<center><h2>ON EVE OF SUMMIT, ASIAN COUNTRIES QUESTION U.S. COMMITMENT TO FREE TRADE, ANALYST SAYS</h2></center>
<P>
	<b>WASHINGTON, NOV. 19, 1996</b> -- When President Clinton attends the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in the Philippines next Monday, he'll have some explaining to do. Specifically, he'll have to tell America's Asian trading partners why his administration seems so much less committed to free trade than it used to be, according to a Heritage Foundation policy analyst.
<P>	"The president's actions and trade policies over the past two years have dismayed America's trading partners in the Asia-Pacific region," says Heritage Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/oquinn.htm">Robert O'Quinn</a>. In fact, the administration's vacillation on free trade has damaged U.S. credibility so badly that one Asian leader, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad, has revived the idea of an Asia-only trading bloc that excludes the United States. 
<P>
	Open trade with the 18 APEC economies (including Canada, Mexico and Chile) is crucial to America's future, O'Quinn says. Taken together, APEC economies have a gross domestic product exceeding $13 trillion, or about one-half of the world's total output. Nearly two-thirds of America's two-way merchandise trade is with APEC countries, and exports to APEC countries provide jobs for 7.3 million American workers. 
<P>	For this reason, O'Quinn says, it is important that President Clinton take <a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/asc144.html">specific steps</a> to reassure Asia about America's commitment to free trade with the region, including:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Asking Congress for "fast-track" authority to negotiate free-trade agreements without getting bogged down in contentious labor or environmental issues;
<P>
<LI> Bringing Chile into the North American Free Trade Agreement by the end of 1997, which would show other APEC countries America's willingness to embrace free trade with a country not on the U.S. border;
<P>
<LI> Inviting other Latin American countries, such as Argentina and Peru, to join APEC, which would shift the balance of power within the trade group away from the "go slow" countries of China, Japan, South Korea and Malaysia; and
<P>
<LI> Asking Congress to eliminate agriculture-export subsidies and the sugar and dairy programs, which would improve relations with a number of APEC nations (and save U.S. taxpayers $10 billion a year).

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5>HERITAGE CALLS FOR CONGRESSIONAL FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<B> <FONT SIZE=4>WASHINGTON, NOV. 15, 1996 --</FONT></B> The 105th
Congress should take full advantage of the revolution in telecommunications
technology to make available on the Internet all disclosable information
having to do with the laws it passes and how it conducts its business,
a pair of Heritage Foundation analysts <a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/bg1098.html">said today</a>.
<P>
 According to <a href="/heritage/staff/weinstein.html">Kenneth R. Weinstein</a>, director of Heritage's Government
Reform Project, and research assistant August Stofferahn, &quot;By
taking the initiative in placing all disclosable information on
the Internet, Congress could avoid the contentious process of
specific requests for materials as well as the necessarily more
complex freedom of information procedures established for the
executive branch.&quot;
<P>
 In addition, the analysts say, the move would provide a needed
reform. &quot;Through key institutional and procedural reforms,
the 104th Congress sought to unmask and dismantle the network
of liberal special interests that ran Capitol Hill for decades,&quot;
Weinstein and Stofferahn said. &quot;A Congressional Freedom of
Information Act (CFOIA) would complete and confirm the move toward
open access to Congress.&quot;
<P>
 In addition to areas that already have been opened to the public
through the Internet -- such as THOMAS, the Library of Congress'
on-line legislative information service, and the GPO (Goverment
Printing Office) Access system, which features 58 information
databases produced by the federal government -- the U.S. House
of Representatives' Task Force on Committee Review already has
recommended that Congress' new open-door policy be expanded. Specifically,
the task force has called for amendments to bills, committee and
subcommittee prints and reports, and oversight plans and activities
to be placed on the Internet. Similarly, the U.S. Senate has sought
to use information technology to publicize its activities more
extensively through its &quot;Operation Daylight.&quot; 
<P>
 But Weinstein and Stofferahn say Congress should go further.
Under a CFOIA, all information currently made available to the
public would become available through the Internet. In addition
to the committee documents detailed by the House task force, Congress
would add issue briefs, spending reports, voting records, the
content of mass mailings, financial and lobbying disclosure documents,
and a host of other items.
<P>
 &quot;Providing citizens outside of Washington with the means
to closely examine and actively monitor the work of their elected
representatives would do more to foster openness and prevent back
room politics than any other single reform,&quot; the analysts
say. &quot;The 30 million American families with personal computers
would be able to use the Internet to observe more closely the
activities of Congress and their particular representatives. In
addition, other citizens could take advantage of the numerous
possibilities for Internet access at work and at public and university
libraries to find timely information on current legislation that
may affect their lives.&quot;
<P>
 &quot;Overall,&quot; Weinstein and Stofferahn say, &quot;these
changes would make our democratic system stronger and more responsive
to the average citizen.&quot;

<title>Next Administration Can Restore U.S. Free-Trade Leadership in Latin America -- Heritage PR</title>

<h2>
NEXT ADMINISTRATION CAN RESTORE 
U.S. FREE-TRADE LEADERSHIP IN LATIN AMERICA</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>


	WASHINGTON, SEPT. 25, 1996 </b> -- The most important trade goal for the next administration should be the creation of a hemisphere-wide <a href=" /heritage/library/categories/trade/bg1092.html">free-trade area</a> linking the signatories of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the South American Common Market (Mercosur), the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), and other countries into a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) by 2005, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"Latin America has bounced back from the economic meltdown caused by the collapse of the Mexican peso on Dec. 20, 1994, but the United States has not," according to Latin America and Trade Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/sweeney.htm">John P. Sweeney</a>. "The democracies of Latin America have stayed on course with free-market reforms, trade liberalization and efforts to create an FTAA. However, the United States appears to have turned its back on Latin America, allowing U.S. relations with important trading partners to deteriorate significantly on issues such as trade, Cuba, drug trafficking and illegal immigration, and allowing countries like Brazil to fill the leadership vacuum."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Sweeney says U.S. reluctance to expand NAFTA to other countries such as Chile has not interrupted hemispheric trade expansion -- it has simply left the United States out. "Mexico has signed free trade agreements with Chile, Bolivia and Costa Rica, is negotiating its association with the South American Common Market (Mercosur), and soon will launch trade negotiations with the European Union. Chile recently became an associate of Mercosur and is negotiating a bilateral free trade agreement with Canada. Other countries interested in joining Mercosur include Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia. Mercosur also wants to sign a free-trade agreement with the European Union," Sweeney points out. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"No one is waiting for America to climb back aboard the free-trade express in the Western Hemisphere," he says.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Among the 10 steps Sweeney says the next U.S. administration should take to regain its leading role in the FTAA process and heal the recent rifts in U.S. relations with Latin America:<p><ul>
<li><b>Approve a new fast-track trade negotiating authority.</b> "No country will invest the time or human or financial resources necessary to negotiate a trade agreement with the United States if American negotiators cannot guarantee that any agreement reached will not be mutilated beyond recognition by the U.S. Congress," Sweeney points out. "Making renewal of fast track one of the first actions of a new administration and Congress would constitute a strong reaffirmation of America's commitment to free trade and would send Latin America a powerful message that the United States has re-engaged in the FTAA process," he says.
<p>
<li><b>Expand NAFTA to include Chile and the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries.</b> "The accession of Chile to NAFTA would reaffirm America's commitment to an FTAA with Latin America and the Caribbean, open a new gateway for U.S. exports in South America and the nations of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, and provide America with valuable strategic leverage in future convergence talks with Mercosur," Sweeney says. Also, NAFTA has enhanced the attractiveness of Mexico as a site for investing in manufacturing operations for export to the United States, causing the rate of growth for apparel imports from the CBI countries into the United States to fall from 25 percent during 1995 to about 8 percent for the first five months of 1996. Apparel imports from Mexico grew by 41 percent during the same period. To redress this unforeseen imbalance, Sweeney says, the CBI countries should be included in NAFTA. 
<p>
<li><b> Launch a dialogue for integrating NAFTA and Mercosur into an FTAA by 2005.</b> "The United States has squandered a two-year window of opportunity to influence the timetable and pathway for creating an FTAA, and Mercosur has emerged as a viable alternative pathway to an FTAA that many Latin American countries find appealing," Sweeney says. "Therefore, NAFTA and Mercosur should engage quickly in a formal dialogue with the goal of deepening and harmonizing trade practices as both groups take on new members. The ultimate objective should be to merge the two regional blocs into one hemispheric FTAA by 2005."
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"Although Latin America has recovered from the aftershocks of the peso crisis, and trade expansion continues unabated throughout the Western Hemisphere, the Clinton administration is reluctant to put the expansion of NAFTA back on track," Sweeney says. "If the administration does not halt its flight from free trade and the expansion of NAFTA, U.S. economic and security interests in the Americas could suffer a sustained decline."

<title>Poor Children Would Benefit From School Choice, Analyst Says - Heritage PR</title>

<h2> POOR CHILDREN WOULD BENEFIT FROM 
 SCHOOL CHOICE, ANALYST SAYS</h2></center>



<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>

	WASHINGTON, AUG. 26, 1996</b> -- As the new school year begins, Congress will be considering legislation that would allow tax dollars to be used for special scholarships so poor children can attend the schools of their choice, private or public. According to a Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/education/bg1088.html">study</a> released today, such scholarships could make a real difference in the lives of children from poor families. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The proposed legislation, called Title II, The Low Income Educational Opportunity Act of 1996, would allow each locality to determine the value of the special scholarships, with the maximum value no greater than the existing per-capita cost of education in the local public school district.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"Public policy has made it difficult for all but the well-to-do to choose schools they prefer," says <a href="/heritage/staff/doyle.html">Denis Doyle</a>, senior fellow in education at Heritage and author of the study. "The  reason why the Clintons and the Gores, as well as other members of the nation's social and political elite, select private schools is simple: Empirical evidence clearly reveals that most private schools do a better job than most public schools, particularly with poor and minority students," he says.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	For example, Doyle says compelling research by the late Johns Hopkins and University of Chicago scholar James Coleman points out that Catholic schools have benefitted poor and minority children in numerous ways. Coleman's research found, for example, that Catholic school sophomores scored 10 percent higher in science, 12 percent higher in civics, and from 17 percent to 21 percent higher in mathematics, writing, reading and vocabulary than their public-school+ counterparts.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	A recent study by Harvard University and the University of Houston confirmed Coleman's research, showing that elementary school students who participated in the nation's first school-voucher program in Milwaukee scored higher on math and reading tests after four years than youngsters who stayed in public schools. In Milwaukee, 99 percent of the students receiving vouchers were black or Hispanic.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"Unfortunately for poor children, their only current educational choice lies in selecting between failed and failing public schools. The Low Income Educational Opportunity Act of 1996 offers a good first step toward giving poor children and their parents more and better educational options," Doyle says.

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations

<p>

	WASHINGTON, AUG. 21, 1996</b> -- A new approach to local police management emphasizing high recruitment standards, "community policing," and a high-tech focus on crime "hot spots" and repeat offenders -- coupled with a judicial system that keeps criminals behind bars -- can win the war on crime, according to a major Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bg1089b.html">analysis</a> co-authored by former Attorney General <a href="/heritage/staff/meese.htm">Edwin Meese III.</a>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
	The 33-page report, released today, proposes 21 specific actions local, state and federal officials can take to achieve the same dramatic reductions in crime that have been achieved in cities like New York, where in 1994 the murder rate declined 45 percent and major felonies dropped 12 percent (and 18 percent in the first nine months of 1995). 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The gains made by New York and other cities in fighting crime have not been achieved by accident," according to Meese and co-author <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert E. Moffit</a>, Ph.D., Heritage's deputy director of domestic policy studies and the son of a Philadelphia police detective. "They have happened because innovative police officials have learned the lessons of experience and used them to improve policing." 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The most important lesson taught by the experience of the past several decades of rising crime, according to Meese and Moffit, is that police must be: 1) Well-paid, high-quality individuals in both achievement and character, actively recruited from the communities they patrol or from the military; 2) savvy peacekeepers, known personally by the neighborhoods they serve, able to spot troublemakers and, more often than not, quell disturbances before criminal acts occur; and 3) allowed to do their jobs, and not be constantly second-guessed by department higher-ups, nor demoralized by judges whose ideas of social justice put criminals back on the streets. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"If we're going to spend billions of dollars on combating crime," Meese and Moffit write, "we ought to use that money in the ways that have been shown to work and stop wasting them on ways that don't." For example, Meese and Moffit point out that the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994, which President Clinton vowed would place 100,000 additional police officers on neighborhood streets, has increased the number of officers by just 17,000, and even these aren't necessarily in areas hardest hit by violent crime.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Among the advice Meese and Moffit offer to local police:
<p><ul>
	<b><li> Target urban America's "hot spots" and career criminals.</b> "Successful police departments should focus on the decaying and disordered spaces where most of the nation's serious crime takes place," according to Meese and Moffit. "Research shows that more than half of all serious crime is concentrated in less than 3 percent of the addresses in an urban area. These areas should by the targets of short-term, unpredictable crackdowns that tell the criminal he stands a serious chance of getting caught. Police should also target urban America's tiny criminal class: the 6 percent of the male population responsible for about 50 percent of serious crime. They should be a routine target of police," they say.
<p>
<li><b> Good policing requires high recruitment standards.</b> "Too many metropolitan areas in the United States have witnessed a deliberate -- often politically motivated -- lowering of intellectual, physical and character standards within police forces," Meese and Moffit say. If local police departments expect to make a dent in crime, they need to insist on high standards in both cognitive ability and personal integrity. 

<p>
"Responsible officials should use standardized tests as an initial screening mechanism to evaluate the cognitive ability of recruits," Meese and Moffit say. For patrol officers charged with keeping order on the streets, "psychological evaluations and the ability to meet serious physical strength and stamina requirements are also essential," they say. Most important of all, "background investigations of recruits must include serious inquiries into their past behavior, their reputation for honesty and integrity, current and past associations and financial and marital stability, as well as evidence of illegal drug use or alcohol abuse."
<P>	<li><b> Police should be on the beat, not behind a desk.</b> "Instead of keeping order and enforcing the law, too many police officers are patrolling ineffectively or being employed in ancillary functions that could be performed just as easily by civilians or private agencies," Meese and Moffit say. These officers should be put "on the beat" and their administrative duties performed by clerical or other qualified personnel.  
<p>	<li><b> Aggressively recruit police officers from the ranks of the military, which would expand the number of well-qualified black and other minority applicants. </b> It is important that police departments reflect the demographic composition of their communities, especially in minority neighborhoods. This enables officers to understand the prevailing subculture, prevent and control community disorder, and elicit information vital to effective law enforcement, Meese and Moffit say. 

<p>
But local officials "should not be deceived by the false god of 'diversity' at the cost of excellence in the field." Instead, they say, local police departments "should aggressively seek out those members of minority groups who meet the high cognitive, physical and moral standards of the department, and offer them a pay level that will make law enforcement an attractive career option."	
<p>	The military offers a pool of personnel -- many of them minorities -- with many skills that would be useful in police work, they say. 
<p><li><b>Anchor the police in the community.</b> "The most effective police officer is an insider; someone local residents know and respect. Foot patrols should be established wherever feasible," say Meese and Moffit. Better still, "if the police officer and his family live in the community, policing becomes more than simply a job; it becomes a matter of protecting one's friends and neighbors." For this reason, Meese and Moffit say local officials should consider offering low-cost housing loans as an incentive for police to live in the neighborhoods where they work. 
<p><li><b>Make police commanders directly accountable for results and police conduct.</b> It is absolutely essential, Meese and Moffit say, for police commanders to be held personally accountable for the maintenance of law and order in their jurisdictions, as well as the integrity and honest of their officers. This method, strictly followed by former NYPD Commissioner William J. Bratton, resulted in "precincts that operated as miniature police departments," and managers who "rose to this opportunity with enthusiasm and creativity." </ul><p>
<b>What Washington Can Do</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Among the steps Congress can take that will truly aid state and local governments in combating crime, Meese and Moffit say, are the following: <ul>
<p><li><b>Block the appointment of federal judges who demonstrate an insensitivity to public safety, and reform criminal procedure so it once again serves the purpose of putting criminals behind bars.</b> The Senate, which approves nominees to the federal judiciary, should refuse to give its consent to nominees who have a history of rulings that result in the release of criminals. 
<p>	In addition to what it has already done -- putting a stop the federal imposition of "prison caps," which commonly resulted in the release of thousands of dangerous criminals -- Congress should review the impact of the Miranda ruling, the so-called exclusionary rule, and reform the law to allow a good-faith exception in the gathering of evidence during criminal investigations Meese and Moffit say. "As currently formulated, the exclusionary rule suppresses good evidence, causes good arrests to be thrown out, and contributes to the demoralization of police," they say. 
<p><li><b>Review all federal statutes dealing with crime, identify those that impinge on the legitimate authority of local and state law enforcement officials, and repeal them.</b> "Currently, there are more than 3,000 federal crime laws on the statute books: Hardly any crime, no matter how local in nature, is beyond the jurisdiction of federal criminal authorities," Meese and Moffit say. "The Clinton administration's 1994 crime bill added two dozen more ... Congress should begin to reverse this counterproductive trend toward the federalization of crime -- and allow states and cities to solve their own problems."
<p><li><b>Provide more flexible federal funding for local law enforcement, such as federal tax rebates to states for use in combating violent crime.</b> Meese and Moffit say this would enable local officials to tailor financing to those aspects of law enforcement that best meet the needs of their communities. Alternatively, Congress could make $10 billion in block grants available to local police agencies over a period of five years to target the areas hardest hit by violent crime, as proposed by Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla.</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"It is possible to achieve dramatic reductions in crime," Meese and Moffit say. "In New York City and elsewhere, innovative policing is having a measurable impact on crime -- again, not because of the numbers or mere presence of the police, but because of what the police are doing." 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	But success, they say, rests ultimately on intangibles as "courage and character, sound judgment, a solid knowledge of law and procedure, and an ability to apply them in ambiguous, often dangerous and difficult situations. Officials must realize that these qualities are essential in any person who is given broad discretion, armed with a deadly weapon, and pledged to serve and protect the citizens of the community."

<h2> THINK TANK ECONOMIST IDENTIFIES
<br>THE "WORST TAX OF ALL" </h2></center>

<u>Calls for Estate-Tax Repeal</u>
<p>


	WASHINGTON, AUG. 19, 1996</b> -- It may be absent from political radar screens this election season, but a Heritage Foundation economist has identified what he considers the "worst tax of all."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	It's the estate tax, and in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1091.html">new study</a> released today Heritage John M. Olin Senior Fellow in Economics <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a> says it should be repealed. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Consider the evidence, Beach says. The estate tax can confiscate a crushing 55 percent of an individual's lifetime assets, yet is so inefficient it may cost the government and taxpayers more in administrative and compliance costs than it raises in revenue. The estate tax slows the economy by encouraging consumption over investment and by keeping interest rates artificially high. And the estate tax punishes some of the very people "progressive taxation" is supposed to help: female and minority business owners struggling to enter the economic mainstream.<p>
<b>A Paltry Revenue Source</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Along with the gift tax, which requires payment of taxes on the value of lifetime gifts from parents to children, the estate tax brings in less than 1.7 percent of the federal government's total revenue. In 1995, for example, the tax generated just $14.7 billion in revenue -- but may have lost up to $11 billion, Beach says, as individuals shed their assets by giving them away to charities and others. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	One of the primary reasons for this paltry revenue figure is the extraordinary lengths to which individuals will go to avoid paying estate taxes, Beach says. Not only do individuals spend an inordinate amount of time and money on "estate planning," which has become a euphemism for tax avoidance, but when that proves insufficient they resort to the next defensive measure: spend as much of their money as they can. In this way, Beach says, individuals only pay tax on their wealth as income, where the top tax rate is 39.6 percent, compared to the maximum rate of 55 percent under the estate tax (which, on top of the income tax, results in a tax bite of almost 70 percent).<p>
<b>Spend It Before You Die</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	It doesn't even matter what they spend the money on -- cars, boats, second homes, even presidential elections. "The fact is," says Beach, "that the estate tax encourages the kind of strange world where it costs less for a millionaire like Steve Forbes to spend $30 million of his own money on a presidential campaign than to save $30 million for his children's future -- an investment on which he'll pay a 55 percent tax. The thinking behind this behavior is quite rational: Since you refuse to let me pass on my assets to my children, I'll spend them."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	It is this kind of behavior that also helps explain why the estate tax acts as a drag on the economy, Beach says. The more individuals spend and consume, the less they save and invest. What's more, to the degree that individuals do continue to save and invest, they demand higher returns [interest rates] to offset the steep future tax they will pay. This raises the cost of capital to businesses, Beach says, which translates into lower levels of investment in plant and equipment.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Perhaps most perniciously, the estate tax also hurts small businesses, especially those owned by women and minorities. Women re-entering the work force often find starting their own business the best economic opportunity, and minorities view businesses as a way to establish economic independence and give their children a boost up the economic ladder, Beach says. But businesses also constitute estates, raising the prospect that all the financial security these small-business owners have worked to achieve will evaporate once the owner dies. In fact, a 1995 survey highlighted by Beach showed that 58 percent of minority business owners believe their business will fail or have difficulty surviving after estate taxes kick in. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All told, there are approximately 16 million non-corporate family-owned businesses nationwide that may be affected by the estate tax. California, for example, has approximately 2.2 million; New York, 950,000; Texas, 1.6 million; Florida, 835,000; Illinois, 620,000; and Alabama, 208,000. In many cases, Beach says, these businesses won't survive the estate tax. The child who inherits the business will face such a crushing tax bill that the only viable option will be to sell it.<p>
<b>Repeal Would Boost Economy</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	In addition to chronicling the problems with the estate tax, Beach also asks what would happen to economic growth if it were repealed. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Using two respected computer models of the U.S. economy -- the Washington University Macro Model (WUMM) and the Mark 11 model by the Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates (WEFA) -- he found that repeal would cause the economy to grow by an extra $3 billion (WEFA) to $11 billion (WUMM) per year between 1997 and 2005.  This translates into job growth over the same period of between 130,000 (WEFA) and 145,000 (WUMM). Using the WUMM model, Beach also estimates that repeal would boost household disposable income by $12 billion over the nine-year period; generate 49,000 new housing starts in its first year; and lower the cost of capital to business by at least two-tenths of a percent. "These numbers aren't huge," Beach says, "but they also are low-ball estimates. It may be that repealing the estate tax would produce much higher economic growth."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"In the end," Beach says, "the estate tax fails the cost-benefit test. Both the social and economic costs of the tax far exceed the revenue it produces for the government. If it were repealed, no one would miss it."

<title> Legislation Creating New Urban Policy Would Revive Poor Areas, Analysts Say - Heritage PR</title>

<h2> LEGISLATION CREATING NEW URBAN POLICY WOULD REVIVE POOR AREAS, ANALYSTS SAY
</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>




	WASHINGTON, JULY 31, 1996</b> -- Congress is holding hearings this week on the American Community Renewal Act, a comprehensive bill to bring economic and moral renewal to the nation's most impoverished areas. A new <a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/family/ib228.html">Heritage Foundation study</a> of the bill calls it "an excellent opportunity" to reverse 30 years of failed social policy.
<p>
	While the separate welfare reform legislation moving through Congress represents a step in the right direction, it omits many of the policy changes needed to aid the urban poor, says Heritage Senior Policy Analyst Robert Rector. By providing tax and regulatory relief to economically depressed areas and by boosting the role religious institutions can play in addressing social ills, the American Community Renewal Act would do much more to help the poor overcome the poverty, drug abuse, family disintegration and crime that plague their communities, according to study authors Rector and Policy Analyst Christine Olson.
<p>
	Sponsored by Reps. J. C. Watts, R-Okla., and Jim Talent, R-Mo., the legislation "rejects the premise that all that is needed for our poorest communities are larger government benefit checks," the analysts say. Specifically, the bill would make the following policy changes:  <ul>
	<p><li>Reduce regulations and eliminate capital-gains taxes on assets held in 100 "renewal communities" across the nation. Research has shown that reducing the tax and regulatory burden on businesses in impoverished areas can reduce unemployment by a third or more, the analysts say.
	<p><li>Provide poor parents with education scholarships that can be used to send their children to any school -- public, private or religious. "Giving poor parents the same choice in education enjoyed by middle- and upper-class families would increase parental involvement, improve the quality of education and reduce the rate of school failure," Rector and Olson say. And by allowing parents to send their children to religious schools, "the sponsors of the bill recognize that building a sound moral foundation is not only the most important aspect of a child's education but critical to solving social problems," they say.
	<p><li>Allow religious organizations to use federal funds to perform social-service work such as drug treatment. The social-science research shows religiously based drug-treatment programs are more effective than strictly secular programs, the analysts say. By prohibiting discrimination against religious organizations that have a proven track record of successfully treating substance abusers, Rector and Olson say, the bill would make the most of an underused solution to one of  the country's most pressing social problems.
	<p><li>Create a new charitable tax credit for donations given to charities whose primary purpose is to help the poor. "The bill's underlying philosophical premise is that individual taxpayers are better able to decide where funds should go in their local communities than are bureaucrats in Washington," the analysts say. "The bill would encourage Americans from all walks of life to become more directly involved in the basic business of financing social-service programs to help the poor."
	</ul><p>The American Community Renewal Act "gives Congress and the administration an opportunity to change the way the federal government has practiced community development for 30 years," the analysts say. "It respects the fact that low-income Americans want to help themselves, it builds on the successes of local organizations and community groups, and it harnesses the energy of the nation's churches and religious organizations in combating social ills."

<h2> TAKE GDP GROWTH NUMBERS WITH A GRAIN
OF SALT, HERITAGE ECONOMIST SAYS
</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>




	WASHINGTON, JULY 30, 1996</b> -- If history is any guide, the federal government's Aug. 1 estimate of how fast the economy grew in the second quarter of 1996 will be like most quarterly growth estimates of the past 20 years -- wrong. Probably very wrong.
<p>	According to a <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/library/categories/theory/fyi114.html">new Heritage Foundation analysis</a> of the Commerce Department's regular quarterly estimates of gross domestic product (GDP), the figures released by the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) have been off by an average of 50 percent during the nearly 20-year period beginning in 1976.
<p>	In some cases, the BEA couldn't even accurately say whether the economy had grown or contracted, economist William Beach found. From 1978 to 1991, for example, the BEA had to revise its numbers for 12 percent of all quarters to show that a "shrinking" economy had actually grown or that a "growing" economy had actually shrunk.
<p>	Citing the real effect the BEA's initial GDP forecasts can have on business decisions, Beach, the former chief economist for Sprint Corp., urges that the agency delay the release of growth numbers for at least 60 days, when fuller data will yield a more accurate picture of the economy.  "The federal government is forcing businesses to make decisions about jobs and investment based on faulty estimates of the economy's strength," he says. "In this regard, the GDP forecasts do more harm than good."
	<p>Frequently, the difference between the Commerce Department initial GDP estimates and the actual performance of the economy is extraordinary. For the first quarter of 1996, for example, the BEA initially said the economy grew by 2.8 percent.  Later revisions, however, put first quarter GDP growth at only 2.2 percent, a 20 percent downward revision.  More glaring was the error for the first quarter of 1992.  The BEA initially reported 2.0 percent growth, when later revisions showed the economy had grown 4.7 percent -- a 135 percent correction. 
	<p>The Heritage Foundation analysis found that the BEA underestimated the growth rate during President Reagan's two terms 63 percent of the time, while it has overestimated the growth rate 70 percent of the time during President Clinton's presidency.
	<p>Beach, Heritage's John M. Olin senior fellow in political economy, does not fault the BEA. After all, he says, estimating quarterly GDP for the huge and highly complex U.S. economy will inevitably require "guesswork." What he does fault is the near-obsessive focus on quarterly GDP by politicians and the media, since the numbers tell so little about the actual strength of the economy. 
	<p>To get an accurate picture of the nation's economic health, he says, it is necessary to look at longer-term economic trends.
<p>	The GDP estimate for the second quarter of 1996, for example, may look good on paper, he says, but will mask the underlying economic trend -- which is downward. Beach notes that economic growth rates increased significantly from the first quarter of 1992 to the final quarter of 1994, but have been on a decline ever since. The fact that both the expansion and the slowdown have been punctuated by "spikes" in individual quarters does nothing to change the overall trend, he says.
<p>	The lesson? "Americans shouldn't be lulled into a false sense of economic prosperity, or insecurity, based on how the economy is supposedly performing during a single quarter," Beach says. "They also shouldn't be fooled by the political posturing that surrounds economic growth numbers. What counts is the longer term direction of the economy, and right now it's down."

	WASHINGTON, JULY 26, 1996</b> -- If Congress hadn't stopped President Clinton from passing his 1996 budget, rejected his plans for $200 billion deficits well into the next century, and pushed through substantial cuts of its own, this year's deficit would be nowhere near the $117 billion recently projected  by the Office of Management and Budget. In fact, <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi113.html">according to Heritage Foundation budget analyst Scott Hodge</a>, the deficit would have come in at about what the Clinton administration originally proposed for 1996: a deficit of $211 billion.
<p>
	"It is Congress that deserves taxpayers' credit for cutting President Clinton's proposed deficit nearly in half," Hodge says. "Furthermore, had the president not vetoed Congress' Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which included $17 billion in entitlement savings for fiscal year 1996, this year's deficit would be less than $100 billion rather than the $117 billion for which he now claims credit."
<p>
	Hodge says the domestic discretionary spending cutbacks pushed through by Congress in the face of White House opposition have gone practically unreported in accounts of the 104th Congress' legislative record. "Thanks to congressional pressure for program terminations and major cuts, fiscal year 1996 discretionary spending will experience its first decline since 1969," he points out. "More than 270 separate programs, offices, agencies, projects and divisions were eliminated completely. Many other programs, such as the National Endowment for the Arts, the Appalachian Regional Commission and the Legal Services Corporation, were cut by more than one-third."
<p>
	Other reasons cited by Hodge for the lower projected 1996 deficit numbers include:<ul>
	<p><li>The savings and loan bailout, which is now generating revenue instead of adding to the deficit. "This program -- which has accounted for 10 percent of the deficit change between fiscal years 1992 and 1996 -- is expected to bring in more than $15 billion in new revenue to the Treasury as assets acquired during the bailout are sold to the private sector";
	<p><li>New revenues from selling the electromagnetic spectrum. "President Clinton is reaping a windfall from the auction of telecommunications spectrum to private industry, estimated to generate more than $10 billion in new revenues for fiscal year 1996";
	<p><li>A one-time tax revenue windfall caused by "investors cashing in on capital gains because of the rise in the stock market and the possibility of an agreement between Congress and the White House on a cut in the capital gains tax";
</ul><p>	"At every turn, the Clinton administration has fought attempts to cut spending -- or even to reduce the rate of spending growth," Hodge says. "Incredibly, the president now claims credit for reducing the deficit to a 15-year low when, in fact, it was Congress that kept the president from pushing through spending that would have kept deficits higher than $200 billion for the foreseeable future."

<h2> GOVERNMENT VIOLATIONS OF PARENTAL RIGHTS
ALL TOO COMMON, HERITAGE STUDY SAYS
</h2>

WASHINGTON, JULY 23, 1996</b> -- Legislation moving through Congress would protect parents from a growing number of government attempts to prevent them from raising their children as they see fit, according to <a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/family/ib227.html">a new Heritage Foundation study</a>.
<p>	With "parental rights" under siege on all fronts -- from legislatures, courts, government agencies, even the "helping" professions -- the "Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act" would restore to parents what the Supreme Court has deemed their "fundamental right" to direct the upbringing of their children, say study authors Patrick Fagan, Heritage's William FitzGerald fellow in family and cultural studies, and Wade Horn, director of the National Fatherhood Initiative. Fagan is former deputy assistant secretary for social services policy at the Department of Health and Human Services, and Horn is former U.S. Commissioner for Children, Youth and Families.
<p>	To underscore the deteriorating status of parental rights -- and the need for legislation to correct the problem -- Fagan and Horn point to a number of recent abuses:<ul>
	<p><li>Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., tried in 1994 to require parents who educate their children at home to obtain state teacher certification, a step that would have all but abolished a practice already recognized as a parental right;
	<p><li>The Massachusetts Supreme Court in 1995 ruled that local school boards could deny parents the right to "opt out" of sex education classes and condom distributions for their children;
	<p><li>The Michigan Supreme Court in 1993 denied "secular parents" the right to educate their children at home, even though it upheld the right of "religious parents" to do so;
	<p><li>The county of Durham, N.C., in 1995 drew up guidelines for determining the presence of child abuse in the home that could lead to investigations of parents for practices such as confining children to their rooms. The county also crafted a list of guidelines for "suitable" parenting, which included dictating such minutiae as what time parents must be home if a baby-sitter is watching their children (9 p.m. in the case of 12-14 year olds, for example);
	<p><li>A school nurse and doctor in East Stroudsburg, Penn., recently administered physical examinations -- including examination of the genitalia -- to about 60 girls aged 11 and 12, without permission from many of their parents; and
	<p><li>Even groups like school counselors and the American Library Association (ALA) have shown hostility toward parental rights; counselors by claiming they can counsel minors without parental consent, and the ALA by opposing parental efforts to prevent their children from checking out R- and X-Rated videos.
	</ul><p>Fagan and Horn say that even though the Supreme Court has ruled decisively in favor of parental rights, violations of those rights still occur with alarming frequency. To correct the problem, the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act (sponsored by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla.) would buttress the Court's settled opinion by clarifying parental rights to:<ul>
	<p><li>direct or provide for the education of the child;
	<p><li>make a health or mental-health decision for the child (with exceptions to "prevent an imminent risk of serious harm or remedy serious harm to the child");
	<p><li>discipline the child, including reasonable corporal punishment as defined by the Supreme Court; and 
	<p><li>direct or provide for the religious and moral formation of the child.
	</ul><p>The analysts are careful to point out that the legislation would in no way hinder states from protecting children from child abuse. Parental rights are fundamental, but they are not absolute, the analysts say. "No parent has a right to abuse a child," they say, "and the state has the duty to protect the child." The analysts say the real threat of child abuse stems not from the legislation, but from the "family preservation philosophy" of social workers who repeatedly try to reunite children with clearly abusive parents.
<p>	To those opponents of parental rights who will nevertheless raise the child-abuse issue, the analysts again cite the Supreme Court, which said in 1979 that "the statist notion that governmental power should supersede parental authority in all cases because some parents abuse and neglect children is repugnant to American tradition." 
	<p>It is this "repugnant" disregard for parental rights that must be corrected, the analysts say. The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act would do just that, they say, "erecting a barrier against the mounting erosion of these rights."

<title> Study Shows Wasteful Spending Still Abounds In Washington - Heritage PR</title>

<h2> STUDY SHOWS WASTEFUL SPENDING
STILL ABOUNDS IN WASHINGTON

        WASHINGTON, JULY 22, 1996</b> -- Even in an era marked by concern for how taxpayer dollars are spent, boondoggles still abound in Washington, according to <a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi112.html">a new Heritage Foundation study</a>.
<p>	In the second of a series of reports on "How Government Wastes Your Money," Heritage Senior Fellow in Economics Ronald Utt casts the spotlight on some particularly outlandish recent examples, such as:<ul>
<p><li>The 260 public housing residents, officials and employees of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) who took an all-expenses-paid trip to San Juan, Puerto Rico -- courtesy of the taxpayers. The official purpose of the trip was to attend the 1995 convention of the National Tenant Organization. But HUD's inspector general said the event showed a marked "lack of programmatic content." Perhaps, says Utt, that's because the participants were too busy taking advantage of the numerous amenities offered at the Casino Hotel and Sands Beach Resort: gambling, snorkeling, dancing, touring, shopping and a beauty salon. The total cost of the excursion: $325,000.
<p><li>The telephones at the Department of Agriculture, which were being used to make calls to adult phone-sex lines, many to the Dominican Republic. What's more, the General Accounting Office found that during one four-month period roughly half the collect calls accepted by department employees (nearly 600 calls costing $2,600) were from inmates at 18 jails and prisons, with many of the calls rerouted illegally to the department's long-distance lines. 
<p><li>The decision by the Federal Aviation Administration to install a sophisticated new radar system at 47 airports at a cost of $373 million. The problem: The system doesn't work very well. At the 16 airports where it is already in place, the system has suffered frequent shutdowns. Since it was installed at Washington's National Airport in January 1996, for example, the system has failed nearly once every week and has proven incapable of detecting dangerous wind conditions (as it was supposed to).
	 </ul><p>"Washington would like to think these stories are isolated incidents," Utt concludes, "but they happen every day. It's just too easy to spend -- and misspend -- somebody else's money."

<title> AFL-CIO "Voter Education Project" Violates Worker Rights, Analyst Says - Heritage PR</title>

<h2> AFL-CIO "VOTER EDUCATION PROJECT" VIOLATES WORKER RIGHTS, ANALYST SAYS
</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>


        WASHINGTON, JULY 19, 1996</b> --  The AFL-CIO's $35 million "voter education project" violates the rights of union workers by using their mandatory union dues to pay for political activities aimed at defeating Republican members of the 104th Congress, two <a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/regulation/bg1087.html">Heritage Foundation analysts said today.</a>
	<p>They called on Congress to allow union workers to choose not to have their mandatory dues used for partisan political activities. A bill to accomplish this, The Worker Right to Know Act, is scheduled for a vote in Congress July 24 or soon thereafter.
	<p>According to Kenneth R. Weinstein, director of the think tank's Government Reform Project and Research Assistant Thomas M. Wielgus, union members split their vote roughly 60-to-40 between Democrats and Republicans, respectively, in 1994. Since virtually all of the AFL-CIO's effort is aimed at unseating Republicans, this means as many as 40 percent of  AFL-CIO members may be forced to finance political activities with which they disagree. 
	<p>"Depending on the individual union and the accounting rules applied, union dues devoted to non-collective bargaining activities could range from under $200 to well over $1,000 per year per union member," Weinstein and Wielgus estimate. As things now stand, the authors note, unions are not required to account for how much of union dues are used for political versus other activities. Some unions don't even fully report the amount of their dues income to the government, they say.
<p>	What's more, Weinstein and Wielgus say "most union members may not realize that under the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Communications Workers of America v. Beck they have every right to demand a refund of the portion of their dues used to back political candidates or lobby for causes with which they may disagree." 
	<p>Under the Beck decision, unions must refund to their members any dues not related to collective bargaining activities, contract administration and grievance processes. Unfortunately, the Heritage analysts say, this decision remains largely unenforced. An April 1996 survey of 1,000 union members revealed that 78 percent did not know they had a right to obtain such a refund, and that once they realized what their Beck rights were, 56 percent would be likely to request a refund. 
	<p>To rectify the situation, Rep. Harris Fawell, R-Ill., has introduced the Worker Right To Know Act, which would require a union to obtain a signed agreement from an employee before using dues for purposes not related to collective bargaining activities. The agreement would offer a clear statement detailing the percentage of dues used for traditional collective bargaining and that used for other activities such as "voter education." It also would make it clear that if workers chose not to give a portion of their dues to political activities, they still would retain the right to participate fully in the activities of their unions.
	<p>"It is time to make workers aware of their rights under the applicable Supreme Court decisions and to make it possible for them to exercise these rights freely," the Heritage analysts say. "The Worker Right to Know Act would give union members the power to choose for themselves whether to give their money to political causes."

<h2> HISTORY SHOWS TAX CUTS BOOST ECONOMY, RAISE REVENUE, ANALYST SAYS
</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>




	WASHINGTON, JULY 18, 1996</b> -- With the 1996 presidential campaign rekindling the debate over taxes, a <a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1086.html">new Heritage Foundation study</a> says tax rate reductions historically have had none of the negative consequences ascribed to them by tax-cut opponents.
<p>
	Daniel Mitchell, Heritage's McKenna senior fellow in political economy, examined the three major periods of tax-rate reductions in U.S. history -- the 1920s, the 1960s, and the 1980s -- and found in each case that lower taxes not only boosted economic growth, but yielded the federal government more revenue and resulted in high-income Americans bearing a larger share of the tax burden. Consider:<ul>
	<p><li>In the 1920s, tax rates fell across the board, dropping from a top rate of 71 percent to 24 percent. As a result, the economy grew by 59 percent between 1921 and 1929, government revenue from personal income taxes increased from $719 million in 1921 to $1.2 billion in 1928, and the share of the tax burden borne by the rich ($50,000 and up in those days) climbed from 44.2 percent in 1921 to 78.4 percent in 1928. 
	<p><li>In the 1960s, President Kennedy again lowered tax rates across the board, reducing the top rate from 91 percent to 70 percent. In response, the economy experienced its longest expansion in U.S. history, government revenue grew from $94 billion in 1961 to $153 billion in 1968, and tax collections from those making more than $50,000 climbed by 57 percent between 1963 and 1966.
	<p><li>In the 1980s, President Reagan signed across-the-board tax cuts, paring the top rate from 70 percent to 28 percent. From 1982 to 1989, the economy responded with its longest peacetime expansion in U.S. history, government revenue grew by 99.4 percent, and the share of income taxes paid by the top 10 percent of earners rose from 48 percent in 1981 to 57 percent in 1988</ul>.
	<p>By contrast, Mitchell says, periods of tax increases have had a damaging effect on the economy.  He notes that since Reagan left office, the top tax rate has risen from 28 percent to 42 percent. The result: The economy has suffered its worst seven-year period of economic growth since World War II, with family income $2,000 lower today than it was in 1989. 
	<p>Likewise, tax increases imposed by President Johnson, combined with the "bracket creep" of the 1970s, caused the growing economy of the Kennedy years to lapse into a period of stagflation, notorious for rampant inflation and anemic economic growth. As for the 1920s tax cuts, they were followed in the 1930s by tax increases that boosted the top rate first to 63 percent, then to 79 percent. "To put it mildly," Mitchell says, "the 1930s are not remembered as one of the American economy's better decades."
	<p>"The economy is lagging, incomes are falling, and tax revenues are stagnant," Mitchell says. "History shows clearly that the way to reverse this trend is to cut tax rates."

CLINTON ADMINISTRATION RAISES WHITE FLAG IN WAR ON DRUGS, NEW HERITAGE STUDY SAYS
</h2>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>

        WASHINGTON, July 11, 1996</b> -- Dispatches from the front line of the war on drugs carry bleak news: The United States is going down to defeat, in no small part because the Clinton administration has failed to make combating drugs a high priority, according to a new Heritage Foundation <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bgup279.html"> study released today.</a>
<p>
"After a decade of consistent progress during the Reagan and Bush administrations, almost every available indicator shows the United States is losing -- some would say surrendering -- in the prolonged struggle against illegal drugs," say study authors John Walters and James O'Gara, respectively the president and director of research for the New Citizenship Project. Walters previously served as deputy director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. 
	<p>Specifically, the analysts fault the president for lackluster appointments to key anti-drug positions, from the "invisible" former drug czar Lee Brown to the "embarrassing" former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, who favored outright legalization of drugs. In addition, the administration has cut staff at the Office of National Drug Control Policy from 147 to 25 and allowed 227 agent positions at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to disappear from September 1992 to September 1995.
	<p>Efforts to interdict drugs before they reach U.S. shores also have lagged under the Clinton administration, Walters and O'Gara say. All told, interdiction flight hours in the "transit zone" between the United States and South America have dropped by 50 percent, and ship "steaming days" have fallen by a third. 
	<p>These actions reflect the administration's intentional shift in strategy away from drug interdiction and law enforcement toward therapeutic treatment of drug users, the analysts say. But the new policy has a price: Almost as soon as it went into effect, cocaine seizures by the Customs Service and the Coast Guard plummeted, from 51 metric tons in fiscal 1993 to 15 metric tons in fiscal 1994. During the same period, the retail price of a gram of cocaine dropped from $123 to $104, which, ironically, coincided with increased drug use among the very hard-core addicts the administration's new policy was supposed to help.
	<p>The result: Hard-core drug users are "cycling through emergency rooms at record rates," Walters and O'Gara say. Cocaine-related emergency room admissions in the first half of 1995 were 65 percent higher than in the first half of 1991; for heroin, the figure was 120 percent higher; and for methamphetimine the figure was an astonishing 321 percent higher.
	<p>Perhaps even more distressing, the spike in drug use under the Clinton administration is not limited to addicts and "hard" drugs. Citing research from the Department of Health and Human Services and the University of Michigan, Walters and O'Gara note that the number of kids age 12 to 17 using marijuana has almost doubled since 1992, from 1.6 million to 2.9 million. Nearly one in three high school seniors now smokes marijuana, and 12 percent of the class of 1995 had taken LSD. 
	<p>Given the administration's record, Walters and O'Gara say the appointment of Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey as the new drug czar is a step in the right direction but that much more needs to be done if the president hopes to retake lost ground in the war on drugs. Specifically, he should:<ul>
	<p><li>Use the "bully pulpit" to send a powerful anti-drug message to the nation's youth, something he thus far has failed to do;
	<p><li>Support anti-drug efforts in Latin America. For $50 million, for example, the administration could provide new tracking aircraft to Peru, a country that has proven its commitment to fighting the drug war by shooting down or disabling 20 trafficker airplanes since March of 1995;
	<p><li>Permit the Defense Department to spend more than the currently allowed 0.3 percent of its budget on drug interdiction;
	<p><li>Block future proposals by the U.S. Sentencing Commission to ease prison sentences for crimes involving crack cocaine; and
	<p><li>Allow federal funds to flow to religiously based drug-treatment programs, which in some cases are far more effective than programs where addicts decide how long and rigorous their treatment will be. 
	</ul><p>In the end, Walters and O'Gara say the Clinton administration cannot escape at least partial responsibility for America's recent losses in the war on drugs. "President Clinton has demonstrated little leadership on the drug issue and has failed to send an unambiguous message of disapproval to young Americans," they say.

<h2>New Strategy Required for Cleaner Air</h2>
The Progress & Freedom Foundation today released a white paper urging for the creation of local Environmental Innovation Areas (EIAs) that recognize the variation in environmental conditions across America and thus will serve to solve regional pollution problems.  The paper calls for using EIAs as a means of promoting alternative fuel vehicles to meet clean air requirements and petroleum import reduction goals.

"Different regions face different pollution problems, and thus they must be given the flexibility to meet clean air requirements in ways best suited for their region," said Bruce Yandle, a co-author of the white paper, titled <i><a href="/pff/clean/exec.html">Clean Air and Emerging Alternative Fuel Vehicles:  A Time for Environmental Innovation Areas</a></i>.  "Alternative fuel -- or non petroleum-based -- vehicles pollute less and should serve as an important component of many regions strategies for meeting clean air goals."<p>

The white paper calls for an end to Federal fuel taxes that discriminate against alternative fuels.  In their place it urges incentives for states and regions to design fuel taxes that encourage the appropriate use of cleaner burning fuels in their area.  The authors also argue that alternative fuel vehicles are a lower-cost way to improve automobile efficiency than Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.<p>

"By removing barriers to expanded alternative fuel vehicle use and development of other improved technologies, these proposals would reduce the cost of achieving environmental and national energy security goals," argues the paper.<p>

Copies of the white paper are available from the Foundation by calling 202/289-8928 or on its Internet homepage:  www.pff.org.  The Progress & Freedom Foundation is a private, non-profit, non-partisan idea center established in 1993 to create a positive vision of the future founded in the historic principles of the American Idea.  It brings together a diverse group of thinkers and policy experts and shares their work with the American people through seminars, conferences, publications and broadcasts.<p>

<h2> AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD FACES $14,000 TAX BILL
TO KEEP MEDICARE AFLOAT, STUDY SAYS
</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>


        WASHINGTON, JUNE 18, 1996</b> -- The tax bill for every household in America will come to $14,000 to keep Medicare afloat through the year 2005, according to <a href=" /heritage/library/categories/healthwel/fyi110.html">a new Heritage Foundation analysis</a> of the recent Medicare Trustees' report on the program's financial condition.
	<p>As has been widely reported, the hospital insurance portion of Medicare (Part A) will run out of money in 2001, at which point it will literally be illegal for the program to pay full benefits. To keep this segment of Medicare operating until 2005 will require a $400 billion bailout, or $4,000 in new taxes on every household in America, says <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm"> Stuart Butler</a>, Heritage vice president and director of domestic and economic policy studies.
	<p>The situation for Medicare Part B, which covers doctor visits and other services, is in many ways even worse. Under current law, the cost of Part B is paid partly by beneficiaries (about 30 percent) and partly by taxpayers (about 70 percent). Yet, if no changes are made to Medicare, by 2005 the taxpayer share of Part B costs is projected to rise to 84 percent. With Part B costs expected to total $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years, that translates into a taxpayer share of $950 billion, or $10,000 for every family in America.
	<p>Despite this bleak forecast, the Medicare Trustees balked at proposing serious solutions to the program's terminal financial condition, Butler says.  Instead, they proposed a "national commission" to recommend solutions to Congress.  But all this will do is "allow nervous politicians to believe they can avoid the issue of Medicare for a few more years," the Heritage Foundation executive says. By that point, "the choices would be more limited and the necessary action more drastic," he says.
	<p>Butler says Congress and the White House should act now to repair Medicare's finances by making three structural changes to the program.  First, turn Medicare into a "defined contribution" program, which would give seniors a specified amount of money to purchase health coverage instead of providing specific benefits.  Second, allow Medicare recipients to choose from a wide range of health plans, which would give them access to fuller coverage (prescription drug benefits, for example) and spur competition between plans to hold down costs.  And third, reduce the Part B subsidy for those who don't need it, which would correct a costly situation in which millionaire seniors get just as much help paying their doctor bills as those who rely entirely on Social Security checks to make ends meet.
	<p>Calling the Medicare Trustees report "grim reading," Butler says policy-makers have limited choices when it comes to fixing Medicare: massive tax increases, draconian benefit cuts, or structural reforms. "Only the third choice makes any sense," Butler says. "The quicker Congress and the White House begin those reforms, the less painful they will be."

<h2> REPUBLICANS WRONG TO BELIEVE 104th CONGRESS A FAILURE, ANALYST SAYS </h2>
<p><b>Bigger Budget Cuts than Reagan's</b>
</center>
<p>

<p>


        WASHINGTON, JUNE 14, 1996</b> -- It's one thing when Democrats attack the Republican-controlled 104th Congress for failing to deliver on its promises; it's quite another when Republicans themselves start believing the charge.  For the fact is, in the crucial area of making real cuts in the federal budget, the 104th Congress has rung up a remarkable record of success, according to <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi109.html"> a new Heritage Foundation analysis.</a><p>
	Consider: When the 1996 budget process came to a close, Congress had made real cuts -- not phantom "baseline" cuts -- in discretionary spending for the first time since 1969, says Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow in Economics <a href="/heritage/staff/utt.html">Ron Utt</a>.  All told, it eliminated 270 federal programs, agencies, offices and projects, reduced the number of bureaucrats at 29 of the 39 major government offices, and helped reduce the deficit to its lowest level since 1982.  <p>
	"Fiscal conservatives in Congress may have lost a rhetorical battle with the president over the budget," Utt says, "but they won the budget war." 
	<p>Specific programs Congress erased from the federal landscape include the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corp., the Office of Travel and Tourism, the Office of Technological Assessment, the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Bureau of Mines.  Spending for many programs and agencies Congress failed to eliminate -- such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development, National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the Legal Services Corp. -- dropped substantially.
	<p>Utt's conclusion: Congress' accomplishments were "far bolder than even the intentions of the early Reagan administration, which until now have served as the benchmark for ambitious fiscal restraint." For example, Reagan proposed cutting the NEA by 27 percent and achieved 20 percent, but this Congress slashed the arts agency's budget by 39 percent.  The same applies to the National Endowment for the Humanities, where Reagan's goal of a 23 percent reduction (he got 20 percent) pales next to Congress' 35 percent cut.  Similarly, mass-transit subsidies, targeted by Reagan for a 10 percent reduction, were cut 43 percent by the current Congress.
	<p>Granted, there's much more Congress could have done, and still should.  "As impressive as this Congress' performance was," Utt says, "it has only made a dent in the massive waste and redundancy that pervade the federal government." He says first on Congress' cut list should be out-of-control entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Medicare.  And while Congress found many opportunities to privatize federal programs such as the Naval Petroleum Reserve, another $8 billion to $20 billion could be saved just from privatizing the country's four "power marketing administrations."
	<p>With work well underway on the fiscal year 1997 budget, Utt says Congress' goal should be to shave another $20 billion off spending totals.  "This Congress cut discretionary spending for the first time since 1969," Utt says. "There's no reason it can't cut spending a second time." <p>

<title>INS Considers "Dumbing Down" Standards for Citizenship, Analyst Charges - Heritage PR</title>

<h2> INS CONSIDERS "DUMBING DOWN" STANDARDS FOR CITIZENSHIP, ANALYST CHARGES </h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>


        WASHINGTON, JUNE 13, 1996</b> -- This Fourth of July, 2,000 immigrants will swear-in as U.S. citizens at the World Trade Center in New York City, 10,000 will naturalize in Los Angeles a day earlier, and another 4,000 will swap their green cards for citizenship papers in El Paso, Texas.
	<p>Like the waves of immigrants that rolled upon America's shores on the eve of World War I, these immigrants have been immersed in the language, culture and history of their new nation, the better to help them become naturalized U.S. citizens. Now, proposals under consideration by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) would tamper with this highly successful assimilation formula, lowering naturalization standards and devaluing citizenship "like a worthless peso," according to a <a href="/heritage/p_review/jul96/miller.html">new article</a> in The Heritage Foundation magazine <a href="/heritage/p_review/">Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship.</a> 
	<p>Specifically, the INS is considering making it easier -- too easy -- to become a U.S. citizen, writes John Miller, vice president of the Center for Equal Opportunity. Not only is the INS studying whether to ease the English language requirement for citizenship, it is contemplating exempting entire classes of immigrants from the U.S. history and government tests newcomers traditionally have to pass. 
	<p>Granted, the INS has had to deal with a flood of new applications for citizenship -- 1.2 million in 1995 versus an average of just 230,000 a year in the 1980s.  But the way to cope with the volume of applications is not to lower naturalization standards to the point that immigrants begin to take citizenship for granted, Miller says.  
	<p>Yet that, he says, is what is happening. "Like a school that advances failing students to the next grade, the INS now pressures its examiners to push potential citizens through the system quickly, even if they are questionable candidates," he says.
	<p>To some organizations, this is a welcome development, because easy naturalization translates into political power. For example, Miller says, more Hispanic citizens means more Hispanic votes, which explains why the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials promotes easing naturalization standards. 
	<p>But such views not only diminish the value of citizenship, Miller says, they may also inflame the anti-immigrant sentiment that bubbles just below America's multicultural surface.  Citing a recent poll that shows 66 percent of Americans already feel America is no longer a "melting pot," Miller says a robust naturalization process is the only means the country has to "decide who is an American and who is not ... Without it, the cohesive United States resembles the fractured United Nations." 
	<p>Fortunately, Miller says, an antidote to the INS's lackadaisical attitude toward naturalization can be found in a Seattle program that puts immigrants through an intensive, 10-week course in the basics of U.S. citizenship.  Applicants who pass an English fluency screening are grilled in preparation for the standard INS exam, and are rewarded with an INS interview at the end of 10 weeks, compared to the usual six-month wait.  Particularly encouraging to Miller is the fact that the Seattle program -- which requires immigrants to give up three hours a night, four nights a week -- has a waiting list hundreds of names long.
	<p>Miller concedes the INS lacks the resources to run such a program itself, but then he doesn't want it to. Instead, he envisions a nationwide network of private and local public institutions that "would revive the old-fashioned idea of civic instruction for immigrant adults."  In this way, he says, immigrants can become Americans, and America can remain the melting pot it was intended to be. <p>

<p>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 29, 1996</b> --As Congress and the White House lock horns over the fiscal 1997 budget, both sides should take note of an important fact:  Most of the government downsizing that has occurred so far has been in the Department of Defense. 
	<p>In fact, of the 200,000 government jobs eliminated to date, some 60 percent have been defense jobs. If one counts all federal civilian and military positions lost since the end of fiscal year 1992, more than 89 percent  -- almost 760,000 total -- come solely from the Department of Defense, according to Heritage Foundation Senior Defense Policy Analyst Baker Spring and Policy Analyst  John S. Barry, authors of <a href="/heritage/library/categories/natsec/bgup278.html">a study released today.</a>
<p>	Defense budget cuts, in turn, have led to a drop in private-sector defense industry jobs, according to Spring and Barry. By the end of fiscal year 1997, there will be 795,000 fewer such positions than in 1992. "In total, defense sector employment is down by 22 percent. By comparison, Internal Revenue Service employment has dropped by only 6 percent, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms [ATF] positions have dropped by less than 5 percent and Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] positions have increased by more than 2 percent," the Heritage analysts say.
<p>Barry and Spring recommend "restoring balance" to federal employment policy by:<ul>
<li>Freezing military personnel reductions at 2.4 million, the level recommended by the Clinton administration in its 1993 "Bottom Up Review" of U.S. military requirements
<li>Limiting further reductions in civilian positions at the Department of Defense to those achieved through privatization efforts
<li>Increasing a defense procurement budget that has fallen by more than two-thirds in inflation-adjusted dollars since 1985, severely damaging America's future military readiness. The steady stream of procurement cuts have cost 1.3 million defense industry jobs since the defense employment peak in 1987
<li>Concentrating federal work force reductions within non-defense departments by eliminating unnecessary and outdated federal programs and agencies.</ul>
	<p>"President Clinton's federal employment policy is unbalanced. One department, the Department of Defense, bears a disproportionate share of personnel reductions. The American people do not need federal bureaucrats from agencies such as the IRS, EPA and ATF watching their every move. They do need the sort of skilled people that contributed to victory over Iraq in the Persian Gulf War," write Spring and Barry.

<title>Legal-Aid Groups Defy Ban on Lobbying and Helping Criminals, Study Says - Heritage PR</title>

LEGAL-AID GROUPS DEFY BAN ON LOBBYING
AND HELPING CRIMINALS, STUDY SAYS  </h2>
</center>

<p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 21, 1996</b> -- Faced with new rules that prevent them from lobbying and defending drug dealers and illegal aliens, groups that use taxpayer dollars to provide legal assistance to the poor have devised a number of loopholes allowing them to continue these banned activities, <a href="/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bgup276.html">according to a new report</a> from The Heritage Foundation.
	<p>Rules imposed by Congress last year bar groups that receive grants from the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) from using any part of their budget -- including private funds -- to lobby against welfare reform, file class-action lawsuits, represent criminals, and engage in other politically motivated activities. The new rules were necessary, says Kenneth Boehm, chairman of the National Legal and Policy Center and author of the report, because "in the past legal services lawyers could evade virtually any congressionally imposed restriction by using, or claiming to use, their own money for prohibited activities."  
<p>	But with this loophole now closed, Boehm says, legal services groups have invented a new evasive tactic: They swear off banned activities in order to remain eligible for federal money, then set up new shadow organizations that will use the groups' non-federal money to pursue a political agenda.  
<p>	For example, the Philadelphia Legal Assistance Center was recently formed by 12 lawyers from Community Legal Services (CLS), which receives money from the LSC. The new center, housed in the same building as CLS, will handle non-prohibited cases and receive taxpayer subsidies; CLS, meanwhile, will continue to handle prohibited political and ideological cases. "The possibility that former LSC grantees and new grantees will share office space and even staff means that, once again, it will be difficult to ascertain whether federal funds are being misused," Boehm says.
<p>	Legal services lawyers also have incurred the wrath of Congress for representing drug dealers who face eviction from public housing projects. Boehm cites a case pending in New York City where representatives of the city's 500,000 public housing tenants have sided with the New York Housing Authority in support of expedited evictions of drug dealers. Defending the drug dealers is the Legal Aid Society, which is supposed to use the federal money it receives from the LSC to represent the interests of the poor. 
<p>	With Congress likely to impose a new round of tough restrictions to deal with this problem, the LSC board defensively drafted a new regulation that supposedly bans legal groups receiving federal funds from representing drug dealers facing eviction, Boehm says. The problem, once again, is that the regulation is so full of loopholes it does nothing to deter a legal services lawyer from participating in drug-eviction cases, he says.
<p>	The ability of legal services groups to flout attempts to rein in their political activities is evidence to Boehm that Congress was right last year when it decided to end all federal funding for the LSC by 1998. Besides, he notes, the LSC has been successful raising funds for its activities from other sources, blunting the charge that elimination of federal funding would deny legal services to the poor. For example, the LSC will receive $278 million from the federal government this year, down from $400 million last year, a substantial cut. Yet the LSC also collects $250 million a year from non-federal sources, Boehm says, raising the question of whether federal funding is needed in the first place.
<p>	When the bill that funds the LSC for fiscal year 1997 comes to the floor of the House of Representatives, the Republican leadership is expected to leave open the option of "zeroing out" the agency -- something Boehm says would be a wise policy decision. "The 104th Congress took major steps to reduce the tendency of legal services groups to pursue frivolous and politically charged lawsuits at taxpayer's expense," Boehm says. Now, he says, "it is past time for Congress to eliminate all federal funding for this program."

Ever-Increasing "Tax Wedge" 
Between Labor Costs And Wages

<P>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 17, 1996</b> -- Instead of increasing the minimum wage, which would only destroy jobs, lawmakers addressing worker anxiety over lower take-home pay should reduce the costs imposed by government on employers, Heritage Foundation analysts <a href="/heritage/library/categories/theory/fyi102.html">said today</a>.
<p>	"There is a huge 'wedge' between what employers pay out to hire and maintain a worker and the amount of money that actually reaches the worker in the form of a paycheck," according to Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy <a href="/heritage/staff/wilson.htm">Mark Wilson</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/antonel.htm">Angela Antonelli</a>, deputy director for economic policy. "These costs are taking an ever-increasing bite out of personal income. If Americans had to write a monthly check for each tax and government-mandated benefit, they would quickly understand how government excess consumes their take-home pay."
<p>	For example, the analysts point out that in 1995 private-industry employers paid an average of $17.10 per hour to hire and keep a worker on their payrolls. But after deducting the cost of government-mandated benefits, taxes and optional benefits, workers took home an average of only $9.84 per hour, 42 percent less that the total cost of employing them. "The total tax wedge (government-mandated benefit costs plus taxes) cost workers an average of $4.00 per hour, or 23 percent of their total compensation," the analysts say.
<p>	For minimum-wage workers, the "wedge" is just as bad: In 1995, it cost a typical employer at least $4.76 per hour to hire such a worker. But after the cost of government-mandated benefits and taxes ($1.03 per hour) is deducted, and the Earned Income Tax Credit is added, this worker took home only $3.73 per hour, or 22 percent less than the total cost of their employment, and 12 percent less than the cash wage of $4.25.
<p>	These figures do not include the hidden cost of federal regulations. One study cited by the analysts estimates the regulatory burden per employee, on average, to be in the range of $3,000 to $4,000 per year. "This equals somewhere between $1.40 to $2.00 per hour for a full-time worker," the analysts say.
<p>	"The solution to this problem is not more government mandates, such as job-killing increases in the minimum wage," say Wilson and Antonelli. Instead, "Government should pursue policies that directly reduce the wedge between compensation and take-home pay." Such policies -- cuts in payroll and income taxes, reductions in the regulatory burden on businesses, a cut in the capital gains tax -- also would promote economic growth and thereby increase productivity, job opportunities and real earnings.	  
<p>	"Politicians who blame 'corporate greed' for what is happening to the take-home pay of American workers are diverting attention from the real problem: an overly intrusive and expensive federal government," the Heritage analysts say.

Congress, White House
Urged to Boost Spending

<p>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 16, 1996</b> -- The refusal of the White House to adequately fund its own national security programs is undermining America's ability to guarantee victory in defense of its freedom and global interests, a <a href=" /heritage/library/categories/natsec/bg1083.html">new Heritage Foundation study</a> says.
<P>	Even the passage by the House yesterday of a defense budget $12 billion higher than what President Clinton has requested for fiscal year 1997 is not enough, not when the White House has underfunded its own military strategy by $130 billion over the next six years, Heritage Senior Policy analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a> calculates. The Senate, Spring says, has an opportunity to begin to correct the administration's grave funding shortfall when it considers the fiscal 1997 Defense Authorization Bill in the coming days.
<p>	Spring says the existing gap between what is needed to fund the administration's military strategy -- which calls for the United States to be able to fight two Persian Gulf-sized wars "nearly simultaneously" -- and actual spending plans will leave the United States unable to fulfill its commitment to security alliances in Europe, Asia and elsewhere.  He estimates that under the president's defense budget fighting just one Persian Gulf-sized war in the future would require 87 percent of America's army divisions and 75 percent of its aircraft-carrier battle groups, leaving little left to fight a second conflict and uphold security commitments.
<p>	While Congress has attempted to provide adequate funding for the administration's defense plan in the short term, it has failed to address the long-term implications of the budget shortfall on U.S. military strategy, Spring says.  Despite the House-approved increase in defense spending for the coming fiscal year, Congress' overall defense budget actually would spend less than what the White House proposes in 2001 and 2002, he says.  Even last year's decision by Congress to spend $7 billion more on defense than the White House, while politically costly, fell far short of the $20 billion Spring says is necessary to fully fund the administration's defense plan.
<p>	By way of example, Spring notes that Operation Desert Storm required seven active army divisions and six aircraft-carrier battle groups.  Yet the administration's defense budget, Spring estimates, provides for only eight of each.  The result: If a U.S. ally in the Persian Gulf were attacked by either Iran or Iraq, the United States could respond but could not also maintain its commitments elsewhere in the world.
<p>	Although critics claim reductions in military spending are only natural now that the Cold War is over, Spring notes that those reductions are being made without regard for the fact that U.S. security commitments to NATO, Japan and others remain intact.  "All of these commitments place an extraordinary drain on the resources of the armed services," he says.  Without increased defense spending, up to the level needed to fund the administration's military strategy, "the time is rapidly approaching when this mismatch may force the nation to abandon at least some of its security commitments." 
<p>	The task for Congress, Spring says, is to begin a national debate over the proper role and size of America's defense forces.  To stimulate such a debate, Spring offers a draft resolution that Congress could consider, outlining in detail a global defense strategy and the specific force levels necessary to fulfill that strategy -- down to the number of troops, ships and aircraft required.  The resolution could be considered as an amendment to the Senate Defense Authorization Bill, he says.  
<p>	But the time to begin the debate is now, Spring says, for if defense spending is left at current levels it could well mean "the end of America as a global military power ... and the beginning of a new age of insecurity of the sort Americans have not known since the first half of this century."

<h2>FOREIGN AID RECIPIENTS CONSISTENTLY VOTE AGAINST THE U.S. IN THE U.N., STUDY SHOWS</h2>

<P>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 13, 1996</b> -- Despite claims by the Clinton administration that foreign aid bolsters support for America around the globe, nearly two-thirds of the countries that received U.S. foreign aid last year voted against the United States a majority of the time in the United Nations, according to a <a href=" /heritage/library/categories/forpol/fyi101.html">new analysis</a> by The Heritage Foundation.
<p>
	All told, 75 of the 118 countries that received foreign aid last year voted against the United States more than half of the time, reports Heritage Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan Johnson</a>. "It's clear from the data," he says, "that foreign aid fails to win friends where it counts -- in supporting U.S. diplomatic initiatives at the United Nations."
<p>	The 10 countries that voted against the United States most often -- an average of 73 percent of the time -- will pocket more than $212 million in foreign aid this fiscal year. And of the 10 countries that will receive the most money, only three of them voted with the United States a majority of the time.
<p>	Some of America's biggest aid beneficiaries were consistently hostile to U.S. positions in the United Nations. Egypt, for example, receives more foreign aid ($2.1 billion) than any country except Israel, yet voted against the United States 67 percent of the time. And the country that voted against the United States the most -- India, 83 percent of the time -- is America's fifth-largest foreign aid recipient, pulling in $157 million.
<p>	Even Haiti and Mexico, two countries the United States has helped considerably, consistently opposed U.S. positions in the United Nations. On top of the $1 billion America spent on a military operation to restore democracy to Haiti, the island nation will get another $124 million this year. Haiti voted against the United States 60 percent of the time. The same holds true of Mexico, which benefited from a $40 billion economic bailout funded largely by U.S. taxpayers and is slated to get another $25 million this year, yet voted against the United States 58 percent of the time.
<p>	"Why is the United states spending so much money on countries that obviously care little about America's interests abroad?" Johnson asks. He recommends that Congress make significant cuts in the $13 billion foreign aid budget this year, even abolishing the agency that hands out most of the money.

<title>Congress Should Back White House Plan to Let Poor Move Out of Public Housing - Heritage PR</title>

<h2>CONGRESS SHOULD BACK WHITE HOUSE PLAN TO LET POOR MOVE OUT OF PUBLIC HOUSING, ANALYST SAYS</h2>

<P>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 7, 1996</b> -- Congress should end antiquated housing policies that concentrate the poor in deteriorating neighborhoods and embrace a Clinton administration plan that gives tenants a choice of where to live, a Heritage Foundation analyst says in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/bg1081.html">study</a> released today. 
<p>	"To his credit, President Clinton's fiscal year 1996 budget proposed to shift virtually all housing assistance from projects to tenant-based vouchers that let the poor rent the housing of their choice," says Ronald Utt, a visiting fellow at the prominent think tank.   
<p>	Yet rather than embrace what Utt calls the most innovative housing-reform proposal in 25 years, Congress drafted new legislation that largely preserves the current system of public-housing projects. While such a move is sure to please the construction and public-housing lobbies, he says, it guarantees that thousands of poor families will remain trapped in substandard government apartments.
<p>	Under the president's plan, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) would end multibillion-dollar payments to public housing authorities (PHAs) and replace them with vouchers going directly to tenants living in housing projects. Utt says tenants then would have a range of options: continue to rent housing from the PHA, rent better housing elsewhere, or join with other tenants to hire better project managers. The end result is that PHAs would be stripped of their government-sponsored monopoly and forced to compete for tenants by offering better service at a competitive price. 
<p>	But Congress is blocking the reform, Utt says, devoting much-needed funds to traditional public housing projects rather than to vouchers. For example, the $2.5 billion proposed by the Senate appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over HUD to modernize housing projects could have provided vouchers to more than 475,000 poor families. Another example: HUD plans to spend $115 million in Baltimore to construct just 338 new housing units, money that could provide a year's worth of safe, decent, privately-owned apartments to as many as 80 percent of the 25,000 poor families on the city's housing-assistance waiting list.
<p>	On average, Utt estimates, project-based assistance costs twice as much as vouchers for each family helped. Instead of empowering tenants, such an approach enriches local bureaucracies at the expense of both the poor and the taxpayers, he says.  
<P>	Vouchers, by contrast, would allow poor families to rent the housing of their choice, as long as the rent stays within established limits. "This freedom allows assisted families to escape the worst urban communities," Utt says. "Families can move to safer neighborhoods with better schools, the unemployed can move where the jobs are, and the elderly can move closer to their families and shopping." 
<p>	"Congress needs to seriously reconsider its preservation of the status quo in public housing," Utt says. Project-based housing is a proven failure, he says, resulting in the warehousing of large concentrations of the poor in dismal neighborhoods marked by high crime, drug abuse, child neglect and other pathologies. Far better, he says, to switch to a voucher system giving the poor the freedom to live where they want.

<CENTER><B><h2>PHILLIPS FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES 1996 JOURNALISM FELLOWSHIPS</h2>
<h3>$50,000 GOLD AWARD AND $20,000 SILVER AWARD</h3><br>
<hr size=3 width=50%></center><p>
Potomac, MD, May 7, 1996</b> -- The Phillips Foundation today announced the winners of its 1996 journalism fellowship awards.  Stacy Mattingly captured the $50,000 Gold Award for her proposal to write a book on a highly-charged school prayer case in northern Mississippi.  Daniel Richardson won the $20,000 silver award to write a series of articles on the growing Patriot movement in America.  
<p>
Mattingly and Richardson were introduced during an awards dinner last night at the University Club in Washington, D.C., attended by prominent journalists.
<p>
During her one-year fellowship which commences on September 1, 1996, Stacy Mattingly will research and write a book on <I>Lisa Herdahl v. Pontotoc County</I>, a Mississippi school prayer case currently in the courts.  Last year, she wrote an extensive article on the case for <I>The Oxford American </I>magazine in Mississippi.  She has spent a great deal of time in Pontotoc County, and her article was widely praised as the most thorough and balanced reporting on the case.  She will write a book in narrative form, beginning with the Herdahl family's move 
from Wisconsin to Mississippi and ending with the trial on the school prayer case.

Clear "Intervention Criteria" Needed
<p>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 2, 1996</b> -- The United States has been squandering its limited military resources on "missions without a purpose" around the globe, making it difficult for American forces to keep up with their other security commitments, the Heritage Foundation's chief foreign policy spokesman said today.
<P>	According to <a href="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim Holmes</a>, the think tank's vice president and director of foreign policy and defense studies, the Clinton White House desperately needs to formulate, spell out and "codify" a policy on where, when, and under what circumstances the United States will intervene militarily in the future.
<p>	Congress, meanwhile, should reassert its "oversight" responsibilities in this area, he said.
<p>
<b>Intervention Criteria</b>
<p>	Holmes made his remarks during a briefing on a new Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/natsec/bg1079.html">policy paper</a> on American military intervention. Written by Defense Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/hillen.html">John Hillen</a>, a decorated Gulf War veteran, the report says any U.S. decision to intervene militarily should be based on whether U.S. interests are at stake, America's ability to decisively affect the outcome, and the resources available for the task. 

<p>	Hillen proposes five criteria for determining whether and how the United States should intervene in any given situation:
<p>
<b>	1) Whether national security interests are at stake. </b>
<P>	The United States, Hillen says, must be able to distinguish between such vital interests as "protecting America's territory, borders and airspace" and other interests "that are merely important or marginal." Not all American interests are "high priority" national security interests that must be defended through military intervention, he stresses. 
<p>	The United States should always be prepared to use military force to defend its vital interests, Hillen says. But since U.S. military resources -- both tangible assets such as troops, carrier battle groups, fighter wings, and spare parts and equipment, and intangibles such as "public support" -- are available only in limited supply, the president must realize that not all interests are equally important and choose wisely where and when to dispatch U.S. troops.
<p>	America's vital interests, he says, include: protecting America's territory, borders and airspace; protecting American citizens at home and abroad; preventing a "major-power" threat to Europe, East Asia or the Persian Gulf; preventing "hostile interference by an outside power" in the Western Hemisphere; and ensuring access to foreign trade and resources.
<p><b>	2) Whether the proposed intervention will "jeopardize the ability of the United States to meet more important security commitments."</b>
<p>	There is "an enormous gap," Hillen says, between America's national commitments and objectives and the military resources available to achieve them. 
<p>	The administration's own proposed military force, (presented in the Pentagon's "Bottom-Up Review" of U.S. military readiness) is not only "inadequate" for America's stated strategy, but is underfunded by an estimated $150 billion over five years. Such a force, he says, simply can't do everything the administration expects it to do. 
<p>	"Military interventions in support of peripheral interests," he says, "should never come at the expense of an American military force trained for and capable of protecting vital interests -- a perilous situation that many believe the United States is rapidly approaching today."
<p><b>	3) Whether the military goals are clearly defined, decisive, attainable and sustainable.</b>
<p>	Military objectives, Hillen stresses, should support political objectives. "For instance, in the Gulf War, the military objective was to expel the Iraqi Army from ... Kuwait. When the U.S. military accomplished that task ... the political objective was also ensured: Kuwait was liberated and its national sovereignty restored." 
<p>	While "working towards clearly defined goals may seem a rather obvious point," Hillen says, the Clinton administration has consistently done otherwise. Indeed, when U.S. troops were sent to Haiti and Bosnia, he notes, about the only goal the administration clearly articulated was "setting deadlines for troop withdrawals." This approach, he says, "is a gross misuse of American military power."
<p><b>	4) Whether Congress and the public support the action.</b>
<p>	As the Vietnam experience showed, "only when the nation is solidly behind an intervention can the United States hope to sustain credible military efforts abroad," Hillen cautions. In the absence of such support, the United States is forced into humiliating withdrawals like the Somalia debacle in 1994.
<p><b>	5) Whether the U.S. military can create "the conditions for their success" -- enabling U.S. forces to achieve their objectives.</b>
<p>	"This does not mean saving the U.S. military for just 'the big ones'," Hillen says. "Limited interventions done properly, such as the 1986 F-111 raid on Tripoli, Libya, can have a decisive effect." 
<p>	However, he warns, there is always the temptation in limited military interventions to greatly restrict the operational latitude and resources made available to the military command, "because the purpose of the intervention is to send an indeterminate political signal."
<p>	In any intervention, Hillen says, "the military must be given goals that it understands, that it can reach through methods for which it is well trained, and that will make a difference, once attained."
<p>	"There is always a measure of political and military risk to military intervention," the Heritage Foundation report concludes. "However, by establishing workable criteria for military interventions, the United States can minimize those risks, or, at the very least, ensure that the risks are consistent with the costs of the intervention," Hillen says.

<head><title>1993 Tax Hike Dampening U.S. Economy - Heritage PR</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h2>News Release</h2><hr><a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>214 Massachusetts Avenue NE<br>Washington, D.C. 20002<br>(202 546-4400<br><p><hr><h2>1993 TAX HIKE DAMPENING U.S. ECONOMY,
NEW STUDY SHOWS</h2>
</center><P>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<P>

		WASHINGTON, MAY 1, 1996</b> -- Along with the recent news that the U.S. economy grew by only 0.5 percent during the final quarter of last year comes a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1078.html">new study</a> from The Heritage Foundation that helps explain why: the $241 billion tax hike enacted in 1993.
<p>		Employing one of the computer models of the economy used by the federal government and many leading U.S. corporations, Heritage Foundation economists found from 1993 through the end of 1996 the tax increase will cost the economy $208 billion in total output, reduce the number of new jobs by 1.2 million, and cost the typical family approximately $2,600 in higher taxes and lower earnings.
<p>		With economic security shaping up as a key issue in the 1996 elections, these findings shed light on the widely observed economic "anxiety" felt by many Americans, say study authors <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a>, Grover M. Hermann fellow in federal budgetary affairs, and <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a>, visiting fellow in tax analysis.  "People are right to feel they should be better off today than they are," the authors say.  "The 1993 tax increase deprived them of a higher standard of living by cutting the economy's growth."
<p>		Heritage arrived at its findings by essentially "deleting" the tax and spending changes contained in Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA-93) from the computer model -- the Washington University Macro Model (WUMM). This generates a simulation of how the economy would have performed if these factors had not been changed. No other variables were changed, and only mainstream economic assumptions were made where necessary.
<p>		In addition to slower growth and fewer new jobs, the Heritage analysis also indicated that employee wages and salaries will be reduced by $112 billion, automobile and light truck sales will fall short by 1.3 million vehicles, and businesses will invest some $42.5 billion less in durable goods.
<p>		Taking a specific year -- 1995 -- the study found that the economy would have grown by an additional $66 billion in gross domestic product (GDP) were it not for the 1993 tax hike. And for the entire period between 1993 and 1996, the total loss in economic growth is an estimated $208 billion, or $2,100 for every household in America.  
<p>		As for the 1.2 million jobs not created as a result of the 1993 tax and budget changes, nearly 17 percent were the result of new businesses not formed. For every $1 billion in economic growth, roughly 195 new businesses are created.  This means the loss of $208 billion in GDP prevented nearly 40,600 businesses, and 203,000 jobs, from being created. The other 1 million missing jobs are likely the result of existing businesses hiring fewer employees due to the tax increase. Hodge and Beach say that although an otherwise healthy economy has created 8 million new jobs over the past three years, the fact remains that "1.2 million Americans who could have been working today are not because of the 1993 tax increase."
<p>		Not only are fewer Americans working than would have been, but those who are working are earning less.  Of the $112 billion in lower wages and salaries caused by OBRA-93, $46.5 billion will be lost in 1996 alone, according to the Heritage projection using the WUMM model.  That translates into roughly $465 for every household in America, more than the average U.S. household's monthly housing bill of $440.
<p>		Specific industries also are suffering from OBRA-93. In the automobile industry, for example, the loss of 368,000 vehicle sales in 1996 alone means $4.8 billion in lower revenue and 60,100 fewer jobs in auto-related fields.  And as for computers, more than one-third of the $42.5 billion shortfall in durable-goods purchases by businesses will be reflected in lost computer sales, the Heritage study indicates.
<p>		Far from being the healthiest economy in 30 years, as President Clinton has said, "the current economy is lousy compared to past recoveries and lousy compared to what it would have been without the 1993 tax increase," Beach says. "The first rules of economics should be the same as it is in medicine: First, do no harm."

<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> On April 15, the day Americans' increasingly burdensome tax bill is due, The House of Representatives will vote to make it harder to increase taxes in the future.  The <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.J.RES.159:">Tax Limitation Constitutional Amendment</a> would require a two-thirds vote in Congress to raise taxes rather than the fifty percent plus one currently required.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"In 1950, families paid only 5 percent of their income in federal taxes," said Herger.  "In 1990, that number jumped to 24 percent and when combined with state and local taxes, families lose almost half their income to taxes.  If a two-thirds tax increase amendment had been in place since 1980, the American people would have been spared more than $660 billion in new taxes, all of which were used to pay for more government spending."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Over the past three decades, Washington has paid for wasteful and excessive federal spending by simply raising taxes on working families and small businesses," added Herger.  "These excessive taxes stifle business growth, hurt families, and hinder our nation's economy.  It shouldn't be easy to take money from families and businesses -- it's their money not Washington's."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"A two-thirds requirement to raise taxes would go a long way toward reining in runaway federal spending and putting a check on excessive taxation," said Herger.  "The requirement would also become a valued component in our efforts to reform the entire tax system."

<h2>DEMOCRACY IN TAIWAN FORCES NEW U.S.-PRC-ROC STRATEGIC BALANCE, ANALYST SAYS</h2>
</center>
<P>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<P>
	WASHINGTON, APRIL 12, 1996</b> -- Taiwan's new democratic status will force the People's Republic of China (PRC) to treat her with much greater caution and respect, and U.S. policy-makers to take America's commitment to her safety more seriously, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.
<p>	According to <a href="/heritage/staff/yates.html">Stephen J. Yates</a>, a policy analyst with Heritage's <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/asian.htm">Asian Studies Center</a>, the new situation "forces all sides to recalculate their strategies and find a new balance." For the United States, "democracy on Taiwan makes it more difficult to overlook Taiwan's interests while seeking better relations with China." From now on, "U.S. policy-makers will be freer to stand up for Taiwan because they will more clearly occupy the moral high ground," Yates says, "whereas China will have to be more circumspect in its belligerence where Taiwan is concerned." In fact, he says, "Taiwanese democracy strikes at the very heart of the Chinese Communist Party's legitimacy." 
<p>
	"It will be increasingly difficult for Beijing to vilify Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui as an enemy of the Chinese people while posing as brotherly compatriots of the Taiwanese who elected him," Yates says. On a practical level, this means "if the people of Tibet, Xinjiang, or even Beijing decide they want to democratically choose their representative," the answer no longer can be "that Western-style democracy does not work and is inappropriate for the Chinese." In fact, Yates says democracy on Taiwan "challenges Beijing to change in a way that will make Taiwan's future reunification with the mainland compatible with the interests of the people of Taiwan."  
<p>	Meanwhile, "democracy is of great strategic importance to Taiwan -- more important than any weapon system it could acquire," Yates points out. "It makes the ROC much more likely to draw support from the United States and other developed democracies in the event of a hostile threat from mainland China."
<p>	Yates offers a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bgup272.html">game plan</a> U.S. policy-makers should follow to protect American interests in the Far East, and promote stability in the region. Among the proposals:<p>
<ul>
	<li>  Encourage the resumption of cross-Strait dialogue, so that China and Taiwan have a forum to discuss and resolve issues;<p>
<li> Support Taiwan's bid to join international organizations, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the World Bank, even if the PRC objects;<p>
<li>	  In accordance with the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, continue to sell Taiwan arms of a defensive nature, and assist Taiwan in developing a strategic missile-defense system;<p>
	<li>  Avoid linking renewal of the PRC's most favored nation (MFN) trade status with Taiwan issues, since such linkage would be counterproductive and would probably hurt Taiwan and Hong Kong, which have manufacturing concerns on the mainland; and<p>
<li> Support a cross-Strait armistice agreement, perhaps one whereby Taiwan would pledge not to declare independence for a specific period of time, and Beijing would agree to renounce the use of force during that same period.<p>
</ul>
	"The March 23 election demonstrated the maturity of Taiwan's democracy," Yates observes. "Despite large-scale military and rhetorical intimidation from Beijing, the election ran smoothly.  Now the United States, China and Taiwan must establish a new equilibrium that will be successful in the new strategic environment."

<h2>DESPITE VICTORIES, CONSERVATISM FACES TOUGH FIGHT, HERITAGE PRESIDENT SAYS</h2>
</center><b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>
	WASHINGTON, APRIL 11, 1996</b> -- President Clinton's State of the Union pronouncement that "the era of big government is over" seemed to cement conservatism's position as the dominant political philosophy in America.  
<p>	Not so fast, says the president of The Heritage Foundation in his latest annual essay on "The State of Conservatism," released today. It's true conservatives have scored some important victories, but "the war is far from over," according to <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin J. Feulner</a>, head of the well-known conservative think tank.  
<p>	"Liberalism is not dead," Feulner says, "because it is just too much fun to spend other people's money." He notes that after President Clinton's eulogy for big government, one of his first actions was to demand $8 billion in new spending from Congress for the current fiscal year. 
<p>	What's more, he says, the Washington establishment's response to many of the proposals for conservative change has been a resounding "no": no term limits, no balanced budget, no welfare reform, no entitlement reform, no significant regulatory relief, and no end to the National Endowment for the Arts, Legal Services Corporation and numerous other non-essential programs and agencies.
<p>	While Feulner is not prepared to declare the end of liberalism as a political entity, neither does he agree with those "perpetually melancholy conservatives who subscribe to the headline 'We Lost.'" After all, he says, Congress passed both a bold, seven-year balanced budget plan and real welfare reform (both vetoed by President Clinton). And even in the face of threatened retaliation from the powerful senior-citizen lobby, Congress tried to reform Medicare -- a valiant effort that would have saved the program from impending bankruptcy.
<p>	Of course, Congress also committed its share of blunders in the past year, Feulner says. For example, lawmakers dallied on the passage of the line-item veto. "Without sounding too much like the liberal League of Women Voters or Common Cause," he says, "the line-item veto languished for 18 months because the GOP Congress didn't want to hand this weapon to President Clinton." Calling the veto central to getting control of the budget, Feulner says, "The credibility of all of us who truly believe in smaller, less intrusive government suffered while Congress dragged its feet on this promise." The legislation finally was approved this spring and signed into law on April 9.
<p>	Feulner also criticizes some of his fellow conservatives for their short-sightedness on tax reform. "Reforming the tax code to produce a flat -- or at least a flatter -- tax was to have been the driving issue in the '96 election," Feulner says. Instead, the GOP presidential hopefuls earlier this year used the issue to attack one another.  "What were these Republicans -- self-proclaimed conservatives all -- doing playing upon class warfare and class envy, positions long the domain of the left?" he asks.
<p>	Despite these short-term setbacks, the Heritage Foundation chief executive remains upbeat about the direction in which the country is moving politically. The reason: "Most Americans realize liberalism has been a failure." Citing a <I>Washington Post</I> series bemoaning the fact that many Americans have lost confidence in government, Feulner says, "Of course they have; any sane person would." After all, what other reaction can there be to stories like the one cited by Feulner on how Minnesota's Medicaid program is paying for sex-change operations?  Transsexuals may complain that they are "trapped" in the bodies of the opposite sex, he says, "but what about the average American who is trapped inside the body of a taxpayer?"
<p>	As long as such liberal excesses continue -- and there is no reason to believe they will cease -- Feulner believes the conservative case will remain as strong as ever. "I am optimistic," he says, "because conservative prescriptions are based on sound economic principles and a realistic understanding of human nature, not on wishful thinking." 
<p>	"People genuinely want to get this country back on the right track," he says. "The end result will be a more conservative -- and better -- America."

<h2>HERITAGE FOUNDATION OFFERS BLUEPRINT FOR DISMANTLING U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact:  Heritage Public Relations<p>

	WASHINGTON, APRIL 5, 1996</b> -- Congress should take the funds now going to the U.S. Department of Education and send them back back to states, localities and parents, Heritage Foundation analysts said in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/education/bg1076.html">study</a> released today. 
<p>	To assist lawmakers in this task, the study's authors, Visiting Fellow in Education Denis Doyle and Policy Analyst Christine Olson, have put together a comprehensive plan that would eliminate many federal education programs outright, transfer some programs to other government agencies, and roll others into block grants to be administered by states and localities.
<p>	Doyle and Olson recommend a host of programs for termination, including Goals 2000, President Clinton's education reform initiative, the Bilingual and Immigrant Education program (to be phased out over three years), college Work-Study, and Direct Student Loans. Programs that would be transferred to other government agencies include student financial-aid, such as Pell Grants and Federal Perkins Loans. These would go to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. A host of programs are recommended for either full or partial conversion into state or local block grants, including Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants and Title I, the federal aid program for school districts with high concentrations of poor students.  
<p>	Doyle and Olson say the Back to Basics Education Reform Act, sponsored by Reps. Joe Scarborough, R-Fla., and Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, "is an excellent vehicle to dismantle the department because it would entrust authority over issues of educational policy to the states and the people." The bill would abolish the Department of Education one year after its enactment; roll all elementary and post-secondary education programs into two separate block grants; and eliminate major portions of the federal education bureaucracy. 
<p>	According to Doyle and Olson, "Since its creation in 1979, the Department of Education has done precisely what its severest critics envisioned: It has usurped state and local control of education by slowly imposing a steady stream of bureaucratic, heavy-handed and intrusive rules and requirements and has inserted itself into almost all aspects of the day-to-day workings of the nation's 15,025 school districts."  
<p>	The result, besides taking control away from parents, teachers and local officials, is "practically no positive impact on student performance." In fact, as the federal government's role in education increased, academic performance of the nation's students has declined. Since the Department of Education was created in 1979, Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores have stagnated, the high-school dropout rate has risen from 8 percent to 12 percent, and, despite spending more money per pupil on elementary and secondary schools than any other county, math and science test scores of American 13-year-olds still lag behind those of other industrial countries. 
<p>	"Taxpayers should recognize the obvious: The purpose of a federal role in education is to 'federalize' the nation's schools, to make them march to a common drumbeat. And it is succeeding, to the detriment of our children's education," say Doyle and Olson. The federal role in education -- currently subsidized to the tune of more than $31 billion per year -- has expanded from 100 programs in 1980 to more than 240 today.	
<p>	Yet, the federal government does have an important role to play in education, the authors say. "Washington should limit its role to doing things states and localities cannot do themselves and that also serve a larger national purpose," they say. For example, "the federal government has an overriding responsibility to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans, in school or out." In addition, they acknowledge a federal role for "data collection, dissemination, analysis and research, and in helping poor school children get a good education (through creation of school voucher systems, for example). All of these jobs can be handled at the agency level, the analysts say. 
<p>	 "One the other hand," they say, "when it comes to such basic educational matters as management of classroom instruction, adoption of curricula, and text book selection, official Washington is capable of little more than offering advice."
<p>	"It is time to rethink the role of the federal government in education. States and localities are the 'laboratories of democracy'; educational reform should originate at these levels, not be imposed from on high from a bunch of Washington bureaucrats," Doyle and Olson say.

<center><B>Executive Summary</B><P>
</center>

<b><i>Americans are unquestionably a religious people. Studies show that virtually
all of us believe in God or another higher spiritual force; a clear majority regularly
attend religious services.<p>
     
Both news and entertainment television insist they reflect reality, yet they continue 
to tell the public that religion is insignificant and, more likely than not, a negative 
influence in society. <P>

Such is the primary finding of the Media Research Center's third annual study on 
the major television  networks' treatment of religion, which covers all network news
and prime time entertainment programming.  Faith in a Box, the most comprehensive
analysis of television and religion ever done, consists of two separate studies, one
on the news, the other on entertainment television.<p> 
<hr>

<a name="Entertainment"</a>
<center><B>Entertainment Media:<p></center></b>

The number of portrayals of religion in prime time went up slightly, to 287 from 
253 in 1994. However,  given that there were almost 1,800 hours of original shows,
that means there was only fewer than one depiction for every six hours of programming
 -- a slightly better ratio than that of 1994. Most of the increase in portrayals is attributable
to the debut last year of two part-time networks, UPN and WB. CBS's treatments of religion
greatly increased, but this was offset by ABC's sharp drop off.<p>

In two categories -- depictions of the devout laity and of the clergy -- the situation
worsened markedly. In the laity category, positives plummeted from 44 percent in '94
to 11 percent in '95, while negatives shot  from 35 percent in '94 to 64 percent last year.
Only 20 percent of depictions of the clergy were positive in '95, an eight percent drop
from '94.<p>

On no network were even half the overall portrayals positive. CBS had the highest
percentage (47.5) of  positive depictions among the major networks. ABC (36.7) and
NBC (34.4) were well in back of CBS, while Fox (24.4) badly trailed all other networks.<p>
<hr>

<a name="News"</a>
<center><b>News Media:</b></center><p>

Total network news coverage of religion in 1995 remained numerically insignificant:
out of more than 18,000 evening news stories in 1995, religion drew only 249; out of
more than 26,000 morning news segments, religion drew only 224. For three years in
a row, the news networks have had trouble cracking a one-percent barrier when it 
comes to religion coverage.<p>

           
The Catholic Church dominated religion news coverage, attracting almost 50 percent
of the evening stories and 71 percent of the morning segments. CBS aired the most 
obviously negative stories on the Catholic Church, including a 60 Minutes profile with
25 &quot;dissidents&quot; and no defenders, and a story calling Ireland a &quot;
church-dominated backwater.&quot;<p>

While the total number of stories about violence and harassment at abortion clinics
declined from 245 stories in 1994 to 142, only three stories focused on the documented
violence of abortionor harassment by abortion advocates.<p>

The religious right was again portrayed as extreme and damaging to the Republican Party,
even though not a single pro-life incumbent lost in the 1994 elections.  <p>

In the first two studies, the MRC suggested a number of ways the networks could improve
their coverageof religion. With a few notable exceptions, none has been enacted. Given the
public's increasing dissatisfaction with and distrust of the media, it is instructive to repeat
these recommendations and urge network decision makers to change their course.<p> 

Network entertainment divisions should cease their hostility to persons of faith and 
respect religious values. Furthermore, they should attempt to match CBS's success 
with Touched By an Angel by airing other pro-faith series of their own. Also, they 
ought to recognize that the audience for such religion-friendly programming is not
only large, but affluent (i.e., it's an attractive demographic for advertisers).<p>

The news study recommends that the networks decisively break the one-percent
ghetto of coverage that religion receives every year. To make that recommendation
reality, the networks need to make a serious commitment to hire a religion correspondent.
With the exception of ABC, the networks have failed to go beyond general assignment 
reporters. The news study also recommends that network reporters try harder to present
religious issues and authorities in a fair-minded and objective manner, especially on social
issues. <p></b></i>

<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3> 
  
<b><i>The Media Research Center's initial &quot;Faith in a Box&quot; study
explored how entertainment television handled religion in 1993.
The report showed that on the rare occasions when sitcoms,
dramas, miniseries, and made-for-TV movies treated spiritual
topics, it was most often in a hostile manner; there were even
some cases of bluntly anti-religious bigotry. <p>

The mixed results documented in our second study, which dealt
with 1994 programming, suggested that a rethinking and
reawakening might have been taking place in Hollywood. Whereas in
1993 negative depictions had outnumbered positive ones by a
3-to-2 ratio, in '94 there were almost twice as many positive as
negative portrayals. Furthermore, the total number of religious
incidences more than doubled: there were 253 in '94, versus only
116 in '93. <p>

The minuses: the laity and the clergy continued to be vilified in
dramas, ridiculed in comedies. Moreover, the frequency of
religious depictions -- roughly, one for every seven hours of
programming -- illuminated the fact that religion remained
largely a non-presence in prime time. <p>
 
This third annual study, covering 1995 programming, indicates in
one sense that the '94 results were not aberrant: overall, there
again were more positive than negative portrayals. However, in
two categories -- depictions of the devout laity and of the
clergy -- the picture worsened markedly. And, not only did the
total number of treatments increase only slightly, most of the
jump was attributable to the 1995 launch of two part-time
networks, UPN and WB.<p>

Television bigwigs like to claim their fare reflects reality.
This is clearly not the case with religion; given its prevalence
and popularity in our society, it is 1) seriously
underrepresented and 2) ill-served on prime time. The viewing
public is waiting for the networks to close, or at least narrow,
this gap. <p>

Our methodology: MRC analysts studied virtually all 1995 prime
time entertainment programs on the broadcast networks ABC, CBS,
Fox, NBC, UPN, and WB. Instances of religious content were
entered into a computerized data base and categorized under
either personal faith; religion in doctrinal and institutional
terms; the laity; the clergy; or miscellaneous. <p>

Within each category, the instances were classified as either
positive, mixed, neutral, or negative. &quot;Mixed&quot; indicates balanced
points of view with ultimately no side taken; the &quot;neutral&quot;
designation encompasses depictions that were ambiguous or offered
insufficiently substantial treatments of the issue. (In our
previous studies, mixed/neutral was one category.)<p>


The outstanding portrayals in each category are presented below
in order of their length, with the briefest instances discussed
first. Not all treatments or mentions of religion are touched on
in the text, but each is represented in the statistical
appendices, and each is noted by category, chronologically, in a
third appendix.<p>

<h3>II. STUDY RESULTS</h3>

<i>Overview?</i><p>

In 1995, there were 1,798 hours of original prime time
entertainment programming on the six broadcast networks. Those
webs aired 287 portrayals of religion; 38.3 percent of these were
positive, 27.9 negative, 7.3 mixed, and 26.5 neutral. <p>

Where raw numbers are concerned, CBS led with 99 depictions; NBC
broadcast 93, Fox 45, ABC 30. (UPN, with 12, and WB, with eight,
both of which went on the air early in 1995, each offered
programming only two nights per week that year.) NBC
and Fox held relatively steady from last year to this, but CBS's
number represented an large increase over 1994's total of 63,
while ABC plummeted from its 1994 figure of 67.  <p>

CBS had the highest percentage of positive depictions, at 47.5;
ABC (36.7 percent) and NBC (34.4) followed, and Fox, with 24.4,
brought up the rear among the major networks. Fox led in negative
portrayals at 46.7 percent; ABC (36.7), NBC (26.9), and CBS
(20.2) trailed. <p>

In religious terms, Touched By an Angel, the CBS drama currently
in its second season, was the outstanding series of 1995, and
perhaps the most pro-faith series in television history. (After a
shaky start, it is also a bona fide popular success.) No series
was anywhere near as anti-religious, although Fox's The Simpsons
consistently got in its licks. Probably the greatest
disappointment of the year was NBC's Amazing Grace, whose
minister protagonist espoused a faith so diluted as to be almost
unrecognizable.<p>
<pre>
   <h3>A. Faith: Prime Time's Expressions of Belief<p></h3>

  As in 1993 and '94, religion was treated far more favorably in
  this category than in any other. It comprises instances wherein a
  person states or manifests in simple terms his or her belief, or
  lack thereof.

  Positive -- 76.6 percent (74% in 1994; 63% in 1993)<p>

  On prime time, the most common indication of faith is prayer. In
  the March 13 NBC movie Awake to Danger, a father whose daughter
  is in a coma offers to help; the doctor tells him to pray. On the
  February 21 Grace Under Fire (ABC), a man remarks that he &quot;prayed
  that the Lord would give me one more chance to make [his
  seriously ill father] proud of me.&quot;<p>


  A character on the September 25 Chicago Hope (CBS) says, &quot;I
  hadn't been to church in years. That is, not until recently, when
  my daughter had heart trouble and I found myself praying.&quot;
  Another medical drama, NBC's ER, featured on its December
  14 episode an elderly Holocaust survivor whose kidnapped
  granddaughter had just been found alive. The old woman comments
  that while the little girl was missing, &quot;I did something that I
  stopped doing fifty years ago: I prayed.&quot;<p>
   
  On the September 30 Sisters (NBC), Teddy, who is coming out of a
  coma, takes part in a fantastical exchange with her younger self.
  After the young Teddy says, &quot;All it takes is a little
  persistence,&quot; the adult Teddy adds, &quot;;And a whole lot of faith.&quot;
  The camera then pans upward to the sky. <P>
   
  One of the celestial emissaries on CBS's Touched By an Angel had
  her own crisis of faith in the February 25 episode. Monica,
  addressing God, wonders, &quot;Why have You forsaken me? Why are You
  punishing me?&quot; Monica's mentor, Tess, responds, &quot;Has God ever
  forsaken you, Monica? He told you he wouldn't, and He never has.&quot;<p>
   
  Fox's The X-Files surprised many with an affirmation of
  Catholicism in its December 15 installment. Scully, an FBI agent,
  regains her faith while investigating a series of murders in
  which each victim has what appears to be stigmata. After the case
  is solved, Scully goes to confession and discusses her drift from
  the Church in the past few years; the priest tells her,
  &quot;Sometimes you have to go full circle.&quot; Scully has the
  show's last line: &quot;God is speaking, but no one's listening.&quot;<p>

  The January 10 episode of NBC's The John Larroquette Show
  centered on what many perceived as an image of Jesus Christ on a
  bus-station wall. Even though it transpires that the face is
  really that of Willie Nelson from an old, painted-over poster,
  the image inspires a good deal of pro-faith reflection. The bus
  station manager, addressing God, states, &quot;I have spent most of my
  life unconvinced of Your existence, [but] I have come to believe
  in a higher power.&quot;<p>


  Negative -- 6.4 percent (6% in 1994; 22% in 1993)<p>

  On the May 9 NYPD Blue (ABC), Detective Sipowicz explains to his
  fiancee that he lost his faith as a result of the depravity he's
  witnessed on the job, and on the December 1 Homicide: Life on the
  Street (NBC), a Baltimore detective, offered the chance to see
  the Pope in person during the pontiff's visit to that city,
  comments, &quot;Sixty thousand people...looking at a man for some sort
  of miracle? No, thank you. I'm not interested.&quot;<p>

  Mixed --  8.5 percent; Neutral -- 8.5 percent; (Mixed/neutral 20%
  in 1994; 15% in 1993)<p>

  One mixed incidence was found on the February 26 Earth 2 (NBC).
  After Yale prays, Mary, a resident of the Tarian planet, asks,
  &quot;Who were you talking to?&quot; Yale responds, &quot;God...[to] ask
  forgiveness for the harm that [one does].&quot; Mary counters,
  &quot;The Tarian way is better: Don't harm.&quot; A neutral example:
  apropos of a murder, a policeman on the March 19 NBC movie Ed
  McBain's 87th Precinct asks, &quot;If there's a God in heaven, why do
  things like this have to happen?&quot; His partner answers, &quot;I don't
  know.&quot;<p> 


   <h3>B. The Institution: Prime Time's Treatment of Churches and Their
     Doctrines</h3>

  This category deals with religion handled in institutional terms,
  such as a reference to a service or to a particular church or its
  doctrines.

  Positive -- 31.1 percent (46% in 1994; 50% in 1993)
  On the January 17 Something Wilder (NBC), a boy, age five or so,
  asks his father where one goes after death. His father replies,
  &quot;Heaven.&quot; A character on the November 26 episode of Fox's Space:
  Above and Beyond comments, "When I'm on a battlefield, and I see
  a human dead...I can feel something is missing...You can feel
  they have no souls." 
 
  During the December 12 CBS movie A Holiday to Remember, a woman
  tells a young runaway, "Come on, I don't want to be visiting you
  down at the jail in five years. You need religion." On the
  December 18 Can't Hurry Love (CBS), Annie tries to organize her
  co-workers to volunteer with religious charities, performing such
  tasks as collecting Christmas gifts for needy children.<p>
 
  Negative -- 31.1 percent (22% in 1994; 50% in 1993)<p>

  The title character of CBS's Murphy Brown is hosting a memorial
  service in the January 16 installment; asked if she's put a Bible
  out for the mourners, Murphy answers, &quot;Eeeuuuwww, I don't think I
  have one.&quot; On the November 2 episode of Fox's The Crew, a woman
  says to a gay character, &quot;I don't care what they say about you in
  Leviticus. I think you are fun.&quot;<p>
   
  In the March 8 premiere of CBS's The George Wendt Show, two
  characters return to their old church for casino night; one says
  the visit brings back memories of "the gradual stripping away of
  a young boy's self-esteem.&quot; On the November 21 episode of ABC's
  Roseanne, the protagonist, playing an unpleasant pilgrim at the
  first Thanksgiving, dismisses an Indian's reference to "Mother
  Earth.&quot;<p>

  &quot;That's nothing but heathen talk,&quot; Roseanne remarks. "There is
  one God. He's in  heaven, sitting on [His] throne, so he can damn
  everything. The end.&quot;<p>
  
  
  Mixed -- 6.6 percent; Neutral -- 31.1 percent; (Mixed/neutral 32%
  in 1994; 0% in 1993)
   
  A mixed example comes from the May 9 Wings (NBC). After a
  character remarks that he's going to attend Mass regularly, a
  friend commends him: "Good for you...Without a strong spiritual
  connection, what does life really mean?" He asks what religion
  she is, to which she replies dismissively, "I don't know. Some
  sort of Protestant."
  
  In the neutral category, a character on the June 14 High Sierra
  Search and Rescue (NBC) who's been a recluse since her husband
  left her is rebuked by a friend: "You quit your job because you
  couldn't make it ten miles to work. Then five miles to church."
  On the March 14 John Larroquette Show, a regular character rigs
  it so John can see another player's poker hand. Afterwards, the
  character says, "What if God really does keep score of all the
  bad things you do? I'd hate to think I had only one sin left and
  wasted it riggin' a poker game when I could've robbed a bank or
  something."  


   <h3>C. The Laity: Prime Time's Portrayal of Believers</h3>

  This category encompasses depictions of those for whom religion
  is a strong (sometimes the central) force in their lives. It
  covers both portrayals of their explicitly religious words or
  deeds and their secular conduct. As opposed to simple
  declarations of faith, we see here and in the clergy category
  that the more elaborate the depiction, the more likely it is to
  be negative -- a finding common to all three studies.   


  Positive -- 11.1 percent (44% in 1994; 18% in 1993)
   
  In the March 20 NBC movie Menu For Murder, a mistress asserts her
  affair with a judge would not have lasted because the judge's
  wife is a devout Catholic. On the October 31 The Client (CBS), a
  woman tells a friend that the friend's taking in her grandchild
  was &quot;a Christian thing.&quot;<p>
  
  Negative -- 64.4 percent (35% in 1994; 68% in 1993)
   
  Murphy Brown's title character, addressing a women's studies
  class during the October 30 episode, asserts, "While we sit here
  arguing, the radical religious right is working to take away
  everything we've fought for." During the May 14 CBS movie
  The Rockford Files: A Blessing in Disguise, an actress appearing
  in an irreverent movie is called a "slut" and almost physically
  assaulted by followers of a televangelist.  
   
  Detectives on the February 24 Homicide: Life on the Street drop
  by the house of a middle-aged woman prominently displaying a
  crucifix on her front door. She admits she killed her boyfriend
  (for dating her sister) and put his body in the freezer. On the
  November 29 Law & Order, a mentally disturbed woman kills her
  baby daughter because she believes God wanted her to.
  
  Mixed -- 4.4 percent; Neutral -- 20.0 percent; (Mixed/neutral 21%
  in 1994; 14% in 1993)
   
  One of the mixed treatments was offered by the April 28 Picket
  Fences (CBS). After killing a swan, a repentant young boy becomes
  devoutly religious and develops what appear to be stigmata. His
  sister accepts what happens to him at face value, but the
  patriarch says any supernatural explanation is "crap" and
  "evidence of how dangerous and how ridiculous organized religion
  can be."
   
  Neutral examples: on the January 10 Frasier (NBC), an adult son
  says to his father, "Brush your teeth and say your prayers." The
  father responds, "That's what I used to say...didn't I?" His
  other son says, "No, you didn't," to which the father replies, "I
  meant to." Establishing his credentials as a good citizen, a
  murder suspect on the November 22 Law & Order (NBC) says, "I pay
  my taxes. I go to church." He turns out to be innocent. 
  

   <h3>D. The Clergy: Prime Time's Treatment of Religious Leaders</h3>
   
  This category comprises portrayals of the professionally
  religious.
  
  Positive -- 20.0 percent (28% in 1994; 15% in 1993)
   
  On the November 27 Nowhere Man (UPN), a mother gives her son news
  of his hometown: Father Kearney has died. "He was a wonderful
  man," she says. "Everyone in town will miss him dearly." In the
  February 5 CBS movie The Piano Lesson, a minister says, "I ain't
  got no power...God's got the power...God's got a wonderful
  power." A priest on the November 12 NBC movie Her Hidden Truth
  champions the cause of a woman unjustly convicted of murder.
  
  Negative -- 41.7 percent (31% in 1994; 59% in 1993)
   
  On the January 1 George Carlin Show (Fox), a waitress in a bar
  shows her breasts to a priest. He says he finds them attractive,
  whereupon she says to her boyfriend, "If an abnormal man like him
  likes them, they're good enough for you." On the March 25
  Mommies (NBC), a woman laments, "I've turned into a boring person
  who makes rules and says no," to which her friend queries,
  "You're the Pope?" A married minister asks Ellen for a date on
  the November 5 Cleghorne! (WB).
   
  During the March 8 George Wendt Show, a man reminisces about a
  nun lifting him by his eyebrows and about "all the hell [priests
  and nuns] put me through as a kid." In the April 17 NBC movie The
  Other Mother, a teen mother lives at a Catholic halfway house;
  the nuns who run the home are portrayed not just as well-meaning
  disciplinarians, but as excessively harsh. 
 

  Mixed -- 5.0 percent, Neutral -- 33.3 percent (Mixed/neutral 41%
  in 1994; 26% in 1993)<p>
 
  The December 8 Picket Fences provided the outstanding mixed
  instance. The episode centered on a visit by Pope John Paul II to
  a small Wisconsin town, where he witnesses a murder. The attorney
  for the accused killer declares that because the victim was gay,
  the Pope can't be an unbiased witness given the Vatican's
  condemnation of homosexual acts. Others, including the judge in
  the case, are more respectful of the pontiff.<p>
   
  Among the neutrals: On the October 1 Hope & Gloria (NBC),
  regarding a nun named Theodore Rose, a man wonders, &quot;Why do nuns
  always have names that make them sound like they're half man,
  half woman?&quot; His ex-wife answers, &quot;What difference does it make?
  They don't use either half.&quot; On the October 8 Can't Hurry Love, a
  woman says, &quot;I'm sure even Mother Teresa has things she doesn't
  like about guys. OK, so maybe her dating years are behind her,
  but you get my point.&quot; <p>
  

   <h3>E. Miscellaneous</h3>

  In other words, everything that didn't fit into the other
  categories. Many references to God go here if they don't belong
  under Faith, inasmuch as He is not, strictly speaking, clergy.<p>
   
  As usual, almost all incidences were mixed or neutral. On the
  September 17 Cybill (CBS), a woman who's just been on a shopping
  spree says, &quot;I, for one, feel closer to God.&quot; One of the positive
  examples was heard on the May 5 Homicide: Life on the Street.
  When a detective was told he was lucky not to have been shot, he
  replies, &quot;Luck had nothing to do with it. God reached down and
  graced [the potential killer] with wisdom.&quot;

<h3>III. RECOMMENDATIONS</center></h3> <br>
   
In last year's study, we noted a marginal improvement in prime
time's treatment of religion from 1993 to `94, yet in
quantitative terms the numbers were still anemic and in
qualitative terms the attacks on religion continued.<P>
  
Regarding 1995, the overall numbers were similar to those of `94.
There was, however, significant qualitative regression in certain
categories. <p>
   
Perhaps this was, in part, liberal Hollywood's reaction to the
widely acknowledged boost that evangelical voters gave
conservative Republican candidates in the fall '94 elections.
Perhaps old habits don't change easily.<p> 
   
Whatever the motivation, the step backward is cause for concern.
The silver lining, though, is that the failure of the broadcast
networks' yuppie-centered fall offerings and the continued
decline in their share of the audience makes a return to
traditional programming a more attractive prospect now. Our
recommendations:<p>
     
Re-establish respect for religious values on the networks.
Religion should not be treated as if it were a political issue,
where a balance of positive and negative is considered
appropriate. Rather, faith in general, and the faithful in
particular, should be afforded the dignity it and they deserve.
It is highly unlikely that any major network will ever air vast
amounts of faith-oriented programming, nor do we suggest such a
thing should be done. The networks can, however, make it clear to
religious viewers that at the very least, their shows will not
assault Judeo-Christian values. <p>

Clone a religious hit. After the young-adult-oriented Friends
became a smash in the 1994-'95 season, the fall '95 prime time
schedule was thick with series in that genre. With the success of
Touched By an Angel, the networks now have a pro-faith winner to
copy. Wouldn't it be nice to see more shows that dared to speak
of the power of God's love? At the recent Academy Awards, actor
Christopher Reeve challenged the film industry to &quot;put social
issues ahead of box-office success...[to] continue to take risks.
Let's tackle the issues. In many ways, our film community can do
it better than anyone else.&quot; The same challenge applies to
television and matters of faith.<p> 
   
Listen to the concerns of the faithful. Networks invest vast sums
in market research, yet seemingly don't take into account the
millions who, save for series like Touched By an Angel and
Christy, are offended by the values of television and are tuning
out. The more shows of that kind there are, the more that
audience will watch. And make no mistake about it: studies show
this audience is large and affluent. Executives like ABC's Ted
Harbert know that the industry's frantic pursuit of the 18-to-49
demographic was excessive; they should now turn their attention
to the audience that cherish traditional values. In this way,
networks can boost both their Nielsen ratings and their profits.<p>
   
Television is on the hot seat, and the only way to get off it is
to behave responsibly. Ultimately, this means not content
ratings, or encoding for the V-chip, but rather changing the
values promoted over the airwaves. An increase in
religion-friendly programming can and should be at the center of
such a prime time reformation.<p>

<h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2> 
  
<b><i>The media continue to miss the story of a religious and moral
resurgence across the country in our politics, in our culture,
and most importantly, in our churches. In their survey The
Churching of America, Roger Finke and Rodney Stark reported that
virtually all Americans believe in God or a universal spirit. A
substantial majority believe they will be called before God on
Judgment Day to account for their sins. The vast majority of
Americans believe the Bible is either the literal or inspired
Word of God, and the Ten Commandments are valid rules for living.
Sixty percent of the populace can be found attending houses of
worship in a given month. This &quot;silent majority&quot; still worships
and reflects on their faith under the radar screen of a
secularized media elite.<p>

Despite officially proclaimed concern in the highest councils of
the national news media that religion and religious issues too
often go ignored, the record demonstrates that the concern has
been matched by little noticeable action. The Media Research
Center's first study of television news coverage of religion and
religious values in 1993 discovered both a surprising paucity of
religion coverage and an overt pattern of advocacy against
traditional values: out of more than 18,000 evening news stories,
only 212 evening news stories dealt with religion. Out of more
than 26,000 morning segments, only 197 dealt directly with
religion. Prime-time magazine programs and Sunday morning
interview shows broached religious subjects on only 18 occasions.
The networks had trouble cracking the one percent barrier with
religion coverage. <p>

Employing the same methodology, the Media Research Center
discovered that religious coverage actually declined in 1994.
Evening news stories rose slightly to 225, but morning segments
declined to 151, and Sunday talk show and magazine show segments
dropped to nine. Thanks in part to events like the papal visit to
the United States in October, 1995's network output on religious
news and issues added up to a slight increase over 1994. The
number of evening news stories rose to 249; morning segments grew
noticeably to 224; and magazine and interview show segments
increased to 15. Despite the slight increase overall, the
networks are still barely cracking the one percent barrier. The
pattern in unchanging: the networks continue to neglect people
and issues of faith in their everyday reporting. When religion is
covered, hostility toward traditional religious positions on
social issues remains overt and sometimes unrebutted.  <p>

<h2>II. QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF NETWORK NEWS COVERAGE </h2>
<pre>
  <h3>A. Evening News Stories</h3>

  Out of an estimated 18,000 segments last year on the five network
  programs evaluated (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News,
  CNN's World News, NBC Nightly News, and The MacNeil-Lehrer
  NewsHour on PBS) the networks devoted only 249 stories to
  religion or religious issues in 1995, a slight increase (11
  percent) from 1994.<p>

  Only 143 of these were reporter-based stories (compared to 106
  anchor briefs), an increase of nine stories from the previous
  year's full story total. <p>

  As in past years, news stories perhaps tangentially related to
  religious issues (in this year's case, the Million Man March led
  by Rev. Louis Farrakhan) were only included if they involved
  issues of religion or theology.<p>

  CNN's World News tied with ABC for the highest number of religion
  stories with 65, even though ABC's World News Tonight lasts only
  half as long. The quantity of news coverage is also determined by
  the length of each story: only 23 (35 percent) of ABC's stories
  were anchor briefs, compared to 47 segments (or 72 percent) of
  CNN coverage. CNN's total was three stories less than 1994, while
  ABC reported 15 stories more than the year before. <p>

  CBS improved to 50 stories, up from 31 stories in 1993 and 46 in
  1994. NBC trailed with 43, the same number as 1994 and 11 less
  than 1993. For the third straight year, The MacNeil-Lehrer
  NewsHour lagged far behind the others with 26 stories, eight more
  than 1994.<p>

  But only 11 were reporter-based stories or interview segments.   
  The Catholic Church again led the coverage with 111 stories, up
  from 103 in 1994. Fully 68 percent of the total (76 stories) were
  anchor briefs, not full-length, reporter-based stories. Generic
  religion stories (without specific reference to denominations),
  often on subjects like school prayer or church-state relations,
  came in second with 70 stories. Once again, news of individual
  Protestant denominations was nearly absent -- five for the
  Southern Baptists, four on Episcopalians, two on Anglicans.
  Muslims drew nine stories; Jews six; Mormons six; Buddhists five;
  Hindus, Greek Orthodox, and Russian Orthodox, one each. Unlike
  1994, when it outnumbered all stories on individual Protestant
  denominations combined, New Age spirituality attracted only one
  evening news story in 1995.<p>
 

  <h3>B. Morning Shows<p></h3>

  Despite a full two hours daily for news and interviews, adding up
  to more than 26,000 segments in 1995, the major network morning
  shows (ABC's Good Morning America, CBS This Morning, and NBC's
  Today) devoted 224 morning show stories to religion in 1994.
  That's not very impressive in terms of the tens of thousands of
  morning segments, but it is a noticeable one-third increase over
  1994, if not a significant increase from the 197 morning news
  stories in 1993.<p>

  Like 1994, the networks were closely matched in their amount of
  coverage. NBC led again with 80 segments, up from 52 in 1994; CBS
  aired 74, up from 48 in 1994; and ABC aired 70, up from 50
  segments in the previous year. Of the 224 stories, more than half (115
  stories) were anchor briefs.<p>

  Greater emphasis on religion interview segments may be partially
  responsible for the increase. NBC interviewed &quot; dissident
  Catholic&quot;  priest and author Andrew Greeley on five occasions. CBS
  devoted an hour of This Morning to a rabbi, a priest, and a
  Protestant pastor. ABC began airing the "God Squad" duo of Father
  Thomas Hartman and Rabbi Marc Gellman in mid-year, relying on
  them for 12 of their 23 interviews in 1995. Gellman's appearances
  substantially heightened the visibility of Jewish voices on the
  networks from past years. Counting Father Hartman's appearances,
  159 stories (71 percent) of the morning coverage featured the
  Catholic Church, a great increase from 63 stories in 1994, a year
  which lacked a papal visit.  <p>


  <h3>C. Magazine/Interview Shows</h3>

  The blind spot to religious news remains especially noticeable on
  Sunday morning interview shows and prime-time magazine programs.
  Analysts reviewed the Sunday shows (ABC's This Week with David
  Brinkley, CBS's Face the Nation, NBC's Meet the Press) as well as
  the prime-time magazine lineup (ABC's Day One, Prime Time Live,
  and 20/20; CBS's Eye to Eye with Connie Chung, 48 Hours, and 60
  Minutes; and NBC's three-night Dateline format). Out of roughly
  400 shows, the number of religion stories rose from nine in 1994
  to 15 in 1995, including segment repeats. But that also includes
  three one-hour programs on religion: a March 15 Peter Jennings
  Reporting special, a September 8 CBS Reports on the religious
  right, and an October 5 48 Hours focusing on the papal visit. Out
  of roughly 150 shows between the three networks, only one Sunday
  morning interview focused on religion: a May 21 segment of Meet
  the Press with Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition and Clinton
  aide George Stephanopoulos. <p>
  </pre>

<h2>III. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF RELIGION COVERAGE AND SOCIAL ISSUES</h2>
<pre>
 <h3> A. Institutions</h3>

  Institutional coverage of religion again focused mainly on the
  Catholic Church, and reporters focused on the unpopularity of
  Church teachings among the American laity: 15 stories highlighted
  poll results finding a majority of American Catholics rejecting
  Church stands. These polls continued to ignore the statistical
  significance on the issues between Catholics who attend church
  weekly and lapsed Catholics who seldom or never attend Mass.
  The networks again portrayed the traditional Church as an
  oppressive, narrow-minded hierarchy with outdated moral concepts.
  Again, in stories and interviews, moral equivalence was awarded
  to self-proclaimed &quot; dissidents&quot;  with a pro-abortion, pro-gay,
  feminist agenda. A case study is the January 22, 1995 60 Minutes.
  Mike Wallace devoted an entire segment to Call to Action, a
  Chicago-based group of &quot; dissidents.&quot;  Wallace portrayed this group
  as a credible, moderate voice for respectable Catholics: &quot; Among
  the things they challenge is the Pope's position on birth
  control, on women becoming priests, and on priests being able to
  marry....There's no denying that for many American Catholics,
  those teachings have lost their appeal.&quot; <p>

  Wallace characterized his subjects as &quot; hardly wild-eyed radicals,
  these people from Call to Action. They're sober church workers,
  nuns and priests, and just plain concerned Catholics....their
  ideals formed in the heady age of change back in the '60s.&quot;  These
  people had decidedly un-sober things to say. Father Mike Flager
  denounced the Church as &quot; spiritually bankrupt&quot;  and said the
  traditional Church has &quot; a love it or leave it, you know, it's
  that crazy patriotism philosophy.&quot;  Edwina Gately &quot; was described
  as a devout Catholic with the tongue of a pagan tart.&quot;  Gately
  replied: &quot; Well I'm OK with the `pagan tart,' it's the `devout
  Catholic' that worries me.&quot;  Wallace reminded her she once said
  &quot; the Vatican is the only tyranny left in the world today.&quot;  <p>

  Wallace's report included 25 soundbites from &quot; dissidents&quot;  without
  broadcasting a single voice in favor of traditional Catholicism.
  Wallace later conceded to the Catholic newspaper Our Sunday
  Visitor that &quot; interviews with Harvard law professor Mary Ann
  Glendon and George Weigel of the Ethics and Public Policy Center,
  prominent lay Catholics who support Church teaching, were not
  used because producers felt the material was too dissimilar to
  work with footage from the Call to Action conference.&quot;  
  When Pope John Paul visited America in October, he underlined the
  Church's historical call to assist the poor, but network analysts
  gave it a secular spin, portraying the remarks as an attack on
  the Republican Party. PBS anchor Robert MacNeil wondered: &quot; Is the
  Pope against the Contract with America?&quot;  CNN anchor Judy Woodruff
  asked Pat Buchanan about the pontiff: &quot; He's certainly been a
  conservative on many theological issues, but many people would
  agree he's been more liberal on social issues, helping the poor,
  he's talked a lot about this. How do you as a Catholic reconcile
  that with what your own party has done this year and is talking
  of doing with regard to cutting back programs for the poor in
  this country?&quot; <p>

  For three morning interviews, NBC brought on Father Andrew
  Greeley to echo that liberal spin: &quot; I heard a Catholic
  conservative last night say that the Pope's words have nothing to
  do with American politics. And I can't imagine anybody being more
  totally wrong. The Pope has come to the United States when it's
  in a very mean-spirited period when it's bashing immigrants,
  bashing poor people, bashing minorities. And the Pope has come to
  say `Hey, stop that!' He isn't talking about specific legislative
  measures, but he's certainly addressing himself to the spirit
  that elected and sustains the Gingrich-Dole Congress.&quot; 
  But later in the same interview, Greeley suggested Catholics can
  ignore the Pope on sexual matters because Greeley thinks he's
  wrong: &quot; Well, most Catholics choose to be Catholic on their own
  terms....they reserve the right to follow their own consciences
  and appeal to a God who does understand.&quot; <p>

  When Ireland moved to lift its ban on divorce, CBS Evening News
  reporter Cinny Kennard applauded on November 18: &quot; Those opposed
  are backed by the mighty Roman Catholic Church that argues
  divorce would profoundly damage the stability and fabric of Irish
  society...Fear is the primary weapon for those who want to
  maintain the ban.&quot;  Kennard highlighted what she felt were more
  enlightened opinions: &quot; For many here, it's more then a referendum
  on the right to remarry. It's another example of the country's
  move to re-invent itself as a more modern and progressive
  Ireland, an Ireland that is more tolerant and open. Recently,
  there has been legal reform on contraception, abortion, and
  homosexuality; signs that the traditional Church grip on Ireland
  has been loosened; signs that the country is increasingly run
  from government buildings and not the Vatican.&quot; <p> 

  Kennard repeated her line on the November 30 CBS This Morning:
  &quot; It's been like an awakening. Ireland, long positioned on the
  world's stage as a church-dominated backwater, has reinvented
  itself as a new and energized Emerald Isle. A more open, a more
  tolerant place.&quot; <p>

  <h3>B. Abortion and Violence (142 in 1995; 247 in 1994; 150  in 1993)<p></h3>

  Social issues bring out the bias in reporters. In a March 2, 1996
  appearance on the CNBC program Cal Thomas, Washington Post
  reporter Howard Kurtz denied that reporters had a liberal
  political bias in favor of the Democrats, but he did suggest &quot; I
  think there is, however, a problem with what I call cultural bias
  on these subjects that you mentioned -- religion, abortion,
  homosexuality. I think a lot of it is unconscious, but I think on
  those kinds of subjects, most reporters are probably to the left
  of the American public and probably don't realize that they're
  not always giving a full weights of views of people who have very
  different take on these matters.<p>

  Reporters may pride themselves on adding context and perspective
  to the issues, but on abortion the networks continue a troubling
  pattern of black/white distinctions: pro-lifers are inextricably
  linked to a violent, radical fringe, while abortion advocates are
  harassed do-gooders operating in the peaceful mainstream. 
  Due to the lack of further violence against abortionists, evening
  newscasts devoted 59 segments to harassment and violence around
  abortion clinics, down almost 60 percent over the 146 segments
  broadcast in 1994. The network morning shows had 82 segments,
  down almost 14 percent from the 95 segments shown in 1994. Magazine
  shows aired only one segment on abortion-related violence in
  1995, down from the six they presented the previous year. Total
  coverage of violence around abortion clinics on all shows amounted to 142
  stories, compared to the 247 in 1994 and 150 segments in 1993. 
  Among the abortion stories not focusing on pro-life violence, the
  networks reported on the debates in Congress over partial birth
  abortions and abortion services at armed forces hospitals, as
  well as the Surgeon General nomination of Dr. Henry Foster, who had
  trouble remembering how many abortions he had performed. Evening
  shows aired 161 total abortion-related segments, morning shows
  245, and magazine shows 11, for a grand sum of 417 segments. On every
  network, pro-life violence stories garnered about one-third of
  the total coverage. That declined from 1994, when pro-life violence
  stories outnumbered other abortion stories by a 2 to 1 margin. 
  Unlike the past two years, religion was not indicted as a
  co-conspirator in pro-life violence. The media did not allude to
  a &quot; link between crime and religion,&quot;  as CBS Evening News anchor Bob
  Schieffer declared two days after Dr. David Gunn was murdered in
  1993. But, once again, the pro-life movement was demonized as a
  dangerous, menacing force.<p>
 
  On January 3, 1995 Jane Pauley promoted an upcoming segment on
  Dateline NBC by charging: "Still ahead -- the latest round of
  bloodshed and violence at abortion clinics. The anti-abortion
  movement has been creeping to the edge of bloody fanaticism for a
  decade. One hundred twenty-nine bombings across the country. And
  while the national debate rages on there have been 600 acts of
  vandalism, firebombings, sniper attacks, windows shattered. There
  is no way to measure the fear or count the death threats.&quot; 
  All this one-sided coverage has an effect on the public's
  perception of the pro-life movement. Reporter David Culhane
  conveyed the results of a CBS poll on this topic during the
  January 8 CBS Evening News: &quot; A new CBS poll shows that three out
  of four Americans say the protest tactics of some anti-abortion
  activists can be blamed for leading to the recent shootings at
  several abortion clinics.&quot; <p> 

  What about violence perpetrated by abortion advocates? In 1994, 
  only CNN reported (in passing) that Ernest Robertson Jr. tried to
  shoot a pro-life protester after picking up his wife outside a
  Baton Rouge, Louisiana abortion clinic. He shot once and missed,
  and then his gun jammed. He was later charged with attempted
  second-degree murder. But in 1995, the networks again
  demonstrated their pro-abortion bias by failing to report on
  harassment or threats of violence against pro-lifers, despite
  some important stories all the networks missed. <p>

  For example, Daniel Adam Mahoney was the first pro-abortion
  activist indicted under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances
  Act on April 11, 1995. Mahoney called a crisis pregnancy center,
  First Way of Wenatchee, Washington, on January 2 and threatened
  to kill the workers at the center. He also called the National
  Life Center hotline in New Jersey and told an operator he was
  going to shoot pro-life protesters outside abortion clinics. He
  pleaded guilty to both crimes on June 7. This was reported by the
  Associated Press and The New York Times, but never appeared on
  the networks. <p>

  Alice Hand was arrested in January 1995 for making at least three
  phone calls threatening to blow-up a Catholic church and school
  in Suffern, New York. Hand wanted revenge on the Catholic Church,
  which she believed was partly to blame for pro-life violence. The
  New York Times ran a 288-word story on January 17, but the
  incident never appeared on any of the networks. <p>

  While the networks devoted 142 stories to violence outside
  clinics, only three alluded to violence inside the clinics. CNN's
  September 12 World News broadcast one segment about abortionist David
  Benjamin, who was convicted of second degree murder in New York
  City for allowing a woman to bleed to death from a perforated
  uterus during an abortion. Not one segment mentioned the rate of
  abortions in the United States in 1993 or 1994, but two segments
  aired estimates in 1995. On the August 23 Today show, Dawn
  Fratangelo reported a new study estimated that &quot; one-quarter of
  the world's pregnancies end in abortion,&quot;  while the August 30 NBC
  Nightly News mentioned there are 1.5 million abortions per year
  in the United States. <p>

  With 1995 ushering in a new Republican-controlled Congress, the
  media predicted the death of the right to abortion while betting
  it would be an issue that threatens the survival of the Republican
  majority. After Senators voted to make the gruesome partial birth
  abortion procedure illegal on December 7, NBC's Bryant Gumbel
  opened the next day's Today show with this exaggerated claim:
  &quot; Good Morning. Congress is a step closer this morning to eliminating a
  woman's choice in abortion.&quot; <p>
  During the congressional fight over the nomination of Dr. Henry
  Foster as Surgeon General, NBC's Jim Miklaszewski on the February
  9 Today show felt this would eventually be a win for President
  Clinton: &quot; White House officials claim conservative Republicans
  want to turn Foster's nomination into a fight over abortion. In that
  case, Clinton aides admit they could still lose the nomination,
  but would ultimately win the war of public opinion over choice and
  help push the Republicans further right from center.&quot;  CBS anchor
  Connie Chung also saw abortion as bringing about the demise of the
  Republican Party on the February 15 CBS Evening News: &quot; Republican
  use of the abortion issue against Dr. Henry Foster's nomination
  as Surgeon General seems to be backfiring tonight. The deep stress
  cracks over abortion policy are now starting to show inside the
  Republican Party.&quot; <p>
  Once again, a year passed with the concerns of pro-lifers ignored
  by the networks. Women who regret abortions, how the abortion
  industry operates relatively free of government regulation, the
  large sums of money made by the abortion industry, government
  subsidies to Planned Parenthood -- all went unreported in 1995. <p>

  <h3>C. Homosexuality (113 total stories in 1995; 105 in
  1994; 756 in 1993)<p></h3>

  The number of stories primarily about homosexuality remained
  about the same between 1994 and 1995. Both years were much lower
  than 1993 when the gays in the military debate dominated the news
  for a few months. In 1995, 59 evening show segments were
  broadcast focusing on gay issues, the same number as in 1994.
  Morning shows aired 48 stories in 1995, up from the 37 broadcast
  in 1994.<p>

  Magazine show segments dropped from nine in 1994 to six in 1995. 
  But the networks demonstrated a liberal orientation once again:
  most of the segments featured gays in a positive light while
  rarely presenting those who opposed the gay agenda. In what few
  interview segments there were on the morning shows, the number of pro-gay
  agenda guests outnumbered the anti-gay agenda guests by thirteen
  to three. <p>

  <h3>D. Religious Right (17 evening stories in 1995; 12 in
  1994; 15 in 1993)<p></h3>

  In the 34 total segments and one hour CBS Reports special, the
  media reported on Christian conservatives in 1995 as an
  intolerant and divisive force in American politics willing to
  dishonestly manipulate voters into casting a ballot for their
  candidates. The label &quot; extremist&quot;  sometimes popped up in a
  discussion of Christian conservatives. Bryant Gumbel asked Gary
  Hart on the October 17 Today: &quot; How do you view the GOP's
  courtship of the extreme and religious right?&quot; <p>

  The networks portrayed the Christian Coalition as a negative
  force in the Republican Party. Today co-host Katie Couric
  reflected this view in a February 13 interview with Ralph Reed
  about the effect his organization, the Christian Coalition, would
  have on the presidential race: &quot; Do you believe, Mr. Reed, that
  your stand will divide the Republican Party in a way that will
  make it difficult, if not impossible, to win in the election in
  1996? And isn't that what went wrong in the last election for
  George Bush?&quot;  On the September 8 CBS Evening News, Linda Douglass
  also saw sure defeat for a candidate with Christian right
  support: &quot; Christian conservatives may not have the power to
  anoint a candidate, but they might be able to defeat one.
  Embracing their views may help to win the Republican nomination,
  but it could cost votes in the general election.&quot; <p>

  While the networks would not suggest that a liberal group like
  the NAACP doesn't represent all black people, CBS suggested the
  Christian Coalition did not represent all Christians -- or
  suggested they were less than Christian. Rather introduced
  Douglass's September 8 story by noting Phil Gramm &quot; was at a
  meeting of preacher Pat Robertson's political group, the one calling
  itself the Christian Coalition.&quot;  Four months earlier, on May 15, Rather
  charged: &quot; The group calling itself the Christian Coalition is
  aligned with hard-right stands on issues ranging from gay rights
  to school prayer, and it's demanding its due for its help in getting
  Republicans elected.&quot; The networks also suggested conservatives weren't honest about
  their politics. Paula Zahn's question on the November 15 This
  Morning to the director of the liberal Texas Freedom Alliance:
  &quot; Hasn't some of your criticism been, though, that they have
  funded stealth candidates? That these people have not been honest about
  what their agenda is as they go around campaigning?&quot;       
  Some of the worst bias towards the Christian right was broadcast
  during the murder trial of Susan Smith, who drowned her two sons.
  The same media which decried Newt Gingrich's 1992
  characterization of Woody Allen having Democratic family values took a gratuitous
  slap at the Christian Coalition. Both CBS and NBC aired reports
  mentioning, as NBC reporter Bob Dotson described on July 28, that
  Susan Smith's &quot; stepfather, Bev Russell, former Republican Party
  chairman and once active in the Christian Coalition, began
  molesting Susan just before her 16th birthday.&quot; <p>

  The usually little covered religious left garnered a few pieces
  during the year. These segments were mostly platforms for the
  religious left to attack the religious right. NBC's Bob Abernethy
  profiled leftist activist Rev. Jim Wallis who mounted a campaign
  to bash Christian pro-family conservatives. Anchor Brian Williams
  introduced the May 20 piece: "The religious right is continuing a
  political offensive it started a few years ago but there is a
  growing number of religious people who find the conservative
  agenda offensive.&quot; <p>

  Abernethy then aired Wallis's attack: &quot; His biggest problem with
  the Christian Coalition is its programs towards the poor. Wallis
  is a founder of Sojourners Religious Community which believes
  Christianity requires ministry to the poor.&quot;  Then Abernethy posed
  the question, &quot; And when Christians identify with the rich and
  powerful?&quot;  Wallis replied, &quot; I don't want to overstate this but I
  think that's a heresy. &quot;   Abernethy left out the far-left agenda of
  Sojourners, the magazine that Wallis edited; nor did he mention
  that Wallis was once quoted as saying he hoped &quot; more Christians
  will view the world through Marxist eyes.&quot;  Network coverage
  suggested the &quot; stealth&quot;  political tactics of the religious are
  newsworthy only if they are coming from the right. <p>

<h2>IV. RECOMMENDATIONS AND FOLLOW-UP</h2>

Network coverage of religion and religious issues would improve
considerably if reporters, producers, and anchors would work
harder on the following items:<p>
<ol>
<li> Devote more resources and air time to covering religion news.
The networks have no excuse to keep religion news in a
one-percent ghetto. The role of religion in the larger society,
from private philanthropy to political struggles like Henry
Foster's Surgeon General nomination, were eminently newsworthy
and attention-grabbing in 1995, and yet the networks continue to
slight religion as a major motivating force in Americans' private
and public lives.<p> 

<li> When covering religion, try harder to present religious issues
in a fair-minded, objective way. Network reporters are veterans
at the top of their field. Surely, they cannot protest they don't
know how to present both sides of a story, and they cannot
protest that stories attacking traditional religious "dogma"
without an opposing view is objective journalism. Reporters
should balance the Pope with his critics, but you can't balance a
story with 25 soundbites of critics and no defenders.<p>

<li> Present the social positions of religious figures fairly and
without contempt. The networks continue to label traditional
religious positions on social issues as &quot; extreme&quot;  or &quot; hard
right.&quot;  Is that label accurate for many Catholic clergymen who
are opposed to abortion, but also opposed to capital punishment
and current welfare reform proposals? Ideological identification
is useful to viewers, but current practices serve more to
stigmatize and caricature religious figures. More nuance and
balance is essential.<p>

Reporters also signal their contempt by underlining their opinion
that traditional religious stands are unpopular. An earlier Media
Research Center study of print and network abortion coverage from
July 1994 through June 1995 found that 48 stories suggested
abortion would damage Republican chances for election, while only
one story suggested it would help. But how does that jibe with
the fact that not one pro-life incumbent lost in the 1994
elections? <p>

<li> Hire a religion reporter, and reporters who are religious. ABC
hired Peggy Wehmeyer early in 1994, and she remains the only
explicitly assigned religion reporter at the networks. Wehmeyer
reported 11 stories in ABC's significantly longer &quot; American
Agenda&quot;  format in 1995, the same number as 1994. Wehmeyer was
outnumbered by full-time general assignment reporter Bill
Blakemore, who often covered the Pope for ABC. Time religion
writer Richard Ostling logged six stories for PBS. NBC's Bob
Abernethy continued as a semi-retired &quot; contributing correspondent
on religion.&quot;  CNN and CBS have yet to hire a regular religion
correspondent. The hostile, even partisan tone of some program
content suggests no effort to increase people of faith in the
newsroom. The strong dedication national journalism organizations
publicly declare toward diversity in the newsroom is still
unextended to people of faith.<p>
</ol>
Some recommendations from past MRC studies have led to better
reporting. In 1993, 25 network news stories focused on
unsubstantiated charges of sexual abuse made against Joseph
Cardinal Bernardin. Like 1994, the networks did refrain from
sensationalism in covering serious charges of clerical sexual
abuse. We also recommended that religion news not follow the
formula that `good news is no news.' <p>

On this front, the networks continue to show improvement: Network
reporters did show viewers some examples of the good news that
religion brings to America. On the November 7 World News Tonight,
ABC's Peter Jennings made a startling discovery: &quot; In Texas, there
is a faith-based program which has been remarkably effective in
dealing with alcohol and drug addiction. It does not cost the
taxpayers a cent." Peggy Wehmeyer reported: &quot; A recent University
of Tennessee study showed that 70 percent of Teen Challenge
[program] graduates were drug-free after six months,&quot;  compared
with a state-funded rehabilitation specialist's suggestion that a
25 percent rate would be &quot; very good.&quot;  Acknowledgments that
religion can lead to a better society, in both large systemic
strokes and much smaller personal revelations, might serve as a
comforting respite from the &quot; hell in a handbasket&quot;  tone so many
Americans associate with the network news.</i></b>

</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>


	WASHINGTON, MARCH 29, 1996</B> -- Congress approval today of legislation 
scrapping Depression-era crop programs that make U.S. farmers dependent on government and 
cost taxpayers billions of dollars was immediately praised as a &QUOT;dramatic and welcome&QUOT; step in 
the right direction.<P>
	&QUOT;For the first time in more than six decades, farmers will grow for the market, not for the 
government,&QUOT; said <a href="/heritage/staff/fryden.htm">John Frydenlund</a>, director of the Heritage Foundations Agriculture Policy 
Project and one of the architects of the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/ib221.html">reform plan</a>. &QUOT;Consumers win with more competitive 
prices, taxpayers win with lower government spending on subsidies, and farmers win with the 
freedom to grow for the rapidly expanding world market.&QUOT;<P>
	The legislation, while it doesnt go as far as Frydenlund had recommended, will replace 
open-ended subsidies for crops such as corn, wheat, cotton and rice with a system of &QUOT;transition 
payments&QUOT; -- guaranteed payments that decline and eventually cease by the year 2002.<P>
	When Frydenlund first proposed the elimination of agriculture subsidy programs in an 
April 1995 Heritage Foundation study, &QUOT;Freeing Americas Farmers,&QUOT; few in Washington gave 
his recommendations much chance of passage. Yet the House-Senate conference report on 
agriculture, which is expected to be signed into law by President Clinton, pushes policy 
dramatically in the same direction -- eliminating government programs that rob American 
consumers and taxpayers of billions of dollars and deny farmers the ability to profit from the 
explosive growth in the global demand for food.<P>
	Frydenlund says that although the farm bill failed to reform the costly sugar and peanut 
programs, &QUOT;it is a dramatic and welcome departure from 60 years of command-and-control 
agriculture policy.&QUOT;<P>
	The reform plan proposed by Frydenlund, had it been adopted in its entirety, would have 
phased out all crop subsidies and support payments over five years and, according to a detailed 
computer analysis, would have added $35 billion to the economy of rural America over that same 
period of time.<P>

<hr><h2>HOUSE HEALTH-CARE REFORM PLAN BETTER THAN KASSEBAUM-KENNEDY PLAN
</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br>
<p>

	WASHINGTON, MARCH 27, 1996</b> -- A health-care <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/bgup271.html">reform bill</a> scheduled for a 
vote in the House of Representatives this Thursday would go a long way toward solving the 
problems of availability, portability and affordability of health insurance, more so than the 
Senate measure sponsored by Sens. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., 
a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.<p>
	&quot;Anxiety about todays health-insurance coverage stems from the fact that coverage is 
tied to the workplace,&quot; says Health Care Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/liu.htm">John Liu</a>. &quot;Workers and dependents are covered 
by an employer-based health-insurance policy only as long as they remain with the same 
employer. If a worker loses his job, he gets no tax break if he buys individual coverage, and if he 
takes another job, he may encounter difficulties getting new coverage if he has a pre-existing 
medical condition.&quot;<p> 
	The Senate bill tries to address these problems, Liu says, but it fails to treat the problems 
at their source: the fact that health insurance -- unlike other types of insurance -- is owned by 
employers, rather than individual workers. This anomaly, he notes, is encouraged by the tax 
code.<p>
	Sponsored by eight House members, the Health Coverage and Affordability Act would 
enable Americans to keep their health insurance when they change or lose their jobs, allow 
individuals to purchase health insurance outside of the workplace, and allow self-employed 
individuals to deduct 50 percent (up from the current 30 percent) of the amount paid for health 
insurance for themselves and their dependents. The House legislation is being coordinated by 
Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.<p>
	Effective health-care reform, Liu says, would offer the following:<br>
<ul>
	<li> Group-to-Group portability/tax equity. The best way to achieve portability, Liu says, is 
to give Americans the ability to purchase health insurance independent of their employers, and 
still receive the tax breaks they get for employer-based insurance. This would benefit most of 
todays uninsured, especially the self-employed and those working at small firms that are  unable 
to provide health insurance, the Heritage analyst says.<p>
	<li> Limits on exclusions for pre-existing medical conditions for those who lose employer-
based coverage. Liu says Kassebaum-Kennedys guaranteed availability and renewability of 
health insurance is &quot;a welcome and long-overdue improvement in todays health insurance 
market.&quot; The House proposal would similarly limit the ability of insurance carriers to impose 
eligibility or enrollment requirements based on health status, medical condition, claims 
experience or medical history.<p>
	<li> Group-purchasing arrangements to allow small employers and associations to pool their 
purchasing power and get reasonably priced coverage. Kassebaum-Kennedy attempts -- through 
creation of so-called Health Plan Purchasing Cooperatives (HPPCs) -- to make insurance more 
affordable for small employers and the self-employed. But, Liu says, because HPPCs would 
receive more favorable treatment from certain state laws than other types of plans, they would 
have an unfair advantage. &quot;Instead of creating an uneven playing field, Congress should ensure 
that all health plans, whether issued through a HPPC or not, are treated equally,&quot; Liu says.<p>
</ul>
	&quot;To achieve true health-insurance reform, Kassebaum-Kennedy must incorporate key 
proposals from the Health Coverage Availability and Affordability Act now making its way 
through the House. Only then can Congress give working Americans what they want from 
health-insurance reform: true portability and more choice through the purchase of  individual 
policies that provide long-term protection against catastrophic illness. If Americans are allowed 
to comparison shop among a variety of health plans, costs can be controlled,&quot; Liu says.<p>

<h2>U.S. SHOULD OPPOSE CHINA'S EFFORTS TO DELAY<BR>
GLOBAL FREE TRADE WITH TAIWAN, ANALYST SAYS<BR></center></h2><p>

 
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br><p>
WASHINGTON, MARCH 22, 1996</b> -- In addition to threatening Taiwan militarily, the Peoples Republic of China is trying to prevent the island nation from gaining entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO) before China itself does -- a move the United States <a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/ascbg140.html">should oppose</a>, says an Asia analyst at The Heritage Foundation.
<p>	One of Americas largest trading partners, Taiwan is taking steps to meet the economic requirements for entry into the WTO, the organization that sets the rules for international free trade, says Heritage Asian Trade and Economics Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/oquinn.htm">Robert OQuinn</a>. These include lifting all import bans and slashing tariffs on foreign goods, which would boost trade between Taiwan and other countries, including the United States. 
<p>
	But theres a problem. &quot;The most significant obstacle to Taiwans membership in the 
WTO is not economic, it is political,&quot; OQuinn says. &quot;China insists that Taiwan should not join 
the WTO before China does.&quot; This is true even though Taiwans economy is more advanced than 
Chinas. For China, however, the chief concern is that the world recognize its status as a global 
economic power and its primacy over Taiwan, something it feels is threatened if Taiwan gains 
entry to the WTO first.<p>
	Although the United States cannot unilaterally set the terms for WTO admittance, it 
should &quot;be prepared to exercise international leadership to support Taiwans membership, even 
in the face of Chinas determined opposition,&quot; OQuinn says. In addition, the United States 
should work closely with the European Union and Japan -- the other key players in the trade 
organization -- to build a consensus within the WTO for admitting China only on &quot;commercially 
viable&quot; terms, not for political reasons.<p> 
	Unfortunately, OQuinn says, the Clinton administration seems willing to bow to Chinas 
demands, a position at odds with U.S. economic goals. &quot;As the worlds largest exporter, the 
United States has an interest in seeing that arbitrary political criteria are not applied to WTO 
applicants,&quot; he says. &quot;Any state or territory willing and able to meet the WTOs economic 
criteria should be free to join.&quot;<p>
	This is not to say the administration shouldnt look for ways to let both countries join the 
WTO at the same time, which would &quot;be the best outcome for all parties,&quot; OQuinn says. But 
that may not be possible. China -- with its high tariffs, strict import controls, and anti-
competitive industrial policy -- must do much more to reform its economy than Taiwan before it 
can qualify for entry.<p>  
	OQuinn says there is a way the Clinton administration might get China not only to speed 
up its economic reforms, but to drop its opposition to Taiwan-first WTO entry: Offer China 
permanent &quot;most-favored nation&quot; (MFN) trading status. This is something China values highly, 
so much so that it might be willing to make concessions. OQuinn says the administration should 
ask Congress for the authority to exempt China from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, the 1975 
law that requires Chinas MFN status to be renewed every year.<p>
	In the meantime, OQuinn says, the administration should continue to insist that Taiwans 
entry into the WTO not be held hostage to Chinas demands. &quot;Taiwan should join the WTO 
when it is ready,&quot; he says, &quot;not when Beijing says it can.&quot;<p>

<h2>GOVERNORS' WELFARE REFORM PLAN FAILS<BR>
TO TACKLE ILLEGITIMACY, ANALYST SAYS<BR></center></h2><p>

 
<b>For Immediate Release<br>

NGA Plan a Poor Model<br>
For Upcoming Legislation<br><p>
WASHINGTON, MARCH 19, 1995</b>  -- The welfare reform plan developed by the nations governors for use  as a reform model on Capitol Hill completely ignores illegitimacy -- the No. 1 problem experts have identified as perpetuating the welfare culture, a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/bg1075.html">Heritage Foundation</a> analyst said today.

<p>
According to<a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm"> Robert Rector</a>, senior analyst for welfare and family issues, &QUOT;Illegitimacy and 
family collapse are the keys that open the door not only to perpetual welfare dependency, but to a host 
of other problems such as crime, poverty, drug abuse and school failure. Yet the National Governors 
Association (NGA) not only has abandoned the goal of reducing illegitimacy, it has devised a plan that 
would  provide even more government-funded support services to an expanding population of single 
mothers.&QUOT;<P>
	Thus, the NGA plan, &QUOT;sets the stage for an unavoidable and explosive rise in welfare and social 
service spending in the future,&QUOT; Rector says. A combined welfare-Medicaid reform package is expected 
to be introduced in Congress this month and taken up by the House and Senate in May. Rector says 
Congress would do well to &QUOT;just say no to the welfare reform plan offered by the NGA and pass instead 
legislation that makes reducing illegitimacy, encouraging marriage, and requiring work top priorities.&QUOT;<P>
	&QUOT;By refusing to acknowledge or even mention the collapse of marriage, the governors are 
implicitly condoning and (through inaction) ultimately promoting the skyrocketing rise in illegitimacy. 
They are embarked on a path which will lead, in the near future, to half of all children being born out 
of wedlock and raised in government-supported day care centers,&QUOT; Rector warns. &QUOT;This is not reform; it 
is a national disaster.&QUOT;<P> 
	Rector points out that nearly a third of all children born in America last year were born out of 
wedlock. Within the black community, the out-of-wedlock birth rate is now 69 percent. The 
illegitimate birth rate among whites is nearly 25 percent, almost equaling the black rate in the 1960s 
when policy-makers -- notably Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., -- warned of the consequences 
associated with the erosion of marriages in black families. <P>
	Rector says children born out of wedlock are seven times more likely to be poor than are those 
born to couples who stay married. Girls raised in single-parent homes on welfare are five times more 
likely to give birth out of wedlock themselves when compared to girls from intact families not on 
welfare. Often, they repeat the mothers pattern of having a child and applying for welfare, thus 
continuing the generational cycle of dependence. A poor boy from a single-parent home in the inner 
city is twice as likely to engage in crime compared to a similar boy living with both parents.<P>
	Not only does the NGA plan fail to address illegitimacy, it also guts the work requirements 
from the last House-Senate conference bill, according to Rector.<P>  
	&QUOT;There are so many loopholes in the NGA plan that no welfare recipients would be required to 
work,&QUOT; he says.  Just one example: Up to 20 percent of recipients counted as working can be enrolled in 
vocational education, a remedy that has proved ineffective in the past.<P>
	&QUOT;Just as it did in 1988, the NGA is offering cosmetic welfare reform,&QUOT; Rector says. &QUOT;The public 
was told that welfare would be replaced by work. Then, as now, the NGA opposed real work 
requirements. As a consequence, welfare reform resulted in an explosion of day care funding, and 
welfare caseloads grew by some 30 percent. Now, it looks like history is about to repeat itself.&QUOT;<P>

<p>

        WASHINGTON, MARCH 14, 1996</b> --  A Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi90.html">analysis</a> of the 17-
percent flat-tax plan sponsored by House Majority Leader Richard Armey, R-Texas, and Sen. 
Richard Shelby, R-Ala., shows &quot;no increase in the taxes paid by the vast majority of middle-class 
Americans when compared with their current tax burden.&quot;<p>
	In fact, on average, a 17 percent flat tax would lower taxes on all income groups, 
according to the report by William Beach, visiting fellow in tax analysis, and Daniel Mitchell, 
McKenna senior fellow in political economy.<p>
	A <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi90t1.gif">table</a> provided by the Heritage analysts, based on IRS income-tax files for 1991, shows 
that under a 17 percent flat tax, households with less than $15,000 per year in taxable income 
will experience a nearly 50 percent drop in their tax burden. In fact, &quot;About 24 million families 
who pay federal income taxes now will pay no federal income taxes under the fully implemented 
Armey-Shelby flat tax,&quot; the analysts say, &quot;and nearly everyone else below $30,000 in taxable 
income will see their taxes fall.&quot;<p>
	For example, households whose taxable income ranges between $15,000 to $30,000 per 
year would see nearly a 36 percent drop in federal taxes. Those in the $30,000 to $50,000 range 
would pay almost 16 percent less; and those in the $50,000 to $75,000 taxable-income range 
would pay almost 12 percent less.<p>
	Will lower taxes mean higher deficits for the federal government? Not according to the 
Heritage analysts, who say the loss in individual income tax revenue under the Armey-Shelby 
plan will be offset by increased revenue from middle-sized and big businesses. &quot;Corporate 
income taxes increase under an Armey-Shelby flat tax,&quot; the Heritage analysts point out. &quot;This 
largely offsets decreases in individual income tax payments during the two years it will take to 
implement this tax reform. Taxes from individuals will fall by $51 billion, while taxes from 
corporations will rise by $52 billion.&quot; <p>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>


                        WASHINGTON, MARCH 13, 1996</b> -- Hailed as a bold move to roll back big 
government by returning power to the states, the Medicaid-reform plan touted by the nations 
governors actually preserves some of the worst elements of the program and creates a costly new 
state entitlement to federal money, according to a new Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/fyi89.html">analysis</a>.<P>
	Unless changes are made to the plan, which forms the basis of legislation being crafted by 
the congressional leadership, it &QUOT;will be a disaster rather than a reform,&QUOT; says Heritage Health Care Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/liu.htm">John Liu</a>. To prevent this outcome, he says, Congress should limit the 
categories of Americans guaranteed coverage under Medicaid and cancel the open-ended state 
entitlement to federal money.<P>
	According to Liu, the governors plan claims to scrap the Medicaid entitlement in favor 
of a system of block grants (or cash payments) to the states, yet preserves a long list of benefits 
that must be provided to a large, entitled population.  In fact, of the 33 million Americans on 
Medicaid in 1993, fully 71 percent would still be guaranteed benefits under the governors plan.<P>
&QUOT;The governors plan is not an elimination, nor even a significant scaling back, of the current and 
costly entitlement feature of Medicaid,&QUOT; Liu says.<P>
	Since the governors decision to guarantee Medicaid coverage to so many people will 
impose heavy burdens on state budgets, Liu says, they also included an &QUOT;umbrella insurance&QUOT; 
provision that entitles states to federal money.  If states experience an unanticipated rise in the 
number of people eligible for Medicaid, the federal government would bear the cost, which 
almost certainly would increase the federal deficit.  &QUOT;The states have figured out a way to write 
blank checks on the federal treasury,&QUOT; Liu says.  This is hard to justify, he says, when the federal 
share of Medicaid costs is projected to reach $100 billion this fiscal year.<P>
	If Medicaid reform is to go beyond merely cosmetic changes, Liu says, Congress must fix 
these problems. First, lawmakers should sharply limit who is entitled to what under Medicaid, 
focusing benefits on the truly needy such as the homeless and mentally ill.  Second, Congress 
should turn the state entitlement to &QUOT;umbrella insurance&QUOT; into an annual appropriation with a 
fixed amount of money. This would give states needed protection from sudden increases in the 
Medicaid population, but not an open pipeline to the federal treasury.<P>
	&QUOT;If Congress is to enact a federal balanced budget over the next seven years, then 
Medicaid ... will require more, not less, fiscal discipline,&QUOT; Liu says.  Without changes, he says, 
the governors Medicaid reform plan &QUOT;should be unacceptable to lawmakers seeking a reform of 
the open-ended entitlement status of todays program.&QUOT;  <P>

<h2>"TEAM B" ADVISES CONGRESS: WITHDRAW FROM ABM, BUILD MISSILE DEFENSES<br>
</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>

Administration &QUOT;More Interested In Defending<BR> 
ABM Treaty Than Defending America&QUOT;<p>
WASHINGTON, MARCH 12, 1996</b> -- The United States should withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty and adopt a plan for defending America from ballistic missile attack by building effective sea-based and space-based defenses, the Heritage Foundations "Team B" missile defense study team <a href="/heritage/library/categories/natsec/bg1074.html">said today</a>.<p>

	Top priority, the study panel said, should be given to expanding the Navys Aegis air-
defense system with a missile-defense component able to protect wide areas of the United States 
and other countries from incoming ballistic missiles by the year 1999. Ultimately, America 
should aim for cooperation among allied nations in building the kind of international anti-
ballistic missile system called for by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher this 
weekend, the panel said.<P>
	Leading Republicans in the House and Senate are expected to introduce missile-defense 
legislation on Thursday of this week, and both houses of Congress will hold hearings shortly 
thereafter, extending into April.<P> 
	The Heritage Foundation panel, led by former Strategic Defense Initiative Organization 
Director Amb. Henry Cooper, says in its report that Congress needs to face up to the fact that the 
Clinton administration has no intention of defending Americans against the threat of ballistic 
missile attack. In short, the administration considers the 1972 ABM Treaty more important than 
missile defenses -- a conclusion with which the panel sharply disagrees.<P>

ABM Treaty or ABM/TMD Treaty?<p>
	The Team B consensus is that no long-term, effective defense of the American people 
against ballistic missiles can be built within the constraints of the ABM Treaty. &QUOT; The ABM 
Treaty is stifling the development of todays most capable and effective defense systems and 
perpetuating the vulnerability of the American people and their troops, bases and allies 
overseas,&QUOT; Team B says. &QUOT;Continuing to appease the Russians in ABM Treaty negotiations 
delays U.S. efforts to build needed defenses, and may permanently impair American interests.&quot;<p> 
	&quot;The time has come for the United States to exercise its right under Article XV of the 
ABM Treaty to give six months notice to Russia, withdraw from the ABM Treaty, and build the 
needed defenses,&quot; the blue-ribbon panel says in the 1996 edition of &quot;Defending America: Ending 
Americas Vulnerability To Ballistic Missiles.&quot; <p>
	Yet, the Clinton administration not only exhibits &quot;a slavish adherence&quot; to a treaty signed 
with the now defunct Soviet Union, it even appears committed to expanding the treatys reach so 
it prevents the building of theater missile defenses (TMD). The administration reportedly has 
accepted the Russian demand to limit the performance of the most promising theater missile 
defenses. It has even &quot;dumbed down&quot; the capabilities of theater defense systems rather than 
make them as capable as available technology will permit<p>. 
	In short, &quot;if the administration has its way, no highly effective theater defense will be 
built. The administration has shown clearly that it prefers defending the Treaty to defending 
Americans,&qupt; Team B concludes.<p>
Administration Obfuscation<p>	
	&quot;The administrations actions over the past year, characterized chiefly by the presidents 
veto of the fiscal 1996 defense authorization bill, demonstrate that the American people cannot 
depend on the executive branch to fulfill its chief constitutional duty -- to provide for the 
common defense -- even though the missile threat continues to grow,&quot; the Team B report says.<p>
	&quot;While publicly claiming it is vigorously pursuing missile defenses, the administration
has quietly canceled or sharply curtailed development of the most effective, least expensive 
missile defense programs, while supporting more expensive, less effective ones and extending 
their development time, thereby increasing costs,&quot; Team B says. &quot;It has become regrettably clear 
that the Clinton administration cannot be relied upon to carry out its own stated policy.&quot;    <p>
The Threat<p>
	The United States still has no defense whatsoever against intercontinental ballistic 
missiles (ICBMs). &quot;Contrary to what most Americans believe,&quot; the Team B analysts say, &quot;if  an 
ICBM were launched at the United States today -- by accident or design -- there is not a single 
thing the U.S. military could do to stop the warhead or multiple warheads from reaching their 
targets and killing hundreds of thousands, possible millions, of Americans.&quot;<p>
	The Clinton administration argues that there is no ballistic missile threat to the American 
homeland and that there will be sufficient warning to build needed defenses before such a threat 
develops. &quot;Yet, American cities can be destroyed today by Russian and Chinese missiles,&quot; Team 
B points out. &quot;A Chinese official recently threatened to destroy Los Angeles if the United States 
interfered with Chinas feud with Taiwan. North Koreas nuclear and missile programs recently 
prompted the commander of U.S. forces in South Korea to request that theater missile defense 
development be expedited. Also, U.N. inspectors fear that an Iraqi missile program exposed last 
year is more extensive than previously thought and could enable Saddam Hussein to fire 
chemical, biological or nuclear weapons at targets up to 2,000 miles away. Rogue states could 
threaten U.S. cities with long-range missile attack in three to five years -- sooner if they chose to 
accelerate their development plans,&quot; Team B analysts say. <p>
What Congress Should Do?<p>
	Team B says &quot;America should indicate clearly to the Russians that the United States 
intends to provide effective wide-area defenses for the American people and their overseas troops 
and allies -- and that it would prefer to do so with Russias agreement.&quot; However, if Russia 
refuses to cooperate, &quot;Congress should use all available powers and prerogatives to move 
America toward withdrawal from the ABM Treaty after giving six months notice, which it has a 
right to do under Article XV,&quot; say the Team B analysts. <p>
	Then, Congress should &quot;press for deployment of the least expensive, most effective near-
term defenses technically feasible. This means a de-emphasis of ground-based defenses -- since 
they can be overcome by countermeasures, are expensive, and are difficult to deploy. Highest 
priority should be assigned to expanding and converting the Navys Aegis air-defense system to 
missile defense and deploying theater defenses based on this model by the year 1999.&quot;<p> 
	&quot;For an investment of $2 billion to $3 billion, 650 defensive interceptors on 22 Aegis 
cruisers could be at sea by 2001, achieving a limited global missile-defense capability for the 
United States and for U.S. forces and allies overseas,&quot; the Team B analysts say. &quot;These highly 
mobile platforms could defend Americans in all 50 states from a limited long-range missile 
strike, as well as defend American troops and allies overseas.&quot;<p>
	In addition, the development of space-based sensors and defenses, both kinetic-energy 
interceptors and lasers, should be revived and accelerated, the Team B analysts say. &quot;With the 
necessary funding support, deployment of such systems can begin shortly after the year 2000. 
For planning purposes consistent with this objective, Team B recommends that $1.6 billion, $2.4 
billion and $3 billion, respectively, be budgeted for 1999, 2000, and 2001.&quot;<p>
	&quot;The Clinton administration continues to keep Americans vulnerable while hiding behind 
a smokescreen of positive-sounding but meaningless policy declarations,&quot; the Team B analysts 
conclude. &quot;It is clear that the Clinton administration will remain derelict in the duties required of 
the office of the commander-in-chief by failing to provide for the common defense. Congress 
must fulfill its constitutional duty to check the excesses of the executive branch. It must stop the 
improper attempts to broaden the ABM Treaty and counterbalance the executives dereliction of 
duty by pressing for the most capable and effective missile defense technology will permit.&quot;<p>

<h2>New White House Budget Contains Big Spending, Tax Increases, Study Shows</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>




                WASHINGTON, MARCH 11, 1996</b> -- Although the 1996 budget battle between 
Congress and the White House is still unresolved, President Clinton has already released a new 
1997 budget that boosts spending by $361 billion and tax revenues by $526 billion over the next 
seven years, according to a<a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1071.html"> new report</a> by The Heritage Foundation.<P>
	For every household in America, the new White House budget means $1,927 in higher 
taxes and $3,155 in higher spending over seven years, compared to the 1995 Balanced Budget 
Act that the president vetoed last fall, says Heritage budget specialist <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a>.<P>
	Moreover, the White House budget would add $119 billion more in deficits through 2002 
than Congress Balanced Budget Act, the equivalent of increasing the debt burden on the average 
household by $1,227, Hodge says.<P>
	&quot;Just weeks after telling the nation in this years State of the Union address that the era 
of big government is over, President Clinton [has] indicated that the obituary notice was 
premature,&quot; says Hodge, Heritages Grover M. Hermann fellow in federal budgetary affairs.<p>
	He says while the White House plan would, on paper, balance the budget by 2002, it can 
only do so &quot;by leaving the real work of deficit reduction to a future president and Congress.&quot;  For 
example, the budget claims to save $596 billion over the next seven years, but fully 60 percent of 
that deficit reduction is scheduled to happen after President Clinton leaves office.<p>
	Whats more, the family tax cuts in the presidents plan come in the early years, then 
screech to a halt in 2002, the deadline for a balanced budget. The result: Families depending on a 
planned $500-per-child tax credit would get hit in 2002 with a $17 billion tax increase.  Whats 
more, the president offsets the $98 billion he proposes in tax cuts with $59 billion in tax 
increases.  The resulting net tax cut of $39 billion represents just 3 cents of every $1,000 
taxpayers will send to Washington over the next seven years, Hodge says.<p>
	While tax relief under the White House budget is negligible, spending on entitlement 
programs such as Medicaid and Medicare steams ahead, increasing by $365 billion, or 50 
percent, over seven years.  All told, spending on mandatory programs under the White House 
budget would rise from 49 cents of every federal dollar today to 59 cents of every federal dollar 
in 2002. <p> 
	And although the president proposes to reduce the growth of Medicare spending by $124 
billion over seven years, thats not nearly enough to save the program from impending 
bankruptcy, Hodge says.  In fact, the news that in 1995 the Medicare Hospital Insurance program 
paid out $36 million more in benefits than it took in from payroll taxes shows the program could 
face a financial crisis even sooner than the projected bankruptcy in 2002.<p>
	The situation with Medicaid is just as bad. If nothing is done to reform the program, 
Hodge says, states probably will need to raise taxes or cut spending by $146 billion over seven 
years to pay for it. The White House response is to slow Medicaid spending increases by $59 
billion over the same period, which does little good when maintaining the programs entitlement 
status could cost states more than $47 billion.<p>
	There is, Hodge says, one area of the budget where the White House does propose real 
changes: spending for social programs is greatly expanded.  While short on details -- which are 
scheduled to be supplied in the administrations full budget due later this month -- the current 
White House budget &quot;outlines a sweeping agenda of spending initiatives in areas such as 
education, high technology, crime fighting and the environment,&quot; Hodge says. Compared to the 
Balanced Budget Act, the president proposes spending an extra $111 billion over seven years on 
discretionary programs.<p>
	Yet oddly, Hodge says, the White House also claims to &quot;save&quot; $297 billion in 
discretionary programs over seven years.  Of course, these savings are calculated by using the 
Congressional Budget Offices &quot;baseline,&quot; which assumes automatic spending increases every 
year.  Under this accounting system, simply freezing discretionary spending at 1995 levels would 
&quot;save&quot; $258 billion over seven years.  The extra $39 billion the president proposes to save? 
Hodge says 95 percent of these cuts come in 2001 and 2002, when President Clinton can no 
longer be in office.<p> 
	&quot;The administrations repeated use of gimmicks and accounting ploys ... casts doubt on 
its sincerity in negotiating a balanced budget plan with Congress,&quot; Hodge says. &quot;The Clinton 
budget is not the end of big government,  it is the embodiment of it.&quot;<p>

<title>White House Retreat on Free Trade Bodes Ill for U.S. - Heritage PR</title>

BODES ILL FOR U.S., ANALYST SAYS</h2></center>





<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>

	WASHINGTON, MARCH 6, 1996</b> -- Bowing to protectionist pressure, the White House is backing away from its commitment to free trade in the Western Hemisphere, a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/bg1070.html">policy shift</a> that could derail the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), damage relations with Mexico and discredit U.S. leadership on free trade, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.
<p>	Opponents of free trade have accused NAFTA of causing everything from the Mexican economic crisis and declining U.S. wages to increased illegal immigration and drug trafficking. The fact that the White House has allowed such charges to go unanswered shows that "free trade is no longer a high priority for the Clinton administration," says Heritage Latin America Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/sweeney.htm">John Sweeney</a>.
<p>
	On the contrary, over the past year the White House has taken steps to downgrade NAFTA, first by reneging on a promise to include Chile in NAFTA by 1996 and then by violating key provisions of the trade pact such as allowing Mexican trucks to operate in U.S. border states. 
<p>	If the Clinton administration continues to shirk its obligations under NAFTA, Sweeney says, it will establish "a negative precedent that Mexico, Canada and other countries could follow in the future." Even now, Sweeney says, political leaders throughout Latin America are questioning the administration's commitment to free trade. The possible result: "If Latin America's emerging capitalist democracies feel that U.S. leadership is weakening, they may reach out to Europe or Asia for the support that America is failing to provide," he says.
<p>	To prevent NAFTA from falling into disrepute, Sweeney says the White House must take a number of steps to strengthen the treaty. Not only should the administration respect NAFTA's provisions, it should complete the trade pact's unfinished business with Mexico, which includes forgiving Mexico's public debt and working out solutions to immigration, labor and law-enforcement problems. In addition, the White House should reverse course and speed up the process of admitting Chile to NAFTA.
<p>	Sweeney says the administration has nothing to fear from critics of NAFTA, whose charges have proven untrue. For example, the claim that NAFTA caused the Mexican economic crisis couldn't be more wrong. "The peso collapsed because the government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari sacrificed sound fiscal discipline on the altar of political expediency," he says.  "If not for NAFTA, the economic consequences of the peso's meltdown would have been far more serious."
<p>	NAFTA also remains crucial to U.S. competitiveness in the new global economy, Sweeney says. U.S. exports to Mexico since 1987 have grown at a rate two-and-a-half times faster than exports to the rest of the world. Even in 1995, when the Mexican economic crisis was at its worst, the United States still exported more to Mexico than it did before NAFTA. All told, the United States exports $98 billion worth of goods to Latin America every year -- more than half of that to Mexico -- supporting nearly 2 million U.S. jobs.
<p>	By backing away from free trade, and NAFTA, the White House is also threatening U.S. relations with Mexico, Sweeney says. NAFTA is crucial if Mexico is to emerge from its economic crisis. If that crisis continues, he says, strains in U.S.-Mexico relations are likely to grow, with conflicts over illegal immigration and drug trafficking displacing cooperation on trade and investment. Moreover, the United States has a strong interest in seeing Mexico become a stable, capitalist democracy. But "without NAFTA, [Mexican President Ernesto] Zedillo's chance of advancing political reforms would be very poor," Sweeney says.
<p>	If American relations with Mexico deteriorate through half-hearted U.S. support for NAFTA, the Clinton administration faces the risk of forfeiting America's leadership role as the champion of free trade in the Western Hemisphere, Sweeney says. In fact, the dream of creating a hemisphere-wide free-trade zone by the year 2005, ostensibly shared by the White House, could collapse.  
<p>	"The Clinton administration has lost sight of America's vital interests in the Western Hemisphere," Sweeney says. "The task for American policy-makers now is to correct the current drift in policy toward Mexico and Latin America as quickly as possible."

<html><title>Architect of Free-Market Farm Bill Assesses Congress' Reform Bill -- Heritage PR</title><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h2>News Release</h2><hr><a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
               214 Massachusetts Avenue NE<br>                     Washington, D.C. 20002<br>                              (202) 546-4400<br><hr><h2> ARCHITECT OF FREE-MARKET FARM PLAN
ASSESSES CONGRESS' REFORM BILL</h2>
</center>



<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<P>

	WASHINGTON, MARCH 5, 1996</b> -- A principal architect of the agriculture-reform plan moving through Congress praised the effort to replace America's Depression-era farm policy with a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/ib221.html">market-based system</a>, but said Congress' failure to eliminate the sugar and peanut programs would cost consumers billions of dollars per year in higher prices. 
<P>
	The House of Representatives last week passed the so-called Freedom to Farm Act, which incorporates many of the major structural changes proposed in the April 1995 Heritage Foundation study, "Freeing America's Farmers." The Senate passed similar legislation earlier this year.
<p>
	The legislation would end government programs that manipulate the production and prices of major crops through quotas and planting restrictions. Most dramatically, farm subsidies would be replaced by steadily decreasing "market-transition" payments that would end after seven years.  The House and Senate are expected to iron out differences between the two bills in conference this week.
<p>	"For the first time in more than six decades, farmers will grow for the market, not for the government," said <a href="/heritage/staff/fryden.htm">John Frydenlund</a>, director of Heritage's Agriculture Policy Project.  "Consumers win with more competitive prices, taxpayers win with lower government spending on subsidies, and farmers win with the freedom to grow for the rapidly expanding world market."
<p>	Published in advance of last year's congressional debate over reauthorizing America's farm programs, the Heritage farm policy blueprint also called for the elimination of the Farmer-Owned Reserve -- a surplus cache of crops the government uses to hold down commodity prices artificially by flooding the market.  This recommendation also was adopted by both the House and Senate.
<P>	While the farm bills mark a dramatic, and welcome, departure from command-and-control agriculture policy, Frydenlund says Congress should have adopted other elements of the Heritage plan as well. The failure to eliminate the sugar and peanut programs is one glaring omission, he says, as is leaving intact a component of the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/em448.html">dairy program</a> that will force Americans to pay above-market prices for milk. "A truly free-market approach to farm policy would have ended these programs," he says.
<P>	Frydenlund also says Congress should have done more to reform the Conservation Reserve Program, an environmental program that too often pays farmers to take productive land out of use. "The least Congress should do is let farmers remove non-environmentally sensitive land from the program," he says.
<p>	Another problem: Under the new system, market-transition payments will actually cost the government more in the first few years than traditional subsidies, an outcome Frydenlund warned against in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/ib216.html">Heritage paper</a> in September of last year. At the time, he urged Congress to set a "trigger price" for commodities that, if exceeded, would cancel or reduce transition payments for a given year. This can be easily fixed, however, in the House-Senate conference, he says.
<P>	Despite these shortcomings, Frydenlund says the farm bills go further than any piece of legislation in U.S. history to create a free market for agriculture. "Outdated farm programs are robbing American consumers and taxpayers of billions of dollars a year and denying farmers the right to take advantage of explosive growth in the worldwide demand for food," he says.  "Congress has taken a huge step toward correcting these injustices."

<title>U.S. Shouldn't Rule Out Use of Force if China Attacks Taiwan - Heritage PR</title>

<b>Clinton's Weak Signals <br>
Risk Crisis In Taiwan Strait</b>

<center><h2>U.S. SHOULDN'T RULE OUT USE OF FORCE
IF CHINA ATTACKS TAIWAN, ANALYST SAYS</h2></center>
<b> For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations

<p>	WASHINGTON, MARCH 4, 1996</b> -- The Clinton administration should make clear to China that the United States will not tolerate an attack on Taiwan in response to the island nation's first-ever presidential elections March 23 -- nor should it rule out the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/asc139.html">use of force</a> in case of such an attack, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.
<p>	According to <a href="/heritage/staff/fisher.htm">Richard Fisher</a>, senior analyst with Heritage's Asian Studies Center, the administration should order the U.S. Navy to hold exercises near Taiwan during the period before and after the March 23 presidential election to deter Chinese military action. Also, it should sell Taiwan defensive weapons in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act, including advanced air-to-air missiles, conventional submarines, and missile-defense systems.
<p>	"By failing to assure China's leaders of U.S. intentions in the event of a Chinese military attack against Taiwan, the Clinton administration is risking a clash that could do incalculable damage to Taiwan, U.S.-China relations and U.S. leadership in Asia," Fisher warns.
<p>	President Clinton therefore must take "strong but measured steps" to convey to Beijing America's clear interest in maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait. Fisher says that in addition to warning China that U.S. force is an option, and deploying the U.S. Navy to deter Chinese military action, the Clinton administration should:
<p><ul>
<li>	 In compliance with the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, inform Chinese leaders that America will regard any attack on Taiwan as "a threat to peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States";<p>
<li> Tell China it may face economic sanctions, ranging from removal of most-favored-nation trade status to a full U.S. economic embargo;<p>
<li> Maintain the balance of power in Asia by deploying missile defenses to protect U.S. forces stationed there, thus offsetting China's demonstrated willingness to use nuclear-capable missiles to intimidate Taiwan; and<p>
<li> Recognize Taiwan's democratic reforms and urge China and the Republic of China (ROC) to resolve their differences peacefully.
</ul><p>
	Ever since ROC President Lee Teng-hui's private visit to the United States on June 7-10, 1995, China has been militarily intimidating Taiwan and its emerging democratic system. Large-scale shows of force preceded Taiwan's legislative elections last December, and even larger maneuvers are underway as the presidential election approaches. "China fears the emergence of Taiwan as a model for political reform on the mainland, and continues to reserve the right to use military force against Taiwan should it declare independence," Fisher points out.
<p>	Fisher says President Clinton's failure to respond adequately to recent Chinese saber-rattling in the South China Sea and against Taiwan "fosters an impression of American weakness, and lends encouragement to Chinese hard-liners." He adds that "Several statements by Clinton administration officials to the effect that the United States will not defend Taiwan if it is attacked are potentially even more destabilizing."
<p>	"At stake is not only peace and security in the region, but the viability of democracy on Taiwan. Also, with a population of 21 million and trade with the United States totaling $47 billion per year, the ROC is the seventh-largest U.S. trading partner, right behind China itself," Fisher says.
<p>	"The United States cannot afford to let the situation in the Taiwan Strait deteriorate further without grave consequences for U.S. stature in Asia," he says. "The Clinton administration must make clear the United States will not tolerate an attack on Taiwan."

<P>
	WASHINGTON, MARCH 1, 1996</b> -- Congress should identify and eliminate a host of government programs that special-interest groups use to fund lobbying and political activities many taxpayers would not willingly support, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.
<P>	 According to <a href="/heritage/staff/griffin.html">Charles Griffin</a>, deputy director of Heritage's Government  Reform Project, Congress' 1995 effort to stop what he calls "taxpayer-funded political slush funds" fell far short of what is needed to solve the problem. "Not only are many political lobbying groups still able to draw billions of taxpayer dollars into their coffers," Griffin says, "such groups also tend to be the strongest supporters of bigger government, more spending, and increased regulation -- which guarantee them continued funding."
<p>	Griffin identifies the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/bg1069.html">top 10 government programs</a> that give taxpayer-funded grants to hundreds of special interests, which then use the money for political purposes. For example, by law, participants in AmeriCorps, President's Clinton's national service program, are barred from engaging in partisan political activities. Yet, in one reported instance, a nonprofit group, the Cole Coalition in Cole, Colo., used AmeriCorps volunteers to draft campaign fliers attacking a local politician and distribute them door-to-door. "We realized there was something politically partisan," said 21-year-old volunteer Joseph Taylor. "Although the Cole Coalition was stripped of its funding," Griffin says, "the AmeriCorps program lives on -- as does the potential for abuse." 
<p>	Another major violator, the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) -- funded at $400 million per year -- was originally established to provide legal services to the poor in civil and non-criminal matters. Griffin says the LSC uses its budget to funnel federal taxpayer dollars to 323 private groups around the country that use the money to fight legal battles having clear political objectives. "Through litigation, advocacy and lobbying, the LSC has helped to generate hundreds of billions of dollars in increased local, state and federal welfare spending and the addition of hundreds of millions of people to the welfare rolls," Griffin says. 
<p>	For example, LSC grantees have sued governments at all levels to stop welfare reform and have worked to prevent the eviction of drug dealers from public housing. "It's not that people don't have a right to engage in such activities," Griffin adds. "It's that they shouldn't be allowed to do so with the taxpayers' money."
<p>	 A third example from the top 10 list, the Department of Health and Human Services' Discretionary Aging Projects, is funded at $26 million per year. While the stated purpose of the project is to provide trained personnel and programs that improve the quality of life for the elderly, Griffin says the money in the program is often used to underwrite the activities of senior-oriented special-interest groups. 
<p>	"The National Council of Senior Citizens receives 96 percent of its budget from federal funds and is one of many such groups that promote government interventionism," Griffin says.  Other grantees benefiting from the program in 1994 included groups that actively opposed Medicare reform, such as the American Association of Retired Persons, Families USA, and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.
<p>	Griffin says funneling millions of dollars in public subsidies to special interests to subsidize their political advocacy qualifies as a significant abuse of the public's money and the public trust. 
<p>	"If the situation were reversed and millions of taxpayer dollars were going to conservative activist groups, the response would be sheer outrage. Political orientation aside, Congress needs to put an end to this egregious abuse of taxpayer dollars," Griffin says.

TOUGHER RESPONSE TO CUBA</h2>

<p>


	WASHINGTON, FEB. 29, 1996</b> -- Calling economic sanctions against Cuba an insufficient response to the island nation's downing of two U.S. civilian aircraft, a Heritage Foundation analyst today outlined a series of <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/fyi88.html">tough measures</a> the United States should take to further isolate Fidel Castro.
<p>
	"In addition to tightening economic sanctions against Cuba, the U.S. government should make it clear to Castro that any further violations of international law or unprovoked military attacks against American citizens will be countered with appropriate and decisive force," Heritage Latin American Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/sweeney.htm">John Sweeney</a> says in a new paper.
<p>	Specifically, Sweeney says the U.S. government should:
<p><ul>
	<li> Warn Cuba that the United States will enforce international law in the region.  Any attacks by Cuba against civilian aircraft or boats outside the 12-mile territorial limit established by international law should be met with a "prompt, immediate and proportional response by America's armed forces," he says.  U.S. warplanes should patrol the waters between Florida and Cuba to enable a rapid response.
<p>
<li> Ban the flow of all cash from the United States to Cuba, which props up the Castro regime with more than $500 million a year in hard currency.
	<p><li> Prohibit all visits to Cuba by U.S. citizens -- including journalists, academics and business people -- and ban travel to the United States by all Cubans until the Castro regime extends the same travel privileges to opposition leaders as it does to communist officials.
<P><li> Impose strict controls over the activities and movements of Cuban officials in the United States.  The Castro regime bans democratic and human rights groups from meeting freely in Cuba; the U.S. government should deny Cuban officials those same freedoms in the United States, expelling all violators.
<p><li>Warn Castro that the United States will view any attempt to spark a new refugee crisis as a hostile act against the national security of the United States.
<p><li> Use Radio Marti to inform Cubans that U.S. actions are aimed at Castro, not at them, to counter Castro's anti-American propaganda.
<p><li> Publicly oppose the activation in Cuba of a nuclear reactor based on an unsafe East German design, which would present a security threat to the Southeast United States.

<h2>AS BIG GOVERNMENT WITHERS, LEADING
THINKERS PONDER A REPLACEMENT</h2>
</center>




<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>


	WASHINGTON, FEB. 12, 1996</b> --  If the era of big government is over, as 
President Clinton proclaims, what will replace it? 
<p>
	Lots of things. In the <a href="/heritage/p_review/mar96/toc.html">latest issue</a> of 
<I>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</I>, 20 prominent thinkers and 
reformers describe private institutions they would like to see emerge over the next two decades 
to rebuild American community and culture in the wake of the welfare state. 
<p>	<a href="/heritage/p_review/mar96/symp.html"> Their suggestions</a> run the gamut 
from police-training programs for kids (proposed by New York City Police Commissioner 
William Bratton) to structured group homes for welfare mothers and their children (Myron 
Magnet, editor of the <I>City Journal</I>, New York City, and author of  "<I>The Dream and the 
Nightmare.</I>" Uniting the proposals is a common belief that reliance on Washington to solve 
society's problems has done more harm than good. American culture and society must be 
renewed the old-fashioned way: by private citizens working hands-on in their own communities.
<P>Not surprisingly, many of the suggestions concern improving America's government-run 
education system. Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman wants all parents to have the 
right -- and the financial ability -- to send their children to any school, public or private. William 
Galston, a former adviser to President Clinton who now teaches at the University of Maryland's 
School of Public Affairs, proposes a new funding system for charter schools, which are quasi-
public but free of much of the stifling bureaucracy that plagues the broader government school 
system.  
<p>	Two participants -- New York Lt. Gov. Elizabeth McCaughey Ross and Jim Pinkerton, 
former Bush administration official and author of "<I>What Comes Next: The End of Big 
Government - And the New Paradigm Ahead</I>" -- even proposed the same idea: a rating 
system for schools (Pinkerton envisions a <I>Consumer Reports</I> for education) that would 
empower parents with information on how money is being spent and how well students are 
performing on standardized tests.
<p>	But education reform is not enough. Bratton, for example, believes many kids need to 
learn respect for the law and law-enforcement officers. His dream of a structured police career 
path for kids -- summer "youth academies" and a police-oriented version of the Boy Scouts 
called Law Enforcement Explorers -- would give young people positive interactions with the 
police, deepen their respect for the law, and even guide some into police careers themselves.
<p>	Myron Magnet envisions group homes for welfare mothers and children where the focus 
is not on the job prospects of young women but on providing structured, caring environments for 
kids. He believes that by the time today's underclass children reach school, it's too late to give 
them the foundation in cognitive and moral skills they will need to succeed. That's what the 
group homes could do.
<p>	Higher education is ripe for some new ideas as well. Harvey Mansfield, professor of 
government at Harvard, longs for a "great books junior college" to give students the education 
they didn't receive in high school and won't receive in politically correct four-year institutions.  
And Michael Medved, chief film critic for the New York Post and author of "<I>Hollywood vs. 
America</I>," would go even further, creating an "elite" private university that would go back to 
teaching a classic liberals arts education and compete with the politically correct Ivy League 
schools. 
<p>	Other innovative ideas rounding out the list include: private science funding (perhaps by 
corporations) to reduce the scientific community's dependence on the federal government; 
private, non-profit job-training programs; effective homeless programs run by representatives 
from the religious and business communities; and even new television shows devoted to 
exposing government violations of citizens' rights and celebrating individuals who have 
overcome personal hardships.

<h2> FLAT TAX REDUCES TAX BILLS
IN EVERY STATE, STUDY SHOWS</h2></center>




<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>


	WASHINGTON, FEB. 9, 1996</b> -- Taxpayers in every state would send less of their income to Washington under a 17 percent flat tax, according to a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi86.html">new Heritage Foundation analysis</a>.
<p>	The average annual savings would range from a high of $1,856 per taxpaying household in Connecticut to a low of $318 in California, the study showed. And in 33 states, the average household would see its income-tax bill drop by more than $1,000 per year.
<p>	Nationwide, the 17 percent flat tax would reduce the average household's yearly federal tax bill by more than $1,100, a savings of 25 percent compared to the current system, said Heritage economists <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/mitchell.htm">Daniel Mitchell</a>. Taxpayers in many states would save even more. In addition to Connecticut, the top 10 include: New Jersey ($1,521), Illinois ($1,511), North Dakota ($1,506), Virginia ($1,463), Indiana ($1,415), Rhode Island ($1,406), Washington ($1,385), Michigan ($1,372) and Florida ($1,335).
<p>
	With the campaign of GOP presidential candidate Steve Forbes built around the flat tax, tax reform has already emerged as a key 1996 election issue. House Majority Leader Richard Armey,  R-Texas, and Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., both have introduced bills that would replace the current tax code with a flat rate that taxes income only once. 
<p>	Contrary to claims that a flat tax might increase the tax burden on middle-income taxpayers, Beach and Mitchell found that "a properly designed flat tax would provide much-needed tax relief" for the average filer.  
<P>	Their analysis of the impact on taxpayers under the Armey-Shelby plan found that households in every state would see their tax bills drop not only in dollar terms, but in percentage terms as well. South Dakota taxpayers would benefit the most, with an average tax decrease of 38 percent. Other states would see big drops too, including North Dakota (33 percent), Indiana (31 percent) and Florida (30 percent).  
<p>	All told, a 17 percent tax rate on individual income would decrease federal tax payments by $125 billion, with the largest savings going to individual taxpayers in New York ($10 billion), Texas ($8 billion), Illinois ($8 billion) and Florida ($8 billion).
<p>	The Heritage analysts also examined the impact on taxpayers of a flat tax rate of 20 percent. At the higher rate, they found, the average tax bill would rise in two states. In California the average increase would be $417; in Montana: $9. In the rest of the states, even a 20 percent rate would result in a tax decrease for the average taxpayer; nationwide it would yield the average household a tax cut of more than $500. 
<p>	In addition, a flat tax of 20 percent -- which is the initial rate under the Armey-Shelby plan -- would be revenue neutral, adding nothing to the deficit. According to Beach and Mitchell, reductions in individual income taxes would be offset by increases in corporate taxes (in the belief that business income should be taxed only once, at the corporate rather than individual level).
<p>	To ensure accuracy, the Heritage analysis was based on actual tax records contained in the Internal Revenue Service Public Use File for 1991, the latest year for which data are available. The Public Use File is a statistically accurate sample (155,000 returns) of all individual income-tax returns for a given year.
<p>	"The evidence shows that those who say a flat tax would make Americans pay more haven't looked at the numbers," Beach says.

<h2> NATO MUST REFOCUS OR RISK
DEMISE, ANALYST SAYS</h2></center>





<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>

	WASHINGTON, FEB. 6, 1996</b> -- The NATO security alliance that protected Europe from Soviet attack during the Cold War is veering so far from its original mission that it may not survive, according to a defense expert at The Heritage Foundation.
<P>
	In a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bg1067.html">paper</a> released today, Heritage Policy Analyst John Hillen says NATO's recent foray into "peacekeeping" in Bosnia -- a country not even part of the alliance -- is just the latest example of how NATO is losing sight of its original reason for existence: protecting Europe against domination by a hostile power or bloc of powers.
<P>
	"Who is to say whether Russia or some other country may or may not be a threat to Europe 10 or 20 years from now?" he asks. "It is not the immediacy of the threat that counts, but the depth of America's vital interest in the basic security of Europe."
<p>	To ensure NATO remains a bulwark against threats to Europe's security, Hillen recommends that Congress consider a "NATO Revitalization Act" that would do four things: explain to the American people why U.S. involvement in NATO is vital; define the U.S. role in the alliance as limited to deterring aggression; clarify when U.S. military force should be used; and call for the quick expansion of NATO to include the newly democratized Central European countries of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.	
<p>	The fact that Europe faces no immediate threat is no argument for expanding the alliance's role, Hillen says. After all, NATO is an insurance policy, designed to protect against catastrophe no matter how remote the threat might be. "It is far better to have 100,000 troops deployed peaceably now than have to commit a million troops later to fight a war," he says.
<p>	Besides, Hillen says, the United States is already involved in an organization designed to handle lower-level security tasks such as peacekeeping, and it is not NATO. The 54-member Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) monitors sanctions and leads observer missions in the former Yugoslavia and other countries. And while it is true that the OSCE has proven incompetent at dealing with problems like Bosnia, NATO nevertheless should not be thrust into missions for which it is poorly suited.
<p>	But once NATO decides to act, Hillen says, the U.S. role must be clearly defined to promote a sensible "division of labor" with America's allies. He says U.S. forces should be deployed only when they can make a unique contribution -- one no other country is able to make -- and when they can produce a decisive victory. In this way, America can ensure that its military role is limited to serving NATO's core mission of "collective defense" (protecting Europe against hostile domination) and not "collective security" (peacekeeping, nation-building and other humanitarian missions).
<p>	To drift from this core mission in search of new roles for NATO would not only create rifts between NATO members over whose troops should serve in peacekeeping operations, but would diminish support for NATO from an American public that questions why the United States should be the world's policeman.
<p>	By contrast, expanding NATO to include new democracies in Central Europe would strengthen the alliance and "bring a level of stability and security ... that the region has never enjoyed throughout its tortured history." The only obstacle to such expansion, he says, is the Clinton administration, which fears Russia opposition. 
<p>	"NATO needs to get back to basics," Hillen concludes. "In the absence of a clear and present danger to Europe it has lost its focus. ... A NATO Revitalization Act will refocus the alliance and preserve American support for the U.S. role in Europe."

<h2>U.S. PEACEKEEPING MISSION TO GOLAN
HEIGHTS ILL-CONSIDERED, ANALYSTS SAY</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<P>


	WASHINGTON, JAN. 30, 1996</b> -- The Clinton administration's plan to launch a "peacekeeping" mission to the Golan Heights once Israel and Syria reach a peace agreement would place both U.S. troops and Israel itself at considerable risk, according to a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bg1066.html">new paper</a> by foreign-policy experts at <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>. 
<p>	A U.S. presence in the strategic buffer zone between Israel and Syria would be a double-edged sword, say Heritage Deputy Director of Foreign Policy and Defense Studies Thomas Moore and Senior Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/phillips.htm">James Phillips</a>.  Not only would U.S. troops face possible attacks from terrorist groups in the area, but Israel's ability to defend itself could be diminished. 
<p>	The analysts urge Congress to hold hearings immediately on the costs and benefits of embroiling the United States in a Golan peacekeeping mission.  They say U.S. negotiators trying to broker an agreement between the two countries should not promise foreign aid to Syria as an enticement to reach peace.  And even if a deal is reached, under no circumstances should American troops participate in a peacekeeping force.  "The United States cannot afford an open-ended deployment of first echelon combat troops in support of what is essentially a diplomatic gambit," they say.  
<p>	Moore and Phillips argue U.S. troops in the Golan Heights would be prime targets for terrorist groups based in nearby Lebanon, such as Hezbollah.  Just as Syria's strongman Hafez al-Assad supported Hezbollah's terrorist campaign against U.S. peacekeeping forces in Lebanon (the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut), so too might he pursue a similar strategy in the Golan to drive U.S. troops from the area. And even if Syria cooperates in restraining terrorism, the analysts say, nothing would prevent Iran, Iraq or Libya from sponsoring terrorism against U.S. troops on their own.
<p>	In addition, a U.S. presence on the Golan would effectively halt Israel's ability to respond with force to attacks from Lebanon-based terrorists or from Syria itself.  "Ironically, the U.S. presence could prove to be more of a deterrent to Israel than to Syria," the analysts say.  Since American forces on the Golan will be inadequate to defend Israel if it is attacked, "the real rationale for the U.S. presence is not military, but political -- to reassure a nervous Israeli public about security concerns that the United States will be in no position to remedy if conflict erupts," they say.
<P>	Moore and Phillips also say a U.S. presence in a Golan peacekeeping mission is not needed.  "Other countries are willing and able to contribute neutral peacekeeping forces," they note. Peacekeepers from Austria, Canada, Finland and Poland have been stationed on the Golan Heights for over two decades to monitor compliance with the 1974 Israeli-Syrian Disengagement Agreement, making U.S. participation in any future peacekeeping force unnecessary, they say.
<p>	But if U.S. troops are dispatched to the Golan, their situation would be far more precarious than that of the U.S. peacekeepers stationed along the Egyptian-Israeli border in the Sinai Peninsula.  In the Sinai, where U.S. troops have been since 1982, a broad desert separates two sides that are allies of the United States and at peace with each other.  In the Golan, U.S. troops would be confined to a much smaller area flanked by the large armored forces of two avowed enemies.
<p>	Any peacekeeping mission to the Golan also would divert critically needed  U.S. forces, the analysts say. A credible long-term Golan peacekeeping mission would likely require three brigades, or roughly 10 percent of the U.S. Army's active duty combat strength.  That is a "prohibitively high" burden for an open-ended peacekeeping mission, one that could place the United States in jeopardy if conflict arises in Korea, the Persian Gulf or any other place where vital U.S. national interests are at stake, Moore and Phillips say.
<p>	Citing these and other concerns, the analysts say congressional hearings are imperative. They note in both Haiti and Bosnia, swift action by the Clinton administration to send troops stifled congressional debate.  This time, Congress must address the peacekeeping issue before the negotiators reach a deal, or risk receiving another "diplomatic <i>fait accompli</i>" from the White House.
<p>	"The United States should not jeopardize important national security interests by committing U.S. troops to seal an Israeli-Syrian peace agreement that is potentially fragile and cosmetic," the analysts conclude.

<h2>RELIGIOUS PRACTICE CAN BE EFFECTIVE WEAPON AGAINST AMERICA'S SOCIAL ILLS, STUDY FINDS</h2></center>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>
	WASHINGTON, JAN. 25, 1996</b> -- As Washington policy-makers struggle to find solutions to America's major social problems, they should consider the enormous contribution religion can make toward solving them, according to a Heritage Foundation analyst.
<p>	In a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/family/bg1064.html">paper</a> released today, <a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a>, an expert in family and social issues at Heritage, says nearly every major study on the impact of religion demonstrates its positive impact on a host of social problems. Religion, the majority of studies conclude, "is the resource that most powerfully addresses the major social problems confronting the nation," according to Fagan, the William H. G. FitzGerald fellow.
<p>	Fagan presents a summary of the social science literature, which reveals that religious practice strengthens the family and brings satisfaction to marriage; helps poor people move out of poverty; aids substantially in the formation of personal moral judgment; and inoculates individuals against such social problems such as suicide, drug abuse, out-of-wedlock births, crime and divorce. 
<p>	"Renowned historians and philosophers have always known that the character of a social order is, in large part, determined by its religious roots. Social science cannot prove that religion, or religion in any varying expressions, is true. But the professional literature of the modern social sciences has shown religious practice to have positive social consequences," Fagan says.
<p>	He cites "Middletown," a classic sociological research project that studied the lives of inhabitants of a typical American town, first in the 1920s and then again in the 1980s. The study  found that "church-going members were more likely to be married, remain married, and to be highly satisfied with their marriages." 
<p>	Another important study of strong families, conducted in the 1970s and 1980s by a pair of University of Nebraska professors, found that "84 percent of these families identified religion as an important contributor to the strength of their families." The same study also indicated that "parents who attended church frequently cited the significance of religion in rearing their children and in providing moral guidance."
<p>	Ongoing studies by Arizona State University West demonstrate that  religious belief and practice  encourage optimism among socially at-risk children. Among the findings: Students who attend church weekly or more frequently are more optimistic about their futures; have better relationships with their parents; are more likely to dismiss racism as an obstacle to reaching their goals; and are more likely to see themselves in control of their own futures, not as victims of oppression. 
<p>	Armed with such evidence about the positive benefits of religious practice, Fagan says it is time for policy-makers to stop ignoring the role religion plays in the welfare of the nation. "Given the growing crisis in out-of-wedlock births and their resultant effects, such as huge social and economic costs, this research should be of major interest to policy-makers," he says.
<p>	Fagan offers several steps that both Congress and the president can take to encourage religious practice. Among them:
<p><ul>
	<li> Congress should initiate a national discussion on the need to restore the  role of religion in American life. "The Senate used to be the chamber for debate on the great issues of the day. It should take up that role again and discuss the relationship between the practice of religion and the health of the nation,"  Fagan says. 
<p>
<li> Congress should pass a resolution affirming that census data on the extent of religious practice can also help inform the public debate on America's most difficult social problems.  Such a resolution would also remove the excuse that it is not permissible to fund research on the  religious aspect of American life. 
	<p>
<li> The president should appoint judges who are at least more sensitive to the role of religion in public life. Fagan says it weakens society and makes no sense to crowd religion out of every activity in which government is involved. "All future candidates for federal court appointments  should be asked to clarify their views regarding both the role of religion in politics and their understanding of the Founding Fathers' intent on this issue," Fagan says.  
</ul><p>	While the study discusses  the role the nation's policy-makers should play in encouraging religious practice, it also spells out actions that America's religious leaders and individual citizens can take.
<p>	Fagan says religious leaders must draw attention to the foundational role religion plays in supporting families and schools. He says religious individuals need to emphasize the need for religious training in adolescents who are most at risk of losing their anchoring in the community and turning to crime, drugs or other social ills.
<P>	"Social research demonstrates that regular religious practice is both an individual and social good. It offers a powerful answer to many of the nation's most serious social problems. The time is ripe for a deeper dialogue on the contribution of religion to the welfare of the nation," Fagan says.

<hr><h2>RUSSIAN CONTROL OF OIL-RICH REGIONS KEY
TO CHECHEN CONFLICT, ANALYST SAYS</h2>
</center>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations

<p>
	WASHINGTON, JAN. 23, 1996</b> -- Overlooked in the current conflict between Russia and the breakaway republic of Chechnya is the larger Russian goal of dominating the oil-rich states of the former Soviet Union, according to a new <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bg1065.html">Heritage Foundation paper</a>.  
<p>	The Chechen conflict is just one of many efforts by Russia to create a sphere of influence in the strategic regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia, says Heritage Senior Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/cohen.htm">Ariel Cohen</a>.  If Russia succeeds, he says, it could establish a monopoly over the region's vast oil supply (estimated at 25 million barrels, larger than reserves in Alaska's Northern Slope and the North Sea combined) and drive up energy prices across the globe.
<p>	The U.S. response, Cohen says, must be to ensure that all interested parties, including American oil companies, have free and fair access to the region's oil fields.  The United States can do this in a number of ways, principally by working to preserve the economic independence of former Soviet republics in the region -- such as Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Georgia -- and by opposing any efforts of the Russian military to control the oil fields and pipelines through force.
<p>	In a worst-case scenario, Cohen says, Moscow would grab full control of the oil fields, increasing Western energy dependence on a country that has not always been friendly toward the West.  Disturbingly, Russia is already setting up military bases in the region -- four in Georgia and three in Armenia -- to cement its control over all future oil pipelines built in the region.  Such a strategy has support in Russia not only from ultra-nationalists like Vladimir Zhirinovsky, but from the powerful military and "security services."  Cohen describes the intent of these factions bluntly: "The Russian army and security services seek to deny foreign companies the right to export oil without their control."  If Russia dominates this vital region, Cohen even sees the possibility of a Russian alliance with anti-Western regimes Iran, Iraq and Lybia to drive up the price of oil.  
<p>	Cohen says the challenge for the United States is to convince Russia that its national interest lies not in a confrontation with the West over oil, but in cooperation with the West to develop the economic potential of the oil-rich region.  The United States should reassure Moscow that Russian companies, which currently lack the resources to tap the oil, will nevertheless be included in any future ventures.  In this way, Cohen says, Russia will get the economic help it needs from the West, and the West will get the assurance of stability in the region.

<h2>POLICY REVIEW MAGAZINE WILL GREET 1996 
WITH NEW MISSION, FORMAT, FREQUENCY</h2></center><p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>

<P>

	<b>WASHINGTON, DEC. 1, 1995</b> -- As Americans debate how to rebuild their communities in the wake of a receding federal government, one of conservatism's most influential voices is charting a new course for reinvigorating private-sector and local government alternatives to the centralized welfare state. The Heritage Foundation's flagship magazine, <i>Policy Review</i>, is redefining its mission to articulate and advance the conservative vision of "civil society."
<p>
	Beginning with the <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/toc75.html">January/February 1996</a> issue, the magazine, renamed <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i>, will feature new departments with a new design and appear six rather than four times a year. <a href="/heritage/staff/meyerson.htm">Adam Meyerson</a>, the magazine's editor for 12 years, plans to make <i>Policy Review</i> a clearinghouse of information and analysis about civic leaders who are solving America's most pressing social and cultural problems without relying on the federal government. "The central challenge for conservatives over the next 20 years is to restore the tradition of American citizenship by rebuilding the institutions of civil society -- families, neighborhoods, religious institutions, schools, civic associations, businesses, and local governments," Meyerson explains. 
<p>	The new format builds on one of the current magazine strengths: its long-time focus on stories that show the failures of big-government liberalism and illustrate the successes of private and local government initiative. "By becoming Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship, we are simply clarifying our mission, improving our product by building on what we already do best," says Heritage Foundation President and Policy Review Publisher <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin J. Feulner Jr</a>.
<p>	The magazine seeks to make clear the differences between the conservative and liberal conceptions of society. "Unlike liberals who are mostly uncomfortable with religion, conservatives see religious fervor as one of the most important engines of civil society," says Deputy Editor Joe Loconte. The new Policy Review will feature a regular department, "One Nation Under God," which will show the involvement of religious institutions in repairing America's social fabric.
<p>	Unlike liberals, conservatives also see business as an essential part of the citizenship movement. Frequently the most creative answers to social problems come from businesses that can profit by solving them. Another new department, called "The Blessings of Liberty," will show how economic freedom and marketplace competition contribute to civil society.
<p>	The new Policy Review will feature several other regular departments as well. "Home Front" will identify character-building organizations that promote responsible parenthood. "We the People" will tell about remarkable acts of generosity by ordinary people and community institutions. "Abuses and Usurpations" will show how federal and state executive agencies, legislatures, and courts are interfering with civil society by denying its institutions the freedom to make basic decisions. <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/tsquare.html">"Town Square"</a> will provide news about the best books, papers, and seminars that promote citizenship. And "Profiles in Citizenship" will look at Americans who have built great civic institutions in the past.
<p>	The January/February issue features a <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/preserv.html">symposium with presidential candidates</a> Robert Dole, Phil Gramm, Richard Lugar, Lamar Alexander, and Robert Dornan. Candidates respond to the question, "Which parts of the Constitution are commonly misinterpreted or underappreciated, and therefore deserve more emphasis in political discourse?" The answers are as varied as the candidates themselves: Dole on "The Establishment Clause"; Gramm on "The Takings Clause"; Lugar on "Enumerated Powers"; Alexander on "Presidential Powers"; and Dornan on "Government by Judiciary."
<p>	Also in this issue, former Attorney General and Heritage Ronald Reagan Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/meese.htm">Edwin Meese III</a> and special counsel Rhett DeHart show "How Washington Subverts Your Local Sheriff" in their article about the bipartisan assault on local law enforcement. Meese and DeHart urge national lawmakers to resist the temptation to make ordinary crime a federal issue. They argue that nationalizing crime contradicts constitutional principles, incurs unnecessary expense, and does not allow for states to experiment with innovative approaches to the prevention of crime.
<p>	"Can Congress Revive Civil Society?" Yes, says Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind. Along with William J. Bennett, Coats has introduced the "Project for American Renewal" -- comprised of 19 separate bills designed to use public policy -- and public resources -- to energize mainly private efforts to meet human needs. In this article, Coats details his plan and Gertrude Himmelfarb, Don Eberly, and David Boaz offer their comments.
<p>	In "Clinton's AmeriCorps Values," John Walters of The New Citizenship Project says President Clinton's citizenship is defined  "with subsidies, centralized government, and self-esteem." While Clinton incorporates a message of personal responsibility and citizenship into his rhetoric, his vision is "deeply flawed," says Walters. The president has sought justify his efforts to expand the welfare state and to reinvigorate civic life by trying to re-legitimize government. Walters points to Clinton's AmeriCorps program, which uses federal resources to promote voluntarism and "contradicts the principle of self-government that lies at the heart of citizenship." Walters asserts that Americans should revitalize citizenship by getting the federal government out of the areas of public life that citizens can and should direct themselves. 
<p>	Articles by Florida's Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson, and others appear in the January/February issue as well.
<p>	 Policy Review began publishing in 1977 and now has a paid circulation of 30,000. It is indexed by the Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature, the Public Affairs Information Service, and the Social Sciences Index. The full text of the magazine is available on NEXIS and on the "Internet" at <a href="/heritage/">http://www.heritage.org</a>.
<p>	A one-year <a href="/heritage/p_review/subscribe.html">subscription</a> to the magazine costs $19.95; two-years costs $34.95. To subscribe, call 1-800-304-0056.

<P>
<I>&quot;The 'Index of Economic Freedom' provides an important
benchmark for evaluating Hong Kong's future success after it reverts
to Chinese control in 1997.&quot;</I>
-- Kim Holmes,
Vice President, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
 
<P>
 <B>WASHINGTON, Dec. 13, 1995</B> -- Hong Kong's economy has been
rated as the freest in the world by the prestigious American research
institute The Heritage Foundation. 
<P>
 The economies of just 10 other countries -- three from the Asia-Pacific
region -- also were rated as &quot;free&quot; in the Washington-based
think tank's annual &quot;Index of Economic Freedom.&quot; 
<P>
 Singapore was judged to have the second-freest economy in the
world. New Zealand tied for fourth place. And the Republic of
China on Taiwan tied for eighth. Japan, whose economy was in the
&quot;mostly free&quot; category, was 15th (tied with Austria).

<P>
 The economies of Australia, South Korea, Malaysia, Sri Lanka,
Western Samoa, Indonesia, and the Philippines also earned ratings
of &quot;mostly free.&quot; 
<P>
 The People's Republic of China (PRC), on the other hand, ranked
near the bottom, tied with Mauritania and the Congo for 121st
place. India's score was only slightly better, and earned India
a tie (with Armenia, Sierra Leone and Yemen) for 117th place.
 
<P>
<I><B>Government House Presentation</B></I>
<P>
 Heritage Foundation President Edwin Feulner Jr. will present
a copy of the book-length report, &quot;The Index of Economic
Freedom,&quot; to The Honorable Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor,
at ceremonies at Government House today.
<P>
 Kim Holmes, Ph.D., vice president and director of foreign-policy
studies at The Heritage Foundation, said the &quot;Index of Economic
Freedom&quot; would provide &quot;an important benchmark for evaluating
Hong Kong's future success after it reverts to Chinese control
in 1997.&quot;
<P>
 Hong Kong was characterized in the report as &quot;one of the
most accessible markets in the world,&quot; with &quot;very few&quot;
barriers to imports and &quot;virtually no barriers to foreign
investors.&quot; In addition, the authors wrote, &quot;The government
does not interfere in the marketplace; taxes are low and predictable;
government spending increases are closely linked to economic growth&quot;;
and regulations are &quot;applied uniformly and consistently.&quot;
<P>
<I><B>Overview</B></I>
<P>
 Overall, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, New Zealand, Switzerland,
the Netherlands and the United States received the best ratings
in the think tank's annual survey of economic freedom, while Iraq,
Cuba, Laos and North Korea received the worst scores. All told,
the economies of 65 countries were rated as &quot;free&quot; or
&quot;mostly free,&quot; while 77 economies earned ratings of
&quot;mostly unfree&quot; or &quot;repressed.&quot; In all, 142
countries were rated in the new 1996 &quot;Index,&quot; up from
101 in the previous edition.
<P>
 Each country was rated on 10 economic factors, including its
banking, foreign investment, monetary, tax, trade, and wage and
price policies, the size of its government sector, property rights,
regulatory restrictions, and black-market activity. Countries
were given ratings of one to five in each category, one being
the best, five the worst.
<P>
 The United States stood in seventh place in the new 1996 edition
of the &quot;Index.&quot; Japan was 15th, tied with Austria. Among
former communist countries, the Czech Republic did the best by
far, and was ranked 12th in the world.
<P>
 Several countries showed significant improvement from a year
ago, including Panama, Peru, Poland, Botswana and Indonesia, while
several others -- including Brazil, Mexico, Italy and Zimbabwe
-- moved in the wrong direction, according to authors Bryan T.
Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy.
<P>
<I><B>Resource for Investors</B></I>
<P>
 First published last year to provide the U.S. Congress with guidance
on foreign- aid reform, the first edition of the &quot;Index of
Economic Freedom&quot; also was widely praised by the international
investment community. Washington Post economics columnist James
T. Glassman  (Dec. 11, 1994) said the book provided &quot;useful
clues for investors who want to buy foreign stocks but can't decide
which countries are the most promising.&quot; Global Investment<I>
</I>magazine (June 1995) said the &quot;Index&quot; offered &quot;some
surprising insights on why some markets may be chained to the
ground while others are set for takeoff.&quot; And Journal of
Commerce Publisher Don C. Becker observed: &quot;... the lesson
to be drawn from this survey is clear. The more economic freedom
people are allowed, the less interference there is from government,
the faster the nations prosper.&quot;
<P>
 Kim Holmes, vice president of The Heritage Foundation, said,
&quot;The evidence is incontrovertable: Economic freedom produces
economic prosperity. No amount of American aid can alter this
basic formula.&quot;
<P>
 In a new chapter on using the &quot;Index&quot; as an investment
tool, the authors applied nine additional investment factors to
those countries whose scores on the Heritage &quot;Index&quot;
had improved the most. Of the 24 countries to which the second
set of criteria were applied, Botswana, Indonesia, Israel, Panama
and Portugal scored best. While some of the 24 countries still
are considered economically unfree, all of them, the authors note,
&quot;deserve the close attention of the international investor
because they are liberalizing their economies (hence their improved
'Index' scores) and building foundations for strong economic growth,
an environment in which most investments do well.&quot;
<P>
 The second edition of the &quot;Index&quot; also confirmed a
trend noted in the first edition -- that &quot;wealthy and economically
free countries tend over time to reintroduce restrictions on economic
freedom. As they become wealthy, countries begin adding welfare
and other social programs that were not affordable when they were
poorer. Thus, after they become economically 'liberated,' countries
like Germany, Sweden and even the United States tend to fall back
down the scale of economic freedom, getting worse scores than
newly emerging free economies like Hong Kong or Singapore.&quot;
<P>
 Thus, &quot;economic freedom can rise and fall and the seeds
of destruction can exist in the fruits of success.&quot; 
<P>
<I><B>Highlights</B></I>
<P>
 The 1996 &quot;Index of Economic Freedom&quot; provides plenty
of food for thought, the authors noted. For example,
<P>
 <B>Asia:</B>
<P><ul>
<li>Despite the enthusiasm of the investment community, Vietnam
continues to have one of the world's most repressed economies.
<P>
<li>Japan scored worse this year, moving from the free to &quot;mostly
free&quot; category, largely as a result of increased banking
regulations.
<P>
<li>India's score likewise declined, largely as a result of its
moves against some foreign investment and continued use of price
controls.
</ul>
<P>
 <B>Europe:</B>
<P><ul>
<li>Europe's freest economies are found in Switzerland, the Netherlands,
Denmark and Luxembourg, rather than the United Kingdom, Germany
or France. With superior banking laws, the economies of Switzerland
and the Netherlands both were rated as more free than that of
the United States.
</ul>
<P>
 <B>Latin America &amp; the Caribbean</B>
<P><ul>
<li>The Bahamas had the freest economy in the region and the 12th
freest in the world (tied with Canada and the Czech Republic).
It would have scored even better if not for trade restrictions.
<P>
<li>One of the true bright spots was Panama, which jumped ahead
of Chile in the 1996 rankings, making it the Latin American country
with the freest economy. Chile did not backslide; its overall
average also improved from 1995 to 1996. It's just that Panama's
improved even more, largely because Panama depoliticized its money
supply, abolishing its central bank and federal-reserve system
and adopting the U.S. dollar as its official currency. As a result,
the Panamanian government can no longer print money for political
purposes, causing inflation.
<P>
<li>Despite media reports about economic reform in Cuba, the authors
found little to cheer about, ranking Cuba's economy as the most
repressed in Latin America and one of the three most repressed
in the world.
</ul>
<P>
 <B>Africa/Middle East:</B>

<ul>
<li>Ten countries in Northern Africa and the Middle East -- Bahrain,
United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Oman,
Israel, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon -- earned rankings of economically
free or &quot;mostly free.&quot; Just five countries in sub-Saharan
Africa earned such ratings: Botswana, Uganda, Swaziland, Benin
and Zambia.
<P>
<li>While some countries have liberalized their economies  -- Botswana's
score, for example, improved from 3.05 in 1995 to 2.8 in 1996
-- sub-Saharan Africa remains the most economically unfree &quot;and
by far the poorest&quot; region of the world. Indeed, of the 16
countries categorized as &quot;repressed&quot; in the 1996 &quot;Index,&quot;
six were in Africa.
</ul>

<I>&quot;The evidence is incontrovertable: Economic
freedom produces economic prosperity. No
amount of American aid can alter this basic formula.&quot;</I>
-- Kim Holmes,
Vice President, The Heritage Foundation
<P>

<P>
 <B>WASHINGTON, DEC. 13, 1995</B> -- Just 10 other countries around
the world provide businesses and individuals with a degree of
economic freedom similar to America's, The Heritage Foundation
reported today in its annual survey of global economic freedom.
The economies of 142 countries were rated, up from 101 countries
a year ago.
<P>
 Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, New Zealand, Switzerland, the
Netherlands and the United States received the best ratings on
Heritage's annual &quot;Index of Economic Freedom,&quot; while
Cuba, Iraq, Laos and North Korea received the worst scores. All
told, the economies of 65 countries were rated as &quot;free&quot;
or &quot;mostly free,&quot; while 77 economies earned ratings
of &quot;mostly unfree&quot; or &quot;repressed.&quot; Each country
was rated on 10 economic factors: banking, foreign investment,
monetary, tax, trade, and wage and price policies, the size of
its government sector, property rights, regulatory restrictions,
and black- market activity. Countries were given ratings of one
to five in each category, one being the best, five the worst.
<P>
 The United States ranked seventh overall on the report card,
just behind the Netherlands and just ahead of Denmark, Luxembourg,
the Republic of China (Taiwan), and the United Kingdom, which
tied for eighth place. Japan ranked 15th, tied with Austria. The
Czech Republic, in 12th place, remained far ahead of any other
former communist country. Estonia, which came the closest to the
Czech Republic, ranked 26th. 
<P>
 Several countries showed significant improvement from a year
ago, including Panama, Peru, Poland, Botswana and Indonesia, while
several others -- including Brazil, Mexico, Italy and Zimbabwe
-- moved in the wrong direction, according to authors Bryan T.
Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy.
<P>
<I><B>Resource for Investors</B></I>
<P>
 First published last year to provide Congress with guidance on
foreign-aid reform, the first edition of the &quot;Index of Economic
Freedom&quot; also was widely praised by the international investment
community. Washington Post economics columnist James T. Glassman
 (Dec. 11, 1994) said the book provided &quot;useful clues for
investors who want to buy foreign stocks but can't decide which
countries are the most promising.&quot; Global Investment<I> </I>magazine
(June 1995) said the &quot;Index&quot; offered &quot;some surprising
insights on why some markets may be chained to the ground while
others are set for takeoff.&quot; And Journal of Commerce Publisher
Don C. Becker observed: &quot;... the lesson to be drawn from
this survey is clear. The more economic freedom people are allowed,
the less interference there is from government, the faster the
nations prosper.&quot;
<P>
 Kim Holmes, Ph. D., vice president and director of foreign-policy
studies at The Heritage Foundation, said, &quot;The evidence is
incontrovertable: Economic freedom produces economic prosperity.
No amount of American aid can alter this basic formula.&quot;
<P>
 In a new chapter on using the &quot;Index&quot; as an investment
tool, the authors applied nine additional investment factors --
including political stability, market size, external debt, infrastructure,
currency convertibility, and domestic savings -- to those countries
whose scores on the Heritage &quot;Index&quot; had improved most
during the past year. Of the 24 countries to which the second
set of criteria were applied, Botswana, Indonesia, Israel, Panama
and Portugal scored best. While some of the 24 countries still
are considered economically unfree, all of them, the authors note,
&quot;deserve the close attention of the international investor
because they are liberalizing their economies (hence their improved
'Index' scores) and building foundations for strong economic growth,
an environment in which most investments do well.&quot;
<P>
 The second edition of the &quot;Index&quot; also confirmed a
trend noted in the first edition -- that &quot;wealthy and economically
free countries tend over time to reintroduce restrictions on economic
freedom. As they become wealthy, countries begin adding welfare
and other social programs that were not affordable when they were
poorer. Thus, after they become economically 'liberated,' countries
like Germany, Sweden and even the United States tend to fall back
down the scale of economic freedom, getting worse scores than
newly emerging free economies like Hong Kong or Singapore.&quot;
<P>
 Thus, &quot;economic freedom can rise and fall and the seeds
of destruction can exist in the fruits of success.&quot; 
<P>
<I><B>Foreign-Aid Reform</B></I>
<P>
 The 1995 &quot;Index&quot; was used extensively earlier this
year when Congress debated foreign-aid reform. The House and Senate
both included language in the &quot;foreign operations&quot; appropriations
bill requiring the Agency for International Development (AID)
to report to Congress annually on the relative economic freedom
and prosperity of countries receiving U.S. foreign aid.  
<P>

<P>
<I>&quot;Economic assistance  is wasted when it is given to
countries without free economies -- and it is unnecessary for countries with free economies.&quot;-- </i>Co-authors Bryan T. Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy
<P>
<P>
Johnson and Sheehy, co-authors of the Heritage Foundation
volume, maintain that &quot;economic assistance is wasted when
it is given to countries without free economies -- and it is unnecessary,
as the 'Index' clearly shows, for countries with free economies.
For U.S. taxpayers and the recipients of economic aid alike, such
'assistance' is a no-win proposition.&quot;
<P>
 The United States has provided an estimated $270 billion in economic
development assistance since 1946. The recipients of the largest
amounts of aid, in addition to Israel and Egypt -- which, for
geopolitical reasons, receive a combined $5 billion per year --
are almost all countries with unfree economies.
<P>
 &quot;Most economic development aid is wasted; it is money down
the drain. It doesn't help the recipient country and it certainly
doesn't help U.S. taxpayers,&quot; Holmes said.
<P>
 &quot;The people of Angola, Mozambique, Haiti, Cuba and Ukraine
are not poor because the people in the West don't share their
riches. They are poor because their governments pursue destructive
economic policies that discourage free enterprise and the creation
of wealth. 
<P>
 &quot;Only when poor countries increase the economic freedom
of their citizens and unleash the phenomenal power of the free
market,&quot; the Heritage Foundation vice president said, &quot;will
true prosperity come to the poor nations of the world. Anything
short of this is not only economically unwise, but is cynically
cruel.&quot;
<P>
<I><B>Highlights</B></I>
<P>
 The 1996 &quot;Index of Economic Freedom&quot; provides plenty
of food for thought, the authors noted. For example,
<P>
 <B>Europe:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Europe's freest economies are found in Switzerland, the Netherlands,
Denmark and Luxembourg, rather than the United Kingdom, Germany
or France. With superior banking laws, the economies of Switzerland
and the Netherlands both were rated as more free than that of
the United States.
</ul><P>
 <B>Asia:</B>
<ul>
<li>Despite the enthusiasm of the investment community, Vietnam
continues to have one of the world's most repressed economies.
<P>
<li>Japan scored worse this year, moving from the free to &quot;mostly
free&quot; category, largely as a result of increased banking
regulations.
<P>
<li>India's score likewise declined, largely as a result of its
moves against some foreign investment projects and continued reliance
on price controls.
</ul><P>
 <B>Latin America &amp; the Caribbean</B>
<P><ul>
<li>The Bahamas had the freest economy in the region and the 12th
freest in the world (tied with Canada and the Czech Republic).
It would have scored even better if not for trade restrictions.

<P>
<li>One of the true bright spots was Panama, which jumped ahead
of Chile in the 1996 rankings, making it the Latin American country
with the freest economy. Chile did not backslide; its overall
average also improved from 1995 to 1996. It's just that Panama's
improved even more, largely because Panama depoliticized its money
supply, abolished its central bank and federal-reserve system
and adopted the U.S. dollar as its official currency. As a result,
the Panamanian government can no longer print money for political
purposes, causing inflation.
<P>
<li>Despite media reports about economic reform in Cuba, the authors
found little to cheer about, ranking Cuba's economy as the most
repressed in Latin America and one of the three most repressed
in the world.
</ul><P>
 <B>Africa/Middle East:</B>
<P><ul>
<li>Ten countries in Northern Africa and the Middle East -- Bahrain,
United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Oman,
Israel, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon -- earned rankings of economically
&quot;free&quot; or &quot;mostly free.&quot; Just five countries
in sub-Saharan Africa earned such ratings: Botswana, Uganda, Swaziland,
Benin and Zambia.
<P>
<li>While some countries have liberalized their economies  -- Botswana's
score, for example, improved from 3.05 in 1995 to 2.8 in 1996
-- sub-Saharan Africa remains the most economically unfree &quot;and
by far the poorest&quot; region of the world. Indeed, of the 16
countries categorized as &quot;repressed&quot; in the 1996 &quot;Index,&quot;
six were in Africa.

<P><P>
 <B>WASHINGTON, DEC. 13, 1995</B> -- The economies of 13 countries
in Latin America and the Caribbean received ratings of &quot;mostly
free&quot; in The Heritage Foundation's annual survey of global
economic freedom, released here today.
<P>
 Just 11 countries in the world received ratings of &quot;free,&quot;
none in Central America, South America, or the Caribbean.
<P>
 The Bahamas, Panama, Chile, El Salvador and Trinidad and Tobago
received the best ratings in the region on the influential think
tank's annual &quot;Index of Economic Freedom.&quot; Haiti and
Cuba received the worst ratings, the only two economies in the
region characterized as &quot;repressed.&quot;
<P>
 Globally, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, Switzerland, New Zealand,
the Netherlands and the United States received the best ratings
on the &quot;Index of Economic Freedom,&quot; while Iraq, Cuba,
Laos and North Korea received the worst scores. All told, the
economies of 65 countries were rated as &quot;free&quot; or &quot;mostly
free,&quot; while 77 economies earned ratings of &quot;mostly
unfree&quot; or &quot;repressed.&quot; 
<P>
 Each country was rated on 10 economic factors, including its
banking, foreign investment, monetary, tax, trade, and wage and
price policies, the size of its government sector, property rights,
regulatory restrictions, and black-market activity. Countries
were given ratings of one to five in each category, one being
the best, five the worst.
<P>
 The United States ranked seventh overall on the report card,
just behind the Netherlands, and just ahead of Denmark, Luxembourg,
the Republic of China (Taiwan), and the United Kingdom, which
tied for eighth place. Among the former communist countries, the
Czech Republic received the best score and was ranked 12th overall
(tied with the Bahamas and Canada). 
<P>
 Several countries showed significant improvement from a year
ago, including Panama and Peru, while several others -- including
Brazil and Mexico -- moved in the wrong direction, according to
authors Bryan T. Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy.
<P>
<I><B>Regional Data</B></I>
<P>
 The Bahamas' economy earned a score of 2.0, putting it just over
the line separating the countries with totally free (a score of
1.0 to 1.99) and &quot;mostly free&quot; economies (2.0 to 2.99).
Panama earned a score of 2.4. Chile and El Salvador scored 2.45.
And Trinidad and Tobago scored 2.5. 
<P>
 Other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean whose economies
were rated as &quot;mostly free&quot; were Argentina (2.65), Paraguay
(2.65), Belize (2.7), Jamaica (2.7), Bolivia (2.75), Costa Rica
(2.8), Uruguay (2.8), and Guatemala (2.85). 
<P>
 Countries whose economies earned ratings of &quot;mostly unfree&quot;
(3.0 to 3.99) were Barbados (3.0), Colombia (3.0), Peru (3.0),
Ecuador (3.15), Honduras (3.15), Mexico (3.35), Guyana (3.4),
Brazil (3.45), Dominican Republic (3.45), Venezuela (3.5), and
Nicaragua (3.6). Haiti (4.2) and Cuba (5.0) were the only two
countries in the region whose economies were characterized as
&quot;repressed.&quot;

 <B>WASHINGTON, DEC. 13, 1995</B> -- The economies of just five
countries in sub-Saharan Africa received ratings of &quot;mostly
free&quot; in The Heritage Foundation's annual survey of global
economic freedom, released here today. Of the 11 countries in the
world with ratings of &quot;free,&quot; none was in sub-Saharan
Africa.
<P>
 Botswana, Uganda, Swaziland, Benin and Zambia received the best
ratings in the region on the influential think tank's annual &quot;Index
of Economic Freedom.&quot; Mozambique, Sudan, Zaire, Angola and
Somalia received the worst ratings, with their economies characterized
as &quot;repressed.&quot;
<P>
 As a result of its economic-liberalization policies, Botswana
was identified as one of a handful of countries around the world
that stood out as a possible future investment prospect.
<P>
 Globally, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, Switzerland, New Zealand,
the Netherlands and the United States received the best ratings
on the &quot;Index of Economic Freedom,&quot; while Iraq, Cuba,
Laos and North Korea received the worst scores. 
<P>
 All told, the economies of 65 countries were rated as &quot;free&quot;
or &quot;mostly free,&quot; while 77 economies earned ratings
of &quot;mostly unfree&quot; or &quot;repressed.&quot; 
<P>
 In sub-Saharan Africa, five countries received &quot;mostly free&quot;
ratings, 23 received ratings of &quot;mostly unfree,&quot; and
five received ratings of &quot;repressed.&quot;
<P>
 Each country was rated on 10 economic factors, including its
banking, foreign investment, monetary, tax, trade, and wage and
price policies, the size of its government sector, property rights,
regulatory restrictions, and black-market activity. Countries
were given ratings of one to five in each category, one being
the best, five the worst.
<P>
 The United States ranked seventh overall on the report card,
just behind the Netherlands, and just ahead of Denmark, Luxembourg,
the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the United Kingdom, which tied
for eighth place. 
<P>
 Among the former communist countries, the Czech Republic received
the best score and was ranked 12th overall, tied with the Bahamas
and Canada. Like the Bahamas, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago
also received ratings of &quot;mostly free.&quot; 
<P>
 Several countries showed significant improvement from a year
ago, including Panama and Peru, while several others -- including
Brazil and Mexico -- moved in the wrong direction, according to
authors Bryan T. Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy.
<P>
 Sub-Saharan Africa 
<P>
 The economy of Botswana earned a score of 2.8, the best in the
region and 47th overall (tied with Costa Rica). Other African
countries with &quot;mostly free&quot; economies (2.0 to 2.99)
included Uganda (2.83), Swaziland (2.9), Benin (2.95) and Zambia
(2.95). 
<P>
 Countries whose economies earned ratings of &quot;mostly unfree&quot;
(3.0 to 3.99) were South Africa (3.0), Kenya (3.05), Gabon (3.06),
Mali (3.1), Ghana (3.2), Ivory Coast (3.25), Nigeria (3.25), Guinea
(3.35), Madagascar (3.35), Malawai (3.4), Senegal (3.4), Cape
Verde (3.44), Tanzania (3.45), Cameroon (3.6), Ethiopia (3.6),
Lesotho (3.65), Burkina Faso (3.7), Niger (3.7), Zimbabwe (3.7),
Sierra Leone (3.75), Congo (3.8), Mauritania (3.8) and Suriname
(3.9).  
<P>
 Points to Hong Kong 
<P>
 Kim Holmes, Ph. D., vice president and director of foreign-policy
studies at The Heritage Foundation, said, &quot;The evidence is
incontrovertable: Economic freedom produces economic prosperity.
No amount of American aid can alter this basic formula.&quot;
<P>
 In a Nov. 27 speech in Hong Kong, Holmes pointed out that 30
years ago Hong Kong and Gabon were equally poor countries, with
per-capita incomes of $2,279 per year and $2,770 respectively.
Hong Kong then pursued a bold economic liberalization program,
while Gabon's government pursued the opposite course. Today, the
average per capita income in Hong Kong is $10,223. The average
in Gabon: just $3,502.
<P>
 &quot;Hong Kong's economic miracle should provide a lesson to
the less-developed world,&quot; Holmes said. &quot;You don't need
gold and silver deposits, or oil wells, or rich, arable land,
or American foreign aid to create wealth and prosperity. All you
need is a climate of economic freedom.&quot;
<P>
 Resource for Investors 
<P>
 In a new chapter on using the &quot;Index of Economic Freedom&quot;
as an investment tool, the authors applied nine additional investment
factors to those countries whose scores on the Heritage &quot;Index&quot;
had improved the most. Of the 24 countries to which the second
set of criteria were applied, Botswana, Indonesia, Israel, Panama
and Portugal scored the best. While some of the 24 countries are
rated as economically unfree, all of them, the authors note, &quot;deserve
the close attention of the international investor because they
are liberalizing their economies (hence their improved 'Index'
scores) and building foundations for strong economic growth, an
environment in which most investments do well.&quot;
<P>
 Foreign-Aid Reform 
<P>
 The 1995 &quot;Index&quot; was used extensively earlier this
year when the United States Congress considered changes in the
U.S. foreign-aid program. One major change will require the U.S.
Agency for International Development (AID) to report annually
to Congress on the relative economic freedom of countries receiving
U.S. foreign aid.
 <i>&quot;The evidence is incontrovertable: Economic 
freedom produces economic prosperity. No 
amount of American aid can alter this basic formula.&quot;</i> 
-- Kim Holmes, Vice President, The Heritage Foundation 
<P>
Bryan Johnson and Thomas Sheehy, authors of the Heritage Foundation
volume, maintain that &quot;economic aid is wasted when it is
given to countries without free economies -- and it is unnecessary,
as the 'Index' clearly shows, for countries with free economies.
For U.S. taxpayers and the recipients of foreign aid alike, economic
aid is a no-win proposition.&quot;
<P>
 The United States has provided some $270 billion in economic
development assistance since 1946. &quot;Most economic development
assistance is wasted. It doesn't help the recipient country and
it certainly doesn't help U.S. taxpayers,&quot; said Holmes, a
highly regarded foreign-policy specialist.
<P>
 &quot;The people of Angola, Mozambique, Haiti and Cuba  are not
poor because the people in the West don't share their riches.
They are poor because their governments pursue destructive economic
policies that discourage free enterprise and the creation of wealth,&quot;
Holmes said. &quot;Only when poor countries increase the economic
freedom of their citizens and unleash the phenomenal power of
the free market,&quot; the Heritage Foundation vice president
said, &quot;will true prosperity come to the poor nations of the
world. Anything short of this is not only economically unwise,
but is cynically cruel.&quot;
<P>
 Highlights 
<P>
 The authors of the Heritage Foundation  report made a number
of important observations. They found, for example:
<P>
 <B>Africa/Middle East:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Ten countries in Northern Africa and the Middle East -- Bahrain,
United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Oman,
Israel, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon -- earned rankings of economically
free or &quot;mostly free.&quot; Just five countries in sub-Saharan
Africa earned such ratings: Botswana, Uganda, Swaziland, Benin
and Zambia.
<P>
<li>While some countries have liberalized their economies  -- Botswana's
score, for example, improved from 3.05 in 1995 to 2.8 in 1996
-- sub-Saharan Africa remains the most economically unfree &quot;and
by far the poorest&quot; region of the world. Indeed, of the 16
countries categorized as &quot;repressed&quot; in the 1996 &quot;Index,&quot;
six were in Africa.
</ul><P>
 <B>Latin America &amp; the Caribbean</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>The Bahamas had the freest economy in the region and the 12th
freest in the world (tied with Canada and the Czech Republic).
It would have scored even better if not for trade restrictions.
<P>
<li>One of the true bright spots was Panama, which jumped ahead
of Chile in the 1996 rankings, making it the Latin American country
with the freest economy. Chile did not backslide, however; its
overall average also improved from 1995 to 1996. It's just that
Panama's improved even more, largely because Panama depoliticized
its money supply, abolishing its central bank and federal-reserve
system and adopting the U.S. dollar as its official currency.
As a result, the Panamanian government can no longer print money
for political purposes, causing inflation.
<P>
<li>Despite media reports about economic reform in Cuba, the authors
found little to cheer about, ranking Cuba's economy as the most
repressed in the Latin America/Caribbean region and one of the
three most repressed in the world.
</ul><P>
 <B>Asia:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Despite the enthusiasm of the investment community, Vietnam
continues to have one of the world's most repressed economies.
<P>
<li>Japan scored worse this year, moving from the free to &quot;mostly
free&quot; category, largely as a result of increased banking
regulations.
<P>
<li>India's score likewise declined, largely as a result of its
moves against foreign investment and its continued reliance on
price controls.

<h2>CLINTON'S FAMILY TAX CUT DENIES TAX RELIEF TO 23 MILLION CHILDREN</h2></center><p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>

<P>


<P>
<b>WASHINGTON, DEC. 11, 1995 --</b> President Clinton's budget plan,
released last week, would give much less tax relief to low-income
working families than the congressional plan he recently vetoed,
according to an analysis by The Heritage Foundation. This finding
directly contradicts the president's claim that his budget would
be better for these families.         
<P>
Overall, Clinton's tax credit denies any tax relief to 10.4 million
working families that would receive relief under the plan he vetoed,
according to Scott Hodge, Grover M. Hermann fellow in federal
budgetary affairs. In other families, some children wouldn't qualify
for tax relief under Clinton's plan, but would qualify under Congress'
plan. 
<P>
Taken together, the Clinton plan would deny $15 billion in tax
relief to 23 million children who would qualify for it under Congress'
$500-per-child tax-credit plan.
<P>
Particularly hard hit are lower-income working families. In order
to claim the  Clinton tax cut, low-income families must first
reduce their tax bills by the amount of their Earned Income Tax
Credit (EITC) subsidy. Thus, 5.4 million families earning less
than $30,000 would be denied tax relief under Clinton's plan;
they would get $2.3 billion in tax relief under the plan he vetoed.
A typical single parent with one child, earning below $30,000,
would receive almost $200 less in tax relief each year under the
Clinton plan.
<P>
In addition, Clinton's $300-per-child tax credit does not apply
to children more than 12 years of age. Since roughly 25 percent
of all children are more than age 12, millions of families will
be denied a tax cut just when the cost of raising a child becomes
most expensive. This provision alone denies tax relief to families
of at least 2.8 million children earning less than $30,000 per
year. In fact, the average tax cut per family under the Clinton
plan is $442, the average tax cut under Congress' plan is $856
per family.
<P>
&quot;This is bait-and-switch tax policy,&quot; says Hodge. &quot;Clinton
says he is helping lower-wage families with children more than
Congress is, but that is absolutely untrue. The fine print in
his plan denies tax relief to millions of families who are being
told by the White House that they qualify.&quot;

<h2>CAPITAL
GAINS TAX CUT WOULD BENEFIT LOWER, MIDDLE CLASS MOST, HERITAGE
STUDY FINDS</h2></center><p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>

<P>
<b>WASHINGTON, DEC. 6, 1995 --</b> Contrary to what opponents
say, the benefits of cutting the capital gains tax rate -- as
proposed in Congress' Balanced Budget Act of 1995 --would go mostly
to lower- and middle-income taxpayers, a Heritage Foundation analyst
said today. 
<P>&quot;The typical household declaring a capital gain
had income from sources other than capital gains of $58,729 and
realized a gain of about $973,&quot; according to William Beach,
a visiting fellow in tax analysis at Heritage. &quot;This is hardly
what anyone would consider 'rich,'&quot; he says. In fact, Beach
says, more than 50 percent of the benefits from cutting the capital
gains tax would go not to the wealthy, but to lower- and middle-income
taxpayers. 
<P>Beach's findings are based on an analysis of 1991 tax
returns -- the most recent, detailed data available from the Internal
Revenue Service. 
<P>The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would permit
individual taxpayers to exclude 50 percent of their capital gains
from taxation. That exclusion effectively cuts the tax rate on
capital gains in half. 
<P>For corporations, the act decreases the
capital gains rate from a maximum of 35 percent to 28 percent.
  Furthermore, Beach says when critics claim that capital gains
go mainly to the wealthy, they often mislead the public by including
the gain as part of a person's income. For example, a retiree
living on a $12,000 Social Security check who realizes a $30,000
capital gain one year from selling his house is classified &quot;as
a person with a $42,000 income who received a capital gain.&quot;
&quot;This sleight of hand allows opponents to 'fudge' the number
of rich in their favor,&quot; Beach says. 
<P>According to Beach,
a balanced budget and a lower capital gains tax rate will stimulate
economic growth, improve the fairness of the tax code and increase
federal revenue by encouraging individuals to take gains they
might not otherwise take because of a high tax rate. He points
to the University of Michigan's Quarterly Model -- one  of the
nation's most independent and respected models of the U.S. economy
-- which found that balancing the budget with tax cuts would produce
immediate reductions in interest rates and inflation and an upswing
in long-term economic activity. 
<P>Other leading private economic
firms (Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, DRI/McGraw-Hill
and others) predicted that balancing the budget and cutting taxes
would lead to a much stronger economy with higher wages and more
spendable household income. &quot;This, more than any other factor,
helps poor and middle-class Americans,&quot; Beach points out.
<P>The Heritage Foundation recently used the U.S. Macroeconomic Model
developed and maintained by Laurence H. Meyer and Associates to
analyze the impact of a balanced budget plan. The model found
that over a seven-year period (1996-2002), most of the economic
benefits of the plan disappear without cuts in capital gains taxes.
The model predicted a loss of more than $80.2 billion in potential
gross domestic product, higher unemployment rates and slower household
income growth if the capital gains tax rate remains the same.
<P> Finally, Beach says that experience over the past 25 years shows
that rate decreases lead to more declarations of capital gains
and therefore more revenue from capital gains taxes. &quot;Owners
of appreciated assets who face high tax rates generally hold on
to their assets in anticipation of lower future rates. When the
rates come down, the amount of capital gains goes up,&quot; he
says. &quot;In other words, you can lower the rate and increase
revenue,&quot; Beach says. 
<P>Economists estimate that Americans
are holding trillions of dollars in unrealized capital gains.
&quot;Lowering the capital gains rate could produce substantial
economic benefits and create  revenue windfalls for federal and
state governments as well as average Americans,&quot; Beach says.

<h2>SINGAPORE ONE OF JUST 11 COUNTRIES WITH FREE ECONOMIES, SAYS 1996 &quot;INDEX OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM&quot;</h2>
<i>Ranks Second Overall, Ahead of U.S., Britain, Japan</i>
</center><p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>
<P>




 <B>SINGAPORE, DEC. 4, 1995</B> -- Singapore has the second-freest
economy in the world, the prestigious American research institute,
The Heritage Foundation, reported today in its annual survey of
global economic freedom.
<P>
 Singapore &quot;has made remarkable [economic] progress by maintaining
an open trade and investment environment; a corruption-free, pro-business
regulatory system; political stability; an efficient, strike-free
labor force and tax incentives for foreign investors,&quot; the
report said. Singapore's &quot;average tariff rate is nearly nonexistent,&quot;
it maintains &quot;no import quotas and non-tariff barriers to
foreign trade&quot; and investment laws &quot;are clear and fair
and pose few problems for businesses.&quot; 
<P>
 Just 10 other countries around the world provide businesses and
individuals with a degree of economic freedom similar to Singapore's,
the Washington-based think tank said in its 1996 &quot;Index of
Economic Freedom.&quot; 
<P>
 The report was released Nov. 27 in Hong Kong. It was presented
to leaders of Singapore's business community at a luncheon today
at Traders Hotel. 
<P>
<I><B>Overview</B></I>
<P>
 Overall, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, New Zealand, Switzerland,
the Netherlands and the United States received the best ratings
on the annual &quot;Index of Economic Freedom,&quot; while Iraq,
Cuba, Laos and North Korea received the worst scores. The economies
of 65 countries were rated as &quot;free&quot; or &quot;mostly
free,&quot; while 77 economies earned ratings of &quot;mostly
unfree&quot; or &quot;repressed.&quot; 
<P>
 Each country was rated on 10 economic factors, including its
banking, foreign investment, monetary, tax, trade, and wage and
price policies, the size of its government sector, property rights,
regulatory restrictions, and black-market activity. Countries
were given ratings of one to five in each category, one being
the best, five the worst.
<P>
 The United States ranked seventh overall on the report card,
just behind Switzerland, and just ahead of Denmark, Luxembourg,
the Republic of China (Taiwan), and the United Kingdom, which
tied for eighth place. 
<P>
 Japan was 15th, tied with Austria. Among former communist countries,
the Czech Republic scored the best: in 12th place (tied with the
Bahamas and Canada).
<P>
 In addition to Japan, other Asian and Pacific Basin countries
whose economies received ratings of &quot;mostly free&quot; were
 Australia, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Sri Lanka,
Western Samoa, Indonesia and the Philippines.
<P>
 In all, 142 countries were rated in the new 1996 edition, compared
to 101 countries in the previous edition. 
<P>
 Several countries showed significant improvement from a year
ago, including Panama, Peru, Poland, Botswana and Indonesia, while
several others -- including Brazil, Mexico, Italy and Zimbabwe
-- moved in the wrong direction, according to authors Bryan T.
Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy.
<P>
<I><B>Resource for Investors</B></I>
<P>
 First published last year to provide the U.S. Congress with guidance
on foreign- aid reform, the first edition of the &quot;Index of
Economic Freedom&quot; also was widely praised by the international
investment community. Washington Post economics columnist James
T. Glassman  (Dec. 11, 1994) said the book provided &quot;useful
clues for investors who want to buy foreign stocks but can't decide
which countries are the most promising.&quot; Global Investment<I>
</I>magazine (June 1995) said the &quot;Index&quot; offered &quot;some
surprising insights on why some markets may be chained to the
ground while others are set for takeoff.&quot; And New York Journal
of Commerce Publisher Don C. Becker observed: &quot;... the lesson
to be drawn from this survey is clear. The more economic freedom
people are allowed, the less interference there is from government,
the faster the nations prosper.&quot;
<P>
 Kim Holmes, Ph. D., vice president and director of foreign-policy
studies at The Heritage Foundation, said, &quot;The evidence is
incontrovertable: Economic freedom produces economic prosperity.
No amount of American aid can alter this basic formula.&quot;
<P>
 In a new chapter on using the &quot;Index&quot; as an investment
tool, the authors applied nine additional investment factors to
those countries whose scores on the Heritage &quot;Index&quot;
had improved the most. Of the 24 countries to which the second
set of criteria were applied, Botswana, Indonesia, Israel, Panama
and Portugal scored best. While some of the 24 countries are rated
as economically unfree, all of them, the authors note, &quot;deserve
the close attention of the international investor because they
are liberalizing their economies (hence their improved 'Index'
scores) and building foundations for strong economic growth, an
environment in which most investments do well.&quot;
<P>
 The second edition of the &quot;Index&quot; also confirmed a
trend noted in the first edition -- that &quot;wealthy and economically
free countries tend over time to reintroduce restrictions on economic
freedom. As they become wealthy, countries begin adding welfare
and other social programs that were not affordable when they were
poorer. Thus, after they become economically 'liberated,' countries
like Germany, Sweden and even the United States tend to fall back
down the scale of economic freedom, getting worse scores than
newly emerging free economies like Hong Kong or Singapore.&quot;
Thus, &quot;economic freedom can rise and fall and the seeds of
destruction can exist in the fruits of success.&quot; 
<P>
<I><B>Highlights</B></I>
<P>
 The 1996 &quot;Index of Economic Freedom&quot; provides plenty
of food for thought, the authors noted. For example,
<P>
 <B>Asia:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Despite the enthusiasm of the investment community, Vietnam
continues to have one of the world's most repressed economies.
<P>
<li>Japan scored worse this year, moving from the &quot;free&quot;
to &quot;mostly free&quot; category, largely as a result of increased
banking regulations.
<P>
<li>India's score likewise declined, largely as a result of its
moves against some foreign investment and continued use of price
controls.
</ul><P>
 Heritage Foundation Vice President Kim Holmes said that &quot;The
'Index of Economic Freedom' provides an especially important benchmark
for evaluating the future success of Hong Kong after it reverts
to Chinese control in 1997. Any backsliding will obviously be
noted.&quot;
<P>
 <B>Europe:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Europe's freest economies are found in Switzerland, the Netherlands,
Denmark and Luxembourg, rather than the United Kingdom, Germany
or France. With better banking laws, the economies of Switzerland
and the Netherlands both were rated as more free than that of
the United States.
</ul><P>
 <B>Latin America &amp; the Caribbean</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>The Bahamas had the freest economy in the region and the 12th
freest in the world (tied with Canada and the Czech Republic).
It would have scored even better if not for trade restrictions.
<P>
<li>One of the true bright spots was Panama, which jumped ahead
of Chile in the 1996 rankings, making it the Latin American country
with the freest economy. Chile did not backslide; its overall
average also improved from 1995 to 1996. It's just that Panama's
improved even more, largely because Panama depoliticized its money
supply, abolishing its central bank and federal-reserve system
and adopting the U.S. dollar as its official currency. As a result,
the Panamanian government can no longer print money for political
purposes, causing inflation.
<P>
<li>Despite media reports about economic reform in Cuba, the authors
found little to cheer about, ranking Cuba's economy as the most
repressed in Latin America and one of the three most repressed
in the world.
</ul><P>
 <B>Africa/Middle East:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Ten countries in Northern Africa and the Middle East -- Bahrain,
United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Oman,
Israel, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon -- earned rankings of economically
free or &quot;mostly free.&quot; Just five countries in sub-Saharan
Africa earned such ratings: Botswana, Uganda, Swaziland, Benin
and Zambia.
<P>
<li>While some countries have liberalized their economies  -- Botswana's
score, for example, improved from 3.05 in 1995 to 2.8 in 1996
-- sub-Saharan Africa remains the most economically unfree &quot;and
by far the poorest&quot; region of the world. Indeed, of the 16
countries categorized as &quot;repressed&quot; in the 1996 &quot;Index,&quot; six were in Africa.</ul><p>

<b>WASHINGTON, NOV. 15, 1995</b> -- The U.S. delegation at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum meeting this weekend in Japan should work to revive the group's commitment to free trade in the region, which is being seriously undermined by the protectionist policies of Japan and China, according to a study released today by The Heritage Foundation.<P>
	Leaders from Asia and the Americas will meet under the auspices of APEC, an organization of Asia and Pacific Rim countries that have pledged to create free trade in the Asia and Pacific Rim by 2020.  President Clinton is expected to attend the meeting if  the budget battle with Congress does not keep him in Washington.<P>
	According to Heritage Foundation Policy Analyst Robert O'Quinn, author of the study, 	 Japan's proposal to allow APEC nations to exempt "sensitive economic sectors" like agriculture from free trade is an ominous sign for the future of APEC. "The proposal has become a flash point, dividing APEC into two warring camps. On one side are Japan and China, who want exemptions; on the other side are Australia, Canada, Chile, New Zealand, and the United States, who oppose exempting sectors from APEC trade liberalization," O'Quinn says.<P>   
	At the meeting, the U.S. delegation should:<P>

<ul><li>Tell Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama that selective exemptions to trade liberalization are unacceptable and threaten America's vital national interests. "Once one member is permitted to exempt a sensitive sector of their economy, other members will follow suit with their own protectionist demands," O'Quinn warns.
	<P><LI> Work closely with the leaders of Australia, Canada, Chile, Indonesia and New Zealand to block Japan's protectionist proposal. O'Quinn says the United States has some leverage here because most other APEC members disagree with Japan's protectionist approach. "The key will be to forge a consensus," says O'Quinn.   
	<P><li>Stress that blocking or delaying comprehensive trade liberalization would undermine APEC's institutional credibility. "Backsliding on free trade at Osaka could ring the death knell for APEC as an organization," O'Quinn warns.</ul>
	<P>The importance of APEC to the U.S. economy is illustrated in a related paper by Heritage Foundation Research Assistant John Dori. For example, Dori says, "in 1994, U.S. exports to East Asia and the Pacific Rim totaled more than $150 billion. More exports to Asia means more jobs for Americans." He says that in 1994, more than three million Americans owed their jobs to U.S. exports to Asia.<P>

<b>WASHINGTON, NOV. 13, 1995</b> -- Families would gain $32 billion in real disposable income over seven years, wages would increase faster and first-time home buyers would spend less on new mortgages if the congressional plan to cut taxes and balance the federal budget is approved, according to a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/beach.html">Heritage Foundation computer model study</a>.
	<P>"Over the next seven years, Congress's budget plan would lead to greater business investment, higher earnings per hour, and faster economic growth," Heritage Visiting Fellow in Tax Analysis <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a> says in the study, which is based on one of the same econometric models of the U.S. economy used by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, the Federal Reserve Board and other government bodies. Beach testified about the study today before a House Republican Policy Committee hearing on how the congressional budget reconciliation bill will affect the economy.
	<P>"Critics of balancing the budget by 2002 and simultaneously cutting taxes argue that these changes will send the economy into a recession," Beach says. "But this study shows that not only does no recession result at any time during the seven-year period, but the economy grows faster with these proposed budget changes than it would without them."
	<P> Beach says when lower federal taxes and a balanced federal budget are fed through the econometric model, developed by Lawrence H. Meyer & Associates, the result is higher household spending, lower interest rates, increased productivity, greater capital investment, and less inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI).<P>
	Housing starts and investment in new business machinery would increase by 2.1 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively, the study says. The computer segment of business durable equipment purchases would increase 2.9 percent, compared to current policy.
	<P>The study projects a slightly higher unemployment rate under the balanced-budget plan, due chiefly to a loss of public-sector jobs and lowered government demand for goods and services. The study notes, however, that its assumptions do not include action by the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy and thus create additional private-sector employment growth to absorb former public-sector workers.
<P>	Beach says the study's results may surprise both supporters and opponents of the congressional reconciliation package. "Supporters may have expected the economy to respond to a balanced budget with tax cuts more immediately, but the study indicates that the primary effect of balancing the budget is a steady, long-term improvement in the economy, not a short-term boost. Congress also would need to enact major reforms of the tax code to spur the very large level of capital formation and growth that proponents of, say, a flat tax predict."
	<P>Opponents of the reconciliation bill "should take comfort in the likelihood that the plan will not undermine economic growth, and will lower interest rates and inflation," Beach says.<P>

<h2>U.S.-Led Missile Defense System Urged for Asia</h2>
<h4>U.S. Critical To Shielding
Asian Allies From China</h4></center><P>


<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>
<p>


	<b>WASHINGTON, OCT. 24, 1995</b> --  America can best protect itself and its Asian allies against growing nuclear threats from China and North Korea by deploying as soon as possible both a national missile defense system for the continental United States, and theater missile defenses to protect U.S. naval and ground forces throughout the Pacific region, according to a new Heritage Foundation study released today.
<p>	Congress is currently considering alternative deployment schedules for missile defense systems as part of the 1996 military spending measure. A national missile defense system would intercept enemy missiles aimed at targets within the continental United States, while a theater missile defense system would knock down enemy missiles targeted against American militiary forces operating overseas or against U.S. allies.
<P>	Japan, South Korea and Australia should also be encouraged to buy and field their own American-made theater missile defense systems, while U.S. officials also should pressure China to limit its offensive nuclear missiles in exchange for sharing U.S. missile defense data, says the study's author, Heritage Senior Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/fisher.htm">Richard Fisher</a>.
<p>	"A national missile defense system is needed not only to defend Americans, but to demonstrate to U.S. allies and friends that they too need not be vulnerable to nuclear attack or blackmail," says Fisher. "The administration can enhance security in Asia by pursuing a strategy that defends Americans against missile attack and extends that umbrella to protect America's allies and friends throughout the region."
<p>	Failure to take these actions risks allowing The People's Republic of China or North Korea to use their own growing offensive missile capabilities to checkmate U.S. military strength in the Pacific region, and to intimidate U.S. allies throughout Asia, as occurred earlier this year when China "in a blatant act of intimidation" tested several of its weapons barely 100 miles from The Republic of China on Taiwan, Fisher says.
<p>	"Armed with nuclear warheads, these Chinese missiles could be used to devastate American bases or naval formations in Asia," Fisher points out. "China is believed to have about 300 nuclear warheads for its missile force. By the year 2010, according to one estimate, China could have 50 to 70 intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States from bases in China," notes Fisher.	China also is developing two new mobile missiles capable of hitting the western United States, and may have hired Russian technicians to aid in producing cruise missiles similar to the U.S. Tomahawk. China has even bought 60 Russian-made missile interceptors similar to the U.S. Patriot.
<p>	At the same time, North Korea is proceeding with work on its Taepo Dong missiles, which, Fisher says, "would give Pyongyang the capability to target U.S. forces in Guam, and possibly the western half of the continental United States, plus Europe, East Asia and Australia."
<p>	Fisher believes a national missile defense system would protect America's heartland against these emerging Chinese and North Korean  threats,  while theater defenses would provide a shield for U.S. forces stationed throughout the Pacific region and the U.S. allies they are defending. Without a credible U.S. response, America's Asian allies will be forced to seek their own deterrents to such intimidation.
<p>	Both houses of Congress have approved 1996 defense authorization bills that devote more than $3.5 billion to both national and theater missile defense systems, including the "Brilliant Eyes" space-based sensor system used to identify and track enemy missiles. That amount is about $1 billion more than requested by the Clinton administration.
<p>	The bills now in House-Senate conference would accelerate deployment of the two major theater systems -- the Navy's "Upper Tier" system and the Army's Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system -- to 1997. By contrast, the Clinton administration has set no official date to begin THAAD deployment, and sought only minimal Upper Tier funding.
<p>	Fisher says U.S. officials should urge U.S. allies in Asia to purchase American theater missile defense systems, enter into co-development programs, and then explore multilateral cooperation in missile defense activities. "By cooperating with Washington to develop and fund missile defenses, Asian nations for the first time will be able to share the burden of defending the United States and other countries from nuclear missile threats," Fisher says.
<p>	Finally, Fisher recommends that the United States inform China that it must live up to its commitments under the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and should join the Missile Technology Control Regime backed by the United States that limits the export of offensive missile technology. "Washington should tell Beijing that if it agrees to talks aimed at verifiable limits on its nuclear arsensal, the United States will make available to China early warning data from U.S.theater missile defense systems," Fisher says.
<p>	These actions must be taken by the United States because it is the only nation with "the technical capability and the moral vision to prevent its allies from falling victim to nuclear blackmail or engaging in destabilizing nuclear proliferation," Fisher says.

<h2>LABOR DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE 
CLOSED, ANALYST SAYS</h2>

<h4>DOL Responsibilities Should
 Be Turned Over To States</h4></center><p>



<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>

<p>
	<b>WASHINGTON, OCT. 23, 1995</b>  -- To reduce the job-killing cost and complexity of today's labor regulations while maintaining employment protections and workplace safety, Congress should abolish the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and shift its legitimate functions to the states, according to a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1058.html">Heritage Foundation study</a> released today.
<p>	"The proliferation of DOL regulations, while failing to make things significantly better for American workers, present a serious barrier to the creation of businesses and jobs," says <a href="/heritage/staff/wilson.htm">Mark Wilson</a>, Heritage's Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy. "Closing down the agency as a Cabinet-level department and shifting virtually all of its functions to the states could save as much as $10.5 billion during the next five years," he says.
<p>	In his comprehensive plan for abolishing the Labor Department, Wilson points out that about 75 percent of the department's current $38.8 billion budget is made up of funding for unemployment insurance and for employment services to the states, with job training constituting another 20 percent. "By turning over responsibility for these programs to the states, Congress could take 95 percent of what the DOL does away from far-away Washington bureaucrats and place responsibility for these tasks in the hands of state governments, which are closer to the real problems," Wilson says. This would enable states "to limit the duration of unemployment benefits, reduce payroll taxes, increase jobs, and try new ways to privatize many of DOL's functions," says Wilson.
<p>	Among the job-training programs for the economically disadvantaged that Wilson says should be consolidated into a single block grant to the states are the Job Corps, Senior Community Service Employment Program, Migrant and Seasonal Farm Workers Training, and Indian and Native American Employment and Training. Wilson says states should be required to focus resources for these programs on job placement and to objectively measure the effectiveness of each.
<p>	All other present DOL-funded job-training programs, he says, could be folded into another block grant, which would include programs for dislocated workers, the School-to-Work and Adult Technology Learning programs, Wilson says. "Even DOL itself has acknowledged that making block grants of these programs would eliminate conflicting rules and administrative structures, remove bureaucracy at every level, and end the wasting of tax dollars," he says.
<p>	Wilson says Congress, as part of the process of dismantling DOL, should repeal outdated labor laws, executive orders and regulations, reform the Fair Labor Standards Act and abolish the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. It should repeal the executive order for affirmative action and related regulations governing federal contractors and subcontractors, he says.
<p>	Under Wilson's plan, the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau would be shifted to a newly-created sub-Cabinet agency called the Bureau of National Statistics, as proposed earlier this year by The Heritage Foundation in a proposal for reorganizing the federal government and balancing the federal budget.
<p>	At the same time, DOL's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Mine Safety and Health Administration should be combined, Wilson says, and the newly formed agency made subject to an independent workplace standards-setting board. The new board would "redefine the role of the federal government in workplace safety from that of heavy-handed regulator to one of cooperative partner with the private sector," Wilson says. 
<p>	"Labor market conditions and labor-management relations have changed dramatically since the days when most of America's labor laws were written and the Labor Department that enforces them was created," says Wilson. "Workers are demanding more flexible hours, working conditions and compensation packages than current law and regulations allow. This means a fundamental rethinking of DOL and federal labor policy is needed."
<p>	"Congress should move aggressively to abolish DOL and reform federal labor law to insure that excessive regulatory burdens are removed, labor market flexibility is increased for workers and businesses alike, and basic workplace safety protections are made more effective," Wilson says.<p><p>

<b>	WASHINGTON, OCT. 17, 1995</b> -- The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) should be abolished because it routinely engages in political advocacy and frequently lobbies at taxpayer expense for expanded welfare spending, according to a new Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bg1057.html">study</a>  released today.
<p>	Among the causes LSC supports with taxpayer funds are adoption rights for homosexuals, preventing drug dealers' evictions from public housing, racial quotas in higher education and protecting welfare benefits for illegal immigrants, according to the study's authors, Kenneth F. Boehm and Peter T. Flaherty, who are, respectively, chairman and president of the Vienna, Virginia-based National Legal and Policy Center.
<p>	Reforming LSC is not feasible, say Boehm and Flaherty, because it is virtually unaccountable to taxpayers who fund it and beyond effective oversight by either Congress or the president.
<p>	"For the past 30 years, LSC has been the legal pillar of the welfare state. Through its litigation, advocacy and lobbying, LSC has caused hundreds of billions of dollars in increased local, state and federal welfare spending, and helped add millions of people to the welfare rolls," say Boehm and Flaherty. "LSC cannot be reformed because it was designed to avoid external controls. It should be abolished," they say of the federal corporation that is supposed to help poor people who can't afford to hire an attorney.
	<p>LSC-supported groups have successfully sought countless federal and state court decisions to nullify "moral" conditions connected to welfare benefits such as identifying fathers of illegitimate children, the authors say. Too often, such cases are pursued by LSC-funded groups at the expense of genuine problems facing poor people such as bankruptcy, child-support, custody and guardianship proceedings, landlord controversies, and employment issues, Boehm and Flaherty say.
<p>	At the root of the problem is LSC's legal structure and the unaccountability that structure fosters. Chartered by Congress in 1974 as a independent, private, non-profit corporation,  LSC receives about $400 million in federal funds annually. The way the corporation distributes its money "makes it immune from the safeguards that govern other federal spending," say Boehm and Flaherty. 
<p>	The LSC distributes the money it gets from Congress in the form of grants to 323 private lawyers' groups across the country. At the same time, these groups also receive funds (about $225 million annually) from state and local governments, lawyers groups, and other private sources.
<p>	Even though Congress gives LSC millions of federal dollars every year, LSC employees are not considered federal employees under the corporation's federal charter. As a result, LSC's "status as a private corporation exempts it from provisions of the federal criminal code, including the Anti-Deficiency Act that makes it a felony for government workers to misappropriate public money," say Boehm and Flaherty.
<p>	Further removing LSC from even minimal scrutiny is the fact that nobody outside of the corporation knows how it spends public funds, since its attorneys keep no time sheets, and it is impossible to judge how well LSC attorneys represent clients because all case records are kept secret under a claim of attorney-client privilege.
<p>	"Lack of timekeeping prevents oversight by eliminating the only real way to track the activities of LSC lawyers, and there are no provisions for waiving the attorney-client privilege for purposes of oversight, even though tax funds pay for the services rendered," say Boehm and Flaherty.
<p>	Taken together, these factors mean "it makes little difference who sits in the White House, in Congress or on the LSC's governing board. As long as they flow through the LSC to its 323 grantees, public funds will be spent to further a political agenda that serves the interests of the welfare state and its allies against those of productive taxpayers," contend Boehm and Flaherty.
<p>	"Because money is fungible in the hands of private groups with more than one funding source, no new restrictions can insure the accountability of taxpayer funds given LSC. For the sake of the American taxpayer and for the sake of America's poor, it is time to abolish LSC," Boehm and Flaherty say.

<p>
	<b>WASHINGTON, OCTOBER 16, 1995</b> -- If Medicare is not reformed,  industry and government will have to pass on additional yearly costs of at least $7.4 billion to investors, consumers and taxpayers and $115.7 billion in direct taxes and reduced wages to workers, according to a Heritage Foundation analysis released today.
<p>	The authors of the study, senior fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/winston.htm">David Winston</a> and domestic policy research analysts Christine Olson and Rea Hederman, have included an industry-by-industry analysis showing how much businesses, employees and consumers will have to pay each year as a result of an additional 3.52 percent Medicare payroll tax the program's trustees say will be necessary to finance the current system without reform. 
<P>	Topping the industry list are retail trade, educational services and public administration, which together will shoulder nearly $15 billion, or 25 percent of the yearly cost of the additional tax before passing it on to employees, customers and investors. "Businesses and employees in the retail trade industry alone will pay more than $13.3 billion in extra payroll taxes each year -- with employees picking up more than $12.5 billion of that tab -- if Medicare is not reformed," the Heritage analysts say.
<p>	"The reason the burden is so heavy on employees is that an increase in payroll taxes technically is shared by both the employer and the employee. Experience shows that about 88 percent of the cost of additional employer taxes is passed on to workers in the form of reduced wages and compensation," according to the study. 
<p>	"Without significant reform of the system or increases in the current payroll tax to maintain the level of benefits and spending, Medicare will go bankrupt," the analysts say. "For Medicare to remain financially solvent and able to pay for hospital care for today's 'baby boomers' when they retire, Congress needs to either find additional money or slow down its rate of spending."

<title>Flat Tax Earns High Marks -- Heritage PR</title>

<h2>FLAT TAX EARNS HIGH MARKS 
IN STUDY OF TAX REFORM PLANS</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b><br>
<p>

<b>	WASHINGTON, SEPT. 26, 1995</b> -- Of all the tax-reform proposals ready to be considered by Congress, the flat tax proposal sponsored by House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey, R-Texas, and Sen. Richard Selby, R-Ala., received the highest marks in a Heritage Foundation study released today. <p>
	The study, conducted by Heritage economist <a href="/heritage/staff/mitchell.htm">Daniel Mitchell</a>, McKenna senior fellow in political economy, is aimed at assisting lawmakers, who must decide which of the major tax-reform proposals is best for taxpayers and the U.S. economy. 
<p>	"Tax reform is gaining momentum. The existing income-tax system is fundamentally broken and cannot be fixed without a complete overhaul," Mitchell says. "Of all the plans currently being considered in Congress, the Armey flat tax addresses the most serious problems in the simplest, most straight-forward way."
<p>	The Armey plan would ensure fairness by taxing individuals and businesses with a 17 percent flat rate on all income. The plan, which is based on the model developed by Stanford Professor Robert Hall and Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Alvin Rabushka, would ensure simplicity by allowing taxes to be filed using a postcard-sized return. By contrast, the current income-tax system has more than 400 different forms.
<p>	Mitchell says the flat tax's low rate would encourage economic growth by increasing the value of income-producing assets, such as rental property and investments of all kinds. On the other hand, he says, the flat tax would reduce the incentive to invest in tax shelters, a practice that keeps huge amounts of capital from circulating and producing wealth in the U.S. economy. "With these extra billions in circulation, all Americans will benefit," Mitchell says. 
<p>	The flat tax also would end the practice of using the tax system for social engineering. Mitchell says by removing the progressive component from America's tax structure, the flat tax would stop penalizing economic success. It would encourage savings and investment by taxing income only once, and would significantly reduce the number of preferences and deductions now available under the existing income tax code.
<p>	Another version of the flat tax, sponsored by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., also received high marks from Mitchell. But the Specter proposal seeks a slightly higher rate (20 percent) and would allow for some limited deductions for charitable contributions, including the full deduction for home mortgages. Mitchell says the Specter flat-tax plan is less attractive because it would still allow for government micromanagement of the economy.
<p>	But either way, Mitchell says the time is ripe for reform of the current tax system. "Its complexity forces even the most sophisticated Americans to pay professionals to fill out their tax forms; one study put annual compliance costs at nearly $200 billion." The current system subjects some forms of income, particularly from savings and investment, to as many as four different levels of taxation. "For example, under the current tax system, a single dollar of income can be subject to the corporate income tax, the personal income tax, the capital gains tax, and estate taxes," he says. 
<P>	"Politicians have turned the tax code into a bewildering system of special preferences, penalties and deductions," Mitchell says. Such complexity is inevitable in a system that rewards those with expensive lawyers and accountants and allows lawmakers to micromanage the economy. Mitchell says the system will never change as long as politicians are able to collect large campaign contributions from donors seeking to change or preserve sections of the tax code. 
<p>	"While other reform proposals, such as the value added (VAT) tax and the national sales tax, have some advantages, they contained features that more closely resembled the current system, offering little or no improvement over the status quo," he says.

<title>Federal Health Program Success Lesson for Medicare Reform -- Heritage PR</title>

<h2>FEDERAL HEALTH PROGRAM SUCCESS IS LESSON
 FOR MEDICARE REFORMERS, ANALYST SAYS</h2></center><hr>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>
<p>

	<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 25, 1995</b> -- Medicare reformers in Congress should heed important lessons on consumer choice and health insurance cost controls demonstrated by the highly successful Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), according to a Heritage Foundation analyst.
<p>	"The FEHBP has shown a remarkable success in controlling costs. While average premium increases next year will be only four-tenths of one percent, FEHBP enrollees last year experienced an average annual decrease of 3.3 percent," says Heritage Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert E. Moffit</a> in a study released today. FEHBP contrasts sharply with the current  Medicare system's 10.5 percent per year average increase. Annual private-sector price increases have averaged 6 percent per year during a comparable period, according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers FEHBP.<p>
	House Republicans recently proposed a package of Medicare reforms that "take some modest steps" in directions suggested by Heritage health care experts. But the FEHBP experience ought to provide further policy direction for congressional reformers, Moffit says.
<p>	The vivid contrast between Medicare's spiralling costs and FEHBP's successful cost controls is due to the fact that FEHBP -- which covers nine million members of Congress and their staffs, federal employees, retirees and their families -- holds down premium costs by depending primarily upon consumer choice and competition among about 400 coverage providers, says Moffit.
<p>	Significantly, FEHBP's ability to hold costs down is achieved despite covering what is far from an ideal insurance pool, he says. "Older workers and retirees cost significantly more to cover than younger, more active employees. The federal workforce is older than the private-sector workforce: the average federal worker is almost 44 years of age, while the average private-sector worker is about 38 years of age. Moreover, the ratio of retirees to active workers has increased steadily during the past several years, so that nearly 40 percent of all FEHBP subscribers are retirees," according to Moffit.
   <p>	 By comparison to Medicare's "one-size-fits-all" approach, "FEHBP shows that giving enrollees the right to choose plans in a comprehensive market forces insurers to improve value for money, not simply to cut costs," Moffit says.
<p>	Government workers and retirees would have fared even better in FEHBP in recent years if Congress had changed the program to a defined contribution that is indexed to inflation, rather than retaining the current complex formula, Moffit says. The formula is based on the average premiums for the six largest FEHBP insurance providers, with a statutory ceiling of the government's share of premium costs set at 75 percent.
<p>	Converting FEHBP to a defined contribution consisting of "a clearly defined annual dollar amount" with future increases tied to the Consumer Price Index "would give private insurers a powerful incentive for offering attractive packages of benefits at a price equal to or even less than the amount of the government's contribution. This would reduce the out-of-pocket costs to workers and retirees and increase their savings even more," says Moffit.
<p> 	In a related study released today, Heritage Vice President <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Stuart Butler</a> says Congress is now considering Medicare reforms that would set up a system somewhat like FEHBP.  But further reforms are needed to complete the task of creating "a Medicare program that moderates the growth in costs, while giving America's elderly many new choices and much more control over their own health care."
<p>	The most important provision of the House Medicare reform plan, for example, is the Medicare Plus option, which allows seniors to choose a private-sector health plan paid with a government contribution based on the enrollee's age and other basic risk factors, Butler says.
<p>	But other features of the House plan "raise concerns," according to Butler, including a provision "to use the failed approach of price controls" to limit government Medicare spending. The House plan also makes the "serious mistake" of making Medicare Plus plans cap their deductibles and co-payments at the same level required by the traditional Medicare plan.
<p>	Butler also faults the House plan for requiring Medicare Plus plans to match the benefits offered by the traditional Medicare program. Congress should instead follow FEHBP's statuatory language requiring insurers to provide a basic core of benefits, but otherwise leave them free to group benefits, medical procedures, treatments, and costs in packages as they see fit.
<p>	"These and other problems need to be dealt with, but overall the House plan indicates that Congress is at last prepared to make the changes needed to stabilize Medicare's finances so that it is still there when today's workers reach retirement," says Butler.

<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 22, 1995</b> To end the nation's vulnerability to ballistic-missile attack as quickly as possible, congressional conferees should reject the House version of the defense authorization bill and endorse the Senate bill's "clear, concise and detailed instructions" for deployment of a national missile-defense system in the year 2003, according to a Heritage Foundation analyst.
<p>	"Without a specific deployment date and a detailed plan, nothing will be deployed because the Clinton administration -- since it is against erecting missile defenses in the first place -- will use the lack of a timetable to put off deployment indefinitely," according to Heritage Senior Defense Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a>. Because of this factor, Spring says "Congress cannot afford to give the administration much leeway, and the Senate bill doesn't give it."
<p>	Spring says the Senate bill includes detailed instructions that are much needed but lacking in the House bill. For example, he says in addition to instructions for National Missile Defenses (NMD), the Senate measure fixes the same starting date for deployment of Theater Missile Defenses (TMD), to protect U.S. allies and forces stationed overseas, and defines the core programs the Pentagon will need to erect both systems.   
<p>	For the NMD system, Spring says, the Senate bill includes instructions for "deploying interceptors at more than one site, establishing both interim and initial deployment dates, and setting forth specific options for upgrading existing radars and streamlining acquisition procedures." For TMD systems, the Senate bill designates as core programs "an upgraded Patriot Missile, the Navy Lower and Upper Tier defense systems and the Army's Theater High-Altitude-Area Defense system." The House version, by contrast, contains no instructions for TMD deployment or requirements.
<p>	"Further, the Senate bill would insure that TMD systems are capable of working together so several systems could be used against the same missile attack," Spring points out. Also, the Senate measure lets TMD systems use data from external sensors, including those based in space, to identify and track targets, and "requires the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress next year on the options available for augmenting ground-, sea- and space-based defenses." This last requirement, Spring says, "will force the Pentagon to examine the advantages of sea- and space-based over more expensive ground-based defenses."
<p>	Spring says the Senate bill takes the proper approach toward the future of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty. "By requiring a comprehensive review of the pact to determine its continuing value and validity," the Senate bill creates an opening for eventually doing away with the ABM treaty, since it was signed with the former Soviet Union, and is often used to make a case against missile defenses.
<p>	On all of these issues, Spring says congressional conferees should "move as quickly as possible; otherwise the nation will remain needlessly vulnerable to ballistic-missile attack."

<P>
	WASHINGTON, SEPT. 20, 1995</B> -- The combined general and payroll tax hike that will be needed to save Medicare -- if Congress doesn't restructure the system -- will increase the tax burden by more than a trillion dollars over the next five years, according to analysts at The Heritage Foundation. The other alternative would be a steep cutback in services.
<P>	The options before Congress are limited, say Heritage analysts Robert Moffit, John Liu and David Winston in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/fyi62.html">report</a> released today. Congress must either restructure and reform the program along the lines of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), which allows consumer choice and market competition to keep health-care prices down, dramatically increase payroll and general taxes on American families and businesses, or drastically cut back on services for the elderly.
<P>	"The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) already projects that during the next five years Medicare Part B, which covers doctors' fees and other services, will need an estimated $370.5 billion in general taxes," the Heritage analysts say. On top of that, if Congress resorts to an increase in the payroll tax to save Medicare Part A, the hospitalization program trust fund, this will require an estimated 3.5 percent hike on top of the current level of 2.9 percent, or $711 billion in new revenue over the next five years. "Right now, when you look at the  combined level of taxation needed to save Medicare, the amount is almost triple President Clinton's 1993 tax hike, which ranks as the largest in U.S. history."	
<P>	Yet, the Heritage analysts say transforming Medicare into a health-care program that would work like FEHBP, the popular 35-year-old consumer-driven program that covers retired congressional and federal workers, "would allow Medicare users to pick government-certified private insurance plans and receive a government contribution toward the purchase of those plans. What Heritage proposes is a far more attractive alternative than strangling American workers and businesses with enormous new taxes," the analysts say.
<P>  	They also warn of the possible effects of such taxation. "Any new payroll tax assessed to shore up Medicare ultimately will be felt by America's working families in the form of reduced wages or compensation and in some cases, even the loss of jobs."
<P>	The Heritage analysts point out that while Congress is focusing mainly on fixing Medicare Part A, it must also deal with Part B in order to come up with a permanent solution for Medicare's financial plight. Again, without a major restructuring of the entire Medicare system, CBO projections indicate that the taxes needed to fund Part B will jump from an estimated $57.5 billion in 1996 to $93.5 billion by the year 2000.
<P>	The Heritage analysts used 1993 earnings data to compute the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/wel-62mp.html">state-by-state impact</a> of a 3.5 percent payroll tax increase -- the estimated figure needed to achieve long-term actuarial balance for the Medicare system -- on workers throughout the country. They found that if such a payroll tax increase had been in effect in 1993, employees and employers would have faced more than $123 billion in new taxes that year. Under this scenario, wage earners in Wyoming would have faced a total of $101.2 million in additional taxes, the low range, while California wage earners would have paid an additional $7.7 billion.
<P>	Even worse, employees would have suffered more than $115 billion in lost earnings. On average, the combined tax and wage loss to employees would have ranged from $656 in Arkansas to $1,081 in New Jersey. Similar significant losses were projected throughout the country.
<P>	"No one wants to drastically cut back Medicare services or impose yet another biggest-in-history tax hike on the American people," the Heritage analysts warn. "That's why it's so important that Congress take a serious look at the only viable alternative: restructuring of Medicare along the lines of  market competition and consumer choice."

<h3>State-by-State Analysis
Reveals Billion-Dollar Winners</h3>




<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br>
<p>
	WASHINGTON, SEPT. 19, 1995</b> -- Freeing America's farmers by ending New Deal-era crop subsidies, price supports and land reserves would generate $135 billion in new income distributed throughout all 50 states during the next decade, according to a new Heritage Foundation study released today.
<p>	The study  -- based on a computer model of the nation's economy developed by Heritage to measure the impact of ending the federal farm program -- comes as Congress considers reforms of a wide range of agriculture programs.
<p>	"Freeing U.S. farmers would bring millions of previously idle acres back into productive use, and generate a $135 billion expansion of the nation's economy," say Heritage Fellows <a href="/heritage/staff/fryden.htm">John Frydenlund</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/winston.htm">David Winston</a>, co-authors of the Heritage study. "Every state would share in the economic expansion -- even those that are not agriculture producers -- because they supply farmers elsewhere or handle farm products."
<p>	Increased farm production would fuel demand for seed, fertilizer and equipment such as tractors, as well as generate expansion of the food processing, packaging, transportation and shipping industries, the Heritage analysts say.
<p>	Earlier this year, Frydenlund wrote Heritage's comprehensive proposal for agriculture reform, called "Freeing America's Farmers: The Heritage Plan for Rural Prosperity." The Heritage proposal suggests ending the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) that keeps more than 36 million acres of farm land idle. This government attempt to control farm prices limits the supply of a wide variety of crops and products, including wheat, corn, cotton, rice, sugar, peanuts and milk.
<p>	The Heritage plan would phase out CRP over a five-year period, thus freeing U.S. farmers to return the now-idled acres to production to meet worldwide food demand that experts say will triple in coming years.
<p>	"If farmers were free of the controls that now restrict their output, they would enjoy a surge in new income even when modest declines in prices are taken into account," Frydenlund and Winston say. In the first year alone, more than $2 billion net additional farm income would result, with the annual total reaching $4 billion by the year 2001, and more than $18 billion annually thereafter.
<p>	In Kansas, for example, farmers (primarily wheat producers) would enjoy a $1 billion boost in the first year, while in Iowa, a leading corn producer, the first-year increase would exceed $800 million. For Texas, a major producer of most farm products, the increase would exceed $1 billion, Frydenlund and Winston say.
<p>	Non-farm states like Rhode Island "would reap large benefits" as a result of increased demand for shipping and transportation services, especially those related to exports. In fact, any state with significant export activities or port facilities, such as Louisiana and a number of other coastal and Great Lakes states, would derive more in benefits than they would gain through increased agricultural production," observe Frydenlund and Winston. A state-by-state analysis is included with the study.
<p>	 In a related study to be released later this week, Frydenlund says the sugar, peanut and dairy programs are perfect examples of why reform is needed. All three programs are "beyond repair and no amount of tinkering can fix them," says Frydenlund, because each uses complex systems of quotas and allotments to limit who can produce how much for sale at what price, as well as where it can be grown and where it can be sold.
<p>	The sugar program, for example, "is big government and corporate welfare at its worst. Almost half of the estimated $1.4 billion in federal benefits created by the program go to 1 percent of the sugar growers. In fact, 33 growers and corporations each receive more than $1 million per year, and a Florida family received more than $65 million in one year alone," says Frydenlund.
<p>	"Incremental changes in these programs will not be reform. Instead, Congress needs to adopt real reform of these programs by either eliminating or gradually phasing out the quotas and allotments that benefit so few at the expense of consumers," the Heritage analysts say.<p>

<h2><center> HOUSE SPENDING BILLS FALL FAR SHORT OF PROMISED  GOVERNMENT OVERHAUL, ANALYSTS SAY</h2> </center>
Contact: Jeff Dickerson or Weldon Freeman, Heritage Public Relations at (202) 675-1761 <br><br>
<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b><br><br>





	<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 15, 1995</b> -- Instead of  carrying out the voters' mandate for a radical overhaul of the federal government, the new House spending bills "merely downsize the status quo, leaving the door open to return to bloated, wasteful spending in a few short years," according to a study released today by The Heritage Foundation.
<p>	The study focuses on 11 of the 13 appropriations bills approved by the House since May when the chamber approved a plan to balance the federal budget in seven years. While savings achieved by those bills total about $24 billion, many more billions could be saved if the House terminated obsolete programs, as suggested by Heritage earlier this year in a detailed study showing how to reduce the number of Cabinet-level departments from the current 14 to five.
<p>	Rather than terminating obsolete programs, however, the House imposed relatively equal across-the-board spending cuts that otherwise leave the programs alive and well, according to the study by Heritage's Grover M. Herman Fellow in Federal Budgetary Affairs <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a> and budget analyst John Barry.
<p>	"Congress is leaving in place hundreds of obsolete federal programs that ought to be shut down, but that will instead continue to waste taxpayer dollars, just at reduced spending levels," say Hodge and Barry. "This leaves the door open for government to return to the path of increasing deficits and burdensome taxes, as happened when Reagan-era spending cuts were restored by the Bush and Clinton administrations."
<p>	In May, Hodge and Barry point out, Republicans "promised to downsize the government by terminating programs that do not work, eliminating those that have become obsolete or outmoded, consolidating programs that duplicate others, ending corporate welfare, and transferring to state and local governments programs more appropriately carried out by them."
<p>	But instead, appropriations bills adopted since May show the House merely shaved relatively equal amounts from all programs in order to achieve the savings required to balance the budget on schedule, say the Heritage analysts.
<p>	The House agriculture spending bill, for example, "merely trims perennial sources of pork-barrel outlays by 4.3 percent overall," but triples funding for the office of the Agriculture Secretary, boosts by 33 percent the obsolete Rural Electrification Administration's budget, and adds 8 percent to Natural Resources Conservation Service spending.
<p>	Similarly, the Commerce-State-Justice appropriation includes only "modest trims" averaging  4.5 percent, but the Maritime Administration's budget is hiked 23 percent, and programs that ought to be terminated outright like the Economic Development Administration (EDA) and National Telecommunications and Information Administration are kept alive.
<p>	The Energy and Water Development appropriation imposes a "mild 5.5 percent cut on the Army Corps of Engineers, another favorite source of pork-barrel projects," say Hodge and Barry. But the measure pours more tax dollars into other needless spending projects -- like $4.2 million for maintenance of the Sam Rayburn Dam and Lake in Texas -- and puts another $3.3 billion in the Energy Supply, Research and Development program that has received more than $70 billion since 1977 with little or nothing to show for it.
<p>	If Congress is truly serious about restructuring government, Hodge and Barry say, it will use the upcoming conferences on the appropriations bills to terminate such outmoded and obsolete programs as: Job Corps ($1.2 billion); Amtrak subsidies ($628 million);  Appalachian Regional Commission ($142 million),  and Legal Services Corporation ($278 million).
<p>	Corporate welfare programs Congress should cut include: Rural Electrification Administration ($122 million); Export-Import Bank ($786.5 million); Public Broadcasting Facilities Grants ($19 million); Manufacturing Extension Partnership Programs ($81 million),  Small Business Administration ($590 million), and Federal Transit Administration ($3.9 billion).
<p>	If Congress fails to terminate such programs, Hodge and Barry say, there will be a replay of events during the Reagan administration when 94 federal programs were recommended for termination. According to a congressional study, only 12 were actually shut down, and some of them were later replaced by larger, more expensive programs.
<p>	The Small Business Administration (SBA), for instance, was slashed starting in 1981 during Reagan's first term from more than $2 billion to $557 million by 1986. But SBA rebounded during the Bush and Clinton administrations to a budget of nearly $1 billion. Merely trimming agency budgets leaves in place a federal bureaucracy that works hand-in-hand with special-interest groups to pressure Congress to restore funding to previous levels, say Hodge and Barry. This is what they believe may happen if the current House budget passes.
<p>	The Heritage budget analysts praise only two of the House-passed appropriations bills:  Education, Labor and Health and Human Resources, which eliminates 170 programs, and the Interior Department, which eliminates six agencies and 49 programs.

<h2><center>U.S.-ASIAN COMMERCE ON THE RISE  <br>
DESPITE TRADE WAR FEARS<br><br></h2></center>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br><br>
<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b><br><br>
	<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 8, 1995</b> --  America's exports to Asia totaled $153 billion and sustained 3.1 million American jobs in 1994, according to the 1995 edition of the U.S. and Asia Statistical Handbook, compiled by analysts at The Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center (ASC). The just-released Handbook shows a 12 percent increase in exports over the previous year, and the number of Asia-related jobs grew by 500,000.<p>
	ASC analysts caution that this positive trend will be reversed unless the Clinton administration adopts a more non-threatening trans-Pacific free-trade policy. "The confrontational approach to Japan is an example of brinkmanship," says James Przystup, ASC director, "which, were it not for last-minute compromise, almost led to a full-scale trade war."<p>
	
Such a trade war would quickly spread from one Pacific rim nation to another, ASC analysts believe. The resulting bitterness and economic tension would inevitably pit America against its allies - - just at a time when U.S.-Asia multilateral cooperation on security issues is most needed. This is because many countries are concerned about the People's Republic of China's (PRC) growing military strength and the assertive way in which it challenged the Philippines' claims over the Spratly Islands. In addition, the PRC's recent long-range missile exercises near the Republic of China on Taiwan have reinforced Asia's anxiety about Chinese intentions. <p>
	The PRC's muscle-flexing is not the only challenge to existing regional security alliances. "The administration's response to North Korea's nuclear-weapons program has caused consternation among our Asian allies," says ASC Senior Policy Analyst and Handbook Editor Richard D. Fisher. "Throughout 1995," says Fisher, "the administration acted as if its managed-trade agenda held precedence over regional security." <p>
	Fisher says the U.S. policy of trade confrontation - - combined with frequent administration flip-flops on diplomatic issues - - has left Asians confused about the firmness of America's commitment to the goal of open markets. This, in turn, jeopardizes U. S. leadership on global trade, crucial to forums such as the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) organization. Leaders of the major Asian economic powers already are preparing for the scheduled November APEC summit at Osaka, Japan. <p>
	Most governments and businesses in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region at last agree that free-trade is the cornerstone of continued economic growth. "There is opportunity presented by this victory over Asia's long-held protectionist policies," says Fisher, "but we might lose that opportunity because of the administration's seeming abandonment of free trade."<p>
	Handbook data demonstrate how Asia's initial round of market-opening reforms are benefiting  American businesses. A country-by-country analysis reveals that sales of "Made In USA" goods and services are growing in the region's increasingly affluent countries: Malaysia's imports reached $7 billion, an increase of 17 percent over the 1993 level. The level of South Korea's imports from the United States was $18 billion, a 22 percent increase. Singapore's $13 billion represented an 11 percent increase. American exports to Thailand reached $4.9 billion, an increase of 30 percent over 1993.<p>
	Handbook statistics show several states are reaping substantial economic benefits from this explosion of commerce. More than 828,000 California jobs are dependent on Asia-bound exports - -  which rose by 20 percent in 1994 and reached $41.4 billion. In Texas, 247,000 jobs were sustained as exports rose 19 percent above 1993 levels, reaching $12.4 billion. Illinois' $6.6 billion worth of exports - - supporting 131,000 statewide jobs - - represents a 23 percent increase.<p>
	Pacific-bound commerce accounts for a significant share of jobs and income in other states. Pennsylvania, Ohio, Oregon, and New York all witnessed at least 10 percent growth in the value of their Asian exports. Furthermore, the Handbook shows many smaller states are also gaining from this boom. For example, Maryland's $3 billion worth of exports reaching Asian consumers represented a 40 percent increase over the level in 1993, and supported 28,000 jobs.<p>
	Key social, political, military, and economic statistics on all Asia-Pacific nations are included in the Handbook. This year's edition also contains data on 19 Asia-Pacific countries adapted from the Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom.<p>
	According to Przystup, "the data show that free-trade is a driving force for the economic growth that leads to democratization and security. America dares not lose historic diplomatic and economic opportunities through lack of a coherent policy towards Asia."<p>

<h2><center>BENEFITS "CAP" DECREASES<br>
OUT-OF-WEDLOCK BIRTHS, ANALYST SAYS</h2><br>
<h3>Abortions Didn't Increase <br>
Under New Jersey Program<br><br></h3></center>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br><br>

<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b><p>
	<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 7, 1995 </b>-- New Jersey's "family cap" policy -- which denies increases in cash welfare benefits to single mothers who have additional children while already receiving welfare -- has resulted in a significant decline in out-of-wedlock births with no corresponding increase in abortions.<p>
	According to Heritage Foundation welfare analyst Robert Rector, the evidence from New Jersey indicates that in the 16 months after the cap went into effect, there was an average decrease in out-of-wedlock births of 10 percent. This, even though the average decrease in benefits came to just 4 percent of the monthly Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) benefits received by the typical welfare mother. There was no statistically significant corresponding increase in abortions, according to Rector, who obtained his information from New Jersey's Department of Human Services in Trenton.<p>
	"The New Jersey data show why Congress should consider imposing a similar cap on benefits to welfare mothers who have additional children as part of an overall welfare-reform strategy for reducing illegitimacy," says Rector, Heritage's senior analyst for welfare and family issues.<p>
	The family cap went into effect in October of 1992, and gave affected mothers -- those already enrolled in AFDC -- a 10-month grace period, meaning the limit on benefits applied only those who bore children after July 1993.    <p>     
	"In the year before the cap, the average monthly number of births was 1,331; in the 16 months after the cap went into effect, average monthly births among AFDC mothers fell to 1,197. The cap appears to have caused an average decrease of 134 births per month, or 10 percent," Rector concludes.<p>	
	"Critics claim that the family cap has not caused an actual decrease in the number of illegitimate births, but merely a delay in welfare mothers reporting births to the welfare office," Rector says. "But mothers on AFDC in New Jersey still have a huge economic incentive -- in the form of an increase in food stamp and Medicaid benefits for each additional child born -- to notify the welfare department of a childbirth." Moreover, Rector says the official data from New Jersey are adjusted to include births reported late, and still show a decline in illegitimacy.<p>
	Rector says previously reported data leaked to the press by scholars at Rutgers University -- data that supposedly showed no decrease in out-of-wedlock births as a result of New Jersey's policy -- were not conclusive. Rector points out that the Rutgers scholars have yet to finish their evaluation, have yet to issue an official report, and that their study did not, in fact, show zero effect on out-of-wedlock births. "In fact, the Rutgers analysis shows a lower rate of out-of-wedlock births after the cap went into effect," says Rector.<p>

<center><h2>HOUSE FARM BILL A "GOOD FIRST STEP"<br>
 BUT MORE NEEDED, ANALYST SAYS</h2><br></center><br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br><br>
<h4>Study Projects $135 Billion Economic
Boost From  Phasing Out Farm Programs</h4><br><br>
<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b>	<br><br>
<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 6, 1995 </b>-- House Agriculture Committee Chairman Rep. Pat Roberts' farm reform bill is "a good first step" but the Kansas Republican's proposal needs major changes to achieve real benefits for American farmers and consumers, according to a Heritage Foundation analyst.<p>
	In a paper released today, John Frydenlund, director of Heritage's Agricultural Policy Project, says the bill -- which is scheduled for markup by the House Agriculture Committee September 13-15 -- needs a definite date when current farm programs and payments will end. The termination date should be in five years, Frydenlund says, not the seven suggested by the Roberts bill.<p>
	Nevertheless, he says, the Roberts bill, if implemented, would "significantly enhance the opportunity for farmers to meet the growing demands of the world marketplace." By extricating America's farmers from bureaucratic planting requirements, the bill would "allow farmers to produce to meet domestic consumer demand rather than to satisfy the dictates of the federal government," says Frydenlund.<p>
	Roberts' "Freedom to Farm Act" eliminates supply-control programs such as the Acreage Reduction Program, ends the Farmer-Owned Reserve for excess crop production, and replaces current target and deficiency payments with a new seven-year system of declining transitional payments, Frydenlund says.<p>
	But he believes the bill can work only if it locks in a deadline for phasing out these programs. "While Roberts' bill locks in fixed declining payments to farmers for the next seven years, there is no guarantee that these payments will cease at the end of the seven years," Frydenlund says. "The result could be buying a few years of time under the guise of real reform, only to slip back to the status quo when reducing the federal budget is no longer a top priority in Congress. In future years, supporters of centrally planned agriculture could point to any slight downturn in prices or land values as justification for a return to the current system of government controls," he says.<p>
	 The Roberts bill also should be changed to cap the transition payments for particular crops to prevent their "becoming an exorbitant windfall" if prices soar before the end of the phaseout period, and to "eliminate or at least drastically reduce" the Conservation Reserve Program, which keeps up to 36 million acres of otherwise productive land idled, Frydenlund says.<p>
	Finally, Frydenlund believes Congress should impose a spending cap on the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) program and limit its borrowing authority. Under the current CCC,  there is little to constrain the Secretary of Agriculture's ability to "spend whatever is necessary regardless of what has been provided by Congress in budget authority" on deficiency payments to wheat, feed grains, cotton and rice producers.<p>
	"Not only does open-ended borrowing authority mean there is no real limit to potential farm program spending at present, but this nearly unlimited source of funds also allows the Secretary to raid CCC to cover mismanagement of other farm programs," Frydenlund says.<p>
	In a related Heritage study to be released later this week, Frydenlund and Heritage Senior Fellow for Statistical Policy Analysis David Winston conclude that the nation's economy would expand by nearly $135 billion within a decade as a result of ending the current farm program.<p>
	The study measures the "multiplier effect" on the economy that would result as farmers increase production, earn higher incomes through expanded exports, and generate new economic activity in farm-related industries such as equipment manufacturing, fertilizer, seed, livestock feed, food processing, transportation and shipping.<p>
	"In a 10-year period, the overall economy would expand by $134.9 billion, with every state contributing to the expanded economy. Every single state will win under this plan," Frydenlund and Winston say.<p>
	Their conclusion was based on data generated by an econometric computer model developed by Heritage for the think tank's report, "Freeing America's Farmers: The Heritage Plan for Rural Prosperity." That plan -- which proposed phasing out all federal farm programs by the year 2001 -- was made public earlier this year.<p>
	"In fact, the nation's economy would expand by $10.9 billion just in the first year, and this is a conservative estimate," according to Frydenlund and Winston.<p>

<title>The Salviatori Leadership Speakers Bureau</title>
</head>

<body>
<center>
<img alt="The Salvitori Leadership Speakers Bureau" src="sb-logo.gif">
</center>
<p>
The mission of the Salvatori Leadership Speakers Bureau is to promote on campus America's first principles and to defend the values of the Founding Fathers: the ideas of free enterprise, limited government, strong national defense and traditional family values.<p>

Although these speakers would not agree on all issues, each of them represents aspects of the winning conservative coalition in the United States, values and ideas which are over looked on most campuses.<p>
<p>
Currently, we are in the process of updating
our Salvatori Leadership Speakers Bureau web page. All of the speaker descriptions are being updated and new speakers are being added. The new web page will be
posted as soon as the updates are finished. If you would like information on
this Leadership Institute program please <a href="mailto:lead@lead-inst.org"><img src="email2.gif" ALT="email" BORDER=0 ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE></a> or call Ken Weary at

<i><a href="/lead-inst/epsclips.ram">Listen</a> to real-audio file of recommendations by Tim McConville of the National Right to Work Defense Foundation and Stefan Gleason who found his job though EPS.
</i>
<P>
Founded by Morton C. Blackwell in 1979, the Leadership Institute (LI) actively identifies,
recruits, trains and places principled conservatives in the public policy process.<p>

The Leadership Institute's Free Employment Placement Service is one of the oldest, longest
running, and most successful conservative job banks in Washington. LI's program has placed hundreds of conservatives
in all levels of the public policy process. In addition, its counseling service and educational programs
provide countless other conservatives with the leads, advice and training necessary to succeed in
public policy.<p>

Currently, LI's free Employment Placement Service offers three main placement options.<p>

The main Employment Placement Service program helps conservatives secure full and part-time
work in the public policy, government and private sectors.  A heavy emphasis is placed on filling
positions in Capitol Hill offices, special-interest groups and trade associations. After the 1994 fall election
cycle, special attention was given to Congressional placements and training of prospective Capitol Hill staff.

<p>The Broadcast Media Placement program helps conservatives locate and secure positions in
broadcast and print journalism, as well as public and media relations.<p>

The Intern Placement program helps interested individuals gain experience though
quality internships, volunteer work or temporary positions.<p>

Two full-time placement directors offer career counseling, tips on resume writing, job-hunting,
interviewing techniques, and networking advice to job-seekers.  To set-up an appointment, contact Emily Kertz at (703) 247-2000.<p>

In addition, LI offers a variety of one-day, two-day, three-day, and week-long professional
training programs to help conservatives become effective in the public policy process.<p>

Specialized schools such as the <a href="sc-ch.html">Capitol Hill Staff Training School</a>, the <a href="sc-cd.html">Candidate Development
School</a>, the Foreign Service Opportunity School, and the <a href="sc-brj.html">Broadcast Journalism School</a> teach job-
seekers how to land and succeed in positions within these professions.<p>


Technology-oriented schools including <!--the <a href="sc-yl.html">Youth Leadership School,--></a> the <a href="sc-pr.html">Public Relations

School,</a> the Rhetoric & Campaign Communications School, and
the <a href="sc-sp.html">Student Publications School</a> help conservatives enhance their public policy skills.<p>

Further information about LI's free assistance programs for conservative job-seekers can be
obtained from the Director of Employment Placement Services, Emily Kertz, at (703) 247-2000.<p>
<dd>Here are some testimonies:
<blockquote><blockquote>
<center>
<i>"Your program of finding jobs for conservatives is the most effective I have seen. I have recommended the Institute to my friends."</i><br>
-- Joseph Cramer
<p>
<i>"Thank you very much for all the time and effort you put into helping me find a job in public policy."</i><br>
-- John Lill
<p>
<i>"Although I had been told by three separate individuals that the Leadership Institute is a good place to go when looking for a job, I never expected to see results so quickly. I would not have known where to start without your help. It was great to be on the receiving end of the  phone line for a change."</i><br>

<title>What Is Policy Review -- Heritage</title>
<META name="keyword" content="Policy Review: Journal of American Citizenship, community, conservative, journal, families, family, local, civic, religious, schools, education, citizens">
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<img src="/heritage/revpo.gif" width=169 height=79 alt="Policy Review" border=0></a>
<h2><i>POLICY REVIEW: The Journal of American Citizenship</i></h2></center>
<p>
<i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i>, the flagship magazine of <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>, is published 6 times per year. 
<p>
<i>Policy Review</i> specializes in the study of private-sector and local-government alternatives to the bureaucratic, centralized welfare state. We are dedicated to rebuilding the institutions of American citizenship -- families, neighborhoods, religious institutions, public and private schools, voluntary civic institutions, businesses, and local governments.
<p>
<i>Policy Review</i> profiles great American citizens: Houston constable Victor Trevino is reducing crime with his "zebra squad" of volunteer cops; Sister Connie Driscoll is helping young urban mothers in Chicago; <a href="/heritage/p_review/spring95/tolerth.html">Rev. Frank Reid</a>, of Baltimore's AME Church, is promoting black Christian manhood to the members of his community.
<p>
We study "what works": <a href="/heritage/p_review/spring95/glassth.html">DeVry Institute of Technology</a> sets the standard for career training; Rhode Island's privatized school lunch program tastes better and costs less; private security officers reduce crime around New York's Grand Central Station. 
<p>
We tackle tough subjects, and propose common-sense policy prescriptions, for issues such as <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thegg.html">crime</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thfost.html">taxes</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thhood.html">environment</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thfinn.html">education</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thsher.html">religion and culture</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thcraig.htm">adoption and foster care</a>, and <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thbear.html">Social Security</a>. We publish articles by influential people on the major issues of the day. Newt Gingrich, Phil Gramm, <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/tharmey.html">Dick Armey</a>, Bill Bennett, Ralph Reed, Bill Kristol, Kate O'Beirne, Grover Norquist, and other key policy makers all contribute to <i>Policy Review</i>.
<p>
<i>Policy Review</i> provides practical, constructive thought -- the best of conservatism-in-action.

Dear Cleta:
<p>
I live in Glenside, PA, but my family pays more taxes to the city of 
Philadelphia than we do to our home township and county combined.  
Now Mayor Rendell has come out to my town and said we aren't paying 
enough!  We moved out of Philadelphia because we couldn't afford private 
school for our kids at the same time we were supporting patronage and 
perks for Rendell's friends.  How can I help him get it?  
<p>
--Robbed by the City of Brother Love
</pre>
<p>
Dear Robbed:
<p>
I presume you are talking about the income tax paid by people who work in Philadelphia but who live outside of the city.  Is that what you're talking about?  If not, write back and clarify.  If it is, you are taxed without representation.  You pay taxes on income to a jurisdiction in which you have no voting representation.  I'm wondering if the constitutionality of such a system has ever been tested in the courts.  Maybe you should contact one of the public interest legal foundations and discuss filing a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of such a system.  
<p>
Here are some suggestions:

Dear Cleta:
<p>
Here is a possible idea for a "10" Veep nominee.  How about former 
governor Casey of Penn.? Yes, he is a Democrat but that makes the 
choice more provacative and interesting.  He comes from an area that 
is key to winning the election.  If he can pass any health concerns, 
he would be a great choice.
<p>
What do you think?
<p>
--Frank 
<p>
</pre>
Dear Frank:  
<p>
I think the Republican convention would go nuts if Bob Dole nominates a Democrat for Vice President.  Did you hear the furor when Dole floated Sam Nunn's name a few months ago?  I admire Bob Casey and his courage, but his health isn't great -- and with Bob Dole's age it makes the Vice Presidential candidate's health a key issue for the fall.  Nice try -- but it's probably a non-starter.  
<p>

<pre>
Dear Cleta:
<p>
I have long opposed the minimum wage as an infrngement into American 
private business by a fat over-regulating government.  I resent Uncle 
telling me how much I must pay someone to perform a given task.  How 
can we stop this and other unwarranted entanglement by government in 
private citizens' interests?

<p>
The way you stop the federal government is by electing members of Congress who are willing to say "no" to their own constituents -- and get the government out of our hair.  That means you should make yourself known to candidates and incumbents and don't vote for anyone who is for higher taxes, more spending and bigger government.  That means you should vote for people who are for LIMITED government, which means term limits, balanced budget amendment, lower taxes.  If we are to create an environment where every person can realize the American Dream, we're going to have to organize the people who think like we do -- and fight back against the powerful interests who want a government that grows and grows.  If you want to help with that effort, write back and add your name to our list of the "Dream Team":  people who will work for real politcal change in America. We'll tell you how.

Dear Cleta:
<p>
As active Constitutionalists, we must find a way to force the major media to <br>tell the truth about losses of our freedoms under the Constitution. We know that <br>laws being forced upon us are in truth unlawful, yet media supports every <br>oppressive law they pass.  I have tried to get them to begin telling the <br>people the truth about internal enemies of our Republic...to no avail. <br>I then assume that the media is part of the conspiracy to destroy <br>American freedoms.
<p>
Any suggestions?  
<p>
-- Constitutionalist
</pre>
<p>
Dear Constitutionalist:  
<p>
Yes.  Don't watch the network news, only read conservative newspapers and listen to conservative talk radio.  Since you don't get a balanced view of the world from the mainstream media anyway, you won't be missing anything except a rise in your blood pressure every time you read the paper or watch the news.

Dear Cleta,<br>
<p>
I live in Utah, where the local politicians talk conservatively but act <br>like big spending liberals. For example, our governor actively pursues states <br>rights while he continues to support dumping large amounts of money into <br>a failing educational system and does not support vouchers.
<p>
How can we convince "conservative" politicians to support conservative causes?
<p>
-- Truly Conservative
</pre>
<p>
Dear Truly:
<p>
There are only two things that influence a politician:  votes and money.   The state teacher organizations have a lot of influence even with conservative Republican governors  because they represent lots of votes.  And not only do the teacher unions control the education agenda in most states, but the state school boards association, the school administrators organizations, and even the PTA are all together when it comes to opposing vouchers.  Until and unless the rank and file taxpaying public get organized to support parents' rights in the use of their tax dollars for school choice, the aforementioned organizations (which mostly operate with tax dollars, by the way) will continue to dominate the issue of vouchers, even with governors like Mike Leavitt.  In Utah, however, I would think that a natural ally for you would be the Mormon Church.  Do you know where it stands on school vouchers?  My advice would be to start organizing Mormon parents to get the church to be supportive of vouchers.  Add to that the parents who home school, the Christian Coalition and other family groups,  teachers who are willing to speak out against their union leadership on this issue, Catholic school parents and leaders, and you will have put together a grassroots coalition of parents and taxpayers who represent a lot of votes.  Then, your governor will start to pay attention.

Dear Cleta:
<p>
With the federal government doing so many detrimental things in so many <br>different arenas, what can a person do to combat this overwhelming takeover <br>of our God-given freedoms? Do we even have a Constitution any more? How can <br>they get away with this?
<p>
--Drowning in a sea of politicians
</pre>
<p>
Dear Drowning:
<p>
They get away with it for two reasons:  First,  because the careerists in Washington -- of BOTH political parties -- are more concerned about "getting things done on Capitol Hill" than in making sure they stop bad things from being done.  A good example is what has happened to the Republican Congress in the last six months.  The Democrats have basically put themselves back in charge of Congress and the Republicans have let them be back in charge -- so we have the GOP Congress passing an increase in the minimum wage because the minority (the Democrats) demand it.  That's why I love the House freshmen -- they aren't afraid to take a stand and draw a line in the sand.  It outrages all the insiders -- but the bad things have happened here due to the "go along, get along" philosophy that has ruled Washington for such a long time.
<p>
Second reason:  because average hardworking Americans are not equipped with the right kind of information to do anything about any of this.  Most people have no idea how their representatives and senators in Congress really vote on things that people care about.  And trying to find out voting records is not easy.  So we (my colleagues and I) are working to come up with a system to provide specific information to citizens on a regular basis about how the congressmen and senators vote on things -- and whether the votes are liberal or conservative.  Watch for more information about this effort!  I think if the public knew how most of these congressmen vote, the voters would make changes in Congress.  The politicians fear that, too, which is why they make it so hard for the public to know what they're doing.  We're working on a way to change that.

Dear Cleta:

     How do I get my local newspaper to print my 'letters-to-the-editor'?

     It is my humble opinion that my letters are both cogent and relevent, 
yet they are rarely printed.  They are not overly wordy nor are they blazing 
tirades, but rather are reasoned opinions on todays issues.  I usually open 
with a statement, build a reasoned argument supporting my opening statement 
and then close with a call to action.  I always include my name, address 
and phone number with the letter for verification.

     Can you offer some suggestions?  If you would like, I can send an 
example of a recent letter for your critique.

Cordially,
Robert
</pre>
<p>
Dear Robert:  
</p>
<p>      You didn't say where you're from, so I don't know if you live in a big city or a small town.  Big city papers are the worst -- they are hard to crack because people don't know one another personally.  In a smaller community, the editors tend to know the folks who write letters.  Here are some suggestions:  Call the editor who puts together the letters page (or feature) and ask for an appointment.  Go see the editor and take some of your rejects.  Ask for constructive criticism and try to find out why none of your letters have been printed.  If the editor is a decent person, he/she will try to be helpful and may give you some pointers.  What will really happen is he/she will have a face to put with your name and you'll probably get your next letter printed.  If the editor is a jerk, document the way you were mistreated and send a letter to the editor's boss, usually the managing editor, with a copy to the jerk.  You'll never get a letter printed afterwards but it's not happening now either -- so at least you may be the one who sensitizes the paper a bit for the next guy.
<p>
     The problem with most newspapers is there is little or no competition.  But if there are weekly papers or other community papers in your area, don't overlook those.  They tend to be much more receptive to letters and citizen involvement.  And if you have a local radio talk show, be sure to call and tell your story there about how the newspaper is blacking out your opinions.  One of the reasons that radio talk shows are so successful is because people who have been shut out of many newspapers finally have an outlet.
<p>
     Good luck -- and keep writing (and expressing) your opinions!
</p>
<pre>
Dear Cleta:

     I live in the 20th Congressional District of Texas, "represented" by 
Henry B. Gonzalez, a fat socialist thug who beat up a constituent with whom 
he disagreed in a public restaurant in San Antonio.  The case went to court, 
where Gonzalez's wrists were slapped.  He has a Republican opponent, James 
Walker, who needs help in his campaign.  You don't have to be a rocket 
scientist to know if Gonzalez were backed with tanks and guns he'd be a 
communist.  Ideologically, he thinks just like a communist.  But, lo and 
behold, Walker IS a rocket scientist!  He's a smart guy who can use our help.  
The redrawn district has many independents and conservatives, while many of 
its yellow-dog Democrats may not vote out of disgust for Gonzalez, who was 
nowhere to be found during the fight to save Kelly AFB--in his 20th District--
from the chopping block.

Sincerely,
Marco
</pre>
<p>
Dear Marco:
</p>
<p>  See my advice in our    <a href="/abic/letters/letter-3.html.cgi">first Capital Letters column</a> regarding my representative, Connie Morella.  The same advice holds true for every incumbent.  One difference is that you have a candidate right now.  If he doesn't have a lot of money, it may take more than one race for him to win.  Remember, an entrenched incumbent may have to face a tough challenge a couple of times before it's successful.  And sometimes the mere fact that he/she is facing a tough race is enough to cause him/her to take that fat congressional pension and retire.  
<p>
     In Gonzalez's case, his taxpayer supported pension is worth over $1.2 million.  Why not round up some money and run some radio ads telling people that Gonzalez voted against term limits, against the balanced budget amendment and has a big fat congressional pension that he's voted for himself?  And if it doesn't work this time, just keep working on letting people know how he votes.  It certainly doesn't represent the thinking of that district, I'm sure.  Don't let him get by with it!  Just tell on him every chance you get.
<p>
<p>
<pre>

Dear Cleta:

     Very nice web page!  Listen, you think you have problems with Connie 
Morella?  My Congressman, Albert Wynn (D-MD 4) makes Rep. Morella look like 
a right wing conservative!  This district is one of those "minority" 
districts that is full of government employees, very liberal, etc.  Wynn 
takes elections with 75+% of the vote, and gets lots of AFL-CIO money.
How do we get HIM to listen to logic and reason, or, in the alternative,
displace someone like him?

Signed,
Ron
</pre>
<p>
Dear Ron:
<p>
     You've just advanced a major reason why the "apartheid" districts have been held unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court.  Race cannot be used as a factor in determining the congressional district boundaries.  Unfortunately, political persuasion and incumbency can -- and that is what matters most to incumbents.
<p>
     In the meanwhile, I believe that most black voters are much more conservative than their representatives.  Think about putting together a group of thoughtful constituents in Wynn's district that is bi-racial.  Visit some black ministers and start talking with them about family values and morality issues.  Most minority voters support issues like school choice, term limits, and conservative positions on social issues. Most minority representatives in Congress vote the other way.  See if you can build some common ground with some of the minority citizens who share your views on issues -- and once you get to know one another, perhaps you can reach consensus on some issues on which Wynn votes wrong.  Your activist group might be able to persuade him to change his voting pattern - or perhaps you can begin grooming a replacement who would be more in line with your views.  Don't just assume that minority voters are in tune with their Congressional Black Caucus.  On many, many issues, that is not the case.  The problem is that members of the Black Caucus rarely have any opponents so they vote however they want to.  It is a disgraceful situation and one that is perhaps being changed by the recent Supreme Court rulings on the racial gerrymandering.
<p>
     P.S.  Thank you for the compliment about the web page!  We're glad you're enjoying it!

Dear Cleta,

I am interested in helping organize a group of neighbors for a specific 
cause. Without too much detail, let me briefly explain the problem.
In a middle class neighborhood in which the residents are hard working,
honest citizens, an individual has recently purchased a house citizens,
an individual has recently purchased a house for the purpose of renting
it out. The individual is developing a pattern of renting to people 
who seem to be prone to criminal activity. The house has become a slum 
in the middle of the neighborhood. There has been constant traffic in 
and out of this house and subsequently the neighborhood. Some of these
individuals are known drug users. There have been people sleeping in 
junk cars on the property. There have been numerous residential 
breakins. Several neighbors have witnessed pot smoking in the front 
yard by some of the seven adults that live there. The response from 
the landlord, who lives in another part of town but whose ex-wife lives
next to the rental property, has been something like, "Well, they pay 
their rent on time."

Can we do anything not only to clean the situation up but to also 
prevent the landlord from repeating the act over and over?

A concerned citizen
</pre>
<p>
Dear Concerned:
<p>
<dd>Good for you for taking on illegal activities in your neighborhood!  Keep 
in mind the 3 things you must do to win this fight: 1) gain allies and friends 
2) document everything and 3) make as much noise as you can among decision 
makers. Big shots hate 
noisy constituents.
Some specific suggestions:
<ol>
<li>Document the incidents you wrote about, including the residential break-ins.  List dates and times; take photographs and keep taking them every couple of days.  Build a file.
<li>Check your zoning laws.  Do the laws for your neighborhood permit rental to other than single families?  If not, report (in writing) the violation of the law to your planning and zoning commission, with the documentation.  There are probably also zoning laws about "eyesores" and "public nuisances".  Talk to the city attorney's office in your community and find out what the law is and what the procedures are for getting city action.  You're paying the city attorney--use his/her services as much as possible.
<li>Circulate a petition in your neighborhood. Get signatures from as many of  your neighbors as possible on a petition calling on the landlord to evict the current tenants and supervise the property more carefully.  Rouse the rabble on your side.
<li>Send copies of the petitions and documentation to:
<dd>-- your local elected officials;
<dd>--your local newspapers.  Contact the "metro" section, not the editorial and major reporting side if it's a large paper.  If it's a small paper, it doesn't matter.  Call the managing editor and ask him/her to send out a reporter.  
<dd>-- local TV stations.  Many have developed programs such as "In your corner" where they help citizens take on city hall and that type of thing.  Call your TV stations, and send them copies of your documentation.  If there are good visuals, they might send out a camera crew and do a story.


<dd>-- your local police chief and/or supervising officer in your area.  Follow up with a call to the police and ask what they are doing about this situation.
<li>Organize a meeting of your neighbors in one of your homes to discuss legal action. Call your Mayor and city council member(s) and invite him/her to attend the neighborhood meeting, at which you should present the evidence (again) of the situation and ask what they intend to do about it. Put the officials on the spot. Invite the landlords to attend and explain what they plan to do about the situation.  Invite the press.
<li>Is there an attorney in your neighborhood?  Do any of the neighbors have a son or daughter who is an attorney?  That may become a necessity at some point -- although I'm always hesitant to tell people to hire/listen to an attorney.  They're not universally good and sometimes they are too afraid to lead your group in a fight.  But it wouldn't hurt to start assessing potential attorneys that might be available to help out if you need to file legal proceedings.
<li>Organize a group to appear at your city council meeting if the private meetings don't produce any results.
</ol>
<dd>If you try these things and nothing happens, write me back and we'll figure out what to do next.
<p>

Dear Cleta:

I am a College Professor who became active in local Republican 
politics in the late 80s, on the assumption that all political 
should begin locally. Now, I find myself on the Board of Directors 
of a group called United Conservatives of Ohio.  (I live and teach
in the Dayton, Ohio area.)  UCO does little now except to rate state
legislators (Senators and Assemblymen) and publish these ratings,
something like the American Conservative Union, with which we are 
loosely affiliated.  I would like them to do more than this.  What
do you think of the following, and is there anything you would add to
the list:
 
-a "Home Page" on the Web;
-a quarterly newsletter, focusing on state rather than national issues;
-broader solicitation for funds (at present, we are mostly supported by 
lobbyists and a biennial fund-raising dinner).

We already have a PAC, legally separate from UCO, which doles out tiny 
contributions (in the $100 to $500 range) to candidates for the Ohio 
Legislature.

Thank you in advance for any hints you may have.

Board Member, United Conservatives of Ohio

</pre>
<p>
Dear United Conservatives of Ohio:

<dd>Good for you!  Organizing a statewide entity, having a PAC and hosting a biennial dinner are great activities.  A Web site is another good idea.  Maybe your site should be hooked up with Town Hall somehow, the national conservative web site, so other Ohio folks can find you more easily on the web.
<p>
<dd>One suggestion is to have press conferences during this fall election season where you present your endorsement and contribution directly, in person to the state legislative candidates you've endorsed.  Have a prepared statement as to why this good candidate has garnered your endorsement, the issues that he/she has been particularly good on, and a paragraph about your organization and how to contact it. Have photographers and local reporters there -- or go the newspaper itself in the smaller towns and have your press conference at the newspaper offices. 
<p>
<dd>This is a way for your $100 contribution to be turned into several hundred dollars worth of free press, plus, you look a candidate/legislator in the eye and say thank you publicly at a time when it means something to them.  They will be even more committed to your issues thereafter!
<p>
<dd>Good luck!

Dear Cleta:

     I live in Maryland and my congresswoman is Connie 
Morella.  She voted against term limits and other significant 
items in the Contract with America.  Everyone says she is 
unbeatable. Is that true and is there anything I can do to mount 
a campaign against her?

                     Taxed but not represented in Maryland
</pre>
<p>

Dear Taxed:
<p>
<dd>You're right.  Connie Morella is disgusting.  She votes wrong on most things.  I know, because she's my congresswoman, too...  Here are some suggestions if you are serious about replacing her:
<p>
<dd>First, this is a long term proposition -- it isn't going to be done overnight.  It will take at least 18 months of planning a campaign to get rid of her, and it might take two election cycles of intense effort.  It is difficult to get rid of an incumbent member of Congress without an infusion of major dollars and assistance like the labor unions are presently pouring into beating up on some of the freshmen.
<p>
<dd>Second, a small group of 5 to 10 people, dedicated to ridding the Congress of Rep. Morella should begin meeting monthly through the end of this year.  Who should come to the meeting?  People with a sincere desire to beat Connie Morella -- and at least one or two people who have been involved in politics in some form prior to this effort. The information at the meeting should include a map of the district and the voting patterns in both the GOP and Democratic primaries as well as the general elections from the past 3 cycles.  
<p>
<dd>Third, form some task forces: research (to gather information about her record); candidate recruitment (to develop a list of possible opponents for Rep. Morella); third, outreach (to develop a plan for broadening the circle of activists plotting her overthrow); fourth, finance (you can't do this for free).
<p>
<dd>Watch the fall campaign carefully and continue to meet monthly through December.  By then, you should have complete research on her record through this Congress and a sense of what it's going to take to beat her in two years.  When you've got that all assembled, write me again and we'll go from there.  
<p>
<dd>This is a good project.  I hope you'll do it.

<P>
<h2>The CDC &quot;IMPACT&quot; Grant Program: Cash Cow for America's Health Charities?</h2>
<p>
For fifty years the federal government's Centers for 
Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta has been concerned with curing disease through 
research, public education, and inoculation.  But recently the CDC has shifted its 
focus from the practice of medicine and medical research to politics.  The agency now 
spends tens of millions of taxpayers' dollars 
annually <I>to train lobbyists</I> in how to enact gun 
control laws, how to ban smoking or tobacco advertising, and other politically correct 
causes championed by the political left.
<P>It is illegal to use tax dollars for partisan politics, so there are serious concerns 
about not only the propriety but also the legality 
of the CDC's political initiatives.  This report examines a major ongoing program funded 
by the CDC that in 1993 alone spent $85 million in tax dollars to initiate a program in 32 
states and the District of Columbia to train 
lobbyists and build political coalitions that will 
advocate banning tobacco products.
<P>No one today denies the health hazards of smoking.  The issue here is not whether or 
not smoking is healthy; it is whether or not prohibition is wise public policy and, more 
importantly, whether or not tax dollars ought to 
be used to promote it.  
<P>Once tax dollars are used to promote one kind of &quot;politically correct&quot; consumption 
behavior, there is in principle no end to it.  Today, smoking happens to be the 
most politically incorrect behavior, but the consumption of fast foods, alcohol, red meat, 
and myriad other products has already been attacked by various self-appointed 
national nannies.

<P>1996 marks the midterm of a five year (1993-98) program sponsored by the CDC Office 
on Smoking and Health.  In 1993 the CDC awarded an initial $85 million to 32 state health 
departments as part of its &quot;National Tobacco 
Prevention an

d Control Program,&quot; which the agency labels 
<B>I</B>nitiatives to <B>M</B>obilize for the 
<B>P</B>revention <B>A</B>nd <B>C</B>ontrol of 
<B>T</B>obacco Use (IMPACT).  IMPACT grants to state 
health departments are renewable for up to five years.  
<P>At first blush there does not seem to be anything objectionable to state health 
departments helping people  especially children  quit smoking or discouraging 
them from taking up the habit in the first place.  
But the primary emphasis of the program is not medical treatment or education but politics. 
 The essential purpose of the grants is to mobilize a &quot;comprehensive and 
coordinated nationwide effort&quot; to enact 
prohibitionist legislation through &quot;local, state, and 
regional initiatives.&quot; 
<P>The grants fall into two categories:  
&quot;planning awards&quot; for states that have not 
yet established a political coalition, and 
&quot;core awards&quot; to assist states that have 
already established the political infrastructure 
for such a coalition.  The targeted states are listed in the accompanying box.
<P>Florida is one of the states that has received significant funding 
(approximately $250,000 per year since 1993) from the 
CDC's IMPACT program.  Because Florida is essentially a role model for what the CDC hopes 
to achieve in the other 31 states and the District of Columbia, it will be the focus of this report.  
<P>In its initial 1993 grant proposal to the CDC, the Florida Department of Health and 
Rehabilitative Services (FDHRS) &quot;project 
director,&quot; Mr. Joyner Sims, explained that 
the <HR>


 meetings,&quot; &quot;meeting room costs,&quot; the printing 
of a semi-annual coalition newsletter, and 
&quot;mini grants&quot; to local political coalitions 
throughout the state.
<P>The proposal also describes the precise role of the tax-funded Tobacco Free 
Florida Coalition.  The Coalition will &quot;Provide 
advocacy&quot; for &quot;tobacco prevention and 
control legislation,&quot; &quot;develop new legislation 
specifically targeting restrictions on outdoor 
advertising,<B>&quot; </B>and create<B> </B>a political 
&quot;training and technical assistance plan&quot; to 
provide &quot;coordinated support&quot; for lobbyists.  It 
will fund the travel of its members to political training conferences and establish &quot;a 
linkage with the Florida Association of Broadcasters.&quot;
<P>The Coalition will also seek to change Medicaid so that it covers &quot;tobacco 
cessation services&quot; that are provided by the 
health charities, among others.  This last policy objective would funnel millions of tax 
dollars to the major health charities.  Why should government subsidize smoking 
cessation when most smokers who quit (35 million 
by some estimates) do so on their own?
<P>Taxpayers' funds will also help finance the Coalition's participation in SCARCNet, 
an on-line communication network used by anti-smoking political activists that &quot;allows 
state officials to coordinate with CDC officials 
in countering major tobacco industry announcements.&quot;
<P>Florida's CDC grant application also makes clear the role of the major health charities 
 the ACS, American Heart Association (AHA), and American Lung 
Association (ALA)  and the political nature of the <HR>
<BR>
<B>For decades the political Left has used children as an 
excuse to enact public policies whose major effects are on adults. <HR>
</B><BR>
money would be spent mobilizing a &quot;Tobacco Free Florida Coalition.&quot;  At the 
time, this political coalition was known as 
&quot;The American Cancer Society's Lung Cancer 
Task Force,&quot; indicating that the apparent 
purpose of the grant was to use taxpayers' dollars 
to fund this ACS program.  The grant paid the salary for a &quot;Tobacco Free Florida 
Coalition Coordinator,&quot; a position that &quot;is located 
at the American Cancer Society (ACS) in Tampa, Florida,&quot; according to the grant contract.  
<P>Thus, even though the ACS has long denied receiving government funding of 
any kind (why should individuals donate if their tax dollars are already supporting the 
organization?), it does receive federal tax 
dollars that are filtered through the Florida 
health agency and, in all likelihood, through 
dozens of other state health departments as well.   
<P>In its application to the CDC, the FDHRS indicated that it intended to fill certain 
political &quot;gaps&quot; in the state, including the lack 
of a comprehensive statewide political coalition, limited funding for local 
coalition-building, local coalitions needing more direction 
in &quot;cultural diversity,&quot; and inadequate 
state government staff to help build political coalitions.
<P>If it received the CDC grant, the FDHRS promised to use its federal tax dollars to 
lobby for the following policies:
<P> Local ordinances that would ban smoking in the workplace;
<P> Educational campaigns for lawmakers;
<P> Bans on cigarette vending machines;
<P> Restrictions on tobacco products advertising;
<P> Tobacco excise tax increases, with some of the revenues earmarked for members of 
the Tobacco Free Florida Coalition
<P> Banning promotional give-aways of tobacco products
<P> Banning the sale of cigarettes by pharmacies; and
<P> Raising the legal smoking age to 21.
<P>The CDC grant would pay at least part of the salaries of Florida Health 
Department employees, American Cancer Society 
staff, and newly-hired political activists and consultants.  It also covers &quot;travel expenses 
for coalition members to attend quarterly
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->

IMPACT grant program in a table that lists Coalition personnel.  It shows that the 
health charities are effectively receiving 
taxpayers' dollars as Coalition members, and that 
arguably they are engaged in illegal, tax-funded political advocacy.  The FDHRS grant 
application lists the members of the Coalition and describes their roles (see box).
<P>The list of coalition members also includes medical professionals, but in virtually 
every instance their role is listed as liaison to 
fellow professionals, i.e., as political operatives.  
<P>
<P><B>The Role of the Robert Wood 
<P>Johnson Foundation</B>
<P>The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in Princeton, New Jersey 
complements the CDC's political activities.  The Foundation was founded in 1972 and is 
the largest private foundation in the U.S. devoted exclusively to health care issues.  
Its assets approach $4 billion and its major 
health policy initiatives are almost exclusively 
aimed at drastically increasing the amount of government intervention in health care.
<P>Lawsuits filed against Hillary Rodham Clinton's secret health care task force 
have forced disclosure of the powerful influence RWJF exerted over the 
promotion of the Clinton administration's failed attempt at a government takeover 
of health care in 1993 and 1994.

<P>Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, 
<P>Kentucky, Mississippi, Nevada, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, 
Wyoming, Vermont <BR>
In addition, RWJF's &quot;State Initiatives in Health Care Reform&quot; program put millions 
of dollars behind political lobbying efforts to pass state-level health care laws that 
contain such Clinton plan features as price 
controls, mandated managed care, &quot;community 
rating&quot; of health insurance, and massive regulation of health care markets.  Florida, 
Minnesota, and Washington passed legislation favored by the Foundation.  As 
Genevieve Young, an attorney specializing in 
health law, has argued in past issues of 
<I>Organization Trends</I>, these laws enable state 
officials to circumvent a U.S. Congress that is 
unwilling to do what the Administration and RWJF know is best.
<P>RWJF now wants to use these methods in the anti-smoking crusade.  In Florida and 
in twenty other states, RWJF is supplementing CDC taxpayer funding with its own 
&quot;Smokeless States&quot; grant program.   A brochure 
on the program indicates that the Foundation &quot;will make new grants to up to 21 
statewide coalitions working in partnership with 
community groups.&quot; RWJF plans to spend $20 million on the program over the next 
four years.
<P>To qualify for the RWJF grants, as Florida has, a state or nonprofit entity must 
demonstrate the existence of a &quot;strong, 
broad-based state-wide coalition,&quot; a &quot;state 
government commitment to the effort including 
support <BR>
Alaska, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, 
Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, 
North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah<BR>
from the governor, key legislators, and other public officials,&quot; and &quot;recent or 
proposed local and state policy and financing 
changes&quot; designed to achieve tobacco prohibition. 
 Despite occasional protests that they are not &quot;prohibitionists,&quot; prohibition is what 
RWJF and the health charities want.  What else, 
after all, can &quot;Smokeless States&quot; mean?
<P>In Florida, RWJF provides in-kind as well as financial support:  A FDHRS 
&quot;progress report&quot; to the CDC this year observes, 
&quot;The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Advocacy Coordinators are assisting the 
[CDC] funded tobacco coalitions.&quot;  These 
&quot;advocacy coordinators&quot; organize media 
campaigns, conduct opinion polls, and train citizens in political advocacy.  The RWJF 
grant also is used in Florida to bring in 
&quot;nationally recognized experts in the tobacco 
control movement.&quot;  These efforts are 
consistent with the RWJF's record of attempting to &quot;solve&quot; public health problems with 
more government bureaucracy, regulation, and taxes.  
<P>
<P><B>Using Children as Political Pawns</B>
<P>For decades the political Left has used children as an excuse to enact public 
policies whose major effects are on adults.  The Children's Defense Fund, for example, 
spends virtually all its resources lobbying for an expanded welfare state.  But its name is 
useful when it chooses to attack critics of failed welfare state programs as &quot;anti-children.&quot;  
<P>The CDC and RWJF have adopted this strategy.  Even though most of their 
policy recommendations, such as higher excise 
taxes, affect everyone, they are careful to 
highlight <HR>

<B>Organization</B>Trends<BR>
CDC &quot;IMPACT&quot;
<P><I>(continued from page 3)</I><BR>
 taxpayer funds are spent on public education programs, the 
lion's share goes toward tax-funded politics.  
From September 1993 to May 1994 the FDHRS boasted that it lobbied for a $1.00 increase 
in the state's tobacco products tax, working closely with the AHA lobbyist Scott Ballin. 
 This effort was unsuccessful.
<P>Florida could report success with the sting operations conducted by &quot;underage 
operatives who are observed by a special enforcement agent.&quot;  These resulted in the 
entrapment and citation of hundreds of convenience store clerks; dozens of 
businesses were subject to &quot;administrative actions&quot; 
that were taken against their business licenses; and a &quot;total of $136,000 in fees were 
collected for the Department of Education.&quot;
<P>Is not something unsavory occurring when officials of the Florida Department of 
Education pay other peoples' children to entrap hard-working, tax-paying citizens?  
Are Florida's law enforcement resources appropriately spent arresting clerks who sell 
cigarettes to teenagers?  Is criminalizing 
behavior the best way to advance public health?  
<P>Perhaps the most important political &quot;progress&quot; that Florida reported to the 
CDC is the news that the Tobacco Free Florida Coalition helped lobby for a new state law, 
SB 2110, which was enacted on May 25, 1994.  It allows the state to sue the tobacco 
industry to recover health care costs from tobacco-related illnesses incurred by Medicaid 
recipients.  Florida becomes one of fourteen 
states, as of this writing, pursuing this legal 
strategy and arguing that tobacco companies 
should be liable for the negative health effects 
of their product even if smokers know full well  as they undoubtedly do  that 
smoking increases health risks.

programs aimed at children.  In Florida and in other IMPACT states schoolchildren 
are encouraged (and sometimes paid) to join the Student Coalition Against Tobacco (SCAT). 
 A SCAT campaign involves students in a wide range of activities that organizers 
say are &quot;considered youth political advocacy, which is at the very base of 
the Student Coalition Against Tobacco.&quot;  
<P>The ACS, AHA, and ALA oversee SCAT activities, and they teach 
children to demonize their political opponents.  Join SCAT, children are 
told, and begin &quot;counteracting immoral tobacco industry tactics.&quot;
<P>There is nothing wrong with schoolchildren advising their friends to 
avoid smoking.  But SCAT pays junior high and high school students to 
conduct private sting operations, often against convenience stores.  SCAT reports 
that it sends &quot;minors out into the community in an attempt to purchase

or other locations.&quot;  Such activities have become an integral part of the 
CDC's national coalition-building campaign even though some California law 
enforcement officials have criticized it as &quot;vigilantism.&quot;  
<P>Moreover, health charities are giving young SCAT recruits questionable 
information.  For example, one instructional guide advises children to &quot;make the public 
aware that young people are being attacked by toxins whenever we eat in a restaurant, 
play pool or bowl, or attend school.&quot;  There is 
no solid evidence that second-hand smoke is as hazardous as such a statement implies  
if, indeed, it is hazardous at all, being one of countless indoor pollutants.  Such 
language is needlessly frightening. 
<P>
<P><B>Political &quot;Progress&quot; in the War 
for Anti-Smoking Dollars</B>

its grants.  Florida's reports for 1993-95 show that although some<BR>

<P>The logic of this argument, if it is accepted by the courts, is likely to have 
far-reaching effects.  It is not hard to imagine that 
plaintiffs' lawyers will file similar class-action 
lawsuits against the alcoholic beverage industry, the fast food business, and many 
other industries.  Overeating, overdrinking, even overexercizing can be hazardous to health.  
If courts reject the principle that adults are responsible for their own consumption 
behavior, the resulting liability crisis will 
rival the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.
<P>The federal government's National Cancer Institute (NCI) has joined with the CDC 
to fulfill this promise.  NCI grant # CA-94-15 (obtained through a Freedom of 
Information Act request) provided $1,119,678 to 
Northeastern University Law School in Boston in 1995 for a four-year legal research project. 
 The project will &quot;produce policy papers&quot; 
on `states' ability to sue tobacco companies for the medical expenditures caused by 
tobacco-related diseases&quot; and paid by Medicaid.  
The grantees  university law professors and their students  will also research &quot;the 
optimal design and constitutional validity of state legislation that would strengthen 
legal procedures for obtaining such reimbursement of health care costs from the 
tobacco industry.&quot;  Additional government 
funding for the project is provided by the 
Massachusetts Department of Public Health 
($324,500 annually) and the Americans With 
Disabilities Act ($284,804).
<P>The plaintiffs lawyers who take such cases on behalf of state governments can 
well afford their own legal research, especially since they stand to earn hundreds of 
millions of dollars in contingency fees.  It is likely 
that they will benefit more than any tobacco smoker, courtesy of NCI and other 
government agencies.  
<P>Florida reports one final bit of 
&quot;progress&quot; to the CDC.  The Coalition intends to 
use federal tax dollars to &quot;actively support 
employee litigation against employers who fail to implement meaningful smoking policies.&quot; 
 FDHRS recently recruited an attorney who will help employees harass their 
employers who fail to enact politically correct 
anti-smok<BR>
ing policies along the lines suggested by the state coalition.  
<P>
<P><B>Resurrecting Alcohol Prohibition</B>
<P>The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation recently announced a new four year, 
$10.2 million grant program that follows the same format as its &quot;Tobacco Free States&quot; 
grant program.  The new program will fund statewide political coalitions as well as local 
coalitions to encourage alcohol prohibition.  Like the anti-smoking programs, this one 
contains plenty of rhetoric about children.  Indeed, the program's name is &quot;Reducing 
Underage Drinking Through Community and State Coalitions.&quot;  But the public 
policies highlighted in its brochure affect 
<I>everyone</I>  legal as well as underage drinkers.
<P>For example, among government interventions &quot;shown to be effective&quot; are 
&quot;restrictions on the distribution of alcohol&quot; 
through state government monopoly liquor stores, regulatory limits on &quot;outlet density,&quot; and 
the elimination of advertising.  Perhaps because State liquor monopolies charge higher 
prices than private, competitive liquor stores, 
the Foundation considers them a positive benefit to adult purchasers of liquor.  
Similarly, limits on competitive advertising are sure 
to lead to higher liquor prices.  But won't limits on &quot;outlet density&quot; increase accidents 
as purchasers drive further away to drink?    
<P>Another &quot;effective&quot; intervention, 
according to RWJF, is &quot;increases in taxes and 
the relative price of alcoholic beverages.&quot;  
This, too, is proposed for the sake of children, 
even though sales to minors are already illegal.  Increased taxes and the other proposed 
laws and regulations apply to all liquor sales.   RWJF literature says nothing about 
parental responsibility. 
<P>The last paragraph of the RWJF grant announcement offers this disclaimer:  
&quot;Grant funds may not be used ... for lobbying 
or otherwise attempting to influence legislation.&quot;  This statement cannot be accepted 
at face value when the primary purpose of the program is to fund statewide coalitions 
<I>of lobbyists</I> whose mission is to enact 
prohibitionist policies.  Grantees are &quot;expected 
to mobilize existing or new statewide or local coalitions&quot; to enact higher alcohol 
excise taxes and other legislated restrictions on alcohol consumption.   Among the 
&quot;selection criteria&quot; for the grants is the 
&quot;<I>political feasibility</I>&quot; of the state's project (emphasis added).
<P>The RWJF brochure claims its prohibitionist policy proposals are &quot;seen as the 
most successful approaches.&quot;  Perhaps this is 
why it has allocated $10.2 million to finance such campaigns in twelve states.  
<P>
<P><B>Conclusions</B>
<P>It is illegal to spend tax funds on partisan political activity.  Yet this is what the CDC 
is doing when it allocates hundreds of millions of tax dollars for anti-smoking coalition 
building.  These amounts are comparable to the amount spent on congressional campaigns. 
 Similarly, individuals and organizations that contribute to candidates cannot deduct 
their contributions from their taxes.  But a tax-exempt foundation like the Robert 
Wood Johnson Foundation spends millions of dollars constructing a &quot;political 
infrastructure&quot; for assorted prohibitionist movements 
in dozens of states.
<P>Self-interest reinforces ideology in the actions of the major health charities  the 
ACS, AHA, and ALA.  As documented in this study and in my book, 
<I>Unhealthy Charities</I> (Basic Books, 1994), with James T. 
Bennett, health charities receive federal 
government funds to build political coalitions.  They, 
in turn, lobby state legislatures to require educational programs for adults and children 
to be administered by   none other than the health charities themselves.  
<P>The CDC's reputation is built on its work in health research, education, and 
disease innoculation.  By undertaking to finance 
lobbying campaigns sponsored by various tax-exempt organizations, it is denying 
Americans the right to make their own decisions with regard to personal behaviors that 
have been deemed politically-incorrect.  And it is diverting millions of dollars from 
important disease research.  This abuse of 
taxpayers' dollars should be stopped.

In response to the increasing practice on the part of some large foundations, including the ROBERT WOOD 
JOHNSON FOUNDATION, of using grant monies to &quot;leverage&quot; public funds, the Pennsylvania General Assembly is considering a 
measure that would sharply curtail the ability of state agencies to solicit or receive funding from nonprofit foundations.  More details to

<P>Liberal intellectuals and labor leaders are attempting to revive the old alliance between organized labor and &quot;progressive&quot; academia. 
 Recently, a series of &quot;teach-ins&quot;  modeled on the anti-war conferences of the Vietnam era  have been held at various 
campuses around the country as a means of inspiring students and professors to devote more of their energy toward helping the union agenda. 
 At a Columbia University event, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney declared, &quot;We need your help in telling millions of 
unrepresented workers that while it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a union to get a raise.&quot;

<P>The CENTER FOR EQUAL OPPORTUNITY in Washington has published a new monograph entitled

Trials</I>.  It includes a series of essays that debate whether race continues to skew justice in 
the courtroom and what role, if any, race should play in jury selection.  Contributors include Walter Berns, Joan Biskupic, 
Randall Kennedy and Jeffrey Rosen.  The final essay by Robert Lerner suggests, contrary to conventional wisdom, that blacks are 
actually more likely than whites to be acquitted in jury trials for most felonies.  Contact the Center:  202-639-0803 / www.ceousa.org

<P>During the recent presidential campaign, press reports revealed that the Clinton administration exploited a Justice 
Department program called &quot;Citizenship USA&quot; (designed to accelerate the naturalization process for new citizens) in order to register 
hordes of new Democratic voters before election day.  Further reports show that the White House gave most of the Citizenship USA 
work to liberal &quot;community advocacy groups&quot; like the UNITED NEIGHBORHOOD ORGANIZATION, which has close ties to both 
the President and Mrs. Clinton.

<P>A &quot;third wave&quot; of free market think tanks has begun to emerge.  Following the rise of Washington and state-based policy 
groups (the first and second waves respectively), the ALLEGHENY INSTITUTE in Pittsburgh is blazing the way for a new generation 
of market-oriented groups that will focus on local issues.  The Institute's executive director, Gerry Bowyer, writing in The 
Heritage Foundation's <I>Insider</I> newsletter, reports that the new group is working to restructure the government of Allegheny 
County, Pennsylvania, focusing on privatization efforts (including privatization of an airport and property assessments) and deregulation.

<P><I>Z Magazine</I>, the entertaining publication for the unreconstructed leftist, is in trouble.  An urgent appeal warns that 
&quot;various circumstances&quot;  including the fact that Z hadn't filed IRS forms for four years  have put the brash magazine

<P>Drugs and Welfare:  Billionaire financier George Soros, prime benefactor of the drug legalization movement, plans to give 
$50 million to immigration rights organizations across the country.  He is doing so in response to the welfare reform legislation 
enacted earlier this year, which Soros believes to be unjust and part of a &quot;mean-spirited attack on immigrants.&quot;  The funds will be 
dispersed through his newest charitable foundation, the EMMA LAZARUS FUND.  
<P>
<P>Can't we just get along:  In a full-page ad in the 
<I>Nation</I> magazine, five environmental groups (Earthtrust, Endangered 
Species Project, Friends of Animals, Marine Mammal Fund, and Sea Shepherds Conservation Society) attack GREENPEACE 
for supporting what they call the &quot;Dolphin Death Bill,&quot; which they claim weakens the U.S. dolphin protection law.  The groups 
accuse Greenpeace of being AWOL in the tuna/dolphin battle while &quot;mailing millions of letters appealing to the public to `save the dolphins.'&quot; 
 Thousands of dolphins will die, they say, because Greenpeace acts &quot;hypocritically.&quot;  For our part, we've always been 
more concerned about the neglected rights of the tuna.<HR>

<DD>This election year there has been much loose talk about the 
so-called religious right.  Mainstream media stories on the rise of the Christian 
Coalition speculate on its likely impact on 
national politics and generously quote those who warn that its activities will produce dire 
repercussions for the country in general and the Republican party in particular.  In all 
the clatter there is rarely any mention of the religious left.
But left-leaning churches and religious leaders have been involved in American 
politics long before there was a Christian Coalition. 
 For years the Rev. Jesse Jackson has asserted that political engagement from the pulpit is 
an essential part of the church's moral responsibility.  In 1988 Jackson's presidential 
campaign was financed in part with cash donations openly collected in black churches.  
In 1994 a group of black ministers led by Bishop L.E. Willis, Sr. endorsed Virginia 
Democratic Senator Charles Robb in his reelection 
contest against Oliver North.  Willis's group, the Third Jurisdiction of the Church of God 
in Christ, represented about 60 churches in Virginia.  Yet liberals routinely cite the 
North-Robb race as evidence of a one-sided Christian partisanship.
<P>No one seems to mind when liberal religious groups engage in political activities. 
 Left-wing church activists lobby in support of socialized medicine and racial 
preference programs, and against welfare reform.  
They organize boycotts against business and agitate for mandates and regulations in the 
name of &quot;corporate responsibility.&quot;  Liberation 
theologians make foreign policy pronouncements and lead crusades for nuclear disarmament. 
 Liberal church leaders denounce Republican policies as cruel and un-Christian.
<P>This kind of religious protest is not isolated and sporadic; it is organized.  
Religious groups on the left engage in the same 
activism  albeit on a smaller scale  as the Christian Coalition.  The Interfaith 
Alliance (TIA) is one such group that has lately 
been in the news.  Its organizers say it was 
created as an alternative to the &quot;divisiveness 
and intolerance of the extreme religious right.&quot;   
<P>The agenda of the Interfaith Alliance is far removed from that of conservative 
Christian groups  you won't hear much from them about the right to life   yet its methods 
are quite similar.  In July, it announced a 
&quot;Road to Renewal&quot; that will bring &quot;TIA's 
national religion leaders to local TIA chapters and 
the national party conventions to help empower mainstream people of faith.  TIA's 109 
chapters will distribute millions of voter guides. 
. . .&quot;  Distributing voter guides is exactly 
what the Christian Coalition does.  And it is 
exactly what has the Coalition's liberal critics 
so excited.  
<P>
Earlier this year, the Oregon Interfaith Alliance distributed its &quot;mainstream&quot; 
voter guides to Oregonians prior to that state's special U.S. Senate election.  Like the 
Christian Coalition's guides, they were supposed to provide Oregon voters with the 
candidates' &quot;positions on important issues.&quot;  
Distributed by the Alliance's network of grassroots activists, the guides covered 
such issues as the minimum wage, Medicare and Medicaid, the environment and housing 
discrimination.  What party's candidate do you suspect ranked better on the Interfaith 
Alliance scale?   
<P>Democratic Rep. Ron Wyden narrowly edged out his GOP opponent to win the 
U.S. Senate seat.  Did the Interfaith Alliance's guides play a role in Wyden's victory?  
Probably.  But does that make them illegal?   
Where is the outcry from those who groan about religious influence?  
<P>
<a name="#2"></a>
<B>Just What is the Interfaith Alliance?</B>
<P>
<DD>The Interfaith Alliance, a Washington-based 501(c)(4) organization, bills itself 
as mainstream and moderate.  Yet careful scrutiny reveals that it is anything but moderate. 
 Indeed, the Alliance clearly has a partisan purpose: to elect liberal Democrats.  
<P>It is not surprising to discover that this supposedly nonpartisan group was 
started with Democratic party money.  In 1994, the Democratic Congressional Campaign 
Committee (DCCC) provided $25,000 in seed money to the Alliance.  The DCCC is 
the sister organization of the Democratic National Committee.  It recruits, and 
raises money for, Democratic congressional candidates.  Its current chairman is Rep. 
Martin Frost (D-TX).
<P>The DCCC's support for the Interfaith Alliance may reflect the growing 
awareness on the part of many Democrats that 
modern liberalism's hostility toward religion and 
traditional morality has alienated many voters and driven them into the hands of the 
Republican party.  Fearing a religion gap, they 
fund a group, nominally oriented toward religion, that promotes a secular agenda of big 
government while attacking religious conservatives who have decided to get involved 
in public policy.  
<P>The Alliance has found a friend in organized labor, which has committed 
itself--to the tune of $35 million--to defeating Republican congressional incumbents.  
Toward that end, the AFL-CIO has sought to take advantage of the Alliance's voter guides. 
 On August 29, the <I>Washington Post</I> reported that AFL-CIO field organizers  deployed 
to &quot;targeted Republican districts&quot;  have 
a &quot;special mission&quot;:  to &quot;persuade preachers 
in North Carolina, Georgia, Iowa, Washington, Oregon and Colorado to dump the 
voter guides issued by the Christian Coalition and instead give parishioners literature 
prepared by the Interfaith Alliance.&quot;
<P>Such activities are part of a resurgent alliance between labor and left-leaning 
church groups that has emerged in the wake of leadership changes at the AFL-CIO.  In 
the past, relations between big labor and liberal religious activists were strained.  Former 
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland, a staunch anti-communist, had little patience for the 
religious left because of its uncritical sympathy for Third World revolutionary movements. 
 The deposed Kirkland's successor, John Sweeney, has much closer ties to 
radical elements in the liberal coalition, and he 
has worked to rebuild ties between labor union leaders and religious &quot;progressives.&quot;
<P>The Alliance claims that its voter guides are &quot;fair and honest&quot; and not slanted 
toward one particular party.  But the Alliance 
frames issues so as to make the final positions 
taken by the Democratic party leadership appear more favorable.  For instance, who 
could oppose &quot;Supporting families by 
advocating for a fair living wage,&quot; or &quot;child care 
that protects and nurtures every boy and girl,&quot; 
or "child care that protects and nurtures every boy and girl," or skill
training needed for good paying jobs." As Alan Wisdom, vice president of the Institute on Religion &amp; Democracy, noted 
recently, the Alliance is obviously trying to create the impression that the 
Democratic party &quot;is the party of righteousness 
and reason.&quot; 
<P>
<a name="#2"></a>
<B>Jill Hanauer: Abortion Activist and Party Regular</B>
<P>
<DD>The Interfaith Alliance's partisan pedigree runs deep and it is most apparent in 
the group's leadership.  
<P>Alliance organizers have assembled a collection of clerics to serve as a board of 
directors.  Mostly representatives of mainline denominations, the list includes 
several prominent religious church figures such as Bishop Edmond L. Browning, primate of 
the Episcopal Church in the United States; Joan Brown Campbell, general secretary of 
the National Council of Churches; Denise Davidoff, moderator of the Unitarian 
Universalist Association; and J. Philip Wogaman, senior minister of Foundry United 
Methodist Church in Washington, D.C., the church 
regularly attended by President and Mrs. Clinton.  (See box for complete list).
<P>Their names appear prominently in press releases and statements.  However, this 
seems more style than substance--window dressing to lend the group an air of reverence 
that it would not otherwise receive.  Boards of directors are rarely involved in the day to 
day operations of nonprofit lobby groups.  They may appear at conferences or serve as 
occasional spokesman, but generally they exist to authorize the activities of the full-time staff.
<P>In this case, the staff member who calls the shots is the Alliance's executive director, 
Jill Hanauer.  Her past disproves the Alliance's claims to moderation and calls into 
question its affirmations of faith.
<P>Hanauer's background is politics, not religion.  A long-time Democratic party 
operative, she was a staffer for former Senator 
Gary Hart and later worked on Rep. Patricia Schroeder's 1988 presidential campaign. 
 According to <I>National Journal</I>, she raised more than $3 million for the Democratic 
National Committee before joining the National Abortion Rights Action League 
(NARAL) as its political action director in 1990.  In 
1992, she joined Iowa Senator Tom Harkin's presidential campaign.  All in all, these are 
hardly the sort of activities of someone in the 
mainstream.
<P>
<a name="#3"></a>
<B>Hostility Toward Religion</B>
<P>
<DD>The Interfaith Alliance presents itself as a faith-based organization, but Hanauer's 
past contains incidents of antagonism toward religion.
<P>
As a college student at the University of Colorado, she organized efforts to 
prevent the school's football coach from leading 
his team in a moment of silence before games  and she eventually got the American 
Civil Liberties Union to file suit against the school. 
<P>
The football coach, Bill McCartney, who describes himself as a &quot;born-again 
Catholic,&quot; was proscribed from asking his 
players to bow their heads in silent prayer before taking the field.  He was prevented 
from asking them to say grace before team meals.  He could not share his faith while 
speaking in his capacity as football coach to 
local community groups.  All this was the result 
of an agreement negotiated between the University and the ACLU. 
<P>
McCartney's more egregious offenses included Biblical references during practice 
 recounting the story of David and Goliath, for instance.  The 
<I>Los Angeles Times</I> reported that on one occasion when a player was seriously injured and lying in a 
coma, &quot;the team assembled after practice, 
dropped to one knee and joined hands for a moment of silence.&quot;  
<P>
Hanauer's efforts to keep prayer out of football were but one aspect of her 
campus activism.  During her time at the University 
of Colorado, she also garnered publicity for organizing anti-CIA protests. (This 
resulted in the arrest of 477 people.)  And she 
worked to make sure that abortion coverage 
remained a part of the student health insurance plan.
<P>
Hanauer's apparent antipathy toward religion  and for coach McCartney  did 
not fade after she graduated.  She has criticized Promise Keepers, the national Christian 
men's group that challenges men to be more involved with their wives, children, 
and churches.  Founded in 1990 by McCartney, the group extols personal responsibility 
and family commitment at gatherings across the country which regularly attract tens of 
thousands of participants.  But this is too much 
for Hanauer.  Quoted in the <I>Minneapolis Star 
Tribune</I> in July 1995, she accused McCartney of having &quot;a very extreme political agenda.&quot; 
<P>One telling characteristic about the Alliance is its conspicuous use of the 
word &quot;extreme.&quot;  For example:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> &quot;these extremists organizations preach . . . a destructive message of division, 
discord, and even outright hatred.&quot; 
<LI> &quot;Pat Robertson has long advocated many extremist . . . ideas.&quot;  
<LI> &quot;Help us prevent Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition, as well as other extremists 
with religious claims for an exclusive political agenda, from writing their extremist 
views into the law of the land.&quot;
</UL>
<P>The Interfaith Alliance is ever-ready to cast stones and demonize its political 
oppo--odd behavior for a group that claims to &quot;promote the positive role of religion 
in public life.&quot; and asks candidates to take a &quot;Pledge of Civility.&quot;  It defines 
as  &quot;mainstream&quot; or &quot;moderate&quot; those who 
would normally be associated with the cutting edge of liberalism, and everyone 
to the right of that (most people) must be an extremist.
<P>
<a name="#5"></a>
<B>Who are the Real Extremists?</B>
<P>
<DD>In trying to tar conservative Christians as religous extremists, the Alliance makes 
common cause with groups like Americans United for Separation of Church and State. 
<P>Americans United and the Interfaith Alliance Foundation jointly prepared a 
report that &quot;highlights the Christian Coalition's extreme agenda and its efforts to gain control of the Republican Party.&quot;
<P>The report maintains that the Christian Coalition has forced Republican politicians to embrace various &quot;extreme&quot; positions 
such as calling for the repeal of quotas, the adoption of English as the official language, 
and the elimination of the Department of Education and the National Endowment for 
the Arts. 
<P>The head of Americans United is Barry Lynn, a Protestant minister and former 
legislative counsel for the ACLU.  Lynn is arguably the leading proponent in the country 
of the idea that the sale of pornography should be a protected First Amendment right.  
William A. Donohue documents this in his book <I>Twilight of Liberty: The Legacy of the 
ACLU</I>.  When President Reagan announced in 1984 that a commission would be formed to 
study pornography, Lynn &quot;took issue with the President's characterization of 
pornography as a `problem.'&quot;  According to Lynn, 
&quot;Although we are far from a sexually 
enlightened society today, our greater openness 
about sex should be viewed as a reasonable explanation for much of the growth in 
sexually-explicit materials.&quot; 
<P>Americans United is not an organization known for moderation.  Originally called 
Protestants United for the Separation of Church and State, it is committed to driving 
religion from public life.
<P>For instance, Americans United, together with the ACLU and the Milwaukee 
Teachers' Association, the local NEA affiliate, 
brought suit challenging Wisconsin's school choice plan, which would enable poor families 
to send their kids to private schools.  Americans United argues that the plan and other 
voucher plans violate the establishment clause of 
the first amendment.  The group also opposes a school-prayer amendment to the 
Constitution, opposes legislation to allow 
religious institutions to administer social service 
programs, and opposes parental rights legislation.
<P>Lynn has labelled as &quot;a religious tyranny amendment&quot; a proposed Religious 
Equality Amendment to the Constitution.  The amendment, which was submitted by Rep. 
Henry Hyde, states that neither the federal government nor any state government shall 
deny benefits to or discriminate against any per<BR>
son on account of religious expression.
<P>In September, Americans United launched a national campaign to dissuade 
churches from distributing Christian Coalition 
voter guides.  It warned churches that by doing so they, in Lynn's words, &quot;run the risk of 
having their tax-exempt status challenged and possibly revoked.&quot;  Lynn argues that 
Pat Robertson and the Christian Coalition seek to &quot;create what amounts to a theocracy 
in America.&quot;  Americans United also has a project to encourage people to report to 
the I.R.S. churches that they believe are improperly engaging in politics.
<P>Lynn was quick to criticize Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia for an 
address he made at a Mississippi prayer breakfast this spring.  Scalia descried the 
scorn suffered by people of faith and criticized elites who denigrate religious belief.  As if 
to prove the point, Scalia was immediately pilloried by those who are uncomfortable at 
the mention of morality.  Lynn was quoted in <I>U.S. News &amp; World Report</I> as commenting 
that Scalia's speech &quot;undermines public confidence in his objectivity&quot; on 
church-state issues.
<P>Lynn is also troubled by congressional chaplains who since the first Congress 
in 1789 have opened each day with prayer.  He believes the salaries Congress pays 
chaplains are a &quot;direct subsidy of religion which has no place in a Congress which ought 
to care about . . . the Constitution.&quot;
<P>It's ironic that the Interfaith Alliance, a self-proclaimed mainsteam faith-based 
group, is allied with an advocacy group dedicated 
to eradicating the public expression of religion.
<P>
<a name="#6"></a>
<B>Don't Tell Us What Your Against; Tell Us What You're For</B>
<P>
<DD>The irony disappears when you realize that the Interfaith Alliance has little to do 
with religion.  Rarely is there any mention of God in its literature.  It espouses no tenets 
of theology.  Even its professed values are generic and watery platitudes  &quot;The 
Interfaith Alliance believes in the dignity of the individual and the importance of 
community.&quot;
<P>Moreover, the Interfaith Alliance has no agenda of its own.  Although it clearly 
supports a raft of Democratic policy positions on health care, the environment, the 
minimum wage and so on, its raison d' etre is 
bashing the Christian Coalition.  Perusing press 
clippings one finds that the Alliance is rarely quoted in support of a policy or proposal. 
 Instead, it is almost always mentioned in context: denouncing the Christian Coalition.
<P>The Interfaith Alliance is a parasitical organization.  Without the activism of 
religious conservatives, the liberal left would have 
no use for it.

<B>August 1996</B>
<P>
<DD>Liberals no longer call themselves liberals; they prefer to be known 
as &quot;moderates.&quot;  Now a recently established California foundation has come 
up with a fresh way to market discredited liberal ideas of munificent government.  The 
California Wellness Foundation (CWF) is using the expansive concept of &quot;wellness&quot; to 
advance a broad-based policy agenda that is hostile 
to individual liberty and responsibility.
<DD>Created by the privatization of a major nonprofit Health Maintenance 
Organization (HMO), the foundation is emerging as 
a grantmaking behemoth.  With a multi-million dollar budget and nearly a billion dollars 
in assets, it has already become a major player in the nation's largest state.
<DD>CWF has taken on a cornucopia of concerns: gun ownership, smoking, 
consumption of alcoholic beverages, teenage pregnancy, to name a few.  In FY 1994-95 
CWF awarded 129 grants totaling nearly $40 million to institutions, organizations and 
individuals to tackle these and other issues that 
constitute what CWF has defined as 
&quot;prevention&quot; and &quot;wellness.&quot;
<DD>Wellness is the latest buzz-phrase among hip grantmakers.  Sufficiently vague, this 
all-encompassing term appeals to foundation professionals who believe that specific 
missions and mandates hinder their creative grantmaking talents.  Like the &quot;general 
welfare&quot; clause of the Constitution, wellness provides the imaginative foundation 
officer with limitless possibilities.
<DD>CWF's stated goal is &quot;to improve the 
health of the residents of California&quot; and 
&quot;foster healthful lifestyles, behaviors, and values.&quot; 
 To CWF, health or illness is defined not as the absence or presence of disease, &quot;but by a complex web of conditions in [the] physical and social environment,&quot; and CWF has determined its grantmaking must address &quot;the multiple barriers to healthful living from personal behavior to social and 
economic influences such as poverty, unemployment, inadequate schools and racism.&quot;  In other words, wellness means whatever CWF wants it to mean.  Sound familiar?  Such a program is simply an updated version of the root-causes rationale used to justify the 1960s War on Poverty.  
<DD>Grants are awarded in five program areas: Community Health; Population 
Health; Worksite Health Improvement; Violence Prevention; and Teenage Pregnancy and 
Birth Prevention.  Each of these creates a theater 
of operation for government intervention.  CWF's first project, the Violence 
Prevention Initiative, is fully developed and being 
expanded.  The ominous-sounding Teenage Pregnancy and Birth Prevention Initiative 
is still in the formative state.<P> 
<CENTER>* * * * *</CENTER>
<P>
<DD>Although a grantmaking foundation obligated to foster a public charitable 
interest, CWF is a recent offspring of a 
commercial enterprise.  CWF's &quot;parent&quot; is Health 
Net, the second largest health maintenance organization (HMO) in California, with 1.3 
million commercial and Medicare HMO members, many of them subscribers with CalPERS 
(the state Public Employees Retirement System).  CWF benefits from the considerable 
cachet associated with its parent's former status as a nonprofit insurer.
<DD>In 1990 the previously nonprofit Health Net became a for-profit  corporation.  
Because California law requires nonprofits that privatize to leave their assets in the 
nonprofit sector, Health Net created CWF in 1991, funding it in 1992 to the tune of $300 
million ($75 million cash, $225 million in a 
long-term, interest-bearing note), plus 25.7 million 
shares of Class B nonvoting stock, which convert 
to Class A voting shares when sold.  Its most recent Annual Report (1995) posts assets 
of $851.8 million.
<DD>In January 1994, Health Net merged with QualMed, a Colorado-based HMO, to 
form Health Systems International, which has been actively acquiring smaller HMOs, mostly 
in the Northeast.  Health Net-today a subsidiary of HSI-is actively pursuing the 
Medicare and small-group market, moves that have interesting implications for CWF and its work.  
<DD>As a new foundation, CWF's Board of Directors (then headed by Roger 
Greaves, founder, president and CEO of Health Net) was free to set priorities &quot;unencumbered 
by past funding commitments&quot; (as the 1993 annual report put it) or, for that 
matter, unencumbered by earlier ideological baggage.  Unlike such organizations as the 
Pew Charitable Trusts or the Ford Foundation, which had left-wing agendas thrust 
upon them, CWF has been &quot;progressive&quot; from 
the start.
<P>
<a name="regs"></a>
<B>Education for Regulation</B>
<P><DD>CWF's central organizing concept is &quot;prevention.&quot;  In today's political lexicon, that means far more than immunization programs for kids, X-ray screening for TB or breast cancer, or providing physical exams and dental work for the poor.  The new 
&quot;prevention&quot; includes these, but also much more:  it aims for total elimination of &quot;risk behaviors&quot; 
and anything &quot;bad&quot; in that &quot;complex web of 
conditions.&quot;  A report funded by CWF for the Washington-based Partnership for 
Prevention (of which Health Net is a member) puts it this way:
<DD>&quot;Imagine a new drug that would cure an epidemic . . . a new surgery that would 
correct . . . heart disease . . . a new prenatal 
therapy that would help over 100,000 
low-birthweight babies survive. . . .  Let's go one step further.  Imagine a way to 
<I>prevent</I> the epidemic; to <I>prevent </I> the heart disease; to 
<I>prevent</I>  the low birth weight&quot; (emphasis in original text).
<DD>Desirable as that may sound, full realization of such goals would require 
constant government intervention in people's 
lives, with every behavior added to the lists of targets for modification.  CWF gives 
few details on how this is to be accomplished.  What is clear, however, is that CWF's 
prevention paradigm is a model for a major expansion of the nanny state.
<DD>CWF is not a membership organization, and as a nonprofit with an IRS 
501(c)(3) status it is not permitted to lobby on 
specific legislation.  But it does engage in 
&quot;effecting policy change through public education.&quot;   
In practice, this means convincing the public to 
<I>accept and demand</I>  the laws, ordinances, and regulations CWF believes are 
necessary for public health and &quot;wellness.&quot;  
<DD>Like other foundations, CWF is a money machine; it funnels grants to 
community-based nonprofits and individuals eager 
to make demands for government action, and sponsors university research to bolster 
&quot;progressive&quot; policy initiatives.  But more 
importantly, CWF is a modern, high-tech foundation that recognizes the value of getting 
out the message  especially in California, a big state with expensive media-driven 
politics and a tradition of creating policy by means of ballot initiative.  Thus, CWF recruits 
experienced consulting firms that develop and implement campaigns even to the point 
of serious involvement in state ballot measures and national legislation.  Examples listed 
in the 1995 annual report include:
<UL>
<LI> $500,000 to Public Media Center &quot;to support a public education project on 
health impacts of proposed federal budget cuts on children and families in California.&quot;  
&quot;The campaign joined advocates from a wide 
range of organizations, bringing a unified voice 
to the debate.&quot;
<DD>Public Media Center is a nonprofit, public interest advertising firm based in San 
Francisco, which  as the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> puts it  &quot;Goes for [the] Jugular to 
Push Causes.&quot;  The 20-year-old PMC places more than $1 million in newspaper ads a year in major papers on behalf of clients such 
as Planned Parenthood, Sierra Club, and Handgun Control Inc., according to the 
<I>Journal</I>.  Last year, it placed fear-inducing ads 
opposing the Contract With America.  The Contract &quot;guarantees drastic losses for 
children,&quot; warned one such hyperbolic ad, which 
delineated a parade of horribles that would plague the nation if the Republican agenda 
were enacted, e.g., &quot;neglected and brutalized 
children will not be protected.&quot; 
<LI> $363,000 to the Marin Institute, &quot;to 
build the capacity of five target California cities 
to effectively address the role of alcohol marketing and availability in the economic 
development of these communities.&quot;
<DD>This nonprofit research firm in the North San Francisco Bay Area is hostile to 
both tobacco and alcohol consumption, and explores ways of &quot;empowering&quot; local 
communities to restrict access to them through 
ordinances limiting or banning advertising, sales, and consumption.  The Institute grew out 
of the famous Buck Trust controversy and was established with funds from the Trust.
<LI> $4 million to Public Media Center &quot;to develop and implement a campaign to 
increase [public] awareness about ... Proposition 188.&quot;  This was a 1994 California 
ballot initiative, sponsored by tobacco companies, that sought to curb the ability of local 
communities to enact anti-smoking ordinances that were more stringent than state law.  
PMC &quot;used print, radio and television ads to 
inform Californians about the threat to the 
public's health.&quot;  CWF reports that surveys at 
the start showed Californians in support of the proposition.  After the emotionally 
charged propaganda blitz by PMC, voters rejected 
it (1995 annual report).

<B>Currying Favor with the State?</B>
<P><DD><I>Organization Trends</I> has previously documented how foundations establish a 
financial relationship with state and local governments as a shortcut to achieving their 
policy goals, e.g., a new health care plan or 
education reform.  Often these programs have 
little public support  hence, lawmakers are unlikely to provide funding  so the 
foundation gives the state money to run a pilot program.  The state legislators are often 
hardly aware that state agencies are relying on outside grantmakers for policy direction.  Yet the program becomes entrenched.  Eventually the government takes over the funding 
 and the public gets stuck with something it never wanted.  It's an easy way to avoid 
the sticky problems associated with democratic self government.
<DD>Like other large philanthropies, CWF gives money to selected government 
institutions and agencies, local and state, for 
start-up costs of scholarships, fellowships, and 
research projects.  Some examples:
<UL>
<LI> $775,000 to UC Berkeley in 1995 to support the Schools Wellness Project, 
&quot;a...model aimed at transforming 11 K-12 Bay 
Area schools into centers of community health promotion.&quot;
<LI> $30,000 to the L.A. Unified School District in 1995 &quot;to create a program to identify, 
track, and assist pregnant teens.&quot;
<LI> $15,000 to UC Berkeley, School of Public Health, in 1994 &quot;to conduct research on 
the politics of prevention in health care reform and to assess the influence of the work 
supported by [CWF].&quot;
</UL>
<DD>Commenting on this connection to government, former CWF president and 
CEO Howard Kahn wrote:  &quot;Recognizing the central role of government in the lives of all Californians, we have not shied away from involvement with government and 
public policy issues.  Instead, we have embraced opportunities to affect public policy and 
leverage public funds.&quot;  (Leverage is the key word; the foundation provides $100, 
and soon the government is spending $10 million on a state-wide prevention program.)
<DD>This means, Kahn explained, &quot;evaluation of government-sponsored social and 
health service programs,&quot; and &quot;partnering&quot; 
with government &quot;to attempt to influence the shape of new or existing public programs&quot; and to ensure that &quot;prevention assumes a central role . . . in . . . efforts [of health care reform] within California.&quot;
<DD>To those who would raise an eyebrow over a possible conflict of interest between a 
foundation established by a major HMO that is aggressively pursuing Medicare and 
other government contracts at the same time that 
it gives money to government agencies and attempts to &quot;influence . . . public health 
programs&quot;:  Be advised that such activity is 
not only condoned, it's applauded as a fine example of &quot;partnering.&quot;
<P>
<a name="prev"></a>
<P><B>The Violence Prevention Initiative</B>
<P>Although millions of dollars have been awarded for projects in all five program 
areas (cited above), CWF's top priority has been the Violence Prevention Initiative (VPI).  
In just four short years CWF has positioned itself in the vanguard of the gun 
control crusade.  It has committed $30 million to 
this project, with other foundations kicking in an additional $10 million.
<P>Basically this is a gun-control campaign.  It has drawn nationwide public attention 
and has endeared the fledgling foundation to a sympathetic media.  Consistent with its 
organizing principles, CWF claims to have been the first organization to make gun control 
a public health issue.  &quot;The Initiative 
breaks with tradition by putting the issue . . . in 
a public health perspective that centers on prevention,&quot; says CWF literature.    
<DD>Yes, prevention.  What good is it, asks CWF, for a man to receive a clean bill of 
health at the local clinic, if he is killed by gunshot 
on his way home?  The solution?  Get rid of firearms.  After all, if a public health 
department can order the capping of a contaminated water source to stem cholera or order 
restaurants to stop selling tainted hamburgers, it can surely halt an &quot;epidemic&quot; of 
gun-related injuries and deaths.  
<DD>Not surprisingly, many challenge this view.  Edgar Suter, M.D., of Doctor's for Integrity 
in Policy Research, a nonprofit organization in San Ramon, Calif., has analyzed such 
allegations.  In a report titled <I>Targeting 
Deceit</I>, Suter observes that &quot;The chief strategists of the gun ban lobby have attempted to reframe the debate as a `public health' issue 
rather than a crime issue precisely because they have recognized . . . that two decades 
of criminological research has shown the bankruptcy of the claim that gun control 
reduces crime or violence.&quot; 
<DD>By using FBI and Bureau of Justice Statistics, Suter points out that drug dealers 
and drug users are &quot;overwhelmingly and disproportionately the perpetrators and victims 
of violence....[F]ar from being `innocent children,' an alarming two-thirds of gun 
homicides are of teens and young adults in the drug trade.&quot;    
<DD>Such facts make little if any impression on the anti-gun advocates, and they are 
confident of ultimate success.  &quot;This is the 
beginning of a long journey,&quot; Dr. Michael Rodriguez, Research Director of the 
CWF-funded Pacific Center for Violence Prevention, told a Sacramento anti-gun group 
last June.  As reported by the <I>Sacramento Bee, 
</I> Rodriguez warned his audience that they would face &quot;formidable obstacles, much 
like the pioneers of the anti-smoking crusade.&quot;
<DD>&quot;Twenty years ago, people were able to light up wherever they wanted,&quot; Rodriguez 
is quoted as saying.  Indeed.  And CWF is determined that just as the public was 
eventually conditioned to demand local ordinances and state laws to ban smoking in 
restaurants, work sites, and government buildings, 
&quot;education&quot; by CWF will provide the changes 
in public opinion and policy that will cause citizens to surrender their guns.  Here's 
how some of CWF's grant money is being spent on its anti-gun initiatives.
<UL> 
<LI>$650,000 every other year to fund two-year fellowships for ten community 
activists scattered throughout the state.  Also 
three annual $25,000 &quot;Peace Awards&quot; to 
selected community leaders.
<LI> $400,000 each to 17 community organizations &quot;to implement violence 
preventionprojects.&quot;
<LI> $200,000 to the Center for Investigative Reporting in San Francisco to produce 
and distribute a national televised documentary on the firearms industry.
<LI> $40,000 to the San Francisco-based Legal Community Against Violence (LCAV) for 
a resource manual, <I>Addressing Gun Violence through Local 
Ordinances</I>, a how-to book for anti-gun activists and attorneys.  It 
explains how to enact municipal ordinances that outlaw &quot;Saturday night specials&quot; 
and banish dealers from residential and other &quot;sensitive&quot; areas.  It offers advice on 
how activists can build public support for so-called &quot;rational gun regulation,&quot; and how 
to resist legal challenges to already enacted anti-gun ordinances and regulations.
</ul>
<DD>In 1992 a major grant of $1.3 million (part of an eventual total of  $7.5 million) was 
allocated to establish Rodriguez's Pacific Center for Violence Prevention.  The money went to the Trauma Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group based in San Francisco's 
General Hospital.  The Trauma Foundation has long assaulted gun ownership  going so far as to run full-page ads in major newspapers to promote anti-gun legislation.
<DD>CWF's 1993 Annual Report detailed the work of the new Center:  &quot;[L]inking 
several leading activist organizations, the Pacific Center is helping train those involved 
with the [Violence Prevention] Initiative in order to create a statewide network of 
advocates who can educate the media, public 
officials and other leaders on the public health 
perspective for violence prevention.&quot;
<DD>One such &quot;linking&quot; was with LCAV to produce the resource manual on 
passing local ordinances.  Pacific Center provided staff assistance, while Policy Director 
David Farrar contributed his expertise.  The LCAV project also borrowed anti-smoking 
activist Mark Pertschuk, son of former FTC 
Chairman Michael Pertschuk, of the California 
Preemption Education Project (a joint project of Western Consortium for Public Health 
and Americans for Nonsmokers Rights), which receives funding from CWF.
<P>
<a name="child"></a>
<B>Playing the Child Card</B>
<P><DD>Of all CWF activities, the one generating the most publicity has been the Campaign 
to Prevent Handgun Violence Against Kids.  Begun in 1993, it uses TV ads, public 
service announcements and direct mailings &quot;to 
mobilize citizen action.&quot;  CWF shamelessly 
plays the child card.  This tried-and-true tactic originated with Marian Wright Edelman 
and her Children's Defense Fund.  It entails a three-step process:  First, define an 
issue (e.g., health care, gun control, poverty) as 
a children's problem.  Second, propose a government solution.  Third, attack those 
who disagree with the specific policy as anti-children.  Thus, &quot;There are too many 
handguns, too many gun dealers and too many kids losing their lives to this epidemic, and it needs to stop,&quot; foundation President Gary Yates told the 
<I>L.A. Times</I> in April. 
<DD>The TV ads, narrated by veteran Hollywood leftist Ed Asner, told Californians 
the &quot;number one killer of kids . . . is handguns.&quot; 
 A second ad shows guns on an assembly line, with a voice-over: &quot;Business is 
booming, a handgun is produced every 20 seconds and they're put to use on our kids.  Ten kids are killed every day.  A kid commits suicide with a handgun every 8 hours.  It's an epidemic.&quot;  Suter notes that a &quot;kid&quot; 
includes anyone up to age 18  even young thugs involved in drug trafficking.
<DD>Viewers could call a toll-free number and receive a Citizen Involvement Kit, a 
brochure containing the names of community organizations to contact (most of them funded 
by CWF), names and addresses of elected officials, and a list of meaningless &quot;facts&quot; 
with which to confront officials, e.g., &quot;There are 
18 times more gun dealers than McDonald's in California.&quot;  The kit also contained 
three postcards to send to legislators asking: 
What are you doing to prevent handgun violence against California kids?
<DD>Behind the scenes of this endeavor has been the private political consulting firm 
of Martin &amp; Glantz.  Based in Marin County, it lists among its clients The Nature 
Conservancy and the Ford Foundation.  Partners Angie Martin and Gina Glantz (no relation 
to anti-tobacco enthusiast Stanton Glantz) have earned a reputation for the skill with 
which they manage advocacy campaigns.  They received over $2 million through 1994, and 
in 1995 were awarded an additional $6 million over three years &quot;to continue and expand 
the multimedia public education campaign.&quot;
<DD>A highlight of this campaign to date was a statewide, 90-minute teleconference 
titled &quot;First Aid for What's Killing Our Kids: 
A Prescription for Prevention,&quot; which 
&quot;joined the public and policy makers in 
Washington, D.C. and 18 conference sites in an 
unprecedented discussion of specific policy options for reducing violence.&quot;  The 
teleconference, held in February 1995,  featured 
pre-recorded appearances by Donna Shalala, secretary of Health and Human Services, 
and U.S. Senators Bill Bradley (D-NJ) and Barbara Boxer (D-CA).  The 1,600 participants 
made the following predictable policy recommendations:
<UL>
<LI> Banning so-called Saturday night specials
<LI> &quot;Home rule&quot; for handgun regulation 
(the preemption tactic)
<LI> Regulation of handguns as a consumer product
<LI> Increasing the penalty on carrying a concealed handgun
</UL>
<DD>The 1995 annual report describes &quot;the groundbreaking video-conference&quot; in 
glowing terms as &quot;an important tool for [CWF's] policy goal of developing long term public awareness and support for preventive 
solutions to handgun violence.&quot;  Ironically, 
these recommendations would result in greater violence.  Since criminals ignore gun laws, 
disarming innocent citizens is a policy that costs more, not fewer, lives.
<DD>The obsession with guns explains CWF's mission completely, and it also says a great deal about modern-day liberalism.  CWF 
and politicians like President Clinton focus on issues like gun control and cigarettes 
because they do not have the answers to the broader 
problems afflicting society.  Thirty years ago, liberals 
thought they had the answer:  massive government 
spending and regulation.  But that didn't work; as the 
president said in his State of the Union Address earlier this year, 
&quot;the era of big government is over.&quot;  Intellectually exhausted 
and unable to win popular support for big new 
statist schemes, those seeking to score political points 
have found that guns and tobacco companies provide easy 
targets.  It is no surprise that the president has tried to make 
so much of his opponent's assertion that cigarettes are 
not necessarily addictive for everyone.  Likewise, CWF 
and other foundations have no solutions to the social 
issues confounding America.  So they rail against guns and cigarettes.
<P>
<a name="preg"></a>
<B>The Teenage Pregnancy and Birth Prevention Initiative     </B>
<P>
<DD>While the lion's share of CWF activity to date has focused on the gun &quot;epidemic,&quot; 
it appears that the foundation has even bigger plans for its teenage pregnancy initiative 
 that is if money allocation is any indication of intent.  
<DD>Until this year the Initiative received comparatively little funding, but that has 
suddenly changed.  CWF plans to award $60 million over ten years.  Only two grants 
were listed in the 1995 annual report, though they were sizable:
<UL>
<LI> $570,000 to the California Public Health Foundation to support the organizing 
and implementation of planning and advisory groups meetings.
<LI> $3.5 million to the Public Media Center 
&quot;to design and implement the first phase of a public education campaign.&quot;
</UL>
<DD>More recently, the April 18 <I>Chronicle of
Philanthropy</I> listed nine newly awarded grants totaling $6.14 million for this Initiative. 
 Of that, $5 million is to be paid over four years to the California Family Planning 
Council based in Los Angeles, &quot;to implement a 
clinical-services and prevention model for pregnant teenagers at family planning 
organizations in high-risk areas.&quot;  Also listed in 
the <I>Chronicle</I> as a special grant on 
Reproductive Health and not as part of the Initiative, 
is $50,000 to the Washington-based National Advisory Board on Ethics in 
Reproduction for &quot;administrative support and . . . 
ethical review and analysis of reproductive-policy issues.&quot;
<DD>The VPI is a cover for promoting public acceptance of gun-control.  Is the 
teenage pregnancy initiative just camouflage for 
pushing abortion as a public health measure?  While the word 
<I>abortion</I> is never mentioned in CWF literature, the title  &quot;Teenage 
Pregnancy <I>and Birth </I> Prevention Initiative&quot; 
 presents unclear euphemisms that make one wonder what the program envisions.  
The 1994 annual report admits part of the program will include finding out &quot;what has been 
learned about preventing pregnancies and births among teenagers.&quot;  Sex education and 
family planning, we're told, &quot;are <I>not</I> enough&quot; 
(emphasis in original).  CWF seems to be planning programs far beyond condom 
distribution and birth control pills.
<DD>The rationale for doing something, anything, about teenage pregnancy is 
presented in terms sure to appeal to overburdened taxpayers.  Most teenage girls who 
have babies are poor and go on welfare, and they and their children are caught in a 
descending spiral of poverty and welfare 
dependence which costs tax dollars.  Perhaps it's just 
an oversight, but CWF does not seem at all concerned about illegitimacy and 
focuses attention on teenage pregnancy <I>per 
se</I>--which could include young married couples. 
 That is, as CWF presents the issue, the problem is not so much girls having 
babies out of wedlock, but girls having babies.<HR>
<B>Rather than orchestrating propaganda campaigns, why 
doesn't CWF underwrite the research necessary to discover the cause 
and cure of cancer, AIDS, stroke, and other diseases to which 
humans are prone?<HR>
</B><BR>
<DD>One can appreciate concern about welfare and other costs to the taxpayer.  But is 
there another, more pressing consideration?  A full-term birth in a hospital runs 
anywhere from $2,000 to over $5,000plus prenatal and post-delivery care.  However, an 
elective abortion costs only a couple of hundred dollars.  
<DD>Health Net, CWF's parent, is in stiff competition with other HMOs for 
MediCal (California's Medicaid program) contracts. 
 Under capitation, the government pays an HMO so much per member.  The 
more MediCal members are assigned to it, is it 
more cost efficient to &quot;educate&quot; teenagers 
and their families to agree to abortion when 
there's an &quot;unplanned&quot; pregnancy, rather than 
giving birth, keeping the child or placing it for adoption?  A cynical observation?  Perhaps. 
 But Health Net has the reputation among health care professionals as being the 
most cost-conscious of all the HMOs.  And one of the biggest criticisms of managed care 
in general is that too much attention is paid to costs at the expense of care.
<P>
<a name="tragic"></a>
<B>A Tragic Allocation of Funds</B>
<P>
<DD>With its vast resources and connection to a major HMO, CWF could do truly 
wonderful things in the field of biomedical research.  
In a January 22 article, <I>Time</I> detailed how 
HMOs are swelling their coffers through increased memberships, only to renege when it 
comes to paying for expected medical care.  
<I>Time</I>  reported several cases of women being 
denied bone-marrow transplant therapy for breast cancer  a last-ditch, though 
not extraordinary procedure which might have saved their lives, or at least relieved 
their suffering.
<DD><I>Time</I> explained that Health Net won't 
cover any treatment it deems experimental or investigative, and considers bone marrow 
transplants such, yet like other HMOs, &quot;it 
spends nothing on research to hunt for new treatments for disease....[I]t feels bound by 
law and competition to avoid such research.&quot;  According to 
<I>Time</I>, Health Net recently rejected a proposal to allocate money to 
research ovarian cancer, fearing that under the Americans with Disabilities Act the 
company would be held liable for discrimination against people with other forms of cancer 
and other diseases.  
<DD>But if an HMO itself can't or won't pay for research, would it not be a true benefit 
to humanity for its foundation to do so?  Rather than orchestrating propaganda 
campaigns against unapproved behaviors and attempting to strip us of our right to 
self-defense, why doesn't CWF underwrite the 
research necessary to discover the cause and cure 
of cancer, AIDS, stroke, and other diseases to which humans are prone?
<DD>The tendency of foundations such as the California Wellness Foundation to 
support strategies for social and political control 
on individual behavior in the name of &quot;prevention&quot; is one of the oddities of 
contemporary liberalism.  Once defenders of individual 
freedom, they have become prim overseers of personal deportment.

<b>Gun Control:  Is the Tide Turning?</B><BR>
<I>Battleground Shifts to the States</I><P>

<DD>Gun control is one of our society's most contentious issues.  It 
arouses strong opinions and inflames emotions on both sides of a debate that 
has become inextricably linked to concerns about crime.  Both factions in the debate see 
crime as central to their respective arguments.  
Does the availability of firearms contribute to crime? 
 Or does gun control leave law-abiding citizens defenseless against armed criminals? 
 Much more is at stake than the answers to these questions.  For some, guns are a 
symbol of all that is wrong with our 
violence-prone society; for others, gun-ownership is a 
fundamental right, an indispensable element of a free society.  
<DD>Much of the gun control debate has focused on the edges of the issue, as the 
opposing sides try to define the limits of the country's acceptance of firearms.  In 
recent years, attention has been focused on gun control measures at the national level.  
In 1993, after seven years of lobbying, Handgun Control, Inc. finally succeeded in pushing 
the so-called &quot;Brady Bill&quot; to passage.  The bill, named after former White House Press Secretary James Brady, mandates a five-day 
waiting period between purchase and delivery of a handgun.  A year later, as part of the 
1994 Crime Bill, Congress passed a ban on the importation and domestic manufacture of 
a number of semi-automatic firearms, so-called &quot;assault weapons.&quot;  Anger over the 
passage of these two pieces of legislation helped 
fuel the backlash against congressional Democrats that led to Republicans taking control 
of Congress for the first time in forty years.
<a name="debate">
<P><B>The Debate Over Concealed Weapons Packs A Lot of Heat</B>
<P>
<DD>Despite gun control activists' success in tightening gun laws at the national level, 
a broad-based and little-noticed movement has been working in the states to liberalize 
restrictive gun laws.  This &quot;Quiet Revolution&quot; in the states has focused primarily on 
changing state laws to allow individuals to carry 
a loaded, concealed firearm.  
<DD>In 1987, Florida became the first state in recent times to relax its concealed 
weapon laws.  Shortly thereafter, a number of 
other states followed suit, and the trend continues. 
 In 1995 alone, ten states liberalized their requirements.  Most of these states now 
have what is known as a &quot;shall-issue&quot; 
system, under which applicants are deemed to have a right to obtain a CCW (Carrying 
Concealed Weapon) permit, and the state must 
provide an affirmative reason to deny the issuance 
of one.  For example, states may deny applicants who have prior felony convictions or a 
history of mental illness.  They may also require proof of a certain level of proficiency with 
a handgun.
<DD>Naturally, such changes have not come without considerable controversy.  
Opponents of the Florida measure predicted carnage in the streets and suggested that 
the state's new moniker would be the 
&quot;GUNshine State.&quot;  One hysterical newspaper 
editorial summed up fears about the new law:  
<blockquote><I>&quot;[A] pistol-packing citizenry will mean 
itchier trigger fingers . . . South Florida's climate of 
 smoldering fear would flash like napalm when every stranger totes a piece, and 
every mental snap in traffic could lead to the 
crack of gunfire.&quot;</I></blockquote>  
<DD>The facts paint a far less frightening picture.  Handgun Control, Inc. (HCI) 
argues that CCW reform &quot;has not made Florida 
a safer place.&quot;  While conceding that the 
homicide rate has decreased, HCI observes that violent crime in Florida increased by 
17.8 percent in the five years following enactment of CCW reform.  But this tells only part of 
the story.  While violent crime did increase in Florida, it rose by 22.3 percent 
nationally, noticeably higher than the jump in Florida.  
In addition, fears of legally licensed firearms carriers turning minor disputes into 
deadly confrontations proved baseless.  Of 314,938 licenses issued since the law went into 
effect, only 470 have been revoked for any reason.  
<DD>Contrary to the assertions of anti-gun lobbyists, the evidence indicates that an 
armed citizenry generally has a deterrent effect 
on crime.  According to sociologists James Wright and Peter Rossi, criminals tend to 
be more concerned about encountering an armed victim than about being arrested by the 
police.  Wright and Rossi conducted two studies commissioned by the U.S. Department 
of Justice in the 1980s that examined the attitudes of incarcerated criminals towards 
violent crime.  They interviewed over 1,800 convicted felons who were in prison in ten 
different states.  A majority of these felons 
claimed to worry more about dealing with an armed victim while committing a crime than 
about running into the police.  That's one reason why so many crimes are committed 
outside the home:  criminals fear armed homeowners. 
 And when criminals do target houses, they pick residences where no one is home 
to avoid the possibility of being shot at.  Criminals prefer preying on people on the streets: 
 thanks to concealed weapons restrictions, they will most likely be unarmed.  
<DD>Wright and Rossi's study seems to validate the common assumption that 
civilian gun ownership has a significant deterrent effect on criminal behavior.  Thirty-four 
percent of the felons interviewed indicated that at some point in their criminal careers 
they had been &quot;scared off, shot at, wounded, 
or captured by an armed victim.&quot;  
<DD>How often do private citizens use firearms for self defense?  It is difficult to 
obtain precise figures, since many of these uses 
are never reported to the police, but research by Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck provides some insight.  Dr. Kleck 
undertook a huge study in 1992-93, asking nearly 5,000 people detailed questions about 
whether or not they had used a firearm to protect themselves from crime, and if so under 
what circumstances.  From the results of this 
study, Kleck estimated that close to 2.5 million Americans annually actually use firearms 
for self-defense.  In the vast majority of these cases, no one is killed or wounded, and 
rarely are shots even fired.  
<DD>It is generally recognized that localities with the strictest gun control laws do 
not have lower crime rates than jurisdictions with less restrictive laws.  For example, the 
District of Columbia has probably the strictest 
gun control laws of any municipality, and it has 
an extremely high crime rate.  Neighboring Virginia, with relatively few gun control 
laws (and a shall-issue system for CCW since 1995), has a much lower crime rate. 
<P>
<a name ="nra">
<B>National Rifle Association</B>
<P>
<DD>The participants in the political debate over concealed weapons are familiar 
and their positions are predictable.  What's different is the political strategy that 
opponents of gun control are using.  Increasingly 
frustrated by gridlock in Washington, groups like the National Rifle Association have 
turned their sights on the states, and they have 
had remarkable success in changing laws once considered politically unalterable.  Of 
these laws, CCW reform is the most recent and perhaps the most significant change.  
<DD>The largest, most powerful and probably best-known organization is the National 
Rifle Association (NRA).  Founded in 1871 by a number of ex-Union army officers to 
promote civilian marksmanship, the NRA has grown to over three million members 
nationwide, and it has an annual budget of nearly 
$155 million (1993 figures).  The NRA is a 
501(c)(4) organization, as is its lobbying division, 
the Institute for Legislative Action (ILA).  This means it is tax-exempt but, because it is 
organized to influence legislation, contributions to it are not tax-deductible.  The NRA has 
an affiliated PAC, the NRA Political Victory Fund, and a number of affiliated 501(c)(3) 
organizations, including the NRA Foundation, Firearms Civil Rights Legal Defense Fund, 
International Shooter Development Fund, National Firearms Museum Fund, and the 
NRA Special Contribution Fund.  In the 1993-94 election cycle, the NRA's PAC 
contributed almost $6 million to congressional 
candidates of both parties across the country  The ILA itself spent another $2 million on 
mailings, phone banks, and other benefits to pro-gun 
candidates. 
<DD>For most of its existence, the NRA concerned itself with training people in the 
safe and proper usage of firearms and in sponsoring shooting competitions.  This began 
to change in the late 1960s as increasingly restrictive gun control laws were proposed 
and passed, most notably the Gun Control Act of 1968.  For a time, there was 
considerable debate within the NRA about whether 
increasing the group's focus on political issues was compatible with its traditional 
interest in promoting marksmanship.  This debate continued through the 1970s, and 
culminated in the &quot;Cincinnati Revolt&quot; in which 
the NRA's executive vice-president and a number of board members who favored a 
less active political role were replaced by politically-oriented activists who wanted to 
fight gun-control legislation.  
<DD>The NRA is actively lobbying at the national, state, and local levels.  Working 
in conjunction with state organizations, NRA has successfully pushed for CCW reform 
in 19 states, and it is close to passing 
legislation in several others, including Missouri 
and New Mexico.  In this effort, the NRA works closely with sportsmen's organizations, 
including hunting and target shooting clubs, as well as with crime victims' groups.  In 
the field of CCW reform, NRA has so far worked exclusively at the state level, entirely 
bypassing the U.S. Congress.  NRA is lobbying for the adoption of laws at the state level 
that are patterned on Florida's CCW law, which establishes a shall-issue system placing 
some basic requirements on license holders..
<DD>Following the death of NRA President Tom Washington in 1995, First 
Vice-President Marion Hammer assumed office, 
giving the NRA its first-ever woman president.  
The former president of Unified Sportsmen of Florida, Hammer was instrumental in 
lobbying the Florida legislature for the passage 
of the state's CCW reform in 1987.  Hammer is a life-long Democrat and a grandmother 
who has already purchased firearms for her three grandchildren.  
<DD>It is perhaps not coincidental that the NRA's president and its chief lobbyist, 
Tanya Metaksa, are women at a time when the organization has begun to emphasize the 
importance of training women in the use of firearms. 
 This new emphasis underscores the NRA's traditional interest in firearms training.  But 
it also seeks to enlist women as a new political constituency to the ranks of those who 
believe the possession of firearms is a crime deterrent. 
<P>
<a name="gun">
<B>Gun Owners of America</B>
<P>
<DD>The other major national organization pushing for CCW reform is a more recent arrival 
to the gun control debate.  Founded in 1977 by former California state Senator H. L. 
&quot;Bill&quot; Richardson, Gun Owners of America 
presents itself as &quot;the no-compromise gun lobby,&quot; and its position on CCW reflects that.  
<DD>In contrast to NRA, Gun Owners is pushing for adoption of handgun carry laws 
modeled after those in effect in Vermont.  Alone among the states, Vermont does not 
require a permit of any sort to carry a concealed handgun.  State law makes it a crime to 
&quot;carr[y] a dangerous or deadly weapon, openly 
or concealed, while committing a felony.&quot;  
Gun Owners calls current CCW reform legislation &quot;phony,&quot; and it opposes concealed 
carry laws that require any &quot;government 
approval, permission, license, or tax&quot; to obtain a 
permit to carry a concealed weapon.  Gun Owners argues that the CCW reform legislation 
that has been adopted by most states discriminates against the poor and minorities 
because it requires application fees and the cost of firearms training that states require 
for certification to carry.  More importantly, Gun Owners argues that any government 
regulation of firearms possession will inevitably lead to further restrictions as well as 
violate constitutional rights guaranteed by the 
Second Amendment.
<DD>Politically, Gun Owners is outside of what is usually considered the political 
mainstream; it is not concerned about angering the 
political establishment.  Gun Owners has been willing to endorse and support 
candidates for public office who are considered 
longshots with little chance of winning.  In 1994, 
for instance, Gun Owners, unlike the NRA, enthusiastically backed Republican 
Steve Stockman in his congressional race against longtime House Judiciary Committee 
Chairman Jack Brooks (D-TX).  Brooks had angered Gun Owners by working for passage 
of the 1994 Crime Bill, which contained a ban on the importation and manufacture of 
certain kinds of military-style firearms known as 
&quot;assault weapons.&quot;  Gun Owners had no 
compunction about challenging Brooks, a powerful member of Congress who had 
enormous influence over gun control legislation.  Stockman went on to defeat Jack Brooks and 
became one of the &quot;Giant Slayers&quot; of the 
1994 congressional election.
<DD>Gun Owners has had limited success promoting its preferred version of CCW reform. 
 Despite the many states considering reform legislation, Gun Owners has not 
convinced any to enact its purer version.  Gun 
Owners remains an outsider, occasionally scoring a policy success, but mainly working to 
influence the course and scope of the gun control debate.       
<a name="cit">
<P>
<B>Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms</B>
<P>
<DD>Also involved in the debate is the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and 
Bear Arms, and its affiliated 501(c)(3), the 
Second Amendment Foundation.  Citizens Committee is headquartered in Bellevue, 
Washington, and employs John Snyder, an active political foe of gun control since the 1960s, 
as a congressional lobbyist in Washington, DC.  Citizens Committee was originally 
founded as a committee of the Young Americans for Freedom, but later became independent.
<a name="hand">
<P>
<B>Handgun Control Inc.</B>
<P>
<DD>Anti gun groups have scored notable legislative successes in recent years.  In 
1994, following the election of Bill Clinton, they secured federal legislation placing 
restrictions on handgun purchases and banning so-called assault weapons.  However, 
the gun control groups have had few successes in the latest state legislative battles over 
the right to carry concealed weapons.  Like many other big government advocacy groups, 
their power is concentrated in Washington, DC.  They thrive on coalition-building and 
on public relations imagemaking in the national media.  The real question is whether 
these advantages can survive renewed grassroots challenges by state and local defenders 
of Second Amendment rights.   
<DD>The largest and most powerful opponent of CCW reform is the 501(c)(4) 
Handgun Control, Inc. and its affiliated 501(c)(3), 
the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence.  Compared to the NRA, HCI is a new arrival 
in Washington.  It was founded as the National Council to Control Handguns in 1974 
by Mark Borinsky, a community activist who was mugged by an assailant who used 
a handgun.  Borinsky was joined in 1975 by Pete Shields, a former DuPont 
executive, whose son was the last of the victims of 
the infamous &quot;Zebra Killer.&quot;  Shields 
became executive director of NCCH in 1976. 
<DD>In 1985, the Council (renamed Handgun Control in 1978) gained a new board 
member who gave the group a much higher profile.  Sarah Brady's involvement in the gun 
control movement came about in a very public way:  her husband James Brady, 
Ronald Reagan's press secretary, was shot and almost killed in the 1981 attempt on 
the President's life.  Brady's name soon became synonymous with HCI's flagship 
legislative accomplishment, the Brady Bill, a federal 
law which mandates a nationwide waiting period of five business days before the purchaser 
of a handgun can take possession of it.  
<DD>Since its founding, HCI has grown to over 380,000 members, and it has an annual 
budget of over $6 million.  The affiliated Center 
to Prevent Handgun Violence (CPHV) had a budget in 1994 of $2.4 million, which 
mainly funds educational programs ($1.3 million) and a legal action project ($430,000).  
CPHV's educational efforts include its STAR 
(Straight Talk About Risks) program, which is 
intended to convince school-aged children that 
guns are a key  element of criminal violence.  
CPHV also purports to offer safety tips for those who own and keep firearms at home.  
These tips include &quot;EMPTY IT OUT AND LOCK IT UP&quot; and &quot;Explain to children that they 
should NEVER touch guns&quot; (emphasis in the 
original), tips that would preclude the ownership of a firearm for self-protection and the 
imparting of basic gun safety to children.  The advice concludes with the assertion 
that &quot;The safest thing is not to have a gun in 
your home, especially not a handgun.&quot;  
<P>CPHV's Legal Action Project defends gun control legislation in the courts from 
legal challenges by gun rights advocates.  For example, it has filed briefs defending a 
municipal Morton Grove, Illinois law banning handgun ownership and California's 
state ban on assault weapons. 
<DD>The Legal Action Project also has tried to use the courts to secure unlegislated 
gun control.  CPHV has undertaken court cases that would impose a legal doctrine of 
strict liability on manufacturers of so-called 
&quot;assault weapons.&quot;  Under this 
interpretation, manufacturers would be liable for 
damages that result from the misuse of their 
firearms, without regard to the circumstances.  
This back door approach to gun control would effectively end the production of these 
firearms and probably drive the manufacturers out of business.    
<DD>HCI has been very effective at mainstreaming its cause and attracting corporate funding.  In 1993, for example, 
Capital Cities, the owner of the ABC television 
network, and Bell Atlantic, the local telephone monopoly for much of the east coast, 
each gave $5,000 grants to CPHV.  While these are small grants, they give CPHV the 
credibility of an affiliation with major corporations.  
The Capital Cities grant is particularly 
disturbing because gun rights activists have long 
maintained that their point of view is never accurately reported by media outlets such 
as ABC.  When ABC's owner weighs in with what is essentially a political contribution 
to one side of the gun control issue, its capacity for objectivity is seriously in question.            
<DD>In 1986, HCI began what was to become a seven year effort to enact the Brady Bill 
into law.  Shortly after this effort was underway, gun control activists also discovered a 
new target, the so-called assault weapons.  On January 19, 1989, a gunman used a 
semi-automatic version of the Russian AK-47 assault rifle to kill five elementary school 
students and one teacher on a school playground.  Almost overnight, the issue of 
the &quot;widespread availability of 
semi-automatic assault weapons&quot; became a matter of public debate.  Even though the availability and 
use of semi-automatic firearms, almost all of them rifles, with military-style features would 
appear to be a separate issue, &quot;Handgun&quot; 
Control, Inc. quickly took it up with relish. 
<DD>HCI was heartened by the election of Bill Clinton, who was the first president 
since Jimmy Carter to campaign on a platform that included stricter gun control laws.  
Clinton promised to work for passage of both the Brady Bill and an assault weapons ban, 
and in 1994 he fulfilled his promise.  At the 
state level, HCI has been busy opposing CCW reform  but with considerably less 
success. 
<DD>HCI likes to position itself as a 
&quot;moderate&quot; advocacy group pushing for gun control. 
 For the most part it avoids talk of banning guns or adopting other positions that 
might alienate potential supporters.  But after 
the Brady Bill and the assault weapons ban were passed, HCI unveiled &quot;Brady II.&quot;  This was 
its blueprint for national gun control, and it is anything but moderate.  
<DD>Going far beyond the most restrictive state laws, Brady II would mandate federal 
licensing of all handgun owners, registration of 
all handgun sales, and a limit on handgun purchases to one per month.  It would make 
it harder and more expensive to obtain a firearm dealer's license, allow only licensed 
gun dealers to sell ammunition, and make it a 
crime to leave a firearm &quot;accessible&quot; to 
anyone under age 16.  In addition, Brady II would require an &quot;arsenal&quot; license for gun 
collectors; it would ban &quot;non-sporting&quot; 
ammunition, mandate that firearms be made 
&quot;child-proof&quot;, and hold parents liable for 
accidents involving their children's misuse of 
firearms that they own.
<a name="coal">
<P><B>Coalition to Stop Gun Violence</B>
<P>
<DD>If HCI is like the NRA in promoting itself as a &quot;moderate&quot; voice in the gun control 
debate, then the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence (CSGV) is the more hard-core alternative 
for gun control supporters.  Originally called the National Coalition to Ban Handguns, its 
name change illustrates how the group has attempted to widen and obscure its goals. 
 However, unlike HCI, CSGV does not deny that it wants to ban handguns 
completely from &quot;importation, manufacture, sale, 
transfer, ownership, possession and use by the general American public.&quot;  The only 
exceptions it would recognize are the &quot;police, 
military, security officers, and gun clubs where the guns are secured on the club's premises.&quot;  
<DD>Arguing that sporting and recreation is the only legitimate purpose of gun 
ownership, CSGV does not call for an outright ban 
on long arms such as rifles and shotguns (as long as they are not classified as 
&quot;assault weapons&quot;).  But while CSGV supports 
many of the proposals endorsed by HCI, it regards them merely as intermediate steps to its 
ultimate goal of banning handguns.  It would license gun owners and limit handgun 
purchases to one per month for gun owners, limit the availability of gun dealers' licenses 
and raise their cost, increase taxes on handguns and ammunition to pay for health costs 
associated with firearms, and impose its version 
of strict legal liability on firearms 
manufacturers and dealers.  
<DD>CSGV operates on an annual budget of roughly $ 1 million.  Beside its 120,000 
individual members, it has enlisted 46 labor, religious, professional, medical, and 
educational associations as members, including:  
Americans for Democratic Action, the American Jewish Committee, the Center for Science 
in the Public Interest, the National Urban League, the United States Conference of Mayors, 
and the United States Student Association (see page 5 for a full list).
<DD>As with other 501(c)4 lobbying organizations, CSGV has an affiliated 501(c)3 
organization.  This one is called the Educational Fund to End Handgun Violence.  
Established in 1978, the Fund has expanded its activities much like CPHV, operating a program, 
&quot;Hands Without Guns,&quot; for school-aged children.  
Its Firearms Litigation Clearinghouse assists plaintiffs attempting to win damages for 
shooting incidents and for injuries from defective firearms.  It also develops legal theories 
to hold firearms manufacturers liable.  The Fund also hosts an annual conference on 
gun violence and maintains a database of community anti-gun organizations.  It has an 
annual budget of slightly less than $200,000, and receives grants from several 
foundations, including $55,000 from the George Gund 
Foundation and $16,000 from the Kanter Family Foundation.   
<a name="viol">
<P>
<P><B>Violence Policy Center</B>
<P>
<DD>The Violence Policy Center, a think tank for the gun control movement, is the 
newest participant in the policy debate.  Despite 
its small size and lack of recognition, VPC has skillfully disseminated its ideas.  Founded 
in 1988 by activist Josh Sugarmann, VPC has steadily churned out reports and 
publications.  Operating on an annual budget of slightly more than $100,000, the Center 
devotes itself to studying the gun control debate and &quot;educational efforts . . . targeted 
at the general public, public policymakers, and the news media.&quot;  
<DD>While it has examined typical gun control issues such as CCW reform and assault 
weapons, VPC has made the American firearms industry a particular focus of its attention. 
 Indeed, VPC identifies the recent successes of CCW reform as representative of 
legislation conceived to provide &quot;financial 
benefits to all members of the gun lobby.&quot;  In 
<I>Concealed Carry: The Criminal's Companion</I>, VPC argues that the firearms industry, 
faced with stagnant sales, has used CCW reform to expand its markets.  It claims firearms 
instructors believe the training component in CCW reform laws will give them increased 
business.  And it imagines that the NRA sees CCW reform as a way to increase its 
recruitment of members.
<DD>VPC has had a definite impact on the policy debate over gun control.  In 1988, VPC 
published one of the first reports warning against manufacturers of &quot;assault weapons.&quot;  
When the issue acquired national significance, VPC benefitted from the publicity, and it has 
attracted major foundation funding.  Contributions by the John D. and Catherine 
T. MacArthur Foundation, the Joyce Foundation, and the Aaron Diamond 
Foundation suggest the regard in which it is held.  
<a name="state">
<P>
<P><B>The States Lead the Way</B>
<P>
<DD>In late 1994, it looked like gun rights supporters were on the ropes.  With an ally in 
the White House and many supporters in Congress, anti-gun groups had secured 
passage of the Brady Bill and the assault weapons ban, and they were poised to 
accomplish their final goal.  While the anti-gun 
groups tended to work independently of one another, their efforts were dovetailing.  
HCI strove to appear moderate in its calls for federal legislation, and was aided by 
the strident demands of CSGV.  VPC reports and studies provided arguments and data 
for more and stricter gun control laws.
<DD>The election of 1994 stalled the final assault on guns.  But the assault weapons 
ban remains intact, and President Clinton promises to veto any legislation attempting 
a repeal.  Can the anti-gun groups consolidate their gains?
<DD>This may appear to be the current situation at the national level, but it ignores the 
important changes that are taking place at the 
state level.  Reform legislation permitting the 
carrying of concealed weapons is occurring nationwide, and no help from the 
federal government is needed.  Like so many public policy reforms in recent years, from 
school choice to welfare reform, reform has 
&quot;devolved&quot; to the states.  Congress may 
soon get into the act on CCW reform, possibly by considering legislation to allow CCW 
holders to carry guns across state lines.  But for now, however, the federal government is 
not needed for reform to succeed.

<B>Denigrating America's Armed Forces</B><BR>
By Robert V. Pambianco<BR>
<P>
<DD>Lost in the news coverage over the death of Chief of Naval Operations 
Jeremy Boorda, and the concomitant tales about the problems besetting the 
Navy, is the story of just how Admiral Boorda's medals became a cause of concern for 
the news media.  After all, knowledge of campaign ribbons is not the sort of thing 
one expects of reporters.
<DD>It turns out that the medals story was fed to 
<I>Newsweek</I> and ABC News by a little-known outfit called the National 
Security News Service (NSNS).  A charter member of the blame-America-first 
chorus and an appendage of the anti-defense lobby, the Service delivers 
pre-packaged news stories to the media.  Such was 
the case with the account of Admiral Boorda's Vietnam decorations. 
<DD>Since the leg work is already done, the press naturally gobbles up these 
stories hook, line, and sinker.  The <I>Washington 
Post</I>, ABC's &quot;World News Tonight,&quot; 
and &quot;Prime Time Live&quot; have all used NSNS reports, all of which are hostile to the 
U.S. armed forces and invariably designed to denigrate the defense establishment.
<DD>Veteran activist Wayne T. Jaquith founded NSNS in 1990 as an adjunct 
of the Peoples Education Center.  Earlier, Jaquith had been executive director 
of another far-left group called Physicians for Social Responsibility, the 
American affiliate of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War  one 
of a number of groups used by the Soviet Union to undermine support for 
military preparedness in the West.  As the <I>Washington 
Times</I> reported on May 20, these groups were loosely tied to Soviet 
&quot;active measures&quot; and were conceived by then KGB head Yuri Andropov as a 
replacement for the nuclear-freeze movement, which had lost credibility as a 
result of its more direct ties to Soviet espionage.  Yevgeniy Chazov, health 
minister under Leonid Brezhnev, was the head of the international physicians group.
<DD>Apparently unhappy with the outcome of the cold war, NSNS seems 
determined to inflict revenge on the U.S. military that made the West's triumph 
possible.  Indeed, NSNS's bureau chief, Joseph J. Trento, a former CNN 
reporter, told the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> that 
now that Admiral Boorda is dead, &quot;What we're going to do is look to see if 
there was some other reason that Boorda felt exposed.&quot;
<DD>NSNS receives funding from liberal foundations, most prominently the 
W. Alton Jones Foundation, a supporter of sundry left-liberal causes.  Jaquith 
told <I>Organization Trends</I> that his group 
also receives funding from the John D. &amp; Catherine T. MacArthur 
Foundation, one of America's premier establishment philanthropies.  And he confirmed 
that it had received one grant from the Arca Foundation, which in the past was 
run by liberal gadfly Marge Tabankin, former head of the Hollywood Women's 
Political Caucus and current director of the Streisand Foundation.
<DD>The real story here is not the news service; it is what this tells us about 
the American media.  Groups like NSNS exist on the extreme fringe of the 
political spectrum.  Yet with little effort, they 
are able to sell their wares to unquestioning reporters.  The same reporters who 
would instinctively question the motives of anything prepared by a 
right-of-center think tank, are all too happy to serve 
as a conduit for NSNS's anti-military agenda, while affecting shock and 
disbelief at any suggestion of bias.

<I>December, 1996</I><BR>
<h2>Coporate Philanthropy: A Reexamination</h2>
<hr>

<I>Corporations and corporate foundations gave an estimated $6.11 billion to nonprofit organizations in 1994. 
 This represented 4.7 percent of total charitable giving ($129.88 billion).  Of this $6.11 billion, the 
largest corporations gave at least $35.78 million to public-affairs organizationsgroups that seek to influence 
public policy in such areas as the environment, taxes, and regulation.
<P>While $35.78 million is a relatively minor amount, public-affairs groups operating with small budgets 
have successfully lobbied government to reallocate billions of dollars in private-sector resources.  This is a 
central contention of Capital Research Center's 
</I>Patterns of Corporate Philanthropy<I>, an annual study of 
corporate public-affairs giving.  CRC research associate 
<B>Austin Fulk</B> summarizes findings from this year's 
tenth anniversary edition, which examines corporate giving in 1994.
<P>This issue also features an essay on corporate giving by 
<B>William E. Simon</B>, a CRC trustee and president 
of the John M. Olin Foundation who served as Secretary of the Treasury to Presidents Nixon and Ford.
<P>Six observers of corporate philanthropy respond: 
<B>Kristen A. Avansino</B>, President of the E.L. 
Wiegand Foundation; <B>Albert Dunlap</B>, Chairman of Sunbeam Corporation; economist 
<B>Milton Friedman</B>; <B>Heather R. Higgins</B>, Director of the Randolph Foundation; 
<B>Henry Manne</B>, Professor of Law at George Mason 
University; and <B>Dorothy S. Ridings</B>, President of the Council on Foundations.
<P>Finally, CRC Visiting Fellow <B>Martin Morse 
Wooster</B> reviews <B>John Hood</B>'s new book, 
</I>The Heroic Enterprise: Business and the Common Good<BR>
<B>Taking Philanthropy Seriously:
<P>Giving as Though Our Future
<P>Depended on It
<P>by William E. Simon</B>
<P>
<P>It is a sad commentary, but I see many American 
business leaders financing the destruction of freedom.  They 
have been doing so for decades.  I don't mean that they 
give enormous amounts of money to political candidates 
who regularly vote against the interests of a competitive 
free economy (they do, but that is another matter).
<P>I am referring to their support of nonprofit 
organizations that are controlled by what Irving Kristol has called 
the &quot;new class.&quot;  This elite, hostile to the fundamental 
principles of our society, happily devours the fruits of 
capitalism while working to poison the tree that bears them.

<B>Patterns of Corporate Philanthropy,
<P>Tenth Edition:
<P>Funding the Clinton Agenda
<P>by Austin Fulk</B>
<P>
<P>1994 marked a pivotal point in the history of 
American politics.  After two years of the Clinton presidency and 
forty years of Democratic control of the House of 
Representatives, voters turned out to elect Republican majorities 
in both Houses of Congress.
<P>Anger at Clinton Administration plans to expand the 
size of government fueled voter upheaval: a failed attempt 
to nationalize the health-care system, tax increases despite 
a Clinton campaign promise for &quot;middle-class tax cuts,&quot; 
and continued assaults on private property rights 
alienated many voters and led to the Democrats' reversal of fortune.

be viewed as &quot;progressive&quot; and &quot;socially responsible,&quot; no matter to what asinine end 
this leads them.  They are in mortal terror of being 
branded &quot;conservative&quot; or &quot;rapacious&quot; or &quot;insensitive&quot; or 
&quot;exploiters&quot; and of losing their seats at the annual dinners 
of organizations dedicated to their destruction.
<P>
<P><B>The Entrepreneurial Spirit</B>
<P>This was not the attitude of the great entrepreneurs 
who built American enterprise.  Andrew Carnegie did not 
yearn to be the guest of honor at a dinner of the Industrial 
Workers of the World.  He had faith in the system of 
private enterprise and worked to produce, as cheaply as 
possible, the steel to build the railroads, bridges, and skyscrapers 
of a rising America.
<P>John D. Rockefeller wanted to make transportat<BR>

the anti-capitalist movement today.  They have done it not only by avoiding 
the struggle, but, worse yet, by financing their opponents.&quot;<BR>
ion and illumination available to every family.  Henry Ford 
wanted to give millions of Americans a chance at low-cost 
transportation.  Jim Hill envisioned a northern empire across 
the great plains, built a great railroad without 
government subsidies, and brought settlers to produce wheat 
for America's bread.
<P>These were tough-minded men, and some of the 
things they did invited legitimate criticism; but they never 
wavered in their faith that freedom of enterprise would 
build a great and powerful and prosperous America.
<P>By contrast, a distressing number of today's 
non-owning managers of industry act like bureaucrats in 
three-piece suits whose goal is to get along without making waves.  
If Carnegie had had that mentality, he would have retired 
as the chief telegrapher of the Pennsylvania Railroad, 
and somebody elseI hopewould have forged the rails 
to cross our prairies and made the steel plate for our 
Great White Fleet.
<P>Business leaders who lack commitment to the virtues 
of our system are almost as guilty as those whose goal is 
to destroy that system.  They urge business to keep a 
&quot;low profile&quot; and scoff at the free-market ideal as an 
obsolete notion in this modern age.  They have an obsession 
with being accepted and toasted by the most vocal of 
their <BR>
<B>Fueling the War on Freedom</B>
<P>The keenest and most prophetic analysis of this 
problem was offered half a century ago by Joseph Schumpeter in 
his landmark work <I>Capitalism, Socialism, and 
Democracy</I>.  It was he who first pointed out that capitalism, by its 
very success in raising the standard of living to 
unprecedented heights, would weaken the institutions necessary for 
its survival, giving way to a centralized socialist 
bureaucracy that would exploit the productive capacity created by 
private enterprise.
<P>Schumpeter gloomily concluded that the leaders of 
capitalism would likely absorb the slogans of radicalism and 
let themselves be converted &quot;to a creed hostile to [their] 
very existence&quot; because they were &quot;rapidly losing faith in 
[their] own creed.&quot;  &quot;This is verified,&quot; he wrote, &quot;by the 
characteristic manner in which particular capitalist interests 
and bourgeoisie as a whole behave when facing direct attack. 
 They talk and plead or hire people to do it for them.  
They snatch at every chance of compromise.  They are ever 
ready to give in.  They never put up a fight under the flag of 
their own ideals and their interests.&quot;
<P>There are, in my view, several different reasons 
why business leaders act this way.  One is simply lack 
of awareness.  They are too busy running their businesses 
to know what is going on in the intellectual world about 
them, unless their companies are specifically attacked.  
Such ignorance can well be economically fatal.
<P>Others, while perhaps aware of the drumbeat of 
attacks on capitalism, are simply unable to understand why 
those attacks are invalid.  Perhaps it sounds reasonable to them 
to believe that capitalism is some kind of scourge and 
affliction which has beset much of the world while ignoring 
the fact that people in non-Western countries yearn for 
the same chance at freedom and prosperity.
<P>Some may be aware of the merits of our system but 
have no inkling of how to fight back.  After all, they are 
in business, not in battles over public opinion, and they 
are usually less confident with the written word than is 
the intellectual class from which the attack springs.  So 
they flee the field of battle.
<P>Still others simply may not want to get involved.  
They simply assume that, somehow, the system of which they 
are a part will survive the attacks of its enemies without 
their participation.  Only when the attack hits home do they 
wake upand then it may be too late.  Edmund Burke's 
famous maxim is particularly apt: &quot;All that is necessary for 
the forces of evil to win in the world is for good men to 
do nothing.&quot;
<P>The worst are those who yield before the assaults of 
their enemies.  They long to 
<!-- Generation of story text from PM publication page 3 -->

critics.
<P>Two decades ago, at the American Enterprise 
Institute, Robert Bork observed that &quot;These are the people thought 
of by the general public and by critics of the corporate 
system as bold, rapacious, cunning leaders, the Machiavellis of 
our society.&quot;  In reality, however, &quot;one finds many of them to 
be docile, apprehensive, defensive, and unsure of how 
to respond to sharp unrelenting attacks. . . .  It is as though 
a large fraction of the [business] community . . . wants 
to make preemptive concessions, as if they meet not to plan 
a fight against a wrongheaded movement but to discuss 
how best to negotiate the terms of surrender.&quot;
<P>Bork went on to concludeand it is a conclusion I 
very much sharethat business can never regain its moral 
legitimacy until business leaders can convince the rest of 
the country that they believe in that legitimacy themselves. 
 Their defensive posture &quot;will earn only the contempt of 
the enemies of corporations and capitalism, while leading 
the large, relatively indifferent majority to suppose that 
the <BR>
&quot;Every corporation should spend every dollar of every contribution 
with the same care it devotes to employee pay and new equipment.  
Decisions about corporate contributions should be made on the same level, and 
by many of the same people, as decisions about corporate strategy 
and investment.&quot;<BR>
essage.
<P>A second step is for business leaders themselves to 
play an active role on the boards of foundations that 
their businesses have made possible.  The most fatal of errors 
is for men and women who have proven themselves in 
the profit-making sector to accept a foundation board seat 
and then sit back while professional foundation managers 
tell them the &quot;right&quot; thing to do.
<P>There are many able and conscientious foundation 
executives like Michael Joyce of the Bradley Foundation 
and Jim Piereson of Olin; but for every Joyce and 
Piereson, there seem to be dozens who practice the foundation 
equivalent of &quot;pack journalism&quot;managers who, with aims 
far different from those of their foundations' creators, make 
a career of trying to awe their directors with their 
superior wisdom and grander vision of the &quot;public interest.&quot;  
These people are very good at manipulating words and symbols 
so that the business director or trustee feels almost ashamed 
to <BR>
critics must be right: if capitalism were a positive good 
and worth defending, business leaders would not be so ready 
to compromise and, if need be, to capitulate.&quot;
<P>Alas, it is these same business leaders who have 
provided much of the driving energy of the anti-capitalist 
movement today.  They have done it not only by avoiding the 
struggle, but, worse yet, by financing their opponents.
<P>In 1995, American corporations gave out more than 
$7 billion in charitable contributions, much of it for 
very worthwhile charities like hospitals, the Red Cross, 
and religious institutions; but millions upon millions of 
dollars also are handed out to politically activist nonprofit 
organizations.  This money is lavished on groups whose 
actions show them to be contemptuous of democratic 
capitalism and enthusiastic about the squalor of collectivism.
<P>In 1977, the late Henry Ford II, grandson of the man 
who pioneered the low-cost car and the $5 daily wage, 
resigned from the board of the Ford Foundation, writing that 
&quot;The Foundation is a creature of capitalism&quot; but that &quot;it is 
hard to discern recognition of this fact in anything the 
Foundation does.  It is even more difficult to find an 
understanding of this in many of the institutions, particularly the 
universities, that are the beneficiaries of the Foundation's 
grant programs.&quot;  He urged his fellow trustees to &quot;examine 
the question of our obligations to our economic system and 
to consider how the foundation, as one of the system's 
most prominent offspring, might act most wisely to 
strengthen and improve its progenitor.&quot;  Asked why this had 
happened, he replied, &quot;I tried for thirty years to change it from 
within, to no avail.&quot;
<P>This is an all too familiar pattern in our largest 
foundations and corporations.  What a tragedy it would be 
if capitalism should prove to be the engine of its own 
destruction through its mindless support of those who would 
tear it down.
<P>
<P><B>What Can Be Done?</B>
<P>Fortunately, much can be done.  The first step is 
to awaken business leaders to the nature and magnitude of 
the threat and stiffen their backbones for the battle.
<P>There are many ways to do this, but there is no 
substitute for the determined leadership of those who are respected 
in the world of business.  My model here is the late John 
M. Olin, whose foundation I have the honor to head.  John 
Olin built a great industrial enterprise but never lost sight of 
the fundamentals of a free society.  When he endowed a 
foundation, he made it clear that its mission was to preserve 
our freedoms and strengthen our resolve in the unending 
battle we face.  When he spoke to businessmen, he 
unhesitatingly came down hard on the vital importance of preserving 
this system.  Others must come forward to repeat that m<BR>

<B>Taking Philanthropy Seriously</B>
<P><I>(continued from page 3)</I><BR>
question the destination and use of grant money.
<P>Foundation trustees must, in a sense, become 
philosophical detectives, cutting through jargon and rhetoric to 
understand what is really being proposed.  Business 
people, whether they serve on foundation boards and 
corporate contributions committees or make contributions on 
their own, must take their obligations seriously.  They must 
learn to be as careful in their contributions as they are in 
their personal investments.
<P>Third, those of us who believe in the great principles 
of liberty upon which our society was founded must take 
pains to see that corporate and foundation gifts are directed to 
the support of institutions and individuals who are working 
to maintain freedom.  When I was Treasury Secretary, 
I offered this thought in a speech to corporate public 
affairs officers: Counsel your principals not to support 
organizations whose aim is to destroy our freedoms.  Unless 
corporations and business leaders steer their corporate gifts 
to institutions that are helping to maintain freedom, the 
largesse of the free enterprise system will continue to 
finance its own destruction.
<P>
<P><B>A Reaffirmation</B>
<P>The task of business is to ensure that voices are 
raised effectively from philanthropic institutions to support a 
free society.  The American people will always choose 
freedom once they understand the implications of the 
collectivist alternatives.
<P>Capitalism has no duty to subsidize its enemies.  It 
does have a duty to support the efforts of those individuals 
and institutions which cherish our freedoms and the values 
of Western civilization.  Every corporation should 
spend every dollar of every contribution with the same care 
it devotes to employee pay and new equipment.  
Decisions about corporate contributions should be made on the 
same level, and by many of the same people, as decisions 
about corporate strategy and investment.
<P>Corporations and foundations ought to apply 
zero-based budgeting to their contributions.  Instead of having 
an assistant treasurer just write the annual check, 
business leaders should look closely to see whether their 
donations are still serving a useful purpose or whether they could 
be put to better use elsewhere.
<P>Years ago, Joseph Schumpeter was asked whether 
his gloomy analysis of the impending decline of capitalism 
was defeatist.  He replied with some indignation, &quot;the 
report that a given ship is sinking is not defeatist, only the spirit 
in which this report is received can be defeatist.  The crew 
can sit down and drink.  But it can also rush to the pumps.&quot;<BR>
<B>Kristen A. Avansino
<P>President and Executive Director
<P>The E.L. Wiegand Foundation</B>
<P>
<P>The business of nonprofits is the business of 
for-profits plus altruism.  More than ever, responsible giving 
and responsible disbursement are the bywords of 
exemplary philanthropy.  But today's philanthropic climate also 
demands that we repeat two caveats: Henry Ward 
Beecher warned donors, &quot;Do not give, as many rich men do, like 
a hen that lays an egg, and then cackles.&quot;  William Simon 
has warned trustees, &quot;Do not accept a foundation board seat 
and then sit back.&quot;
<P>Avansino: &quot;While a grant proposal may pull at a trustee's heartstrings,
<P>a sound business assessment is mandatory.&quot;<BR>
Management expert Peter Drucker reminds us that 
&quot;leadership is a foul-weather job.&quot;  The trustee who 
exercises real leadership must have a discerning mind and heart. 
 Every decision, however minuscule, embodies a 
fiduciary responsibility that transcends business as usual.  The 
trustee must understand the foundation's mission and have a 
profound respect for the donor whose wealth created 
the foundation.
<P>The trustee should assure that the financial 
mandates inherent in the for-profit world are also brought to bear 
on the foundation.  Questions regarding the foundation's 
fiscal health, management practices, efficiency, and 
effectiveness should be addressed, as should the &quot;buzzwords&quot; of 
the '90sduplication of services and accountability.  In 
short, while a grant proposal may pull at the trustee's 
heartstrings, a sound business assessment is mandatory.
<P>In the end, the business of nonprofit grant review 
should resemble business itself.  Philanthropy, the cornerstone 
of a civil society, demands no less.
<P>
<P><B>Albert Dunlap
<P>Chairman and CEO

<P>
<P>Business is not a social experiment.  Far too 
many business leaders lose sight of what should be the goal 
of corporations in a capitalistic environmentlong-term 
profit optimization.  This objective creates and promotes 
the 
<!-- Generation of story text from PM publication page 5 -->

competitiveness which is essential for America to 
prosper in a global economy.
<P>One of the major underlying problems with 
corporate philanthropy is that most executives are self-serving 
and shortsighted.  Their actions, however, have long-term 
consequences for which they either do not care or do 
not understand.  They thirst for acceptance and 
recognition from the &quot;elite&quot; and fear criticism from the public.  
In today's environment, where the press is quick to attack 
and even sensationalize controversial views and decisions, 
most business leaders politicize their actions to avoid such 
criticism.
<P>If capitalism is to be protected and American business 
is to thrive, business leaders must be educated as to 
the completeness of their actions and their long-term effect 
on free enterprise.  They must then have the conviction to 
make decisions for the good of the whole, even if those 
who benefit resist due to their ignorance.  The price of 
leadership is criticism.
<P>
<P><B>Dr. Milton Friedman
<P>Senior Research Fellow
<P>Hoover Institution</B>
<P>
<P>As William Simon stresses, the social function of 
a business corporation is to produce goods and services 
that customers wish to buy, and to do so at the lowest 
possible cost.  Its function is not to serve as a philanthropic 
or charitable organization.  The only justification for 
philanthropy is tax avoidance: under present law, 
contributions up to a specified fraction of income are deductible 
in calculating income subject to tax, whereas dividend 
payments are not.  Accordingly, a one dollar reduction 
in dividends enables corporations to make a contribution 
of more than one dollar at the same cost.
<P>Friedman: &quot;I see little reason to expect the business community 
to change its current suicidal behavior with respect to philanthropy.&quot;<BR>
lative and rights can be created and changed.  
Importantly, too, since men are naturally good, evil can't 
come from them but rather wholly from the effects of evil 
social forces (e.g., poverty, capitalism, racism, and sexism).  
These forces must be countered by massive changes to 
society, essentially through the instrument of government.
<P>As a culture, we have largely succumbed to this 
second <BR>
The individual stockholder benefits if and only if 
the contributions are to causes or organizations that he or 
she wishes to support.  Except for closely held 
corporations with few stockholders, the way to assure that outcome 
is one Warren Buffet adopted many years ago for 
Berkshire-Hathaway.  Dividend checks to stockholders are 
accompanied by a statement along the following lines: &quot;In 
addition to paying a dividend, Berkshire-Hathaway will 
contribute X dollars per share of stock to charitable causes.  
Please return the enclosed form telling us whom you would 
like your share of those contributions to be given.&quot;
<P>Unfortunately, few corporations have followed that 
excellent example.  Short of their doing so or of tax 
changes that either permit the deductibility of dividends in 
calculating corporate taxes or deny the deductibility of 
charitable contributions, I see little reason to expect the 
business community to change its current suicidal behavior 
with respect to philanthropy.

<P>
<P>From earliest childhood, I recall my frustrated 
father commenting in disgust that when it came to philanthropy 
or serving on boards, &quot;Businessmen park their brains at 
the door.&quot;  Sadly, experience repeatedly bears out this 
observation.
<P>Simon is correct in his analysis of the various factors 
that influence this behavior: preoccupation, ignorance, 
timidity, naivet&eacute;, and shallowness.  I would go even 
further, however, and argue that behind these characteristics lie 
a vast philosophical change which has affected most 
Americans, not just business leaders: a complete reorientation 
in the basic assumptions of who we are and how we relate 
to the world around us.
<P>The classical view, held even by deists, was that we 
were creatures of Goda relationship that had vast 
implications for our understandings of right and wrong, and for the 
role of government.  In such a world view, man is neither 
good nor bad but capable of choosing either.  As defined by 
God or natural law, there is both truth and a baseline for 
good that exist outside of man.  And there are basic rights, 
which also exist outside of man and delimit the capacity of 
others to encroach upon him while creating obligations 
toward others.
<P>In contrast, the modern view holds that man himself 
is good and therefore the arbiter of the good.  Since each 
can define his own understanding of what is right, truth

 giving.  Thus, we often find that corporations and foundations based 
on business wealth regularly support a left-wing 
intellectual and social agenda.  This activity must be the 
philanthropic counterpart to the Edsel.
<P>But as Mr. Simon makes very clear, there are some 
very good products available to both corporate and 
foundation officials interested in free markets, smaller 
government, individual freedom, and private property.  It would 
certainly be worth more of these officials' time to 
inform themselvesand avail themselvesof these 
&quot;purchase&quot; opportunities.
<P>
<P><B>Dorothy S. Ridings
<P>President
<P>Council on Foundations</B>
<P>
<P>William Simon makes a strong case for his 
argument about what he perceives as wrongheaded corporate 
philanthropy.  But he uses an overly broad brush in painting 
a picture of business leaders whose charitable giving 
does not meet his standards.  In my view, it does not help 
Mr. Simon advance his cause unless he's satisfied with 
simply &quot;preaching to the converted.&quot;
<P>I am disheartened, in fact, by the tone he employs to 
make his case.  Thoughtful people who do not already hold 
his views surely are turned off by language asserting that 
they are &quot;financing the destruction of freedom&quot; with their 
gifts to unnamed organizations that &quot;happily [devour] the 
fruits of capitalism while <BR>

expenditures to 'purchase' a desired product or service.&quot;<BR>
working to poison the tree that bears them.&quot;  Colorful language, smacking of an evil plot.  
Such demonization does not advance his argument.
<P>The central strength of organized philanthropy in 
this country has always been in its diversity.  Deliberation, 
even strong debate, should be encouraged among those 
with differing views on the ramifications of that diversity.  
But characterization that leads to rigid polarization does 
not foster rational conclusions.  Nor does it change 
many minds.<BR>
view, and until we change that understanding, it is 
unlikely that the majority of businessmen will have either the 
intestinal fortitude or the intellectual ammunition to 
understand and defend the foundations of our society.
<P>One final point: I wholeheartedly endorse Simon's 
recommended solutions.  To them I would add the 
observation that because John M. Olin was a keen student of 
human nature and of the long-term problems of bad systems, he 
set up his foundation with a life limited to the likely lifespan 
of the handpicked individual he most trusted, William Simon. 
 While there are various ways to limit perpetuities, I 
would encourage us to look to the sunsetting of foundations as 
a valuable tool in the reform and strengthening of 
philanthropy.
<P>
<P><B>Dr. Henry Manne
<P>Professor
<P>George Mason University
<P>School of Law</B>
<P>
<P>Among the first articles I ever published, over 40 
years ago, was a criticism of the doctrine of corporation law 
that allowed corporations to engage in philanthropic activities. 
 Over the next 20 years I came to see that my position, 
while theoretically correct, was impractical and unworkable. 
 While I still believe, as an old American case had it, 
that &quot;charity <I>qua</I> charity has no seat at the board of 
directors,&quot; this is a long way from approving a rule that would 
allow courts to examine the deepest motives and intentions 
of corporate officials.
<P>Very little of what we term corporate philanthropy 
today is done with the sense of anonymous altruism that 
would have satisfied Maimonides.  Rather, consciously or 
unconsciously,  corporate officials recognize that it is 
good business, and I would never allow judges to interfere 
with straightforward business judgments, no matter what 
they are called.
<P>But since my justification for allowing corporate 
charities is ultimately a profit-oriented one, I would 
strongly endorse William Simon's clarion call for use of 
normal business intelligence in making these contributions.  
In fact, I would even urge corporate and foundation 
officials to go one step further and to view these expenditures not 
as &quot;contributions&quot; or &quot;philanthropy&quot; at all.  Rather, 
they should be seen as normal expenditures to &quot;purchase&quot; 
a desired product or service.
<P>The words &quot;charity&quot; and &quot;philanthropy&quot; have today 
been so confounded by liberals to cover only their own set 
of desired goals that it has become difficult for busy

<B>Patterns of Corporate Philanthropy</B>
<P><I>(continued from page 1)</I><BR>
During the ensuing years the ratio rose steadily, reaching $3.42 in 1992.  In 
the first year after President Clinton's election, corporate 
giving to left-of-center advocacy groups spiked at $4.07. 
 Corporate contributions to advocacy groups favored by 
the Administration, such as the Children's Defense Fund 
and Planned Parenthood, were particularly pronounced.
<P>
<P><B>Ratings System</B>
<P>As in previous years, we have divided grant recipients  
of corporate philanthropy into the following categories:
<P>n<I>Change-Oriented Right</I> (ratings of 8 and 7).  
These are conservative groups such as the Heritage 
Foundation and Capital Research Center, and libertarian or 
market-liberal groups such as the Cato Institute and Reason 
Foundation.  These organizations promote policy reforms 
that encourage private-sector alternatives to government 
programs, urge tax cuts, call for reduced regulatory burdens 
on businesses, and promote individual freedom and 
responsibility.  These groups received $3.01 million in 
1994a little over eight percent of corporate public-affairs giving.
<P>n<I>Establishment Right</I> (ratings of 6).  
Organizations such as the American Enterprise Institute and the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce generally favor free-market 
policies.  But they also allow for more government 
regulation and are skeptical of radical and systemic changes in 
public policy.  They received $4.85 million, or 13.5 percent 
of corporate public-policy giving, in 1994.
<P>n<I>Centrist</I> (rating of 5).  Think-tanks like the 
Rand Corporation and the Center for Governmental 
Research generally support &quot;good government&quot; reforms.  They 
tend to study specific policy issues and avoid taking 
philosophical or broadly political positions on controversial matters. 
 They received 2.71 percent of corporate public 
affairs giving in 1994the smallest percentage going to 
advocacy.
<P>n<I>Establishment Left</I> (ratings of 4 and 3).  
These groups favor government action to solve most social ills. 
 They support higher taxes, more government spending, 
and more regulation of the economy.  They include the 
Brookings Institution, National Alliance of Business, National 
Urban League, Committee for Economic Development, and 
National Wildlife Federation.  They received $22.88 
million in 1994almost two-thirds of corporate public-policy giving.
<P>n<I>Change-Oriented Left</I> (ratings of 2 and 1).  
This category includes organizations that work for 
extensive government control of social and economic 
institutions, such as the Children's Defense Fund, NAACP, and 
Center <BR>
<B>Advocates for Bigger Government</B>
<P>Much of the Administration's failed legislative 
agenda was crafted and promoted by nonprofit special 
interest advocacy groups headquartered in Washington, D.C.  
Advocacy groups and think-tanks that want more 
government control over the economy published policy papers and 
held press briefings to support the Administration's 
programs while offering their personnel to staff federal 
departments and agencies.  Groups like the Children's Defense 
Fund, once chaired by Hillary Rodham Clinton and Health 
and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, pushed for 
government health care and mobilized to scuttle welfare 
reform.  The NAACP, Mexican American Legal Defense 
and Education Fund (MALDEF), and National Urban 
Leagueorganizations that supplied high-ranking officials to 
the Clinton Administrationalso got behind the 
health-care plan.  On the environmental front, groups such as 
the League of Conservation Voters (LCV), Wilderness 
Society, and World Wildlife Fund demanded more 
environmental regulation at the expense of private property owners. 
 LCV president Bruce Babbitt became Secretary of 
the Interior.  A host of nonprofit executives from other 
environmental groups also filled Administration jobs.
<P>The ties between government and big-government 
advocacy groups have never been stronger.  As the 
federal government runs out of money and ideas, it is 
increasingly turning to these groups.  They not only supply 
proposals and lobby to enact them into law.  Increasingly, 
they determine where taxpayer dollars will be spent.  They 
get government jobs, run government programs, and 
spend taxpayers' money.  A large and expanding government is 
in their self-interest.  This much is clear.
<P>
<P><B>Corporate Support for Bigger Government</B>
<P>What is less understandable is how nonprofit and 
tax-exempt advocacy groups can successfully ask 
profit-making and taxpaying corporations for financial support 
for their agenda.  Why do corporations willingly agree to 
their requests for funding?
<P>In 1994, the most recent year for which data is 
widely available, major American corporations gave almost 
$27 million to advocacy groups that promote public 
policies calling for higher taxes, more regulation, and less 
economic freedom for corporations. <I> For every dollar that 
corporations gave to right-of-center and pro-free market 
groups, they gave $3.43 to liberal and left-of-center 
advocacy groups promoting bigger government.</I>
<P>Each year since 1986, Capital Research Center has 
measured corporate giving to public-policy organizations 
and has compared giving to groups on the left and right.  
In 1986, the ratio was $1.64 to $1.00.  <BR>

 liberal or left-of-center.  For their money, corporations in 1994 
supported tax-exempt groups that favor public policies that 
harm business and free enterprise.
<P>Chief among these policies was the Clinton 
health-care proposal.  Its immense and complicated bureaucracy 
coupled with mandated heavy costs on employers threatened

in America,&quot; she revealed an attitude that should 
have opened the eyes of corporate leaders.  Many, 
however, continued to contribute to groups like the Children's 
Defense Fund and the NAACP that strongly supported 
Clinton health policies.
<P>In 1994, major corporations also gave to the 
Environmental Defense Fund, National Audubon Society, 
Natural Resources Defense Council, and World Wildlife Fund. 
 These groups supported the Administration's ill-fated 
BTU tax on energy the year before.  The tax would have 
increased the price of oil by an estimated 17 percent, coal 
by 15 percent, and natural gas by 11 percent.  But 
apparently many corporations were not outraged by the effort to 
raise taxes and force a reduction in the use of fuel.  In 1994, 
even President Clinton momentarily admitted, &quot;I raised 
your taxes too much.&quot;  Did corporations agree?
<P>When corporations contribute to political advocacy groups that 
want more government programs, they make their own shareholders foot 
the bill twice overas shareholders and as taxpayers.<BR>
 disguise their current policy activism.
<P>In other cases, corporations may distribute 
relatively small contributions as tribute money to buy time and 
avoid harassment.  But the activities of advocacy groups 
during the Clinton years make a mockery of that hope.  
The millions of dollars these groups receive from 
corporations simply enable them to pursue goals that undermine the 
free-enterprise system on which corporations depend.
<P>Of course, some corporations may conclude that 
their well-being ultimately depends on the favor of the 
Administration in power.  That might explain an initial flurry 
of 1993 contributions to the Children's Defense Fund 
and Planned Parenthood.  But this kind of giving yields 
bad public policy and worse philanthropy.
<P>When corporations support advocacy groups that 
want more government entitlements and social services, 
they hurt the recipients of charity as well as charities themselves. 
 This is the sorry lesson of our welfare programs.  
Philanthropy, including corporate philanthropy, should call 
on the desire of good people to do good deeds.  But 
when corporations contribute to political advocacy groups 
that want more government programs, they make their 
own shareholders foot the bill twice overas shareholders 
and as taxpayers.<BR>
<B>Corporate Misgiving</B>
<P>This year's <I>Patterns of Corporate Philanthropy 
</I>contains other examples of foolish giving:
<P>nACORN (the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now) is a direct-action advocacy group.  
It uses the threat of federal penalties to pressure 
banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions 
to make higher-risk loans at lower-risk rates to borrowers 
it recommends.  In 1994, BankAmerica, Bank of 
Boston, Chase Manhattan, Fannie Mae, PNC Bank, and the St. 
Paul Companies contributed $483,000 to ACORN.  This is 
an almost six-fold increase in 1993 corporate support 
for ACORN.
<P>nFord Motor Company gave $1,000 to the American Lung Association (ALA), which has lobbied to 
increase EPA emissions standards for automobiles.  ALA's image 
as a non-political public-health group belies its 
aggressive lobbying on a wide range of controversial issues.  Ford 
also donated $10,000 to the World Wildlife Fund, which 
promoted the failed BTU tax to cut fuel consumption 
and increase costs.  What was Ford thinking?
<P>nOil companies Chevron (despite a number two 
rating in our Top Ten) and Atlantic Richfield (ARCO) gave to 
the National Audubon Society and the Center for Marine 
Conservation, both of which oppose offshore oil drilling.  
Chevron, although it gave to groups that support free 
markets, also supported the Trust for Public Lands, which 
also opposes offshore oil drilling.
<P>
<P><B>Harming Charities and Those They Serve</B>
<P>Why do corporations support policy groups whose 
goals are bad for business?  CEOs and managers of 
corporate grantmaking departments may simply be ignorant of 
the agendas of nonprofits applying to them for grants.  
Groups with catchy names and smooth fundraisers often present 
an image at odds with the hardball politics they play in 
Washington.  Large and well-known groups like the 
American Cancer Society, National Audubon Society, and 
Humane Society of the United States trade on their reputations to<BR>

John M. Hood's <I>The Heroic Enterprise</I><BR>
<B>Reviewed by Martin Morse Wooster</B>
<P>What should business' responsibilities be towards 
the community?  Advocates of &quot;corporate social 
responsibility&quot; argue that businesses should use their profits 
&quot;responsibly,&quot; by which they usually mean making donations 
to liberal causes and organizations.
<P>John Hood, president of the John Locke Foundation, 
a market-oriented think tank in Raleigh, North Carolina, 
has a different view.  In <I>The Heroic Enterprise: Business 
and the Common Good</I> (New York: Free Press, 199 
pages, $25.00), he argues that the primary responsibility of 
businesses is not to promote social causes or redistribute 
wealth but, quite simply, to provide needed goods at a 
competitive price.
<P>Take the case of Jerome Lemelson, an inventor 
and philanthropist.  Lemelson has made substantial 
donations to the Smithsonian Institution and the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, which co-sponsors the annual 
$300,000 Lemelson-MIT Prize for the best American inventor.  
When Lemelson dies, his foundation will have an endowment 
of at least $300,000,000.
<P>But Hood argues that Lemelson should not be 
celebrated primarily for his philanthropy, but for the five 
hundred inventions he has patented.  These include improvements 
in bar code readers, devices that make assembly lines 
more flexible, and the typewriter tape eraser, which 
Lemelson invented in college.  These, Hood argues, are 
Lemelson's main contribution to society.  &quot;No matter how hard he 
tries, there is no possible way that he can give enough 
money away to make his charitable contribution to society 
equal the value of his contributions as an innovator and 
entrepreneur.&quot;
<P>Advocates of corporate social responsibility often 
judge businesses by looking at how much they give.  But 
Hood suggests that a more meaningful criterion is to 
examine whether the goods and services companies produce 
make people's lives better.  Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream, 
for example, is renowned by some because it gives 7.5 
percent of its profits to charityfar higher than the average 
corporate gift of one percent.  But its profits come from ice 
cream that, although tasty, is loaded with fat.  Who does 
more good for society, Hood asks: Ben and Jerry's or a 
lower-profile company that makes 55-gallon drums which 
ensure that goods can be transported cheaply, ensuring 
lower prices for everyone?
<P>Hood believes that corporations should practice 
&quot;strategic philanthropy;&quot; that is, they should make grants to 
causes <BR>
Terrence Scanlon, Publisher<BR>
Capital Research Center is a nonpartisan education and research organization
<P>classified by the IRS as a 501(c)(3) public charity.<BR>
CRC, 727 15th Street, NW, Suite 800, Washington, DC, 20005 (202) 393-2600  http://www.capitalresearch.org<BR>
that advance a company's interests.  He agrees with 
Sunmark Capital president Menlo Smith, who has said, &quot;because 
our shareholders will always have different charitable 
interests, we concluded long ago that any giving done by 
Sunmark should have a very direct business purpose, and that if 
it does not, the giving should be done individually by 
the shareholders, and not the corporation.&quot;
<P>According to Hood, corporations can practice 
strategic philanthropy in different ways.  Amoco, which has 
long sought a better-educated workforce, has a substantial 
share of its filling stations in urban areas.  Thus, its 
foundation gives mostly to groups seeking to improve education and 
to rebuild inner cities.  Other companies practice 
&quot;cause-related marketing&quot; by making grants in proportion to 
their sales volume.  American Express pioneered this 
approach in 1981 by donating a percentage of the charges made on 
its credit cards to arts organizations in the San Francisco area. 
 It has since launched several national philanthropic 
campaigns, including a 1983 promotion in which a penny 
of every charge was used to help restore the Statue of Liberty. 
 By tying the use of its credit cards to charity, 
American Express has increased card use by 20 percent.
<P>Many corporations also use philanthropy as a means 
to improve employee morale.  General Electric, Questar 
Corp., and Union Planters National Bank encourage employees 
to volunteer at charities in the evenings and on weekends. 
 Researchers at Columbia University and the 
Conference Board have found that such volunteering increases 
workplace productivity.
<P>Hood suggests that one way businesses can improve 
their philanthropy is by supporting organizations that 
promote free enterprise.  Yet he cites data from the Capital 
Research Center showing that many large corporations give 
generously to groups hostile to free markets and limited 
government.  He speculates that corporate giving officers may 
do so to buy off antagonistic anti-business organizations.
<P>This approach, Hood argues, is ineffective.  In the 
long run, companies that support such groups, or that 
make contributions without a clear strategy, are eclipsed in 
the marketplace by competitors that practice strategic 
philanthropy.  Moreover, Hood suggests that advocates of 
corporate social responsibility must recognize that markets 
are not evil, but necessary if businesses are to create the 
wealth that makes philanthropy possible.  &quot;Without an 
efficient market system, there are likely to be more social 
problems (stemming from poverty and technological 
backwardness) on which philanthropists must spend their time and money.&quot;<BR>

<h2>Charity and Responsibility</h2>
<p>
<h3>CRC Hosts Washington Conference</h3>
<p>
<p>
<DD>On June 25, Capital Research Center hosted a 
conference on the theme of &quot;Charity and Responsibility.&quot;  Some 
100 guests from private and family foundations, 
corporations, think tanks, and the media gathered at the University 
Club in Washington, D.C. to discuss the prospects for 
strengthening private charity and reforming the welfare state.
<DD>Capital Research Center president <B>Terrence 
Scanlon</B> opened the event by remarking that &quot;our country 
cannot have a prosperous and free economy and a 
responsible government unless we have strong and independent 
social institutions.&quot;  He criticized the way that many 
tax-exempt organizations in recent years have undermined the 
American tradition of charity and responsibility by 
promoting governmentrather than private and 
voluntaryapproaches to public problems: &quot;Rather than provide a 
valuable public service that government cannot or should 
not provide, many nonprofits mobilize activists and lobby 
for higher taxes, more regulation, and more welfare 
programsthe same programs that have repeatedly failed our 
neediest citizens.&quot;<BR>
<H4>The View from Capitol Hill</H4>
<DD>The morning keynote speakers were 
Representatives <B>David M. McIntosh</B> (R-IN) and 
<B>Ernest J. Istook</B> (R-OK), sponsors of last year's &quot;Istook Amendment,&quot; a measure which would have limited taxpayer funding of 
nonprofit organizations that engage in political advocacy.
<DD>Rep. McIntosh criticized the welfare state for 
undermining America's tradition of community-based 
problem-solving.  He also endorsed the idea of a tax credit for 
charitable giving.  This would allow individual taxpayers to 
directly earmark a portion of their federal tax dollars to 
charities that help the needy while requiring dollar-for-dollar cuts 
in government welfare programs.
<DD>Noting that &quot;charity begins at home, not in the 
Capitol building,&quot; Rep. Istook called for greater exposure of 
nonprofit organizations that receive taxpayer support 
while lobbying for more welfare programs.  He argued 
that Congress and the media must educate the public about 
the role of advocacy groups so that voters will demand 
passage of legislation such as the failed Istook Amendment: 
&quot;The invisibility of many advocacy groups makes it difficult 
to build public support for reform.  The public tends to 
think all nonprofits are good, but many nonprofits are 
essentially lobbying arms of the government.&quot;<BR>
<H4>The Media's perspective</H4>
<P>Former Attorney General <B>Edwin Meese III</B> chaired 
a lively panel on the media's coverage of philanthropy.  
Five speakers who have written extensively on nonprofit 
organizations from a variety of perspectives argued about 
changes in the nonprofit sector and their impact on the kinds 
of stories they write.  Panelists generally agreed that the 
media pays ample attention to &quot;horror stories&quot; in 
philanthropy, such as the recent United Way scandal, but that the 
day-to-day work of charities and grantmakers goes largely 
unreported.
<DD><B>Jody Curtis</B>, executive editor of the <B>Council on 
Foundations</B>' <I>Foundation News + 
Commentary</I>, said that her publication has focused on offering &quot;how-to&quot; advice to donors and has generally avoided controversial issues 
in philanthropy.  Future editions, however, might 
explore more contentious subjects, such as direct-service 
giving versus advocacy or highlight examples of failure in 
philanthropy<BR>
<DD><B>Roberta d'Eustachio</B>, president and founder of 
the soon-to-be-launched <I>American Benefactor 
Magazine</I>, contended that wealthy individuals need entertaining and 
easy-to-understand articles that will encourage them to 
become donors and create foundations.  She emphasized that 
benefactors sometimes need help in clarifying their 
philanthropic values but cautioned those who advise them to 
&quot;let 1,000 flowers bloom&quot; and not try to choose donors' causes.
<DD><B>Laurence Jarvik</B>, editor of CRC's newsletters 
<I>Foundation Watch</I> and <I>Culture Watch</I>, contended that a 
&quot;1960s sensibility permeates most large foundations,&quot; making 
them reluctant to reconsider long-standing grants programs aimed at 
expanding the welfare state.  Unless the media begins to subject the nonprofit sector 
to greater scrutiny and criticism, he contended, major foundations will 
not change their ways.
<DD><B>Adam Meyerson</B>, editor of the <B>Heritage 
Foundation</B>'s <I>Policy Review: The Journal of American 
Citizenship</I>, contended that the mainstream 
foundation world is wedded to the welfare state 
and is dominated by ideas that don't work.  Fortunately, he said, there are 
many small, community-based organizations that are successfully addressing 
problems such as crime, failing public schools, and family breakdown.  If 
journalists tell the story of these groups, they can serve as models for 
broader privately based initiatives.  (Meyerson's presentation appears on page five.)
<DD><B>Vince Stehle</B>, assistant editor of <I>The Chronicle of Philanthropy</I>,
opined that recent media scrutiny has helped make the nonprofit sector more professional and efficient. During the question-and-answer period, Meyerson 
observed that unlike private businesses, nonprofits do 
not have to satisfy customers to stay in business and, 
unlike government, they do not have to heed the will of voters. </I>Nonprofit accountability, he contended, requires close 
scrutiny by donors, the media, and watchdog groups.  
<B>Joseph Dolan</B> of the <B>Achelis and Bodman 
Foundations</B> suggested that evaluation of the effectiveness of nonprofit 
programs will become increasingly important as the needy come 
to rely on private programs rather than government welfare.
<P>
<P><H4>Replacing the Welfare State</H4>
<DD>A second panel, following lunch, explained why it's time for private 
initiative to replace failed government programs.  Chaired by 
<B>Daniel J. Popeo</B>, chairman and general counsel of 
the <B>Washington Legal Foundation</B>, it featured three leaders from private 
foundations.
<DD><B>Michael Cawley</B>, president of the <B>Samuel Roberts Noble 
Foundation</B> of Ardmore, Oklahoma, argued that 
the welfare state has &quot;stunted our desire to be charitable.&quot;  Nonetheless, he 
noted how Americans have time and again responded generously in the wake 
of natural disasters and tragedies such as the Oklahoma City bombing.  He 
expressed optimism that the genuinely needy would receive adequate 
assistance as government welfare is scaled back.
<DD><B>Heather Higgins</B>, director of the <B>Randolph 
Foundation</B>, contended that the welfare state's universal 
guarantee of benefits has undermined the desire of many recipients 
to change self-destructive behaviors.  The goal of 
charities, she said, &quot;should not be to replace government welfare 
but to do better than government programs.&quot;  She 
suggested that the media celebrate &quot;heroes&quot; in 
philanthropygrassroots organizers who are successfully addressing 
social problems through private initiativeso that 
average Americans can see that their efforts will make a difference.
<HR>
<BR>
<I>Heather Higgins: The goal of charities &quot;should not be to replace 
government welfare but to do better than government programs.&quot;</I><BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<B>James Piereson</B>, president of the <B>John M. Olin 
Foundation</B>, conjectured that we are in the early stages of 
major change in the philanthropic sector.  He urged supporters 
of a free society to develop a richer philosophy that 
encourages more voluntarism and a sense of moral obligation 
to others.  Arguing that lower taxes are essential to increased charitable giving, he expressed reservations about a 
charity tax credit, saying that it would undermine prospects for 
a lower, flat tax.  (Piereson's presentation appears on 
page four.) 
<BR>
<H3>Counsel for Charitable Giving</H3>
<DD>Also speaking at Capital Research Center's 
&quot;Charity and Responsibility&quot; conference were Daniel J. 
Popeo, chairman and general counsel of the Washington 
Legal Foundation (WLF) and a CRC trustee, and William 
J. Lehrfeld, a private attorney.  They announced 
the creation of the Counsel for Charitable Giving, 
whose aim is to provide technical assistance to 
individuals, families, and companies wishing to create 
charitable foundations to promote the cause of free enterprise 
and limited government.  For more information, call

<H4>Alternatives in Philanthropy</H4><BR>
Fashioning a Conservative Alternative to Welfare<BR>
by Dr. James E. Piereson<BR>
Executive Director<BR>
 The John M. Olin Foundation
<P>
<DD>What is the conservative alternative to the welfare state? 
 If welfare were ended, how would we help the poor, the 
sick and disabled, and the elderly who now depend upon 
welfare programs?
<DD>These questions are often posed to those of us who 
reject the policies, institutions, and ideological assumptions 
of the welfare state.  Unfortunately, they do not admit of 
easy answers.  The fact that the welfare state has entangled 
itself in the lives of countless families and communities makes 
it all the more difficult to end without painful disruptions.
<DD>Some conservatives argue that we need a new 
public philosophy to challenge the world view of the welfare state. 
 This would emphasize duties as well as rights, the 
community as well as the individual, and private charity rather 
than government programs as the best means of 
addressing social problems.  Speaker Newt Gingrich has emphasized 
a &quot;conservative opportunity society,&quot; in which 
privately funded institutions assist the needy.  Others, borrowing 
the terminology of Eastern European reformers, stress 
rebuilding the institutions of &quot;civil society,&quot; which have 
been weakened by decades of reliance on government.  In 
both conceptions, private philanthropy is given the 
important task of bringing into place viable alternatives to 
welfare programs.
<DD>It is sometimes said that private institutions can 
better serve the poor and needy than the national government 
with <HR>
<BR>
&quot;We are in the relatively early stages of an important 
reform movement that has a long time yet to run its course.&quot;<HR>
<BR>
its array of welfare programs.  As a general proposition, 
I believe this is true.  Certainly, as Marvin Olasky has 
shown, it was true historically in America from colonial days to 
the Great Depression.
<DD>Yet the poverty problem, driven by misguided 
welfare policy, has exploded to a scale that will be very difficult 
for private institutions to manage.  It will be more effective 
to reform the welfare state in ways that begin to scale back 
the problem, rather than try to turn the task wholly over 
to private institutions.  Perhaps both can be done, but 
welfare reform appears to be a necessary condition for any success.
<DD>Is philanthropy being asked to do too much?  I suspect 
it is, especially when we consider the limited resources on 
our side.  Currently, the federal government spends 
some $400,000,000,000 annually on poverty programs, 
including AFDC, Medicaid, food stamps, rent supplements, and the like.  In 1995, individuals, foundations, and corporations donated some $144,000,000,000 to charitable 
institutions of various kinds.  My sense is that private 
philanthropyespecially conservative philanthropyis not 
yet substantial enough to carry out the assignment some 
have given it.
<DD>Still, I believe we are in the relatively early stages of 
an important reform movement that has a long time yet to
<HR>
<BR>
&quot;I have some reservations about an earmarked charitable deduction, 
as proposed by Senator Dole and others, because I fear it would 
undermine efforts to achieve a low flat tax.&quot;<HR>
<BR>
 
run its course.  We should remember that liberal 
philanthropy developed at the turn of the century in tandem with 
the Progressive movement.  It was built on the idea then 
in fashion that experts could identify social problems 
and design appropriate solutions that government would 
implement.  The cultural revolution of the 1960s drove 
liberal foundations ever deeper into this morass as new 
constituent groups were identified as clients of the welfare state.  
If conservatives are to reverse this trend, they will need 
to develop their own persuasive ideas.  This is now 
beginning to happen through the work of people like Marvin 
Olasky, Arianna Huffington, and groups like the 
Philanthropy Roundtable and the Capital Research Center.
<DD>I have given something of a mixed answer to the 
question posed earlier about philanthropy and the dismantling of 
the welfare state.  Bearing in mind Harry Truman's comment about the one-armed economist, let me lay down a 
few simple principles so that I do not end on a mixed note.  
It seems that several things should be done in tandem and 
in combination:
<UL>
<LI>First, public policy must be reformed, particularly 
in the areas of welfare and taxes, in order to scale back the 
size of the poverty problem and to encourage donations 
to charitable organizations.  Lower tax rates and reform 
of estate taxes would allow Americans to pass along 
more wealth to charities and to their families.  I have 
some reservations about an earmarked charitable deduction, 
as proposed by Senator Dole (R-KS) and others, because 
I fear it would undermine efforts to achieve a low flat tax.
<LI>Second, a conservative vision of philanthropy, 
linked to our understanding of a free society, must be advanced 
to challenge the reigning liberal philanthropy of such 
institutions as the Council on Foundations and the 
Ford, Rockefeller, and Pew foundations.  Such a vision, if 
aggressively pressed, will begin to increase donations to 
conservative organizations.
<LI>Third, we need to show that private-sector approaches, realistically conceived and assessed, are more effective than government programs in moving people 
out of poverty and into mainstream American life.  
Fortunately, many such models exist, but they need to be expanded 
and brought to the public's attention.
</UL>
<DD>With so much to do, there is no need for donors to fall 
into line behind one or another particular approach.  We are far better 
off if we encourage a healthy diversity that leaves room for donors to 
express their own interests in philanthropy.
<DD>The John M. Olin Foundation, for example, following the lead 
of our late donor, emphasizes public-policy studies in the areas of 
taxation, regulation, welfare, and national security, among others.  
Our general objective is to support individuals and institutions that work 
to strengthen our system of free enterprise and limited government.  
Most of our funds are directed to academic programs and research 
centers that support scholars, students, and researchers who address 
these issues.
<DD>Other donors, however, will want to emphasize 
different approaches.  Some will want to focus on direct assistance 
to the needy in their communities.  Others may want to 
support programs in the arts, education, history, literature, 
and philosophy.  This is all good and a sign of healthy 
growth in a movement just beginning to find its stride.
<DD>But let us not forget our larger goal, which is not 
to promote philanthropy for its own sake, but to strive 
to create for our children and grandchildren a country 
with more prosperity, more freedom, and greater moral 
confidence than the one we inherited.<BR>

<H4>The Trouble with Philanthropy</H4>
<BR>
by Adam Meyerson<BR>
Editor<BR>
<I>Policy Review</B></I>
<P>
<BR>
<DD>I come to you with the sad message that 
mainstream philanthropy is part of the problem in this country, not 
part of the solution.  There are many fine people in the 
mainstream foundations, and they fund many fine programs.  
But the foundation world has been dominatedand is 
still dominatedby ideas that do not work.
<DD>For the past 30 years, one of the central objectives 
of foundations has been to open opportunity for black 
Americans.  That is a noble, marvelous objective.  But what 
do foundations have to show for their efforts?  More black 
men are in jail or prison today than in college.
<DD>A second objective of foundations has been to 
revitalize cities and their economies.  Again, a noble objective.  
But New York City is bankrupt.  Washington, D.C. is bankrupt. 
 Boston, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Detroit, Chicago, 
Baltimore, and St. Louis have seen population declines of 25 
to 30 percent.
<DD>For 30 years, mainstream philanthropy has 
supposedly been standing up for children.  But more children 
are growing up in poverty today than 30 years ago.  We have 
an epidemic of child abuse.  Half a million children 
are languishing in state foster care.  And we've seen the 
collapse of the best safety net a child can havea mom and 
a dad who love him or her so much that they are willing to 
stay together despite marital difficulties.
<P>I submit that mainstream philanthropy has failed in 
all these areas because it has had the wrong ideas.  What 
are these ideas?  Here are eight of them:
<UL>
<LI>The failure to understand the importance of 
stable, two-parent families.  Philanthropy's focus has been 
on food, medical care, and income maintenance for the 
children of broken homes.  These are important, but it's 
more important to bring husbands and wives back together.
<LI>An overconcern with funding levels for schools 
and health and welfare programs and too little concern 
with performance levels.
<LI>Opposition to desperately needed reforms of 
the public-school system, such as the introduction of vouchers.
<LI>A bean-counting obsession with &quot;diversity,&quot; 
which has led public schools to set tragically low expectations 
for poor children, especially minorities.  The best 
affirmative action offers equal opportunity to all while holding 
everyone to the same high standards.
<LI>nThe perception of criminals as victims rather than victimizers.  This has undermined true rehabilitation, 
which must begin with repentance for committing evil.
<LI>A reluctance to say that certain kinds of 
behavior, such as teenage sex, abortion, promiscuity, or 
long-term welfare dependency, are morally wrong.
<LI>A misguided economic strategy, based on a 
misunderstanding of capitalism and wealth creation.  This has 
led to a disregard for the way that poor Americans are 
ravaged by high taxes, regulation, and crime.
<LI>A preoccupation with using the federal 
government to solve all our problems.  The great tragedy of 
government today is that it tries to do so much that it doesn't do 
anything well.
</UL>
<DD>The good news is that a tidal wave of social 
entrepreneurship is sweeping the country.  Ordinary Americans, 
through grassroots organizing, are solving problems that have 
perplexed mainstream foundations.  They're putting 
marriages back together, cutting crime, improving schools, and 
offering economic opportunity to the poor.  You can read 
their stories in our magazine, <I>Policy Review: The Journal 
of American Citizenship</I>.

<center><h2>Letter from the Chairman</h2></center>
<b>Dear MRC Member,</b>
<p>
<dd><big>W</big>elcome to <i>Flash</i>, the new monthly newsletter pub-lished exclusively for Media Research Center Members.
<dd>Why a membership newsletter? Actually, the idea is rather simple -- and overdue. Recently we conducted a survey of our supporters to see how well we were keeping you informed about our work at the Media Research Center. 
<dd>The results told me we needed to do a better job.  Members supporting our Entertainment Division efforts weren't aware of the work of the News Division. Subscribers to our newsletters didn't know we had recently opened an office in Hollywood, the Parents' Television Council. PTC supporters aren't following the work of our Free Enterprise and Media Institute. And so on. 
<dd>The survey pointed to the need for a publication for MRC members only. Hence, <i>Flash</i>.
<dd>Each month <i>Flash</i> will serve as your connector to the MRC and its special projects, giving you the timely information on the many projects you are sup-porting through your membership.  Our newsletters. Books. Media appearances. Special reports. Studies. Press releases. Our nationally syndicated column. And much, much  more. 
<dd>Through your newsletter you will also be apprised of  Members' discounts on our merchandise and publications.
<dd>We want you to be abreast of what's going on here and how your gifts make it possible for us to expose and challenge the liberal media.
<dd>As a supporter of the MRC, you understand that the national news media have used their power to promote their left wing views. 
And thanks to you, now the public is on to them, too!
<dd>The Times Mirror Corporation took a survey which shows that 43 percent of the public today believes the national news media set the national agenda. You and I have known that for years. Now, through our efforts, the public is catching on!
<dd>There is another critical front, the cultural wars raging in the entertainment industry. The MRC, through its Parents' Tele-vision Council arm, is leading the fight for pro-family values in entertainment fare. The PTC's mission is to bring responsible, family oriented programming to television, and to organize and mobilize Hollywood conservatives as national spokesmen for our cause.
<dd>The Media Research Center is the largest, most active organization in America identifying, exposing and confronting the liberal agenda of the news and entertainment industries. You make that possible with your support.
<dd> In these pages you'll see why <i>Time</i> (grudgingly) admitted that, "for quality, resources and sheer volume of output, the new star on the right is the Media Research Center."
<dd>We hope you enjoy Flash. And we welcome any questions, comments or suggestions you may have. Please contact us at 1-800-MRC-1423. Or drop me a line. It's always good to hear from you.
<p> 
Sincerely,
<p>

<center><h2>Networks Gnawing at Newt</h2></center>
<dd><big>T</big>he national news media continue to ignore political scandals involving the Clinton administration, but wouldn't dare miss an opportunity to report any allegations, no matter how far fetched, against Republicans. MRC's news media analysts regularly follow this trend and expose the reporting of political scandals.
<dd>The results are predictable: biased reporting, chock-full of half-truths and outright distortions.
<dd>Take Newt Gingrich's book deal, for example.
<dd>The media have decided to link bulk sales of Gingrich's book, <i>To Renew America</i>, with violations by former Speaker Jim Wright with his book, <i>Reflections of a Public Man</i>. CNN <i>Prime News</i> anchor Linden Soles introduced a Bob Franken story: "This could be a case of what goes around come around," referring to Gingrich's expose of Wright's bulk book sales violation, which led to his resignation. 
<dd>An article in <i>Newsweek</i> went so far as to claim, "Former Speaker Jim Wright dismissed a pudgy, loudmouthed back-bencher named Newt Gingrich right up to the day in 1989 when Gingrich's guerrilla campaign forced Wright's resignation from the House. Now it appears that Gingrich has made exactly the same mistake".
<p>
<font size=+1><i><center>What the media know, but didn't tell you, is that <br>the two deals have nothing in common.</center></i></font>
<p>
<dd>What the media know, but didn't tell you, is that the two deals have nothing in common.
<dd>Wright's book deal gave him an outrageously high royalty of 55 percent -- from a publisher who happened to be a former employee.  Gingrich only earned the standard 15 percent from a real publisher. Wright's book was never even sold in bookstores, it was of-fered almost exclusively in bulk sales to lobbyists -- enabling him to get around House limits on honoraria income. 
<dd>Gingrich's book was a genuine commercial property, lasting 12-weeks on the best-seller list (selling close to a half-million books). In addition, the Gingrich book had a grand total of five bulk orders,  totaling just over 500 books.
<dd>Wright was charged with 69 counts of ethics violations -- and resigned in disgrace before being indicted.
<dd>Or take the case of another Democrat, former Speaker Tom Foley.  In 1993 the <i>Boston Globe</i> reported the SEC fined an investment firm $100,000 for giving friends preferential treatment with new stock offerings -- one friend being the former Speaker -- and the networks didn't even blink. Small investors like Foley are generally not privy to initial public offerings (IPOs).
<dd>With this information, Foley was reported to have reaped profits on eleven out of twelve initial public IPOs offered to him the previous year. And yet only one network (CNN's <i>Inside Politics</i>) covered the story! The rest completely ignored Foley's investments.
<dd>Our news analysts uncover these facts, then distribute them to millions of people around the country on a regular basis. Research like this is made possible thanks to your support.

<center><h2>FEMI Calls Journalists On The Carpet</h2></center>
<h3>Here's a Pop Quiz:</h3>

<dd><big>R</big>epublicans in Congress propose to balance the budget while increasing spending by 50 percent over 7 years.
<dd>President Clinton calls this a massive cut and shuts down the government for about a week in protest.
<dd>Guess which side the media took.
<dd>It wasn't difficult to predict that they would parrot Mr. Clinton's point of view. That's what they usually do. But something needed to be done about it, or else the American people wouldn't hear the truth.
<dd>That's where the MRC's Free Enterprise and Media Institute steps in. After analyzing the biased coverage of the first few days of the shutdown, FEMI issued a rapid-response study rebutting the media's liberal spin. 
<dd>In the middle of the shutdown, the study of the first few days' coverage was faxed to hundreds of journalists, press secretaries on Capitol Hill, and prominent conservatives.
<dd>The study found that journalists were refusing to report that spending under the GOP plan was actually increasing; and that reporters were only interviewing people upset about the shutdown while ignoring the nearly half of all Americans who thought it wasn't a problem.
<dd>Lo and behold, coverage started to change! The night after we faxed out the study, NBC News produced a report showing how most people outside the beltway weren't put off by the shutdown.  
<dd>An on December 12, ABC's <i>Nightline</i> exposed Mr. Clinton for lying about GOP "cuts." They actually showed, with a graph on screen, how Republicans were planning on increasing federal spending.
<dd>Keeping the media on their toes is our mission! But we need your help in order to continue this fight.

<center><h2><i>Family Guide</i> Gives Parents the Facts</h2></center>

<dd><big>P</big>arents are fed up with the values their children are learning from network television. This year it's worse than ever.  The four major networks appear to be engaged in a fierce competition for the dubious honor of seeing just how many obscenities, lewd remarks, and sexual situations they can pack into a nighttime television program.
<dd>And the family hour -- the  8 p.m.. time slot dedicated for children's programming -- is now the time slot for some of the worst programming of them all.
<dd>As much as parents may want to do it, there's no way anyone can monitor everything on network television today. This year there are over 90 different programs on network prime time television alone. That's all changed now.
<dd>Through our West Coast office, the Parents' Television Council, we have released the <b><i>1995-`96 Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i></b>, the first ever comprehensive review of the values presented on every single network evening program.
<dd>MRC analysts reviewed thousands of hours of program footage to compile the <i>Family Guide</i>. They looked at all NBC, ABC, CBS, and Fox shows as well as the newest offerings from the WB and UPN networks.
<dd>Rather than look at the artistic merits of a show, the guide analyzes it from the standpoint of values. Which shows are offensive for children? Which shows are highly recommended?
<dd>The Guide is presented in an easy to read format.  Every show on network television is presented with a brief "background" section about its themes, and that's followed with a "summary" outlining what is offensive, or what is recommended.
<dd>The guide is presented with a stoplight format. Red lights are given to those programs not recommended for youngsters; yellow lights for those that contain questionable material; and green lights for those that are recommended for children.
<dd>In November, MRC Chairman L. Brent Bozell III and Parents' Television Council Co-Chair-man Shirley Jones held a press conference in Hollywood to officially release the <i>Family Guide</i>. As Ms. Jones put it, "The <i>Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i> [is] a new and vital weapon in the fight for [children's] minds. That it has not been available until now is only testament to our parental impotency, that as of this day and this announcement is no longer acceptable."
<dd>Many others have praised the <i>Family Guide</i> including William Bennett, who described it as "an excellent resource: objective, accurate, easy to use...the Media Research Center has been doing good work for a long time. [The <i>Family Guide</i>] will surely reinforce its reputation."
<dd>We hope to distribute tens of thousands around the country this year. To help pay for this very expensive project, we are offering the <i>Family Guide</i> at a special rate for our members. With this guide in hand you won't have to worry anymore about the poison on prime time television affecting the children.

<center><h2>Festering Foster</h2></center>
<dd><bing>S</big>everal new developments renewed questions about White House actions related to the Travel Office firings and the death of Vince Foster.  But you wouldn't know if from watching network news.  On October 24 the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee released a May 14, 1993 memo from then-White House aide David Watkins in which he said the First Lady told him to replace career Travel Office employees with a private firm partially owned by a friend.  That contradicted statements made by White House officials over the past two years.  The next day, three handwriting experts asserted that Vince Foster's suicide note was a forgery, thereby implicating White House employees in a grand deception.
<dd>With the exception of a brief mention on NBC's <i>Today</i> on October 29 the networks were silent.  <i>Today</i> co-host Jack Ford asked Tim Russert about "new questions raised about the death of Vince Foster" which "curiously didn't get much coverage at all, the idea now that some experts are questioning the legitimacy of that suicide note."

<p>
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b> Welcome to Meet the Media, the fantasy world of objective journalism, where some of the most important media leaders in the land convene to give you the unfettered truth, the expert analysis concerning the important issues of the day. Today we look at the budget crisis. Let me start with you, E.J. If Bill Clinton were to sign the GOP bill, what would happen?</FONT>
<p><b>E.J. Dionne (<i>Washington Post</i>):</b> "I think that with those kinds of cuts in Medicaid, you really could do a lot of damage or at least cause problems for middle class people."
<p><b>Alan Murray (<i>Wall Street Journal</i>):</b> "If enacted it  would largely get the federal government out of the business of helping the poor. It would mean a much smaller government. It would probably mean a balanced budget. But I think the critics are also right that in some important ways it would mean a less humane government."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b> "Wait a moment, Alan, you sound like Dick Gephardt here. The Republican bill includes a spending increase of $2.6 trillion over the next seven years. That's hardly a much smaller government."</FONT>
<p><b>Robert MacNeil (PBS):</b> "Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said the Democratic plan would cut $89 billion over seven years, a third of what the Republicans have proposed to slash."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b> "But that's my point. Politicians like Daschle and Clinton talk about $271 billion in cuts for Medicare but actually, under the GOP plan, spending in 2002 will be $86 billion higher than 1995. That's an increase of 6 percent annually, far more than inflation. It sounds like the Democrats don't have their facts straight, Eleanor."</FONT>
<p><b>Eleanor Clift (<i>Newsweek</i>):</b>  "The Democrats, the big mistake they've made is they ought to have advertisements about deterioration of quality, they ought to show an elderly person in a hospital, bell  ringing for a nurse who doesn't show up. That's where the cutbacks are going to be."
<p><b>Tom Brokaw (NBC):</b> "Are the Republicans most vulnerable here because they want to make these big cuts in Medicare and also give a tax cut, including tax cuts to those people making $100,000 or more?"
<p><b>John Yang (<i>Washington Post</i>):</b> "President Clinton has declared the GOP budget proposals too extreme and threatened a veto unless Republicans agree to scale back their $245 billion tax cut and the massive cuts in health care for the elderly and poor, welfare programs, student loans, and the Earned Income Tax Credit for the working poor."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  "I thought I just explained to you that under the Republicans there are no massive spending cuts proposed! And even with the tax cuts, the Republican plan projects tax revenues to increase by 41percent over the next seven years."</FONT>
<p><b>Dan Rather (CBS):</b>  "Republicans vowed to press for huge cuts in government spending and $245 billion in tax cuts. President Clinton vowed to veto it as too radical and to extreme."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  "Dan, are you listening? Oh, never mind. Let's move on. The political landscape. Who can the Republicans count on for support?"</FONT>
<p><b>Clarence Page (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>):</b> "Most of the KKK has joined the Republican Party."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  "Whoa! You may not like the Republicans, but where did that come from?"</FONT>
<p><b>Michael Gartner (<i>USA Today</i>):</b> "There's more to governing than likability. We learned that from the likable Ronald Reagan, who charmed us with stories as he amassed huge deficits and spent billions on goofy defense plans. No, the record is more important. And Bill Clinton's record is just short of terrific."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b> "Really? Conservatives, particularly the religious right, will tell you he's completely out of step with the cultural revolution sweeping the land. Just look at the outpouring of love for Pope John Paul II when he was here last month."</FONT>
<p><b>Timothy McNulty (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>)</b> "Without naming names or even mentioning the Republican-dominated Congress, the Pope seemed to admonish the supporters of propose laws to restrict immigration and dismantle many of the nation's programs for the poor. In doing so, he appeared to echo many of Presidents Clinton's warnings."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  "OK, so it's resolved: the Pope's a Democrat. We've only got a few seconds left. Last question to Cokie: Is there a bias in the media's coverage of the budget debate?"</FONT>
<p><b>Cokie Roberts (ABC):</b>  "I think there is a bias in favor of spending money, but I don't think it's liberal versus conservative, but a bias in favor of government programs and spending  money, even if there is not money there to spend and even if you're heaping debt on the next generation."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  And that's the last word. A final programming note for our audience. I, of course, am a fictional creation. My guests are not, and neither is every single quote attributed to them. Have a good day.</FONT>

<center><h2>Prime Time's Missing Mangers</h2></center>
<dd><big>H</big>ave you noticed what's passing for holiday fare on prime time television these days?
<dd>Sure, the networks air special Christmas episodes of their shows, but how many actually deal with Christmas?
<dd>Here at the Media Research Center, our Entertainment Division decided to take a closer look at the content of the networks' holiday offerings.
<dd>In our review of 1994 prime time holiday-themed shows, we found that some contained secularized statements of religious principles, but only a few dealt with the Biblical significance of Christmas, or touched on Scripture at all.
<dd>Unfortunately, those same networks did manage to crank out a good deal of tastelessness and religion-bashing for airing during the Christmas season.
<dd>ABC's <ii>Roseanne</i> was the top offender both in 1994 and 1995. How difficult would it have been to offer one, just one episode that contained family values, that celebrated the Christmas spirit? Surely out of respect for the holiest seasons, Roseanne would tone down her assault on traditional values.
<p>
<center><i><font size=+1>Unfortunately, those same networks did manage to crank out a good <br>deal of tastelessness and religion-bashing for airing during the <br>Christmas season.</font></i></center>
<p>
<dd>But if you believe that you don't  know Roseanne. This is an actress who enjoys not just assaulting, but insulting family values. And she saves her best for Christmas.
<dd>Her 1994 episode concerned her son's erections at inopportune times, such as while standing at the chalkboard during class. The show ended with Roseanne reciting slang terms for erections: "pitching a trouser tent," "standing up for democracy," and so on. In 1995 she was even worse. So offensive was her December 12 episode that ABC moved the show from its usual 8:00 time slot to 9:30.
<dd>It centered on the wedding of Roseanne's boss Leon to Scott. Yes, a gay marriage, in the middle of the most family-oriented time of the year.
<dd>Not surprising that lewd "humor" pervaded the episode. When Scott, alluding to their upcoming honeymoon, suggested to Leon, "Next week, we could be snorkeling in the nude," Roseanne quipped, "Snorkeling, huh? Well, I guess you can learn a new word for it every day." Just before the wedding, Scott said to Leon, "I love you in a way that is mystical, eternal and illegal in twenty states." And after a minister performed the ceremony, they kissed. Merry Christmas from ABC Television Entertainment.
<dd>There was, however, one holiday program worth looking out for. A syndicated special entitled, <b><i>Red Boots for Christmas</i></b>, is helping to disseminate the true message of the season. 
<dd>The animated half-hour is based on a German folk tale which tells of a grouchy shoemaker who learns that the essence of Christmas is not wrapped presents under a tree, but rather God's gift to humanity: a Savior. 
<dd>Your support  of our enter-tainment division enables us to find new ways to expose how much Hollywood's leftist views differ from those people in Middle America.

<center><h2> Letter from the Chairman</h2></center>
<dd><big>A</big>fter the 1994 elections I predicted we would see the most outrageous performance ever from the leftist "news" media. Unfortunately I was right -- and it was even worse than I feared. They have turned public support against conservatives. 
<dd>Our goal in 1996 is to neutralize their impact    -- to convince the public not to believe the propaganda being pushed by the media. Early this year we will announce, at a national press conference, our <b><i>Tell the Truth!</i></b> campaign. We will demand that the national media begin -- begin -- to cover the political landscape fairly.
<dd> The <i>Tell the Truth!</i> campaign will start with the formal release of <b><i>Pattern of Deception: Bill Clinton and the National Media</i></b>. It's a devastating, systematic review of how the media have  promoted Bill Clinton from 1991 through 1995. 
<dd>Just as our first book, And That's the Way It Isn't, gave the MRC its credibility initially, this book will give credibility to our national campaign since the findings are explosive and irrefutable.
<dd>The <i>Tell the Truth!</i> <b>Blast Fax Campaign</b> will combine two of the most successful political techniques undertaken in recent years. In 1992 the Clinton campaign was absolutely ingenious with its rapid response teams. James Carville and Co. were everywhere in the national media responding to anything and everything the Republicans had to say on a moment's notice.
<dd>In 1993 Bill Kristol had a crushing impact on the national health care debate by identifying the top public policy leaders in the country and releasing a regular series of impactful fax reports. He was able to change the entire dynamic of the debate along lines of conservatives' concerns.
The <i>Tell the Truth!</i> Blast Fax Campaign will combine both techniques. We are putting together a list of approximately 1,500 top public policy leaders -- with their fax numbers in order to reach them on a regular basis with our blast fax campaign. 
<dd>When there are developments of outrageous media propaganda (which will happen on a regular basis) we will be shooting out blast faxes around the country to put the press on the defensive immediately. 
<dd>In 1996, teams of <i>Tell the Truth!</i> analysts will be in both parties' convention cities. There we will set up offices and publish a daily report exposing everything the press is doing to slant convention coverage. And by making an issue of convention coverage well in advance, we can neutralize the press if they intend to do in 1996 what they did to conservatives in 1992.
<dd>There will be a flurry of activity by us through the mainstream press.  I will continue to do my twice-weekly syndicated column as well as my weekly television commentary on the TCI television network, and will be writing a series of guest editorials on the subject for major publications like the <i>Wall Street Journal, National Review</i>, and <i>USA Today</i>.
<dd>As for our plans to neutralize the media during the presidential elections, we've got our bases covered. These plans are very expensive, however. So, we will be counting on your continued support throughout this very important election year, and I hope I can count on you.

<h3>The Best Notable Quotables of 1995</h3></center>
<h3>For a sampling of some of the awards, the envelope, please:</h3>
<p>
<dd><big>I</big>t has become a tradition at the Media Research Center to present an annual awards issue -- <b><i>The Best Notable Quotables of 1995 </i></b>-- to highlight the year's worst reporting. Each year dozens of conservative writers and talk show hosts gather together to "honor" those responsible for the most irresponsible comments.  
<dd><i>The Best Notable Quotables</i> is the MRC's most popular publication. It is reproduced in papers, the topic of conversation on radio and television talk shows across the country. 
<dd>So how do the media react to our awards?
It's not surprising that the few conservatives in the press are thrilled with our findings and use them for their own ammunition against the liberal media.
<dd><i>National Review</i> ran an excerpt from the <i>Best of Notable Quotables of 1995</i> in December. 
<dd>Mike Rosen, talk show host and columnist, ran excerpts from the <i>Best of Notable Quotables</i> recently in his column.
<dd>Ray Archer, editorial writer for <i>The Arizona Republic</i>, ran quotes from the <i>Best Notable Quotables</i>, and said this of our examples of the liberal media: "There's no dearth of venom spewed by those who typically tout the liberal line."
<dd>Jeff Jacoby, columnist for <i>The Boston Globe</i>, used an excerpt from the <i>Best of Notable Quotables</i> to prove his point in his column entitled, "How the right is demonized."
<dd>The Minneapolis <i>Star Tribune</i> ran a story on January 1 showing both sides of the media bias issue.  It's funny how the <i>Tribune</i> used all empirical, hard evidence from the <i>Best Notable Quotables of 1995</i> to back up our side, yet when it came to presenting Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting's -- FAIR, an organization which alleges <i>conservative</i> media bias -- position, the Tribune printed an opinion column from a FAIR employee, without, as usual, any evidence.
<dd>Not every story based on the <i>Best of Notable Quotables</i> was positive. 
<dd>Of course, we don't expect the "journalists" who win these awards to be happy that we've exposed their biases. 
<dd>Take Clarence Page, columnist and winner of <i>Notable Quotables'</i> year-end Award for Hypocritical Hate Mongering (for his claim that "most of the KKK ha[ve] joined the Republican Party"). He targeted the MRC and the Best Notable Quotables as the topic of a recent column which ran in the <i>Chicago Tribune.</i> 
<dd>He couldn't understand why anyone would take offense to his remark, and cited as evidence that membership in groups like the KKK had gone down during the `80s -- meaning that they were joining the Republican Party.  (How do you think liberals like Page would react if a conservative were to point out that membership in the Communist Party USA had declined in the `80s and that this meant that Communists were now supporting the Democratic Party?) 
<dd>For good measure, the peace-loving Mr. Page concluded his piece by calling supporters of the MRC -- "brownshirts."

<center><h2>New Horizons for the Entertainment Division</h2></center>
<dd><big>1</big>995 was a year of change for the MRC's 
Entertainment Division, changes which will greatly raise our profile and increase our influence in the American culture war. 
<dd>Our new mission was in large part inspired by prime time television's new agenda. In the late 1980s and early '90s, many shows were politically themed. Whether it was <i>L.A. Law</i> trashing Operation Desert Storm, <i>thirtysomething</i> promoting abortion, or <i>Designing Women</i> crusading for most every liberal cause under the sun, the small screen seemed at times to overflow with political advocacy. 
<dd>Of late, though, there has been much less explicit political content on entertainment television. 
That's the good news. 
<dd>Instead of politics, prime time is now emphasizing values, but -- here's the bad news -- Hollywood is now as hostile to traditional morality as it ever was to Ronald Reagan and Dan Quayle.
<dd>Tune in pretty much any time -- even during the so-called "family hour," between 8 and 9 p.m. -- and you'll see this for yourself. Popular series such as <i>Friends and Seinfeld</i> promote premarital sex. Obscenities are frequent on such shows as <i>NYPD Blue</i> and <i>Law & Order</i>. Parental authority is ridiculed on the likes of The Simpsons and Married...With Children. Worst of all, what was once the family hour (8-9 p.m. EST) is now reserved for many of the most offensive programs.
<dd>Yes, when it comes to what Hollywood is teaching our children, the battles are now over values, not politics. 
<dd>To put ourselves on the front lines, last year we established the Parents' Television Council, whose task is to promote responsible prime time programming by working directly with the entertainment industry.
<dd>Though the PTC is headquartered in southern California, its research ammunition will come from the MRC's main office near Washington. In order to focus more of our resources directly on the West Coast, we have decided to discontinue the publication of TV, etc., the Entertainment Division's monthly newsletter. 
<dd>Under the new plan, some of the Entertainment Division's research and analysis will be issued in monographs like the <i>Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i>; and some of it will emerge as MRC Special Reports, which will examine quantitatively the values promoted by prime time television. 
<dd>An example of the latter is our soon-to-be- released study of sexual content and vulgar language which has become a growing trend for the family hour. Yes, it seems that Hollywood is going out of its way once again to insult the traditional American family by airing material unsuited to children at an hour which in past years was set aside for family viewing. Our goal is to inform parents of these practices and through them to incite change in the entertainment industry.
<dd>We're confident that our revised approach will result in a product that will reach and enlighten an ever growing audience, particularly the parents most concerned about the poisonous values of the entertainment community. 
<br>

<center><h2>PTC's <i>Family Guide</i> Makes a Splash</h2></center>
<dd><big>T</big>he Parents' Television 
   Council (PTC) is a special project of the Media Research Center. The PTC's 1995-'96 <b><i>Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i></b>, the only publication written specifically to help parents determine appropriate television programming, has received national attention since its release in late November.
<dd>The Guide was unveiled at a Hollywood press conference featuring MRC chairman L. Brent Bozell III and actress <b>Shirley Jones</b>, Honorary Co-Chair of the PTC.
<dd>And, as if all that weren't enough, the Guide has at least one fan on Capitol Hill. Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) was so impressed with the Guide that he plans to give a copy to each member of the House and has invited Brent Bozell to speak to Congress about the "influence of television on our culture" at a  "Members only" breakfast.
<dd>The PTC, Smith said, "provides Americans who want to see positive values instilled in children with an invaluable tool. The <i>Family Guide</i>...is the best summary of the values reflected in current prime time television programs that I've seen." 
<dd>Thousands of copies of the Guide now have been distributed, and its editor, Sandra L. Crawford, has conducted promotional interviews with such newspapers as the Detroit Free Press and The Washington Times as well as with such electronic outlets as the Newstalk TV cable network. 
<dd>The first television ad for the Guide aired in the Oklahoma City market.

<center><h2>FEMI Report Piques Media Interest</h2></center>
<dd><big>D</big>oes the profit motive determine what network executives put on prime time television, or is it their political ideology? 
<dd>Last summer, <b>MediaNomics</b>, the Free Enterprise & Media Institute's (a division of the MRC) newsletter, reported a strange phenomenon. 
<dd>The television networks, we reported, continue to produce prime time shows with extreme, anti-business environmental themes. It doesn't matter that such shows consistently get poor ratings. The anti-business, environmental extremism of television writers, producers, and executives forces the shows on the air.
<dd>The <i>MediaNomics</i> story caught the eye of <i>USA Today</i> magazine's editorial staff. They asked MediaNomics Editor Tim Lamer to expand the article into a story for an upcoming issue of the publication. In his report, Lamer shows how TV shows with environmental themes, such as the recently canceled seaQuest 2032 and the movie The Fire Next Time, garnered extremely poor ratings. Both took gratuitous slaps at business.
<dd>On the futuristic sci-fi show seaQuest, for example, ruthless businessman Larry Deon creates havoc for the world. He breaks off a chunk "the size of New England" from a polar icecap. He wants to flood the Middle East and create a market for his fresh water supply. (Does any of this sound the slightest bit plausible?)Viewers learn from Deon's opponent, Wolenczak, that "Lawrence Deon is a privateer, and his companies are turning the world's water supplies into sewage." Viewers also learn from another of Deon's opponents that "the man's been a grandstander since he sold IBM off in a yard sale when he was 23."
<dd>Deon also engages in piracy and tries to sabotage the Omni-Pacific, a transcontinental underwater railroad -- because it will compete with his airlines, don't you know? The government is afraid to try to stop Deon. One politician asks the crew of seaQuest: "So what are we sup-posed to do, embarrass him in front of the whole world? The last time we did that, he tripled the price of steel and nearly bankrupted the auto industry." 
<dd>America, meet the free enterprise system -- Hollywood style.
<dd>Lamer also points out that this business-bashing is not new to entertainment television. 
A 1992 FEMI study showed that business owners committed 43 percent of all crimes on television and 36 percent of all murders, far more than any other group, including politicians, lawyers -- even mobsters. All this from an industry that purports to "reflect reality."
<dd>FEMI, both through its newsletter and through respected national publications, continues to hold the networks accountable for their attacks on businessmen, society's innovators and job creators.

<center><h2><big>MRC</big> Board of Trustees Meeting</h2></center>
<dd>Each year the Media Research Center invites its Board of Trustees to Washington, D.C. to help chart  the future for the organization. It gives us a great opportunity to get input from some of the people who make our work possible through their donations. The Board met in Washington, D.C. on December 5 to formally review the MRC's work.
We think it's important to give MRC Members the same kind of information, so here are some highlights from the meeting:
<dd>MRC Chairman L. Brent Bozell III informed the Trustees of the exciting new plans for its divisions and special projects in 1996 -- the Entertainment Division's new focus on family values and the Free Enterprise and Media Institute's joint projects with other conservative organizations -- also the News Division's plans to confront the leftist media during the upcoming presidential campaign with our <I><b>Tell the Truth!</b></i>  Campaign.
<dd>Among the dignitaries and special guests, Representative J.C. Watts, Jr. (R-Okla) addressed the Trustees. He said of the media: "When it comes to liberals and their lapdog media -- they can lie louder. They are shameless." The Oklahoma Congressman continued, "I have been amazed at how people will go to the well of the House or Senate and spew forth lie after lie and scare our citizens with lies. I have watched in horror as Katie Couric has treated the Speaker of the House [Newt Gingrich] or the Majority Leader [Dick Armey] like criminals for wanting to do the right thing. They can lie louder, but we can tell the truth longer."
<dd>He continued by congratulating the MRC on the opening of the Parents' Television Council in Hollywood. Rep. Watts also reinforced the fact that family values in the entertainment industry are not only entertaining, they are very good business. 
<dd>Syndicated columnist and CNN talk show host Robert Novak also spoke at our Board of Trustees function. Pointing out the simple fact that the majority of journalists are liberal, Novak outlined eight statements that  most members of the press would support:
<ol>
<li>The Republican budget will slash spending for women, children, and the poor.
<li>The U.S. has a global role to protect human rights wherever possible.
<li>Missile defense is a waste of money.
<li>A major purpose of government is income redistribution.
<li>Affirmative action programs are absolutely essential.
<li>The federal government alone can do much better than the states.
<li>Term limits are a bad idea.
<li>America is undertaxed.
<dd>Novak  proceeded by explaining that it's easy to see why the media are biased when you have a majority of journalists who agree with these points.
<dd>Some other special guests who attended the meeting included General Alexander Haig; Ed Capano, Publisher of <i>National Review</i>; Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe; and Arianna Huffington, MRC Trustee and Senior Fellow at the Progress and Freedom Foundation.

<center><h2>Letter from the Chairman</h2></center>
Dear MRC Member,
<p>
<dd><big>I</big>t was early one evening and I was sitting with my young daughter, watching what I thought was a perfectly wholesome show on television. To my surprise and horror, the two main characters on this particular program began having an explicitly sexual conversation. 
<dd>Awkwardly I tried to draw my daughter's attention away from the lewd material coming from the television.
<dd>It's a scene repeated in homes all over America every night. The pollution on the airwaves -- even during the so-called "family hour" -- is out of control.
<dd>Like it or not, studies show that children admire and imitate their favorite celebrities more so than their parents, teachers, or religious leaders. 
<dd>And when surveys also show that by the time the average child graduates from high school he or she will have spent more time in front of a television than in the classroom, who is the teacher in society today?  
<dd>That is why the Media Research Center's Entertainment Division is taking giant steps to make television safe for children again.
<dd>For years Hollywood has been pushing the envelope on sexual themes and rough language. Now the networks have almost completely abandoned what was once the "family hour."  Shows still aimed at children contain some very adult-oriented -- and in some cases, highly offensive -- subject matter.
<dd>In February we released our study, <b><i>A Vanishing Haven: The Decline of the Family Hour</b></i>, and have made the networks' irresponsible programming the subject of a national discussion. 
<dd>We've launched a crusade which has gained support from both conservatives like Rep. Lamar Smith (R.-Tex.) and liberals like Senator Joe Lieberman (D.-Conn.) -- both of whom joined me at a national press conference to release this study on the "family" hour.
<dd>Last month I met with network executives in California. John Matoian (President of the Fox Entertainment Group) and had a very productive conversation about the state of prime time. The Senior Vice President of Programming for the Disney Channel, Bruce Rider, reaffirmed his network's strong commitment to family programming. Warner Brothers' Jamie Kellner told me that maintaining family-friendly programming standards was not only good for young viewers but very good for business -- and would be the cornerstone for this new network.
<dd>So there are good signs  that things are moving in our direction. But now is the time to work, and push, like never before. In these pages you'll get more information on our national campaign, all made possible because of your support.
Sincerely,
<p>
L. Brent Bozell III

<center><h2>Family Hour Findings</h2></center>
<dd><big>P</big>rime time television's traditional family hour -- 8 to 9 p.m. Eastern and Pacific, 7-8 Central and Mountain -- traditionally has been home to scores of wholesome series, including <i>Little House on the Prairie, Happy Days, The Cosby Show</i>, and <i>Full House. </i>
<dd>Not anymore.
<dd>The "family hour" is now dominated by adult-oriented shows like <i>Friends</i> and <i>Mel-rose Place</i>, with sexual content and obscen-ities prevalent across the dial. To document how pervasive the problem has become, the Media Research Center's Entertainment Division studied a month's worth of "family hour" shows. On February 8 we released <i><b>A Vanishing Haven: The Decline of the Family Hour</b></i> and opened up a new front in the American cultural war.
<dd>Our study found that certain words and expressions that as recently as the early 1990s were rarely heard on TV -- even late at night -- are now common between 8 and 9. "Kiss my ass," "bastard," and "bitch," among other vulgarisms, are now acceptable in the "family hour."
<dd>Of the networks, NBC easily won the foul-language award. It aired more than twice as many obscenities per hour -- 1.26 -- as any other network. Fox, ABC, and CBS turned in virtually identical per-formances, with each averaging just over one curse word for every two hours of 8-9 programming. The series with the most swearing was NBC's Mad About You, with seven obscenities; the same network's <i>JAG</i> followed with six. 
<dd>Depictions of sexual behavior were just as squalid. The former "family hour" constantly portrays premarital sex as frequent and permissible; in fact, during the study period, depictions of extramarital or premarital sex outnumbered those of sex within marriage by an 8-1 ratio.
<dd>Fox led the network standings with the most sexual treatments per hour, but the other networks were close behind. NBC's <i>Friends</i>, Fox's <i>Melrose Place</i> and <i>Martin,</i> CBS's <i>Cybill</i> and <i>Almost Perfect</i>, and ABC's <i>Ellen</i> and <i>The Drew Carey Show</i> are just some examples of shows with typically raunchy portrayals of sex.
<dd>A Vanishing Haven has gained the support of from both the left and the right. Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) joined Brent Bozell at the Washington, D.C. press conference where the MRC introduced the study. 
<dd>After summarizing the study findings for reporters, Bozell discussed a letter sent to the entertainment heads of the television networks calling on them to air only "wholesome, family-oriented programming" between 8 and 9. Signers of the letter were Bozell, Lieberman, and Smith, and six other Congressional leaders: Senators Dan Coats (R-Ind.), Lauch Faircloth (R-N.C.), and Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.) and Representatives: Tom DeLay (R-Tex.), Steve Largent (R-Okla.), and J.C. Watts (R-Okla.)
<dd>"The bulk of TV programming has rapidly grown ruder, cruder, and lewder over the past few years," Sen. Lieberman remarked on the state of network programming standards. "I'm glad to join with the Media Research Center today to call upon the networks to reestablish the family hour...Like any other parent, I don't think it's too much to ask to have one hour [of TV] a night that's junk-free."
<dd>"Many TV shows aired during what should be [the] family hour are corrupting the morals and corroding the minds of a generation of Americans," Rep. Smith stated. "We hope TV producers will live up to their public trust and take their responsibility seriously."  
<dd>Not only did the study garner bipartisan support, it also attracted the attention of the national media. Even they can't disagree that television's programming standards have been heading steadily down- hill. 
<dd>The press conference generated massive coverage. Most networks covered the event; and stories appeared in <i>USA Today</i>, the <i>New York Post</i>, the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, and the <i>Washington Times</i>. The study also was cited by numerous radio talk show hosts including, Rush Limbaugh and Paul Harvey. 
<dd>The debate is in high gear. Rupert Murdoch of Fox Television has now announced his network will institute a ratings system to monitor sexual content and violence on his shows. In the <i>Washington Post</i>, Bozell called this "a good first step," and added: "This is the man most responsible for pollution on the airwaves. Now he's saying he'll rate his pollution instead of doing what he should do. What he should do is get it off the air."

<center><h2>CBS's Goldberg: Media are biased </h2></center>
<dd><big>V</big>indication is sweet. For years the Media Research Center has been documenting the liberal bias of the media, often provoking hostile denials by journalists. But now someone has joined our efforts -- and the support comes from a most welcomed quarter.
<dd>In a stunning <i>Wall Street Journal</i> column, CBS News correspondent Bernard Goldberg wrote that "the old argument that the networks and other 'media elites' have a liberal bias is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing anymore." 
<dd>What prompted Goldberg to write the February 13 article was a <i>CBS Evening News</i> segment about the flat tax by Goldberg's colleague Eric Engberg. Engberg used such loaded words as "elixir" and "scheme" to describe the flat tax, "conjuring up images of Doctor Feelgood selling worthless junk out of the back of his wagon," according to Goldberg.
<dd>Goldberg recounted how Engberg spent much of the story saying a flat tax would cause "hideous deficits" without mentioning the role of spending in recent deficit growth. Goldberg also pointed out how Engberg used only a liberal economist for his story, and didn't even label him as liberal, a privilege never granted to conservatives. Goldberg also revealed the networks' dirty little secret: "Part of the problem is that most reporters and editors -- television and print... don't know a capital gain from a mutual fund. This, as much as bias, in some cases leads to the kind of reporting we see on the flat tax and a lot of other economic issues."
<dd>With his temper, Engberg himself probably required several buckets of ice to cool down before pronouncing to the press: "I've never regarded myself as an ideological warrior of any kind."
<dd>And Dan Rather supported Engberg by declaring: "His hallmarks have always been fairness and accuracy."
<dd>Really? See for yourself if these Engberg reports strike you as "hallmarks of fairness and accuracy":
<dd>October 2, 1994, on Newt Gingrich: "From the start, modesty was not his style. Rejecting the House's gentlemanly ways, he waged such constant guerrilla war against the Democrats he was attacked for McCarthyism...the family values candidate who divorced his ailing first wife, the avowed enemy of dirty politics who bounced 22 checks at the House Bank and runs a big-dollar political action committee that won't disclose its contributors." He also called Gingrich "bombastic and ruthless."
<dd>August 28, 1993 <i>Face the Nation</i> question to conservative Rep. Gary Franks: "I know that many of the ideas that you advocate, self-help, up-by-the-bootstraps-type arguments, that has been used for years as an excuse for the government to do nothing, hasn't it?"  
<dd>October 5, 1992: "Feel-bad ads trying to drag down Bill Clinton are regarded as the only hope. In a multi-million dollar assault, Clinton is being portrayed as a duplicitous blobhead who governs a Hee Haw backwater where only the taxes soar. The ads are cleverly worded to suggest Clinton means more taxes." 
<dd>After exposing the Bush ad for relying on "assumptions" that Clinton would raise taxes, Engberg then asked Steven Colford of <i>Advertising Age</i> to describe "the stacking up of assumptions like this, there's a word we use for that." Replied Colford: "I think it's 'lying.'"
<dd>June 7, 1989, on China's Tiananmen Square massacre: "Will the military leaders there be embarrassed by this? Will this be something like Kent State was for our military?"
<dd>April 6, 1989: Engberg charged that in 1985, George Bush "carried promises of U.S. aid to the military dictatorship of Honduras." (Not true: CBS showed video of Bush hugging <i>democratically elected</i> civilian leader Roberto Suazo Cordova.)
<dd>Goldberg's friends told the <i>Washington Post</i>. "He has complained to CBS management about a liberal tilt for several years and has been consistently ignored." 
<dd>Is CBS's reaction to his published charges -- denial and arrogance -- any surprise?

<center><h2>Foreign journalists learn about MRC</h2></center>
<dd><big>I</big>s media bias just a problem in America? It may surprise you to learn that the Media Research Center's mission to encourage responsible journalism doesn't stop at the country's borders. The National Forum Foundation and Delphi International have made the MRC a popular stop for international journalists. The two groups, which arrange tours of the United States for foreign professionals, now regularly bring their guests to the MRC headquarters to learn more about what we do and the unique role we play in American politics.
<dd>Just in the past few months, reporters and journalism professors from Algeria, Austria, Gabon, Kyrgystan, Nepal, Pakistan, Poland, and Russia have visited the MRC. Tim Lamer, Director  of the MRC's Free Enterprise & Media Institute, briefs them on the biases of the American media, what the MRC does to combat those biases, and the crucial role of strong watchdog organizations in a democratic society.
<dd>The questions they ask are wide-ranging and fascinating because they reflect the authoritarian backgrounds of their countries. "Does the MRC advocate censorship?" (No, we assure them, but we believe a free press does not mean freedom from criticism.) "Is the MRC funded by the government?" (No, we're funded by like-minded Americans who recognize the need for a check on the media's power, and who want the media held accountable for what they say and write.) In fact, we inform them, the press cannot truly be free unless both it and its critics are not entangled by government regulations and financing.
<dd>Some have expressed interest in someday starting an organization like the MRC in their own countries. Some have remained, working out of our office in order to learn the trade. Many of them find they can use our research for their work back home. All of them come away with a better understanding of the American media and the American political scene.
<dd>By supporting the MRC, you aren't just making the American media more responsible, you're being a positive influence on the global media.

<center><h2>FEMI editor and the welfare debate</center></h2>
<dd><big>W</big>hile combating liberal media bias is the main mission of the Media Research Center, our staffers sometimes take on other issues as well. Example: Tim Lamer of the MRC's Free Enterprise & Media Institute recently wrote an article about welfare reform for <i><b>The Weekly Standard</b></i>, one of the conservative movement's premier magazines.
<dd>At issue was an amendment to the welfare reform bill offered by Republican Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri. The amendment would have allowed government to contract with religious charities to provide welfare services to the poor, as long as they didn't use the money to proselytize. Lamer argued that the amendment was a mistake on three grounds.
<dd>First, the reason religious charities do well is because they proselytize. If they're not allowed to do that, they won't be any more effective than government or other charities. Second, taxpayers of all religious stripes  -- whether Roman Catholic, Evangelical Protestant, Jewish, Mormon, or whatever -- shouldn't be forced by the government into supporting faiths with which they disagree. Third, conservatives shouldn't be turning more charities into clients of the welfare state unless we want even more groups lobbying for big government.
<dd>Lamer's article ran in the January 15 issue of <b><i>The Weekly Standard</i></b>.

<center><h2>Commentary</h2>
<h3>L. BRENT BOZELL III</h3>
<h3>Franken Privileges: Cheap-Shot Satire</h3></center>
<dd><big>F</big>ew doubt that Al Franken's a genuinely funny guy. He wrote for <i>Saturday Night Live</i> during its golden age in the latter half of the 1970s; years later on SNL, he created and realized the character of wispy self-help sage Stuart Smalley and performed a hilarious impression of Sen. Paul Simon. 
<dd>Alas, national recognition for his ability to amuse apparently wasn't en-ough for Franken, who now styles himself a pundit as well. He says his sporadically laugh - provoking bestseller Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations (Delacorte) is a "satire about the breakdown in the civility of public discourse," but on the frequent occasions when his ideology crowds out his wit, he's unquestionably uncivil in his own right.
<dd>Is Franken a humorist seeking to score laughs or a polemicist out to slay the dragons of the right? To be sure, much of what he writes is clearly satirical. Of an exhibit at the never-built Disney's America theme park that was to have simulated what it was like to be a slave, he quips, "All I can say is that it [would have been] a gross distortion of history to have the Un-derground Railroad loop the loop." Not quite Jonathan Swift, but pretty clever. His political humor can carry a punch. But can conservatives take offense at a chapter titled "Pat Buchanan: Nazi Lover" when we've laughed uproariously at Limbaugh's "feminazi" digs? Not really, not if the intent is satire.
<dd>But that's where Franken fails. There's a certain venom in his pen that transforms humor into spite, and spite undisciplined becomes insult. Limbaugh thus becomes "mean," a "bully," and a "liar"; Limbaugh's fans are trashed as "yahoos" and "f---ing morons"; Buchanan's a "racist"; and anyone who thinks Ronald Reagan was the greatest President of this century is a "f---ing idiot." Casting aspersions on these and other con-servative personalities and causes, Franken's acting as a hatchet man -- no more, no less. 
<dd>Franken asserts that his harshness is ironic, that he's "making fun of meanness...by being mean myself." The problem with that argument is that amidst all the invective in his book, there's virtually no indication that he does not really despise his targets, or at least their politics. As far as keeping up with whether or not Franken is kidding at any given moment is concerned, Rush Limbaugh... is basically a 271-page shell game. 
<dd>Naturally, Franken's choice for the best President of the century is...Bill Clinton. "I was trying to write a scathing piece on Clinton," he declares, "and at a certain point it just became impossible...This kind of thing never happened when I was writing the Phil Gramm chapter." Gramm, on the other hand, is a "bastard" and a "big jerk." (But how dependable is Franken's opinion anyway? He's still trying to sell the long-debunked story that Gramm invested in a porn flick.)
<dd>Franken pulls out all the stops in a chapter concerned with 1) skewering Reaganomics and 2) blasting Limbaugh for his defense of same. Regarding said defense, Franken sneers, "These are the rational, carefully constructed, deliberate lies of a man running a gi-ant propaganda factory dedicated to two things: convincing people who were screwed sideways by Reagan-omics that it was actually good for them, and encouraging the people who turned the screws to feel good about themselves...Reaganomics worked. This is the jewel in Rush's crown of bulls--t."
<dd>If there is an economically sophis-ticated anti-Reaganomics case to be made, Franken doesn't make it, re-sorting instead to Richard Gephardt-like class-envy hackwork. As for most Americans getting "screwed side-ways," Franken apparently forgets that real income taxes paid by 90 percent of Americans fell by 10 percent from 1981 to 1987, while real income taxes paid by the richest five percent rose by nearly 43 percent in the same period. Add to that the obvious (seven years of prosperity; two decisive elec-tion victories for Presidential can-didates running on a Reaganomics-centered platform) and you realize why liberals in the entertainment community behave the way they do: Like Oliver Stone and his movies, Franken cannot defend the principles of liberalism -- so he enters the world of make-believe instead. Creative license, we're told.
<dd>Towards the end of that ill-fated chapter, Franken writes, "I think I'm really breaking new ground here. I mean, did you see bar graphs in Jerry Seinfeld's book? In Tim Allen's?" No, and the reason you didn't, obviously, is that Seinfeld and Allen had way too much comedic acumen to even dream of putting in bar graphs in the first place. There's some amusement to be found in Rush Limbaugh... but considered as political analysis, it is       -- in the derisive, non-funny sense -- a joke.

<center><h2>Letter from the Chairman</h2></center>
Dear MRC member,
<p>
<dd>I predicted that the media would have a field day with the GOP primaries, and that's just what happened. I don't know if there's ever been more negative or slanderous coverage of candidates  than what Bob Dole, Pat Buchanan, Steve Forbes and others have been subjected to this year. 
<dd>The media are complaining about how dirty campaigns have become, yet mud-slinging is the only issue they'll cover.  With all their attacks on GOP candidates, the media themselves are ignoring the real issues. 
<dd>A recent study, released by the Center for Media and Public Affairs, found that in campaign coverage "the networks devoted twice as many stories to the horse race (60) as the candidates' policies (30)." And let's not forget how negative the media themselves are. The same study showed reporters' "criticism of the race outnumbered praise by a 20-to-1 margin."
<dd>One blatant example of this was CBS's Eric Engberg's description of Steve Forbes' flat tax proposal as "wacky."  Even more flagrant was Ted Koppel's charge on Nightline that Buchanan is anti-Semitic.
<p>
<blockquote>
<b><font size=+1>Bozell: "If the media distortions continue to go unchecked, we'll be looking at four more years of Clinton running our country." </font></b>
</blockquote>
<p>
<dd>While the media complain about negative campaigns, they are giving less and less time to candidates who are trying to explain their policies. The same study found that the average length of candidates' soundbites was only 7.3 seconds -- shorter than ever. The study also compared the amount of airtime given to GOP candidates (56 minutes) to airtime reporters spent analyzing what the candidates were saying (5 hours, 45 minutes).
<dd>If the media distortions continue to go unchecked, we'll be looking at four more years of Clinton running our country, because they are doing nothing to expose his record.
We <b><i>must</i></b> make the media accountable for their gaps in the truth and distortions of the facts. That is why the Media Research Center has launched a two million dollar campaign to <b>hold the media responsible for their liberally slanted reporting, and force them to begin to "Tell the Truth."</b> Thank you for helping us. 
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>

<center><h2>MRC Welcomes new PTC Director Harry Medved</h2></center>
<dd><big>T</big>he Media Research Center is proud to announce that Harry Medved, the former National Communications Director of the Screen Actors Guild, has assumed his post as the Executive Director of the Parents' Television Council.
<dd>The Los Angeles based Parents' Television Council is a special project of the MRC. The PTC's goal to restore traditional family values to the entertainment industry.
<dd>"It is a privilege to have Harry Medved join the Parents' Television Council as the Executive Director." said MRC Chairman Brent Bozell in a national statement. "He brings a wealth of experience to the PTC.  Harry knows the industry and its people, and he will be a valuable leader in the efforts to restore family-friendly programming."
<dd>Medved's experience in the entertainment industry is indeed extensive. He is the co-founder of the multimedia company Hollywood Interactive, Inc., as well as the co-author of four books on motion picture history.  During his work for the Screen Actors Guild, he was responsible for overseeing all media relations. He has also co-authored four satirical books on the movie industry with his brother, the well known film critic Michael Medved.
<dd>Harry Medved's broad background provides him with the media savvy necessary to insure that the PTC will have an even greater impact on the debate over values in Hollywood. 
<dd>"I consider this a terrific opportunity to improve communications within the industry on these important issues," Medved remarked. "I look forward to working closely with network executives, producers, writers, directors and actors on this project to build bridges with families across the country."
<dd>Here at the MRC, we are confident that our fight for family values is taking a great leap forward with Medved taking the reins of the PTC.  He will be a valuable asset in our struggle to promote responsible programming, making television  safe for America's children.

<center><h2>FEMI Breakfast Forum A Huge Success</h2></center>
<dd>During his run for the Republican presidential nomination, Steve Forbes called for the overhaul of our hopelessly confusing tax system while replacing it with a flat tax. 
<dd>Reporters continuously savaged the flat tax, ignoring arguments supporting tax reform. Journalists called it "wacky" and "a cruel hoax." They said it would cause "hideous deficits." They labeled it an "economic elixir." They suggested it would add $140 billion to the deficit. They called it a tax increase on the poor, a tax increase on the middle class, and nothing but a tax cut for the rich.
<dd>According to many economists, it's none of those things. But you virtually never hear this side of the story in the news media.
<dd>That made the flat tax a perfect topic for a Free Enterprise & Media Institute Breakfast Forum. FEMI (a division of the Media Research Center) Breakfast Forums are held with the intention of bringing together conservative policy makers and journalists to discuss important economic issues, to acquaint journalists with conservative sources (whom they rarely quote) and their ideas.
<dd>The flat tax forum was held March 13 in Washington and included then-Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes and former Congressman Jack Kemp. In his introduction of Mr. Forbes, MRC Chairman Brent Bozell emphasized that the event was not an endorsement of the Forbes candidacy. 
<dd>Mr. Forbes then proceeded to give a comprehensive overview on the history of taxation in America, then followed it with a thorough explanation of his flat tax proposal. Forbes explained how his plan would not increase taxes on anyone, and how it would cut taxes for everyone. He stressed that the only way to reduce the deficit  is to reduce spending, or have the economy grow, both of which a flat tax would accomplish. Forbes argued that because the flat tax would lower interest rates, it would help homeowners. As for complaints from charitable organizations, he showed how, throughout history, tax cuts have always generated increases in charitable giving by making people richer.
<dd>These were arguments that many reporters, trained on the short soundbite, had never heard. Forbes expressed his gratitude to the MRC for giving him this opportunity to go "beyond 30-second, or ten-second, or three-second soundbites, not trying to play gotcha, but trying to gain true understanding. As we say in <i>Forbes</i> magazine, out of Deuteronomy in the Bible, 'With all thy getting, get understanding.' I appreciate, Brent, this opportunity to help that process."
<dd>The FEMI Breakfast Forum was a huge press event. It drew all three broadcast networks, CNN, and C-SPAN. It also drew major print reporters, such as Michael Barone of <i>U.S. News & World Report</i>, Gerald Seib of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and Dan Balz of the <i>Washington Post</i>. 
The forum also garnered stories in the <i>Washington Post, Chicago Tribune</i>, and <i>USA Today</i>, and on CNN's <i>Inside Politics</i>, among many others. The entire FEMI Breakfast Forum was shown on C-SPAN.

<center><h2>MRC Co-Sponsors  CPAC</h2></center>
<dd><big>T</big>he Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), an annual convention held in Washington, D.C., brings together dozens of conservative leaders with thousands of grassroots activists. This year the Media Research Center co-sponsored the 23rd Annual Conservative Political Action Conference. 
<dd>CPAC is host to such groups as the Family Research Council, the Christian Coalition, the Heritage Foundation, and the National Rifle Association.
<dd>It is also a forum for thousands of conservatives from all regions to hear the conservative perspective on the key issues of the day. Noted speakers this year included Bill Bennett, Oliver North, Senator Phil Gramm (R.-Tex.), Congressman Bob Dornan (R.-Calif.),  Steve Forbes, and Alan Keyes.
<dd>The Media Research Center played a major role at CPAC this year. MRC spokesmen met with our members and subscribers at the MRC's CPAC booth where we distributed  a wealth of information. 
<dd>The MRC also hosted an open reception for the CPAC attendees, where our supporters were able to talk with Brent Bozell and other key MRC staff. Bozell also moderated the annual debate between CNN's conservative Bob Novak and ABC's liberal Sam Donaldson. Always one of the highlights of the conference, this debate drew a capacity crowd. 
<dd>It was clear, from so many speakers' presentations as well as the mood of the CPAC attendees, that conservatives are fed up with the pervasive influence of the liberal media and their coverage of politics. 
<dd>It was equally emphatic that the movement sees the MRC as the leader in the fight to expose and neutralize this bias.

<center><h2><i>Time</i> Writer Damns Those Conservatives</h2></center>
<dd><i><blockquote>"I can't tell you how thrilled I am to have been named twice in your December 18 edition featuring the Best Notable Quotables of 1995. To be attacked by a mob of lunatics like your panel of judges is truly an honor. I will cherish it nearly as much as I do the condemnation I received from Louis Farrakhan's followers for criticizing the Million Man March and his recent tour of third world dictatorships. Please select me again!"</i></blockquote>
This is a letter to the Media Research Center from <i>Time</i> magazine's Jack E. White. 
White won the "Damn Those Conservatives Award" in our <i><b>Best Notable Quotables of 1995</b></i> for this quote from his June column:
<dd> "These days Washington seems to be filled with white men who make black people uneasy, like Newt the slasher, Bill the waffler, and Jesse the crank -- Helms that is, not Jackson. But the scariest of all the hobgoblins may well be a fellow African American, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. In the four years since George Bush chose him to fill the 'black seat' left by Thurgood Marshall, Thomas has emerged as the high court's most aggressive advocate of rolling back the gains Marshall fought so hard for. The maddening irony is that Thomas owes his seat to precisely the kind of racial preference he goes to such lengths to excoriate."
<dd>White also made runner-up for the "Embodiment of all Evil Award (for Newt Bashing)" in the <b><i>Best Notable Quotables of 1995</i></b> for this quote:
<dd>"Let's face it: to most African Americans Newt Gingrich is one scary white man...One can only hope Gingrich was sincere in his speech to Congress last week...That could only mean Gingrich is serious about shedding his party's whites-only image. If so, blacks ought to meet him halfway -- if only to temper the impulses of one scary white man."
<dd>Who makes up this "mob of lunatics"? This year the judges for the <b><i>Best Notable Quotables</i></b> included such broadly respected and well known conservatives as CNN's Bob Novak, CNBC's Cal Thomas, and <i>American Spectator</i> Editor R. Emmett Tyrrell; in years past they have been joined by Rush Limbaugh and Charlton Heston.
<dd>Is it any wonder why the public is fed up with the arrogance of the national press?

<h3>Negative Campaigning: Look Who's Talking   The Washington Times</h3></center>
<p>
<dd><big>T</big>he pundits are right.This is the worst year of negative campaigning I've ever seen. These Republican can-didates are being torn apart at the seams. Just sample some of the invective that's being thrown at them on television:
<ol>
<li> Before the campaign really got going, Phil Gramm's campaign was being smeared with a negative TV ad featuring on the screen a New Republic headline labeling Gramm "The Porn Broker" for 18 seconds. When the New Republic's source for the allegation that Gramm had funded a "soft-porn" film in the 1970s repudiated the story, saying "there was no pornography at all," there were no apologies.
<li> Steve Forbes saw his flat tax plan attacked in one campaign commercial as likely to produce "hideous deficits." The ad concluded: "The fact remains the flat tax is a giant, untested theory. One economist suggested before we put it in, we should test it out someplace        -- like Albania." 
<li> The most vicious negative attacks have been aired against Pat Buchanan. One underlined his endorsement by Russian nationalist kook Vladimir Zhirinovsky. 
</ol>
<dd>Another one charged: "It's not that Pat Buchanan today is associated with overtly anti-Semitic or racist acts or statements, but rather that he has  created an image of someone who might be sympathetic to such acts or statements by others." 
<dd>Yet another stooped to attacks on his family, charging his father listened to the anti-Semitic radio show of Father Coughlin, and that his little brothers beat up Jewish kids -- "Christ-killers," they were allegedly called -- in the 1950s.
<p>
<blockquote><b><font size=+1>If they still wish to be the black pot lecturing the kettles on negative campaigning, I have four words for them: Sit down. Shut up.</font></b></blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Yet another ad against Buchanan showed racist nut David Duke at a Buchanan rally, and featured an endorsement from Ku Klux Klansman Daniel Carver. The ad concluded: "A man who says what he means and means what he says and now must fight the embrace of people who think they know exactly what he's talking about."
<dd>As you may already have concluded, these aren't really commercials made by the Republican presidential candidates. Anyone who watches politics knows that were candidates to say these things in their commercials they would be universally scorned -- especially by the press -- for doing so. They are, instead, what the networks themselves have offered us in this campaign. ABC smeared Phil Gramm. CBS bombed the Forbes flat tax. ABC's Ted Koppel and CBS's Bob McNamara hurled bigoted attacks at Buchanan. If we would hound candidates off the hustings for these kinds of attacks, why do we tolerate them from reporters?
<dd>These are the same networks who shake their heads and decry the corrosive negativity of politics. After the recent South Carolina debate, in which the candidates were required to respond to each other's negative ads, the networks all clucked at how unappetizing the prospect was. One wonders if they have considered how unappetizing watching their own programs can be. If they still wish to be the black pot lecturing the kettles on negative campaigning throughout this election year, I have four words for them: Sit down. Shut up. 
<dd>Koppel, for his part, couldn't even leave his attacks at the low level of questioning the ancient antics of the Buchanan children. (This, from  the  man who said of Bill Clinton's draft-dodging thank-you letter: "If we were electing that 23-year-old man, what he said and thought and felt at that time would be germane.") Koppel had help from Time essayist Lance Morrow, who in his magazine likened Buchanan to Joe McCarthy -- "the driving, urgent undershadow of menace." 
<dd>For <i>Nightline</i>, Morrow added that Buchanan's upbringing at the Blessed Sacrament Church and Gonzaga High School was marked by a "reflexive" anti-Semitism of the "they killed Christ" variety. But others who attended high school with Buchanan flatly deny this outrageous charge. You guessed it: <i>Nightline</i> ignored them. 
<dd>Liberal <i>Boston Globe</i> columnist Tom Oliphant has called the liberal media to account on these charges of bigotry against Buchanan, often employing guilt by association: "For liberals to be silent simply because this filth is being directed at a creature of the Right who happens to be on a political roll is intolerable." 
<dd>Already, the media are preparing this story line for the 1996 general election campaign. Bill Clinton, the Great Triangulator, is trying to give the country a better tomorrow, while the Republicans, devoid of vision, have nothing to offer but cheap negative attacks.  
<dd>It's important to declare that negativity has a place in any campaign in defining why one candidate deserves to be elected over his opponent. But let the candidates do that. Decency is also important. It's time the national media attempt to rise to the level of civility these Republican candidates have shown each other.

<center><h2>MRC's Tim Graham Authors Explosive New Book</h2></center>
<dd><big>F</big>rom the Media Research Center's MediaWatch Associate Editor Tim Graham comes a new book entitled <b><i>Pattern of Deception: The Media's Role in the Clinton Presidency.</i></b>
The result of four years of exhaustive research, the book proves beyond a shadow of a doubt how the press has misled the American people by massaging Clinton's image, masking his faults, attacking his opponents and distorting the truth. 
<dd>Using reporters' own words, supplemented by data from the Media Research Center's studies and analyses, <b><i>Pattern of Deception</i></b> not only indicts the media, it <b>convicts</b> them. Starting with the primary campaign in early 1992 and going through to the present, <b><i>Pattern of Deception</i></b> lays bare the undeniable, irrefutable, unmistakable pro-Clinton bias in the national media. 
<dd>The release of <b><i>Pattern of Deception</i></b> officially kicks off the MRC's "Tell the Truth!" campaign to stop the liberal media's shameless promotion of Bill Clinton. We have already distributed over 1,000 books to reporters, columnists, television and radio talk show hosts and producers, as well as to every conservative Member of Congress. We are arming conservatives in the media and public policy with the definitive evidence of how the national press is doing everything in its power to promote Bill Clinton and his left-wing agenda. And we're letting liberals know we conservatives are fighting back.
<dd>Tim Graham is heading up a major television and radio blitz. Within days of the official release, he participated in an interview on the 700 <i>Club</i> with Pat Robertson; a panel discussion on PBS's <i>McCuistion</i>; and interviews on radio stations WSPD in Ohio, KSL in Utah, WTIC in Connecticut, WBSN in Massachusetts, KLIF and WOAI in Texas, WJR in Michigan, WAIM in South Carolina, WTAL in Florida, KSN in South Dakota, WROK in Illinois, WWDB in Pennsylvania, as well as the G. <i>Gordon Liddy Show</i>, which airs across the country. Many, many more shows are lining up to get the message out.
<dd>Get the book that Arianna Huffington, Chair for the Center for Effective Compassion, calls "must reading for the GOP." R. Emmett Tyrrell, Editor in Chief of the <i>American Spectator</i> says <i><b>Pattern of Deception</b></i>, "shows that the press has been easier on Boy Clinton than Gennifer Flowers was." And nationally syndicated columnist and CNBC talk show host Cal Thomas exclaims, "No one is doing a better job of holding the press accountable for failing to live up to its high calling than the Media Research Center. In <b><i>Pattern of Deception</i></b> you'll read how the press have given the Clinton administration a free ride on policy issues which are far more important to the future of lib-eralism than personal peccadilloes." 
<dd>We're offering <b><i>Pattern of Deception</i></b> at a phenomenally low price for Members only. Please see ordering information <a href="#order">here</a>.

<center><h3>A New Poll Rocks the world of Journalism</h3></center>
Dear MRC Member,
<p>
<dd><big>A</big> new poll from the Roper Center and the Freedom Forum has rocked the world of journalism. It proves that Washington-based reporters and editors are even more liberal than we thought. Just look at the numbers: 89 percent voted for Clinton in 1992 (as opposed to 43 percent of the public); only 7 percent voted for Bush; only 4 percent are registered Republicans, while 50 percent are Democrats; only 3 percent think the Contract With America was a serious proposal. And get this: only 2 percent call themselves conservative.
<dd>Remarkably, <b>still</b> reporters are denying a bias when given these numbers! I was asked to debate <i>Newsweek</i>'s Eleanor Clift on CNN's <i>Crossfire</i> recently; both Robert Novak and I listened incredulously as she absolutely denied these numbers were evidence of bias. Rather, she said, it proved how good a job the media are doing, since they are being so tough on Bill Clinton.
<dd>It defies belief. It also explains why our work is so critical to the conservative movement. In the past month we've had a host of new programs:
<ol>
<li>After four years of research, Tim Graham's new book, <b><i>Pattern of Deception: The Media's Role in the Clinton Presidency</b></i>, is now published. It proves how the liberal press worked to elect  Bill Clinton for President in '92, how they've championed his agenda since then, and how they're doing it again in '96.
<li>During Holy Week we released our third annual <b><i>Faith in a Box: Television and Religion 1995</i></b>. By studying over 41,000 network news stories and 1,800 hours of prime time entertainment programs in 1995 we have documented the media's  antagonism toward religious institutions, leaders, and doctrines. It's gratifying to know that some in the press are finally admitting it. "I think there is...a problem with what I call cultural bias on these subjects...religion, abortion, and homosexuality," said <i>Washington Post</i> reporter Howard Kurtz. "I think a lot of it is unconscious, but I think those kinds of subjects, most reporters are probably to the left of the American public and probably don't realize that they're not always giving a full weights of views of people who have a very different take on these matters."
</ol>And then there is the MRC's campaign to bring the "family hour" back to prime time television. (The campaign began with the release of our study, <i><b>A Vanishing Haven: The Decline of the Family Hour</b></i>.) The momentum is growing: over 70 Members of Congress have publicly joined our efforts and signed their names to a full page advertisement that ran in Daily Variety, one of the entertainment industry's leading trade publications.
<dd>All three ventures have something in common: none of these efforts has ever been done before simply because conservatives didn't have the organization or resources to undertake these huge projects. In one month we launched all three of them, and liberals' heads are spinning. They've never been hit like this before, and it explains Bob Novak's statement to me at a reception last week. "They hate you, Brent," he laughed. "They hate you more than any conservative in America!"  Given the company that puts me in, I'm honored.
<dd>Thanks for making all of this possible.
Sincerely,
<p>

<b><font size=+1>-"They hate you, Brent. They hate you more than any conservative in America!"</font></b>

<center><h2>Tell the Truth! Update</center></h2>
<dd><big>T</big>he biggest obstacle for conservatives in every presidential election for the past 30 years is the media's unfair, slanted coverage. This year the MRC has announced we've had enough -- and we aren't going to take anymore. And we're putting our money where our mouth is -- a $2 million Tell the Truth! Campaign to expose the leftist agenda of the media.
<dd>The national campaign is in full gear; the MRC is everywhere in the press right now. 
<dd>Our "Blast Fax" press release campaign is providing conservative radio talk show hosts and columnists with daily ammunition exposing media distortions. Rush Limbaugh, Ollie North, Paul Harvey and a host of others are passing this information on to <b>millions</b> on a daily basis. 
<dd>MRC spokesmen are appearing on numerous television and radio shows every single day. They've appeared on CNN's Crossfire, CBN's the 700 Club, National Public Radio, the Oliver North Show, and literally dozens and dozens of others in just the past few weeks alone.
<dd>We have begun distributing Tim Graham's blockbuster new book Pattern of Deception: The Media's Role in the Clinton Presidency to hundreds of conservatives in the media and public policy. 
<p><font size=+1><blockquote>From now until the election you will find these regular updates in <i>FLASH</i> on what the MRC is doing to expose the media's biased election coverage.</blockquote></font>
<p>
<dd>Since Tim Graham began his media blitz for the book, orders have been flooding our office. We are confident from these early responses to the book that <i>Pattern of Deception</i> will be hugely successful in exposing how the leftist media are openly championing the Clinton Administration. 
<dd>Another aspect of our national "Tell the Truth!" campaign includes distributing hundreds of thousands of bumper stickers, pens, and magnets with the logo, "I DON'T BELIEVE THE LIBERAL NEWS MEDIA!" all over the country.
<dd> If you'd like to show your support for our "Tell the Truth!" campaign with one of the MRC's "I don't believe the liberal news media!" items call us at (800)-MRC-1423, and we'll send these out to you for a shipping and handling fee of $2.
<dd>We will also be opening an office in San Diego -- during the Republican National Convention. This year the media will not get away with their blatant distortions and outright lies against conservatives, as they did at the Houston Convention of '92. 
<dd>These are only a few of our plans. Much, much more is being prepared for our friends in the liberal press this year. Be on the lookout in <i><b>Flash</b></i> in the coming months for more updates on our "Tell the Truth!" campaign.

<center><h2>MRC Religion Report Generates National Discussion</h2></center>
<dd><big>S</big>urveys show the United States is one of the most religious countries in the world. Every year since 1952, Gallup polls have found that about 90 percent of Americans claim their faith is important. On the other hand, a 1995 U.S. News & World Report survey of Hollywood executives found that only 44 percent considered religion important. Another study revealed that 86 percent of  journalists seldom or never attend church, and 50 percent don't even believe in God. 
<dd>Does the product from the news and entertainment media reflect society's views? Not only do both the news and entertainment media not care about religion, when they do touch on it, they regularly attack it.
<dd>It's all detailed in the Media Research Center's third annual report: <b><i>Faith in a Box: Television and Religion 1995</i></b>, the most comprehensive study of its kind in history. Here are some of the findings:
<h3>Prime Time Entertainment Television</h3>
In 1995, there were almost 1,800 hours of original entertainment programming on ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, UPN, and WB, but only 287 religious portrayals. Overall, 38 percent of these depictions of religion were positive, and 28 percent were negative -- roughly a 4-to-3 ratio. This near-balance of positive and negative may satisfy secular Hollywood, but it offends tens of millions of Americans who cherish their religious beliefs. 
<dd>If it's a simple expression of faith, 77 percent of the depictions were positive. But the more serious the expression (and the one expressing it) the more negative it became. Religious institutions only received positive representations 31 percent of the time. Only 20 percent of the depictions of the clergy were positive, while a whopping 43 percent were negative! And the laity? Only 11 percent of the depictions of lay religious leaders were positive -- 64 percent were negative! 
<dd>There was a bright side. In 1995 we also had CBS's Touched By an Angel, arguably the most pro-faith show in television history. It's also a bona fide hit, the fastest growing show on their network, and the second fastest growing show on all of television!
<h3>Network News</h3>
<dd>The network news programs virtually ignored religion in 1995. Out of 18,000 evening news stories, religion drew only 249, and out of 26,000 morning news segments, only 224 dealt with matters of faith. For the third year in a row, religion stories again represented only about one percent of the networks' total coverage. 
<dd>The Catholic Church dominated what religion reporting there was, with almost half the evening news stories and 71 percent of the morning segments.  
<dd>In more political terms, the religious right was again portrayed as extreme and damaging to the Republican Party, even though it provided the margin of victory for the GOP in '94. As well, though not a single pro-life incumbent from either party lost that year and dozens of pro-lifers were elected to Congress, the media continued to report that pro-life policies were hurting the GOP. 
<dd>Stories about violence and harassment at abortion clinics drew another 142 stories in 1995. On the other hand, only three stories focused on the violence of abortion itself, or on documented examples of harassment and violence by abortion advocates against pro-lifers.
<dd>That television's treatment of religion has not significantly improved since the MRC's first study two years ago is troubling. The networks wonder why their audience continues to shrink, year after year. When will they begin to understand that their assault on religion is offensive to 90 percent of the public, and maybe, just maybe, might be a factor?  
<dd>Media Research Center Chairman Brent Bozell held a national press conference on April 4 to release <i><b>Faith in a Box: Television and Religion 1995</b></i>. The event was shown live on C-SPAN, and covered by CNN, CBS Radio, ABC Radio, USA Today, the Washington Times, and countless other outlets.
<dd>There has been a tremendous feedback to our work since the press conference aired live on C-SPAN. Viewers across the nation have thanked us for our work on this issue.

<center><h2>MRC's Family Hour Push</h2></center>
<dd><big>I</big>n this election year, with partisan wrangling everywhere, one issue is bringing together Republicans and Democrats: the MRC's campaign to restore positive values on television, particularly during prime time's Family Hour.
<dd>Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Representative Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) each circulated petitions to their colleagues seeking their support. (Sen. Lieberman and Rep. Smith joined Brent Bozell on February 8 at a national press conference calling on Hollywood to voluntarily return to the spirit of the family hour.)
<dd>Thus far over 70 Senators and Representatives have signed an open letter, calling on Hollywood to voluntarily program only family-friendly fare in the first hour of prime time (8-9 p.m. on the coasts, 7-8 p.m. in middle America). The text of the letter was reproduced in a full-page advertisement in the April 30 issue of <i>Daily Variety</i>.
<dd>Perhaps the most eye-catching aspect of the campaign is the support it has drawn from across the ideological spectrum. Conservatives like Senator Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and Representative Bob Dornan (R-Calif.) have joined liberals like Senator Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Representative Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.) in backing the MRC's effort.  
<dd>Now it's time for us to target the advertising community. A letter is being prepared for the biggest advertisers on prime time television, asking them to join our Family Hour crusade. Watch this space for regular updates.

<center><h3>Unabomber: Really a Swell Guy</h3></center>
<dd>"I can't bring myself to hate the Unabomber. Quite the opposite; I find his story curiously affecting.[The manifesto] tells us what we all know: that American society can be a powerfully compromising, deadening, even saddening force...If Kaczynski proves to be the Unabomber, he is nobody's hero, certainly not mine. The bomber murdered three people, and might well have many more, all by design. Coincidentally, Kaczynski invaded our front pages just before Easter Sunday, mute, pathetic, and manacled before his captors. But maybe he accomplished what the Unabomber set out to do, to make us think about ourselves, and the society that drove him to madness."--Boston Globe columnist Alex Beam, April 10.

<dd>"Although many have praised Ron [Brown] lavishly, I understand that no Republicans have yet expressed condolences to the Brown family. Is that politics as usual, or just plain bad manners?" -- Bryant Gumbel to Rep. Charles Rangel, April 10 Today.
<i><h3>Reality Check:</h3></i>
<dd>"[GOP Chairman Haley] Barbour told Gumbel after the plane crash that killed Brown last week, he issued a statement praising Brown and expressing his 'deepest sympathy' to Brown's family. Barbour made similar comments on his GOP-TV cable show." -- April 11 Washington Post story by Howard Kurtz.
<dd>"Though Republican leaders did not attend the memorial service or funeral, several sent condolence notes to the Brown family. In addition, Mr. Gingrich, the House Speaker, made special arrangements for Mr. Brown to lie in repose on the catafalque used for President Kennedy. " April 12 Washington Times story by Laurie Kellman.

Brent (Baker):
<dd>Your April Fools' Issue (of Notable Quotables) was the best ever. For about the third time, you got me boiling and making notes for a column. I didn't catch on until I got down to Rather and Engberg.
<dd>Spouse and I have shown it to a score of newsfolk, all of whom bit on Bryant Gumbo. Satire only works when it's close to the truth.
<dd>Great Stuff.

Dear MRC,
<p>
Love your FLASH news-letter! Your group is doing a much better job of keep-ing in touch with your members this way.
I did have a few suggestions:
<ol>
<li>List an E-Mail Address - Many people are like me, too busy or lazy to write a letter. I would love to see an option to send you E-Mail, you would get correspondence more often and it would be more current.
<li>Create a World Wide Web Site - This is a great way to publicize the organization. I get on the WWW often to keep track of other conservative organizations like the Christian Coalition, AFA [American Family Association], etc. I can get timely, quick info on these groups and interest in your group would be very high.
</ol>
Sincerely,
Mickey Mixon
<p><p>

Dear Representative 

After years of empty rhetoric, I am glad to see true reform 
brewing in Congress.  I look forward to the day when 
Congress reforms itself via the Citizen Congress Act.

If passed, an initiative such as the Citizen Congress Act 
will help restore my faith in elected officials.  For too 
long, we have been made promises while important measures 
such as term limits and a Balanced Budget Amendment have 
not materialized.

By eliminating perks and wasteful practices from within, 
Congress can begin to reverse the hollow promises of the 
past several years. Abolishment of the federal pension 
system, elimination of franked mass mailings, non-automatic
pay increases, and reduced military aircraft travel are 
significant reforms which also reduce government spending. 
At a time when the country's budget is in poor fiscal 
condition, there is little reason not to tighten the belt 
of Congress.

I was disappointed to see term limits measures fail, yet 
I believe that the Citizen Congress Act is a step in the 
right direction in regards to congressional reform.  I 
understand that Members of Congress work hard and are 
very busy, but I also believe Congress needs to truly 
reidentify with the voters of this country.  I ask that 
you pledge support for this measure, and I look forward
to your reply.

Sincerely,

Dear Congressman:


As a small business owner and taxpayer, I strongly encourage
you to support efforts to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act.  This
outdated, discriminatory act has cost hard working taxpayers
billions, and inhibited the opportunities of small
construction firms and unskilled (mostly minority) workers.

Davis-Bacon is an example of what's wrong with Washington.
This anti-market law has no place in our government, yet
lawmakers elected for change have been unable to repeal it.
I am shocked to hear that some Members of Congress actually
want to "reform" Davis-Bacon by expanding it.

When the Republicans pulled Davis-Bacon out of the budget
reconciliation bill they sent a signal to voters.  Such
activity told the public the majority party wasn't willing
to aggressively support bold regulatory and fiscal reform.
The confidence I had in Congress since the '94 election is
being eroded by the failures of this Congress to enact bold
reforms.  This failure only benefits special interests at
the expense of all taxpayers and our system of free
enterprise.

As a member of the Small Business Survival Committee, I
understand the implications of keeping a law like Davis-
Bacon on the books.  Time should have run out for Davis-
Bacon, and Members of Congress should repeal this harmful
law.

Dear Senator:


As a small business owner and taxpayer, I strongly encourage
you to support efforts to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act.  This 
outdated, discriminatory act has cost hard working taxpayers 
billions, and inhibited the opportunities of small 
construction firms and unskilled (mostly minority) workers.

Davis-Bacon is an example of what's wrong with Washington. 
This anti-market law has no place in our government, yet 
lawmakers elected for change have been unable to repeal it.
I am shocked to hear that some Members of Congress actually
want to "reform" Davis-Bacon by expanding it.

When the Republicans pulled Davis-Bacon out of the budget 
reconciliation bill they sent a signal to voters.  Such 
activity told the public the majority party wasn't willing 
to aggressively support bold regulatory and fiscal reform.  
The confidence I had in Congress since the '94 election is 
being eroded by the failures of this Congress to enact bold 
reforms.  This failure only benefits special interests at 
the expense of all taxpayers and our system of free 
enterprise.

As a member of the Small Business Survival Committee, I 
understand the implications of keeping a law like Davis-
Bacon on the books.  Time should have run out for Davis-
Bacon, and Members of Congress should repeal this harmful 
law.

Sincerely,

Dear Senator: 

I urge you to terminate Senator Alan Simpson's (R. WY) legal 
immigration proposal, S. 1394, at the Senate subcommittee 
level. 

The Senate immigration subcommittee will soon begin markup 
of S. 1394. Unfortunately, Senator Simpson's legal 
immigration legislation intensifies the restrictive measures
of Representative Lamar Smith's (R. TX) immigration 
proposal, H.R. 2202. 

Senator Simpson seeks a 25% tax on businesses that hire 
foreign workers. Under S. 1394, companies hiring foreign 
help would have to pay a tax equal to one-quarter of 
the employee's annual compensation including wages and 
benefits. In addition, employers would be forced to pay 
that employee 105% of the prevailing wage (an expansion of 
the job-killing Davis-Bacon Act). 

Additionally, the new limits on skilled immigration coupled 
with the arbitrary experience requirements will 
significantly lower the number of skilled workers admitted 
to the U.S. annually. Moreover, elimination of the unskilled
immigration visas, prevents families from uniting. Unskilled
immigrants do not displace American workers. The measures of
S. 1394 (and similary House proposals) will do more to 
displace American workers than any perceived move by 
employers to bypass American labor for foreign workers. 

Contrary to the less government principles espoused in 1994,
S. 1394 and similar House proposals, increase government 
spending, expand governmental control over businesses and 
will ultimately weaken the U.S. economy. I strongly oppose 
S. 1394, and I ask you to do the same. 

Sincerely,

Dear Representative:

I encourage you to act in favor of the self-employed and 
small business owners by embracing reform of the status of 
independent contractors. I urge you to support and 
co-sponsor H.R. 1972, the "Independent Contractor Tax 
Simplification Act," introduced by Congressman Jon 
Cristensen (R-NE). 

H.R. 1972 simplifies the tax relationship between the 
business and the independent contractor by defining who is 
not an employee. 

This bill outlines clear, distinct criteria for those 
seeking to perform services as an independent contractor. 
As you are probably aware, independent contractors and small
business owners are presently forced to comply with the 
infamous 20-factor test - an ambiguous tool of the IRS which
lures independent contractors into a spiral of unnecessary 
legalese and expense. 

Many entrepreneurs and small business owners do not have the
time or resources to fight the 20-factor test, some of these 
job producers are forced to close their doors. One recent 
estimate that the IRS reclassified 439,000 independent 
contractors and collected $678 million in fines and back 
taxes over the past several years. 

Clearly there is an institutional bias for the IRS to 
reclassify independent contractors as employees. It would 
be intolerable if Congress failed to pursue reform of the 
20-factor test. 

Small businesses and entrepreneurs, the largest job creators
of our economy, should not be forced to comply with an 
unending string of arbitrary and outdated IRS rules. The 
20-factor test is a prime example of bad tax policy. I 
strongly support Congressman Christensen's bill and I ask 
you to do the same. 

Sincerely,

Dear Senator:

It would be a big mistake to vote for an increase in the 
minimum wage.  A minimum wage hike will hurt the economy 
and cost jobs.

Economists have found that minimum wage increases cost jobs.
Hiking the minimum wage will keep many young people, 
especially minorities and unskilled workers, out of job 
opportunities.  The drive to raise the minimum wage is 
largely politically-motivated and driven.  But many people 
fail to see the destructiveness of minimum wage increases. 
As a small business owner, I know how difficult it is to 
absorb the costs of unfunded mandates like the minimum wage.

The minimum wage is a starting wage, it's a good way for the 
entry-level employees to gain employment experience.  
Studies show that 63% of minimum wage workers earn higher 
wages within a year.  Small businesses are able to determine 
wage scales much better than Congressmen or bureaucrats.

With the implementation of welfare reform, there will be 
many low skilled people looking for jobs -- it will be much 
harder for these Americans to find employment if Congress 
raises the minimum wage.

Now is definitely not the time to raise the minimum wage.  
Leave wage increases for minimum wage workers to the 
employers, not politicians.

Dear Senator:

It would be a big mistake to vote for an increase in the 
minimum wage.  A minimum wage hike will hurt the economy 
and cost jobs.

Economists have found that minimum wage increases cost jobs.
Hiking the minimum wage will keep many young people, 
especially minorities and unskilled workers, out of job 
opportunities.  The drive to raise the minimum wage is 
largely politically-motivated and driven.  But many people 
fail to see the destructiveness of minimum wage increases. 
As a small business owner, I know how difficult it is to 
absorb the costs of unfunded mandates like the minimum wage.

The minimum wage is a starting wage, it's a good way for the 
entry-level employees to gain employment experience.  
Studies show that 63% of minimum wage workers earn higher 
wages within a year.  Small businesses are able to determine 
wage scales much better than Congressmen or bureaucrats.

With the implementation of welfare reform, there will be 
many low skilled people looking for jobs -- it will be much 
harder for these Americans to find employment if Congress 
raises the minimum wage.

Now is definitely not the time to raise the minimum wage.  
Leave wage increases for minimum wage workers to the 
employers, not politicians.

Sincerely,
</textarea>

<h2><i>Family Economics:  What to Expect for Your Infant's First-Year Costs</i></h2>

<p> 
	As any working parent knows, having children can be a costly adventure. But has anyone put a figure on what the average costs per child are in 1995 as compared with 1960?  Of course!  Your hard tax dollars are at work once again.  The US federal government, and a few other sources,  have come up with a few statistics that any expecting parent or current parent needs to know:
</td></tr></table>
</center>
<blockquote>
<p><ul> 
<li> The Census Bureau states that American births should remain at about 3.9 million per year thought the turn of the century.
<p>
<li> Roughly 17% of family income is spent on an infant under one year, as compared with 21% of family income in 1960.  (And day care wasn't even part of the spending equation in 1960!)
<p>
<li> Day care now accounts for 14% of total spending on an infant under one year.
<p>
<li> In 1960, average family income was $30,120  -- that was back when the usual family only had one parent working.  Of that salary, $6,203 was spent on an infant under one.  Today, the average family income -- with two parents working -- is $44, 800.  Of that amount, $7,610 is spent on an infant under one, according the Agriculture Department.
<p>
<li> In 1995,  the majority of spending per infant was spent on child care and food, with clothing and health care following.  In 1960, the majority was spent on food (Remember: day care was not even a consideration then), with health care and clothing following.
<p>
<li> According to Lifestyle Change Communications, here's a specific breakdown in first-year costs:
<P><table border=0 cellpadding=7 cellspacing=7>
<tr>
	<td><b>diapers</b></td><td><b>$570</b></td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><b>nursery</b></td><td><b>$1,200</b></td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><b>furniture</b></td><td><b>$995</b></td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><b>bedding/bath</b></td><td><b>$223</b></td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><b>toys</b></td><td><b>$199</b></td></tr></table>
</ul><p>
	Even though 48% of women are in the work force, as compared with 27% in 1960,  their families are still spending less in the first year, in terms of family income, than their parents spent on them back in 1960.  Any way you look at it, babies really are big business!

 <P>



Karen Czarnecki Miller is the Director of Executive Branch Liaison at <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>, one of the country's leading public policy research institutes.
<p>
A conservative research foundation, Heritage provides policy analysis in several broad areas of study: domestic and economic policy, and foreign policy and defense.  Some of the more specialized departments within the foundation concentrate on <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/asian.htm">Asian Studies</a>, the <a href="/heritage/library/index/g7.html">United Nations</a>, and <a href="/heritage/library/index/h2.html">Congressional reform.</a>  
<p>
Miller is primarily responsible for maintaining contact with the Clinton Administration, educating the presidential campaigns on important policy issues, and overseeing The Heritage Foundation's <a href="/heritage/jobs/jobs.html">Job Bank.</a>  She also serves as a spokesman for the foundation on Heritage proposals and research findings in all areas of the Foundation's study.  She has been a featured commentator on numerous radio and television shows including "CNN & Co.", PBS' "This is America with Dennis Wholey," and <a href=" http://net.fcref.org/">NET NewsTalk Television.</a>  
<p>
Miller previously served as the foundation's director of <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.htm">lectures and seminars</a> for three years, where she organized all public events for the foundation from welfare and education reform to ballistic missile defense.  If one of your favorite pastimes is watching C-Span, you may be familiar with Heritage's lectures and panel discussions.  
<p>
Prior to her work for the foundation, Miller worked in the Bush Administration as a special assistant for domestic policy and public liaison for Vice President Dan Quayle.  She was also a staff assistant in the Reagan Administration, where she assisted in the compilation of research data on the major domestic and foreign policy events which shaped the Administration.  This project served as the basis for President  Reagan's memoirs, and are on display at the <a href="/townhall/hall_of_fame/reagan/preslib.html">Reagan Presidential Library</a>.
<p>
A native of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Miller is married to a Civil War buff from North Carolina who insists she has "southern traits."  Her husband, Matt, works on Capitol Hill, and they have two daughters. The first, Reagan Lee Miller, is named after President Ronald Reagan, the reason they both entered politics.
<p>
Miller has her B. A. and J.D. from The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.

<title>NEW COMMANDER FOR THREE-FRONT DRUG WAR</title>

<body>

<p>

<h2>NEW COMMANDER FOR<br>
THREE-FRONT DRUG WAR</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

The new drug czar, General Barry McCaffrey, is the antithesis
of his boss.  McCaffrey, whose nomination was announced during
President Clinton's State of the Union message on January 23,
1996, is a decorated war hero, a West Pointer who epitomizes 
&quot;Duty-Honor-Country,&quot; and a true anti-drug warrior.
<p>
While McCaffrey's task should be to mount an all-out attack against
well-entrenched drug traffickers, his efforts are likely to be
diluted because two other fronts need attention.   One involves
repairing congressional relationships, and the other concerns
the difficulty of manuevering inside an administration that lacks
enthusiasm for combatting illicit drug use.
<p>
On the second front,  McCaffrey will fight against this administration's
natural inclination.  Many Clintonites feel more comfortable on
the wrong side of drugs and may resist anti-drug changes with
bureaucratic boobytraps.
<p>
On the first front, Congress is skeptical about Clinton's rebirth
as a crusader against the drug trade.   Senator Richard Shelby
(R-Ala.) tried to abolish the drug czar's office, blaming the
administration for sending &quot;a mixed message to America's
youth -- a message that doing drugs is not a crime.&quot;  Shelby
added, &quot;I object to the administration's handling of this
issue -- its lack of commitment to enforcement.&quot;
<p>
Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) said, &quot;I've been in Congress
for over two decades, and I have never, never, never seen a president
who cares less about this issue.&quot;
<p>
Most importantly, on the front of ending drug trafficking, McCaffrey
must repair past damage.  In 1992, Clinton promised to renew the
anti-drug campaign, but quickly surrounded himself with pro-drug
advisors and bad policy.  He has cut Pentagon, Customs Service and DEA 
interdiction efforts.  The White House has radically downsized the drug 
czar's office and dropped the drug war to last on the National Security
Council's priority list.
<p>
Now, Clinton has shown a sudden interest in the drug issue.  He
wants drug testing for all arrested felons.  He has rejected changes
to a tough crack cocaine law and recently criticized his liberal
media friends for glamorizing drugs.
<p>
Why McCaffrey? In 1993, during a White House visit, McCaffrey
was rebuffed by a female White House staffer who said she didn't
speak to military people.  Clinton attempted damage control by
taking McCaffrey jogging with him.
<p>
To his credit, McCaffrey is an expert on narcotics trafficking.
He returned to Washington from the military's Southern Command
in Panama, where he presided over U.S. cooperation with Latin
American and Caribbean nations on drug intelligence and interdiction
since February 1994.
<p>
McCaffrey has also said the right things.  He told Congress that
the President's drug strategy &quot;correctly addresses both the
domestic problems of demand and the international problems of
drug manufacturing and smuggling.&quot;
<p>
McCaffrey has clear marching orders.  As the President directed
him in his State of the Union address:  &quot;Lead our nation's
battle against drugs.&quot;  It's going to be tough for this soldier
who is accustomed to giving orders and expecting things done,
however.
<p>
President Harry Truman said of President-elect and General Dwight
Eisenhower, &quot;He'll say, `Do this! Do that! and nothing will
happen.  Poor Ike -- it won't be a bit like the army.  He'll find
it very frustrating.&quot;
<p>
As a fellow West Pointer and former subordinate, I offer this
advice.  Sir, begin your command by performing a thorough mission
analysis, prepare the troops, and then mount a Desert Storm-like
Hail-Mary maneuver to regain lost ground.  Then, exploit your
success.
<p>
Apply the principles of war.  Begin with the principle of security.
Reduce the probability that the enemy might interfere.  Sweep
your perimeter for guerrillas and then identify others who will
impede your plan.  Fair warning, pro-drug partisans are inside
the Clinton camp.
<p>
Define your &quot;purpose,&quot; which means develop a plan that
gains some degree of control over your opposition.  Begin by dumping
the &quot;harm reduction&quot; strategy, which substitutes treatment
for enforcement.  Return the war to the front lines reducing both
supply and demand.
<p>
Maneuver is another principle.  Sun Tzu, the ancient Chinese military
thinker, said there are only two methods of maneuver (attack):
direct and indirect.  Avoid direct attacks on unsympathetic forces
within the administration.  Attack indirectly by going around
them.  Get the support of the American people.  Maneuver to repair
the administration's credibility with Congress and then seek funding
to rearm interdiction forces.
<p>
Use the principle of initiative to take drug abuse awareness center
stage.  Use your allies.  Foster dissent within hostile federal
agencies using natural allies like Reagan-era bureaucrats who
believe in Nancy's &quot;Just Say No&quot; strategy.  They'll
keep pro-drug Clintonites busy while you focus on drug suppliers.
<p>
Declare war on traffickers.  Work with foreign governments to
destroy drug crops, processing plants and their transportation
networks.  Empower the DEA, FBI and local law enforcement to step
up pressure on drug kingpins and street dealers.
<p>
The principle of economy of force requires that you use the minimum
essential resources for those endeavors that require the least
emphasis.  Ask Congress to fund specific drug projects that don't
need your personal attention, thus freeing you for higher priorities.
Canvas the country to reawaken the 1980-era anti-drug activists.
<p>
Use the principle of surprise to attack those who encourage drug
use.  Adhere to the principle of simplicity.  Simple concepts
and clear, concise orders reduce confusion.  This government has
too many anti-drug plans gathering dust and too many chiefs. 
Put your drug fighters in a formation, and insist they stay in
step.  The President will, no doubt, continue to wage a war of
words against promotion of drug abuse in the culture.  This will
make some of them uncomfortable, but it will be your deeds that
turn their discomfort into alarm.
<p>
Finally, the principle of morale is a state of mind.   You must
be confident and determined.   You must demonstrate staying power
and the spirit to win.  Stay visible.   Be a rabble-rouser  --
be a leader.
<p>
America needs a coordinated anti-drug war, and your leadership
can make the difference.  The question is whether Mr. Clinton's
conversion is real and whether, for our children's sake, he will
permit you to lead.

<title>REVAMPING THE DRUG WAR</title>

<h2>REVAMPING THE DRUG WAR</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

A recent rise in drug use among youth has some national leaders
flirting with the idea of legalizing drugs even though recent
history has shown that anti-drug abuse campaigns -- such as Nancy
Reagan's &quot;Just Say No&quot; program -- work.  Indeed, the
absence of such high-profile, nationalized efforts has no doubt
contributed to the recent rise in drug use among youth.

<p>

James Burke, chairman of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America,
says, &quot;In the last two years, the numbers [of drug abusers]
have gone up dramatically.  We allowed it to happen.  We were
going in the right direction.  We took our eye off the ball.
Kids [today] view illegal drugs as less dangerous and more 
acceptable.&quot;

<p>

Burke attributes the attitude shift to fewer news stories about
the risks of drugs, more pro-drug information, more legalization
discussions, and glamorization of drugs by the pop culture.

<p>

The absence of committed leadership from federal authorities has
also contributed to the problem.  Since taking office, the Clinton
administration has been  pushing treatment rather than enforcement
-- a strategy known as &quot;harm reduction.&quot;  In 1995, the
budget share for interdiction was one-third of what it was in
1985.   Investigations, too, were reduced by 28 percent over this
same period.

<p>

Even though treatment funding has expanded by 119 percent in the
past five years, the number of persons treated has actually declined
by 9 percent.  Additional concerns are raised when one looks at
the distribution of taxpayer dollars within the drug programs.
In 1995, the $13 billion allocated to the war against drugs was
spread thinly among 18 federal agencies and 12 functional areas
(such as interdiction, prevention, treatment, etc.).  All in all,
the war involves more than 140 federal programs, each with its
own bureaucracy.  This scatter shot approach tries to spread enough
money around to drown the problem with resources.  Unfortunately,
only a small percentage of the money ever gets to the &quot;street.&quot;
The majority gets absorbed by infrastructure.

<p>

The vast majority of Americans -- 94 percent according to a December
1995 Gallup poll -- consider drug abuse a serious national problem
and want something done about it.  Large majorities oppose legalization
as a solution and most fault illicit drugs as a root cause of
many of America's social pathologies.

<p>

How bad is the problem?  A 1994 survey by the National Institute
on Drug Abuse found that marijuana use among 8th graders more
than doubled from 1991 to 1994, rising from 6.2 percent to over
13 percent.  A similar trend is evident among 10th and 12th graders
while adolescent abuse of cocaine, crack, heroin, speed and LSD
is also rising dramatically.

<p>

What are the consequences of increased drug abuse?   Andrew Peyton
Thomas, Arizona assistant attorney general and former NAACP counsel,
writes in <I>Crime and the Sacking of America</I>, &quot;There
is...an undeniable relationship between crime and drugs.  Drug
addiction can both lower inhibitions among offenders and spur
them on to other crimes to finance their dependency.&quot;   A
1993 Justice Department study of urban youths over a five-year
period found a direct connection between drug use and delinquency.

<p>

Since 1985, drug-related medical emergencies have skyrocketed
500 percent.   Most of the rise is blamed on heroin and crack
cocaine which are out of control, but the rebirth of designer
drugs like methamphetamine or &quot;speed&quot; is equally startling.
Attorney General Janet Reno said, &quot;[Meth] is spreading
across this country....  There should be no question...that methamphetamine
poses a real and serious threat to the citizens of our nation.&quot;

<p>

The war against drugs doesn't necessarily need more money, but
it does need a major overhaul in emphasis and implementation.

<p><ul>

<li><b>It needs committed leadership.</b> Battles are won tactically
but wars are won strategically.  A winning strategy requires a
leader with vision.  Presidents Bush and Clinton have given responsibility
to a drug czar who has virtually no authority.  One cannot delegate
responsibility unless one delegates commensurate authority to
get the job done.  The President must give this issue a constantly
high profile.

<p>

<li><b>It needs a single responsible federal agency emphasizing
interdiction and prevention.</b> The new drug czar, General Barry
McCaffrey, promises to reorganize his office into &quot;a more
effective mechanism.&quot;  But the drug war needs more than a
reshuffling of the czar's deck chairs.  He should be subordinate
to the Attorney General like the Surgeon General falls under the
Secretary for Health and Human Services.  That would eliminate
redundancies and improve the use of taxpayer dollars. He should
coordinate America's drug interdiction effort and speak out against
abuse.  Let local communities do the rest.  They can do a far
better job than the federal government.

<p>

<li><b>It needs focus on faith-based treatment programs.</b>
Let faith-based organizations tailor prevention and treatment
to local needs.  The best drug abuse prevention and treatment
programs are faith-based, yet they are often denigrated by federal
bureaucrats.

</ul><p>

To desert the war in the face of rising drug abuse is wrong.
Instead, the drug war must refocus on committed leadership, government
interdiction and prevention, and faith-based treatment programs.

<title>ADOLESCENT MARIJUANA ABUSE GOES HIGHER</title>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>ADOLESCENT MARIJUANA<br>
ABUSE GOES HIGHER</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
According to the 1994 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse
(NHSDA),  marijuana use among 12-17 year olds nearly doubled from
1992 to 1994.  The number of teenagers who believe they risk harm
by using marijuana has decreased.[1]
<p>
Four-fifths (10 million) of current illicit drug users use marijuana
and the highest rate of drug use is now among persons 16 to 21
years old.  They tend to be unemployed and lack a high school
diploma. 
<p>
Since the 1970's, the NHSDA has been the primary source of statistical
information on the use of illegal drugs in the United States.
 It is based on a nationally representative sample of the civilian
noninstitutionalized population age 12 and older. 
<p>
Similar results were found in a 1994 survey by the National Institute
on Drug Abuse (NIDA).  It found that marijuana use among 8th graders
rose from 6.2 percent in 1991 to 13 percent in 1994.  A similar
trend was evident among 10th and 12th graders.[2]
<p>
Both 1994 surveys found declines in the proportion of adolescents
who believe they risk harm by using marijuana occasionally has
decreased.  But White House Drug Policy Director Lee P. Brown
said, marijuana is &quot;a very dangerous drug that can cause
you to fight for your health and your life.&quot;[3]
<p>
Although some young people don't even consider marijuana a &quot;drug,&quot;
Dr. Carlton Turner, former NIDA director and head of the Marijuana
Research Project at the University of Mississippi, warns, &quot;There
is no other drug used or abused by man that has the staying power
and broad cellular actions on the body that cannabis [marijuana]
does.&quot;[4]
<p>
The short-term effects of marijuana include impairment in learning
and memory, perception, judgment and complex motor skills.  The
drug can cause difficulty in speaking, listening effectively,
thinking, retaining knowledge, problem-solving and forming concepts.
<p>
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala states, &quot;Young
people must understand that there is clear scientific evidence
that marijuana is a dangerous drug that can have acute and hazardous
effects.&quot;[5] More than 10,500 published scientific papers show
that marijuana damages brain cells, the lungs, may adversely affect
reproduction in women and fertility in men, endangers the unborn
baby and newborns of pot-smoking women, and could damage the heart.

<title>DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION:  HOW TO KEEP KIDS DRUG FREE</title>

<h2>DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION:<br>
HOW TO KEEP KIDS DRUG FREE</h2>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
The recent dramatic rise in drug abuse is fueled by a pro-drug
culture, generational forgetfulness and crippled prevention programs.
 The problem demands renewed grassroots attention by parents,
community involvement and aggressive, private and public, national
anti-drug leadership.
<P>
Drug abuse is symptomatic of  numerous social pathologies such
as rampant fatherlessness which afflicts 18 million American children.
 And abuse has personal and cultural consequences:  increased
crime, poorer health, lowered productivity, and significant costs
to the nation in health and welfare support.  Curbing this scourge
must become a national priority.
<P>
This paper will profile the drug abuse problem, the culture's
contribution to that problem, the parents' role and the history
and future of organized, drug prevention programs.
<P>
<center><h3>A RISE IN DRUG ABUSE PORTENDS MORE VIOLENCE</h3></center>
<P>
A 1994 survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) found
that marijuana use among 8th graders rose from 6.2 percent in
1991 to 13 percent in 1994.  A similar trend is evident among
10th and 12th graders.  Adolescent abuse of cocaine, crack, heroin,
and LSD is also rising.[1]
<P>
The Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education (PRIDE) reports
that the U.S. is in the midst of a new wave of adolescent drug
abuse.  Associated with this increase is more violent behavior.
 PRIDE found that children who use alcohol, marijuana, hallucinogens,
and/or cocaine are significantly more likely to carry a gun to
school, take part in gang activities, attempt suicide, threaten
to harm another, and get in trouble with the police than children
who abstain from drugs.[2]
<P>
The Supreme Court agrees that there is a relationship between
drug abuse and juvenile crime.   On June 26, 1995, in the case
of <I>Vernonia School</I>
<I>District v. Acton,</I> the court decided  that school-sponsored
drug testing is constitutional, giving local officials a tool
to fight the problem.[3]
<P>
The Vernonia School District told the high court that disciplinary
problems had reached &quot;epidemic proportions.&quot;   The school
administration concluded that rebellion in the classroom was fueled
by alcohol and drug abuse and that student athletes were the leaders
of the drug culture.   
<P>
After a parent &quot;input night&quot; to discuss a proposed drug
test policy for athletes, the parents present gave unanimous approval.
 The policy's purpose is to &quot;prevent student athletes from
using drugs, to protect their health and safety, and to provide
drug users with assistance programs.&quot;  The high court okayed
athlete drug testing. 
<P>
<center><h3>A PRO-DRUG CULTURE</h3></center>
<P>
Andrew Peyton Thomas, Arizona assistant attorney general and a
former NAACP counsel, writes in <I>Crime and the Sacking of America,
&quot;</I>There is ... an undeniable
relationship between crime and drugs.  Drug addiction can both
lower inhibitions among offenders and spur them on to other crimes
to finance their dependency.&quot;  He argues that in spite of
the synergism of crime and drugs, analysts cannot conclude that
drugs cause crime.  In fact, drugs &quot;do not ingest themselves
... Drugs reach their human hosts only after being invited.&quot;
  What then leads children to use drugs?[4]
<P>
James Burke, chairman of the Partnership for a Drug Free America,
told delegates at the May 1995 American Cities Against Drugs Convention
in Atlanta that in 1962 there were fewer than four million people
who tried illegal drugs.  By 1993, this number had grown to 80
million who had tried drugs, with six million in various stages
of addiction.[5]
<P>
According to Burke, attitudes drive drug abuse:  &quot;In the
last two years, the numbers [of drug abusers] have gone up dramatically.
 We allowed it to happen.  We were going in the right direction.
 We took our eye off the ball.  Kids [today] view illegal drugs
as less dangerous and more acceptable.&quot;[6]  Burke attributes
the attitude shift to fewer news stories about the risks of drugs,
more pro-drug information, more legalization discussions, and
reglamorization of drugs by the music industry.
<P>
A national survey released by the Center on Addiction and Substance
Abuse at Columbia University supports Burke's contention.  It
found that 76 percent of adolescents and 67 percent of adults
blame the popular culture -- television shows, movies, magazines,
and popular music -- for encouraging illegal drug use.  One-third
of the adolescents also said that drugs are the most important
problem facing them.[7]
<P>
The Washington pollster who did the survey, Frank Luntz, explains,
&quot;It's not parents talking about children.  It's kids talking
about themselves.&quot;  The polls show that respondents feel
that the entertainment industry helps to create an environment
in which drug use is not stigmatized.[8]
<P>
Other pro-drug influences are working to transform the culture.
 For example, youth clothing manufacturers like Adidas produce
shoes called &quot;Chronic,&quot; which are made from hemp and
named after the slang term for a marijuana-packed cigar.[9]
<P>
Cultural icons like baseball star Darryl Strawberry undercut anti-drug
messages. Strawberry is an admitted cocaine addict and alcoholic
who has been jailed for spousal abuse and convicted of fraud.
 Although his former manager, Tommy Lasorda of the Los Angeles
Dodgers, said Strawberry ought to be in jail, not playing baseball,
New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner recently signed Strawberry
to a new contract.  Lee Brown, Office of National Drug Control
Policy director, said that Steinbrenner's decision tells our youth,
&quot;If you use drugs, you can be rewarded with big money in
big-time sports ... It is no wonder kids may think that star athletes
are into drugs and there are no real penalties.&quot;[11]
<P>
Even television news programs have taken up the pro-drug banner.
 ABC aired &quot;America's War on Drugs -- Searching for Solutions&quot;
on April 6, 1995.  It includes a litany of distortions such as
the unproven notion that legalizing drugs will reduce crime  and
that drug treatment is a better alternative than enforcement.[12]
<P>
Former CBS news anchor Walter Cronkite hosted a <I>Discovery Channel</I>
program entitled &quot;The War on Drugs.&quot;   The June 20,
1995 documentary sympathetically profiles the plight of jailed
drug offenders, declares the drug war lost, and calls on President
Clinton to form a bipartisan commission with sweeping powers to
reappraise the war.
<P>
<I>NBC Nightly News</I> profiled a commentary by marijuana advocate
Dr. Lester Grinspoon which appeared in the June 1995 <I>Journal
of the American Medical Association</I>.[13]  The NBC &quot;Health
News&quot; segment by Robert Bazell interviewed many people who
claim marijuana helps them with medical problems that include
AIDS, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, and cancer.  NBC ignores more
than 10,500 scientific studies which chronicle the adverse consequences
of marijuana use.[14]
<P>
<center><h3>GENERATIONAL AMNESIA</h3></center>
<P>
The drug crisis of the 1970s was reversed by the parents of the
1980s who took charge.  They became involved in their children's
lives, forced schools and community organizations to join the
fight, and supported efforts by President and Mrs. Reagan, who
promised to make drug fighting a national priority.
<P>
Gary Fields, school superintendent in Zion, Illinois, believes
that today's teens are being raised by &quot;drugged parents&quot;
who struggle with their own abuse history and often enable their
children.  He says these parents must stop denying the problem
and he encourages them to give their children a strong anti-drug
message at home.  Otherwise, he says, school-based prevention
programs won't work.[15]
<P>
Southern Methodist University professor Robert Hampson studies
child and adolescent behavior.  He says that parental involvement
in drug-abuse prevention is critical to helping children stay
drug free.  &quot;A healthy family,&quot; he explains, &quot;is
one in which the children respect their elders, older siblings
serve as strong role models, communication lines remain open and
parents remain open, and parents feel empowered to shape their
children's lives.&quot;[16]
<P>
Deborah Cohen of Louisiana State University Medical Center led
a study to identify specific parenting behaviors associated with
the onset of alcohol and tobacco use.  Cohen's 1994 study, published
in <I>Pediatrics,</I> found that children who reported that parents
spent more time with them and communicated with them were less
likely to use alcohol and tobacco.[17]  Another 1994 study in
<I>Pediatrics</I> found that parental monitoring is an effective tool 
in the prevention of drug use.[18]
<P>
Research has identified numerous risk factors that contribute
to adolescent drug abuse.  They include:  availability of drugs,
family and community mobility, community safety, parental drug
use or attitude toward drugs, and level of supervision.
<P>
The Virginia Council on Coordinating Prevention found that most
children who defy the odds of becoming drug abusers &quot;have
had the opportunity to establish a close bond with at least one
person who provided them with stable care and from whom they received
adequate and appropriate attention during the first year of life.&quot;
 A caring and supportive relationship remains the most critical
variable throughout childhood and adolescence.  In fact, even
for those from a troubled home environment, &quot;a good relationship
with one parent&quot; provides a substantial protective effect.[19]
<P>
Rosemary Hinojosa recognizes the need to empower parents to rear
resilient children.  She is the executive director of La Familia
Fuerte [Strong Family], a drug abuse prevention program for Mexican-American
children in Dallas, Texas.  Her program takes a holistic approach
which involves parents in keeping children drug free.  She educates
parents on child-rearing, health, and substance abuse issues.[20]
<P>
&quot;We're trying,&quot; Hinojosa says, &quot;to help the families
draw from their own strengths and allow them to see they have
those strengths, so when we're gone, they can fall back on them.&quot;[21]
<P>
Hinojosa's focus on the home is proper, but some children don't
have parents who are willing or prepared to guide them away from
drugs.  In these cases, when parents fail, government has become
a poor substitute.
<P>
<center><h3>HISTORY OF DRUG PREVENTION</h3></center>
<P>
Drug abuse is an international problem.  For example, in the 1960s,
then-Chinese Premier Chou En-lai told Egyptian President Gamal
Abdel Nasser, &quot;We are getting back at the West now.  We are
helping the Vietnamese make drug slaves of the American GIs with
heroin and hashish.&quot;[22]
<P>
Chou En-lai blamed the 19th-century British [translated &quot;the
West&quot;] for smuggling opium into China, leaving 90 million
opium addicts.  Hoping to curb the opium supply, the Chinese &quot;illegally&quot;
disposed of tons of British opium.  The British responded by starting
the First Opium War, which was settled in their favor after China
ceded Hong Kong.  
<P>
The Chinese opium plague wasn't resolved until the 1950s and only
after unprecedented public health efforts.   Neighboring Japan
fought an amphetamine epidemic that began during World War II
with government encouragement in order to keep war factories producing
and men fighting.  They were sold without prescription for &quot;elimination
of drowsiness and repletion of the spirits.&quot;
<P>
In 1951, the Japanese government passed the Awakening Drug Control
Law to deal with the nearly two percent (750,000) of the population
who were abusing amphetamines.  The law began a successful three-year
campaign to eradicate the abuse through treatment, education and
stiff penalties.[23]
<P>
Singapore had a heroin epidemic in the late 1970s.  Poh Geok Ek,
director of the Central Narcotics Bureau, states, &quot;The situation
called for immediate action; otherwise, heroin, like an infectious
disease, would spread like wildfire.&quot;[24]
<P>
Singapore adopted harsh laws that called for the death penalty
for trafficking more than 15 grams.  Between 1980 and 1985, 15
people were hanged.   That country also embraced large-scale and
mandatory &quot;cold-turkey&quot; drug rehabilitation.  Poh explained:
 &quot;Our aim is to persuade the addict that he no longer needs
the drug and finally to give him an incentive to replace the drug
with a more satisfying way of life.&quot;
<P>
The Singaporean rehab model includes indoctrination and a military-style
exercise regimen, followed by six months in a halfway house and
two years of close drug supervision.  Today, Singapore has one
of the lowest drug abuse rates in the world.
<P>
 The American Civil War (1861-1865) created a morphine epidemic.
 Many soldiers who were treated with morphine for battlefield
wounds became addicted.  After the war, local drugstores and mail-order
firms like Sears Roebuck legally sold opium or morphine, and by
the beginning of the 20th century, one percent of the U.S. population
were opium addicts.[25]
<P>
The U.S. has fought the opium trade for most of two centuries.
 America signed a treaty with Siam in 1833 acknowledging the need
to curb the flow of opium.  President Teddy Roosevelt organized
the 1909 Shanghai Convention to control the production, manufacturing,
export, import, and distribution of narcotics.[26]
<P>
The U.S. pushed for an international meeting in the Netherlands,
which produced the Hague Opium Convention in January 1912.  That
treaty included, for the first time, control over cocaine.  The
Hague Treaty provided the basis for the 1914 Harrison Narcotics
Bill, which committed the U.S. to controlling drug trafficking.
<P>
After World War II, heroin emerged as a major problem in America's
inner cities.  The government responded by embracing treatment
modalities, including methadone maintenance, therapeutic communities,
and outpatient care.  Politicians passed abstinence laws and created
a phalanx of anti-drug forces.  Meanwhile, educators joined the
fray by stressing information about types of drugs and the negative
consequences from their use.  Proponents of this approach argued
that teens used illicit drugs because they were ignorant of their
harmful nature.  
<P>
This scare tactic approach was replaced by values clarification
(teaching social and personal skills). Today, most programs are
characterized as risk based protective factor type approaches.
<P>
School-based programs designed to prevent drug abuse have been
an integral part of the nation's anti-drug effort for more than
two decades.  Drug education is a $2 billion industry replete
with teachers' seminars and anti-drug texts.  Most of the money
comes from block grants for counseling, and social work.  Yet
there is conflicting evidence whether these programs really make
a difference.
<P>
The President's 1995 National Drug Control Strategy paper concludes
&quot;that only prevention efforts can bring about a long-term
solution to the problem of illicit drug use and its consequences.&quot;[27]
 The paper argues that there has been significant progress since
1979 in reducing casual use of illicit drugs -- from 24 million
to 12 million users -- and that prevention programs have played
a critical role.  
<P>
The National Structured Evaluation (NSE) of Alcohol and Other
Drug Abuse Prevention, sponsored by the Center for Substance Abuse
Prevention, recently concluded an analysis of hundreds of prevention
efforts.  The NSE found that effective programs emphasize personal
skill development, provide social sanctions and rewards that discourage
drug use and for adolescents at risk, provide professional individual
and family counseling.
<P>
 According to the NSE, there are seven typical prevention approaches.[28]
<UL>
<LI>Positive decisionmaking:  Helps develop personal skills for
preadolescent children.  It is in a quarter of all programs and
is a common school-based program.
<LI>Safety/health skills:  The least common, it provides skills
development and drug lectures.
<LI>Psychosocial skills:  Focuses on personal skill development
without fact-based drug lectures.  Accounts for 10 percent of
the programs.
<LI>Counseling intensive:  Provides individual and family intervention
and drug information.  Accounts for 10 percent of the programs.
<LI>Case management:  Focuses on individual needs to include health
care and addiction counseling.  Accounts for 7 percent of the
programs.
<LI>Multidirectional:  Combines many activities, personal skills
development, skills training, drug information lectures, and alternative
drug-free recreation.  Accounts for 13 percent of the programs.
<LI>Environmental change:  Provides training, changes law or enforcement
patterns, and alters the physical setting.  Accounts for one-third
of the programs.
</UL>
<P>
<center><h3>DRUG PREVENTION PROGRAMS</h3></center>
<P>
The Federal Government funds and oversees drug prevention through
efforts like the Department of Education's Safe and Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Program.   One of the best known is Project
D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education).  
<P>
DARE is distinctive because of its widespread adoption nationwide;
its use of uniformed policemen teaching in local schools; and
its local control.  
<P>
DARE was created in 1983 by the Los Angeles Police Department
for grades K-12.  It uses a core curriculum consisting of 17 hour-long
weekly lessons, usually offered in 45- to 60-minute blocks.  DARE
focuses on teaching skills to resist social pressures to use drugs,
making decisions, building self-esteem, and choosing healthy alternatives
to drug use.  The programs for high school students address additional
topics like conflict resolution, gang prevention, parent education,
and after-school recreation.
<P>
The Research Triangle Institute (RTI) in cooperation with the
National Institute of Justice studied DARE's effectiveness.  Their
study found that DARE is popular and that many DARE  coordinators
plan to expand the program.  Many districts without the program
want to adopt it.
<P>
But RTI's meta-analysis found that DARE does not reduce drug use
despite its success in increasing student knowledge about substance
abuse and enhancing their social skills.[29]  William Midzelski, a
U.S. Department of Education drug education specialist, said,
&quot;It's well established that DARE doesn't work.&quot;[30]
<P>
Phyllis Ellickson, a Rand Corporation researcher, states, &quot;DARE
has a following and sales force that is extremely powerful in
fighting for scarce resources.  But its growth is totally out
of scale to its effectiveness.&quot;[31]
<P>
The Drug Policy Foundation (DPF) hosted a conference in Washington,
D.C. in November 1994.  A seminar entitled &quot;Truth or DARE&quot;
featured two activist parents critiquing DARE.  Richard Evans
of  Northhampton, Massachusetts, says DARE does not define drug
abuse and relies on values clarification.  According to Evans,
teachers like DARE because it gives them a free hour each week.
 Local police like DARE because it gets them into the lives of
children.  And politicians like DARE because it makes them look
like they are doing something.
<P>
The other DPF panelist was Steve Wallace of Chapel Hill, North
Carolina, who complained that DARE officers scare kids.  He said
that DARE consumes $600 to $700 million each year but doesn't
help children learn.
<P>
Despite the fact that the program has demonstrated limited success,
DARE has many supporters.  Glenn Levant, DARE's executive director,
states, &quot;Scientists will tell you bumble bees can't fly,
but we know they can.&quot;  Steve Rusiniak, a youth-bureau detective
in Wayne, New Jersey who has taught DARE classes for three years
states, &quot;I do know, because I've heard back from many kids
and their families, that DARE has established a good rapport.
 DARE has done something.  I'm not claiming that DARE is the answer,
but it's part of it.&quot;[32]
<P>
Less publicized prevention programs have shown promising results.
 Project Smart, founded in 1981, teaches children to resist peer
pressure, to interpret advertisements for alcohol and cigarettes,
and to practice saying no to drugs through role playing.[33]
<P>
Drug Strategies president Mathea Falco touts the successes of
Project Star.  She claims in her 1992 book, <I>The Making of a
Drug-Free America,</I> that there was a 30 percent drop
in drug abuse among adolescents in a Kansas City test.[34]
<P>
High-Scope curriculum advocates claim that 70 percent of their
inner city graduates stay away from drug dealing compared to peers
who hadn't participated.  This program includes a weekly 90-minute
home visit from counselors who focus on teaching parents how to
parent.[35]
<P>
The Archdiocese Drug Abuse Prevention Program (ADAP) is based
in the Bronx.  The curriculum focuses on group prevention counseling.
 According to executive director Sally Ann Shields, &quot;Information
does not change behavior.  It's the development of skills and
the relationships with counselors [that change behavior].&quot;[36]
<P>
ADAP is recognized by the federal government's Center for Substance
Abuse Prevention (CSAP) as one of the nation's best prevention
programs.  ADAP claims that 91 percent of participants significantly
reduced or eliminated drug and alcohol use and 79 percent of the
adolescents improved their grades and behavior at school.[37]
<P>
The President's National Drug Control Strategy states, &quot;America's
faith community can play an important role in finding solutions
to the related issues of drugs and violence.&quot;[38]  In fact, ONDCP
has called for a meeting of faith community leaders before the
end of 1995.
<P>
Religion-based drug treatment and prevention programs have been
especially successful.  Freddy Garcia, an ex-addict, has spent
the last 30 years helping inner city children fight drug addiction.
 He claims a 60 percent success rate using teaching on marriage
and the family, practical Christian living, Biblical counseling
skills, and love.  His staff includes ex-addicts, because, as
Garcia says, &quot;The man who has come back from the precipice
can best show others the way.&quot;  Garcia's &quot;Victory Mission&quot;
has 60 branches and has treated over 13,000 substance abusers.[39]
<P>
U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich named Garcia to a citizens' group
to recommend solutions to problems like poverty, crime, substance
abuse, and teen sex.  He said of Garcia, &quot;Freddy Garcia has
achieved results that are almost unheard of ... rather than studying
him, all too often the bureaucracy has tried to put folks like
Freddy out of business because they don't have a Ph.D. or they
don't fill out the paperwork right.&quot;[40]
<P>
Teen Challenge is a religion-based drug treatment and prevention
program that claims that 86 percent of individuals who go through
their program remain drug free.[41]  The basic philosophy is, &quot;We
believe that sincere faith in Christ is the motivation needed
to extract the deep-rooted symptoms that cause dependence on narcotics.&quot;
[42]
<P>
Characteristics shared by successful programs include parental
involvement, knowledge of drugs and their dangers, positive social
activities, positive role models, rewards and recognition for
youth interests, and an overall caring and supportive environment
in communities with integrated health, social service, and educational
systems.
<P>
<center><h3>THE FUTURE OF DRUG PREVENTION</h3></center>
<P>
The Oakland, California based &quot;Just Say No&quot; International
called on the Clinton Administration to look at youth drug-abuse
prevention as an economic issue as well as a social health issue.
 It found that over one-third of America's youth are at risk of
succumbing to drug use.[43]
<P>
Volunteer chairman and Hewlett-Packard executive Jack Brigham
cites his organization's survey of 6,404 youth educators, administrators
and other service providers, stating, &quot;The survey findings
confirm that youth drug-abuse prevention must be viewed by the
federal government not only as a social health issue, but as an
economic issue critical to the long-term economic health of this
nation.&quot;[44]
<P>
But Shirley Higgins, a communication specialist with the anti-drug
organization InTouch, told Speaker Newt Gingrich in a recent letter,
&quot;While the federal government has a vital role to play, we
have got to stop engaging in the fantasy that the federal government
can rescue us from our addictions, our community apathy where
it exists, our lack of self-responsibility and our lack of a vision
of a future that goes beyond the next five years.&quot;[45]
<P>
The Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education (PRIDE) subscribes
to three basic beliefs with regard to any future solution.  First,
it believes that parents have a strong instinct to protect their
children.  All we need to do is help parents to understand the
harmful effects of drugs, understand their child's social pressures
and help them develop an action plan.[46]
<P>
Second, our youth have a &quot;goodness of heart&quot; or a deep
care and concern for their peers.  We must help young people by
forming positive peer groups.  Finally, there is a contingent
of adults in every neighborhood.  These adults must be brought
together to network their resources and battle the scourge of
drugs.[47]
<P>
<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>
<P>
The drug debate should be an issue in the 1996 presidential campaign.
National leaders, public and private, must help rein in insidious
cultural influences and government must increase -- not ease up
-- pressure on drug traffickers.  It must also abandon &quot;feel
good&quot; strategies and embrace drug prevention programs that
work.

USE TO POPULAR CULTURE</h2>

<p>
Adults and adolescents see popular culture as a major factor in
the recent increase of drug abuse, according to Columbia University
researchers.
<P>
The Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) at Columbia
released a national survey on June 29, 1995 showing that 76 percent
of adolescents and 67 percent of adults blame popular culture
-- television, movies, magazines, and popular music -- for encouraging
illegal drug use.[1]
<P>
&quot;What's at stake here is America's children,&quot; says CASA
President and former HEW Secretary Joseph A. Califano, Jr.  &quot;We
know that individuals who make it from age 10 to age 20 without
using illegal drugs, without abusing alcohol, without smoking,
are virtually certain never to do so.&quot;
<P>
The Luntz Research Company, which surveyed 2,400 adults and adolescents
between May 18 and June 8, 1995, asked, &quot;What is the most
important problem facing kids today?&quot;  One-third of the adolescents
answered &quot;drugs.&quot;  A distant second with 13 percent
was &quot;crime and violence in school,&quot; which often also
involves drugs.
<P>
The poll also included the question, &quot;When do kids start
using drugs?&quot;  Nine out of ten people who use drugs begin
by age 17.  A surprising one-third begin by age 13.

THE MYTHS AND THE FACTS</H2>

<P>
Despite data which strongly supports the continuation of effective
drug abuse prevention, treatment and enforcement programs, some
prominent Americans support legalizing illicit drugs.  For example:
<P>
<LI>George Shultz, former President Reagan's Secretary of State,
says that &quot;Legalization would destroy dealer profits and
remove their incentive to get young people addicted.&quot;[1]
<P>
<LI>Nobel laureate in economics Milton Friedman says that the criminalization
of certain drugs undermines respect for the law and creates &quot;a
decadent moral climate.&quot;  He states that legalizing drugs
like marijuana and cocaine would &quot;thus strike a double blow;
reduce crime activity directly, and at the same time increase
the efficacy of law enforcement and crime prevention.&quot;[2]
<P>
<LI>U.S. Federal District Judge Robert Sweet says the nation should
learn the lesson of prohibition and the crime that ensued when
alcohol was illegal.  &quot;Look at tobacco, the most addictive
drug, and we've reduced [use] by a third.&quot;[3]
<P>
<LI>Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke commented on former Surgeon General
Joycelyn Elders' call for a study to legalize drugs.  &quot;I
think what the Surgeon General said was absolutely courageous
and correct.&quot;[4]
<P>
<LI>Aryeh Neier, president of billionaire philanthropist George
Soros's Open Society Institute, states, &quot;The current [drug]
policy is wasteful and it promotes crime and disease....  From
every standpoint, it is a failure.&quot;[5]
<P>
Many other officials disagree.
<P>
Lee P. Brown, the director of the Office of National Drug Control
Policy at the White House, labels legalization &quot;a formula
for self-destruction&quot;[6] and warns that decriminalization of
drugs would mean genocide for the black community.[7]
<P>
Wayne Roques, a much-published Drug Enforcement Agency spokesman,
says, &quot;Drug policies which legalize drugs would decimate
the inner cities and gravely wound the suburban populations....
 Legalization is a morally and intellectually bankrupt concept.&quot;[8]
<P>
Most Americans want to know the truth about drugs and expect public
policy to be based on facts and not myths.  Yet myths about legalization
abound.  Consider:
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MYTH #1: ILLICIT DRUGS ARE NO WORSE THAN LEGAL<BR>
DRUGS LIKE ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Marianne Apostolides of the pro-legalization Lindesmith Center
wrote in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, &quot;Marijuana is safer
than other substances such as nicotine and steroids.  Most people
who use marijuana have no problem with it.&quot;[9]
<P>
Yale law professor Steven B. Duke, who wrote <I>America's Longest
War: Rethinking Our Tragic Crusade Against Drugs</I>, believes,
&quot;Our biggest, worst drug problem is the tobacco problem.
 Legalizing drugs will reduce the use of alcohol, which is far
more damaging than any popular illegal drug.&quot;[10]
<P>
The fact that some dangerous substances are legal does not mean
that all dangerous substances should also be legal -- especially
when there are significant differences between the substances
in question.  Clearly, alcohol and tobacco can be quite harmful.
 They have a major impact on morbidity and mortality in the United
States.  
<P>
<LI>Alcohol is a cause or contributing factor in most traffic deaths
and nearly half of all murders, sexual assaults, robberies and
other violent crimes.  More than 40,000 babies are born at risk
each year because their mothers drank alcohol during pregnancy.[11]
<P>
<LI>Similarly, tobacco kills over 400,000 people each year in the
United States, and the British medical journal, <I>Lancet</I>,
estimates that tobacco is the cause of death for 20 percent of
the people in the developed world.[12]
<P>
<LI>Nevertheless, a given dose of cocaine or crack is far more dangerous
than a drink of alcohol.  Alcohol has an addiction rate of 10
percent, whereas cocaine has an addiction rate as high as 75 percent.[13]
<P>
And when cocaine is combined with marijuana, it can be deadly.
 According to a study in <I>Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behavior,</I>
an increase in heart rate due to cocaine was markedly enhanced
if preceded by smoking marijuana.[14] The dual use creates greater
risk of overdose and more severe cardiovascular effects from the
cocaine.  An article in <I>Schizophrenia Research</I> found that
up to 60 percent of schizophrenic patients used non-prescription
psychoactive drugs.[15]
<P>
By itself, marijuana is a dangerous drug as well.  A joint of
marijuana is far more carcinogenic than a cigarette.  Microbiologist
Tom Klein of the University of South Florida reports, &quot;We've
tried working with [marijuana smoke], and it's so toxic, you just
get it near the immune system and it [the immune system] dies.&quot;
 Klein found that THC [tetrahydrocannabinol -- the active ingredient
in marijuana] suppresses some immune system responses and enhances
others.[16]
<P>
A study in the <I>Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology</I>
found that marijuana smoke is often contaminated by the fungus,
aspergillus.[17]  Another study in the <I>Journal of the American
Medical Association</I> found that cases of allergic sinus infection
with the same fungus came from recreational use of contaminated
marijuana.[18]
<P>
A study in <I>Drug and Alcohol Dependence</I> found that cannabis
[marijuana] users react very slowly in performing motor tasks
and suffer disability in personal, social and vocational areas.
 They also indicate a higher score for neurotic and psychotic
behavior.[19]
<P>
A study in <I>American Review of Respiratory Diseases</I> found
that marijuana smoke is as irritating as tobacco smoke; when used
together, marijuana and tobacco cause the small oxygen-exchanging
parts of the lung to shed cells that first become inflamed.[20]
<P>
A 1995 study in <I>The New England Journal of Medicine</I> suggests
that illicit drugs such as marijuana and cocaine can interfere
with male sperm production.[21] 
<P>
A study in <I>Cancer</I> found that the children of women who
smoke marijuana are 11 times more likely to contract leukemia.[22]
 Mothers who smoke marijuana also contribute to low birth weight
and developmental problems for their children and increase the
risk of abnormalities similar to those caused by fetal alcohol
syndrome by as much as 500 percent.[23]
<P>
Kasi Sridhar, a professor at the University of Miami's Sylvester
Comprehensive Cancer Research Center, reports finding large numbers
of marijuana smokers among younger cancer patients.  While only
17 percent of the patients in his study were marijuana smokers,
two-thirds of the patients younger than 45 smoked cannabis.[24]
<P>
Since the 1970s there have been more than 10,500 scientific studies
which demonstrate the adverse consequences of marijuana use.[25]
Many of these studies draw upon data collected when most of the
marijuana available in the U.S. was far less potent than that
available today.  Indeed, drug czar Lee Brown says that marijuana
on the streets today is up to 10 times more potent than a generation
ago.  This fact contributes to its addictive nature.[26]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MYTH #2: LEGALIZATION WILL DRIVE THE CRIME RATE DOWN.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Syndicated columnist Abigail Van Buren endorses <I>Legalization</I>.
 She wrote in her column, &quot;Dear Abby,&quot; that, &quot;The
legalization of drugs would put drug dealers out of business.&quot;
She added that it would also reduce the prison population and
create a perpetual source of tax revenue.[27]
<P>
Former Surgeon General Elders told a National Press Club luncheon,
&quot;Sixty percent of violent crimes are drug- or alcohol-related....
 Many times they're robbing, stealing and all of these things
to get money to buy drugs....  I do feel that we would markedly
reduce our crime rate if drugs were legalized.&quot;[28]
<P>
Professor Steven Duke told an America Online computer network
audience, &quot;Without a doubt, the problem of violent crime
would be ameliorated [by legalizing drugs].  I think drug prohibition
causes half of our serious crime.&quot;[29]
<P>
Rep. Barney Frank (D-Ma.) supports legalization.  &quot;We make
a mistake, with the serious law enforcement problems we have today,
to get the police to arrest people who smoke marijuana....  We
are wasting $10 billion a year trying to physically interdict
drugs.&quot;[30]
<P>
The new president of the American Bar Association, George Bushnell,
favors legalizing marijuana and cocaine.  He believes legalization
will cut crime.[31]
<P>
Legalizers believe most black market and organized syndicate involvement
in the drug business would die and that drug-induced crime would
decrease with drug legalization.  But these assertions are not
supported by the facts.
<P>
The United States experimented with legalization and it failed.
 From 1919 to 1922, government-sponsored clinics handed out free
drugs to addicts in hopes of controlling their behavior.  The
effort failed.  Society's revulsion against drugs, combined with
enforcement,  successfully eradicated the menace at that time.[32]
<P>
California decriminalized marijuana in 1976, and, within the first
six months, arrests for driving under the influence of drugs rose
46 percent for adults and 71.4 percent for juveniles.[33] Decriminalizing
marijuana in Alaska and Oregon in the 1970s resulted in the doubling
of use.[34]
<P>
Patrick Murphy, a court-appointed lawyer for 31,000 abused and
neglected children in Chicago, says that more than 80 percent
of the cases of physical and sexual abuse of children now involve
drugs.  There is no evidence that legalizing drugs will reduce
these crimes, and there is evidence that suggests it would worsen
the problem.[35]
<P>
Legalization would decrease drug distribution crime because most
of those activities would become lawful.  But would legalization
necessarily reduce other drug-related crime like robbery, rape,
and assault?  Presumably legalization would reduce the cost of
drugs and thus addicts might commit fewer crimes to pay for their
habits.  But less expensive drugs might also feed their habit
better, and more drugs means more side effects like paranoia,
irritability and violence.  Suggestions that crime can somehow
be eliminated by redefining it are spurious.
<P>
Free drugs or legalizing bad drugs would not make criminal addicts
into productive citizens.  Dr. Mitchell S. Rosenthal, expert on
drugs and adolescents and president of Phoenix House, a resident
treatment center in New York, said, &quot;If you give somebody
free drugs you don't turn him into a responsible employee, husband,
or father.&quot;[36]
<P>
The Justice Department reports that most inmates (77.4 percent
male and 83.6 percent female) have a drug history and the majority
were under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of their
current offense.  And a surprisingly large number of convicted
felons admit their crime motive was to get money for drugs.  For
example, 12 percent of all violent offenses and 24.4 percent of
all property offenses were drug-money motivated.[37]
<P>
Even if drugs were legalized some restrictions still would be
necessary.  For example, restricting the sale of legalized drugs
to minors, pregnant women, police, military, pilots and prisoners
would be necessary but would still provide a black market niche.
<P>
Pro-legalizers contend that government could tax drugs, thus off-setting
the social costs of abuse.  But history proves that efforts to
tax imported drugs like opium created a black market.  Earlier
this century Chinese syndicates smuggled legal opium into this
country to avoid tariffs.  Even today, there is ample crime based
on the legal drugs, alcohol, and tobacco.  For example, organized
crime smuggles cigarettes from states with low tobacco taxes into
those with high taxes, and such activities are accompanied by
violence against legal suppliers.[38]
<P>
If now-illegal drugs were decriminalized, the government would
have to determine the allowable potency for commercial drugs.
 But no government can okay toxic substances, so a black market
would be created for higher potency drugs and those that remained
banned, like the new &quot;designer drugs.&quot;
<P>
Even pro-drug forces do not call for blanket legalization of drugs
like LSD, crack, or PCP.  Therefore, we would continue to have
drug-related crime and illegal drug distribution organizations
that would push these drugs on youngsters, who would be more easily
induced into drug abuse through the availability and social sanctioning
of marijuana.
<P>
Drug abuse is closely correlated with crime.  The National Youth
Survey found that 25 percent of youths who admitted to cocaine
or heroin use also committed 40 percent of all the index crimes
reported.  The survey also found that youths who tested positive
for cannabinoids have more than twice as many non-drug-related
felony referrals to juvenile court as compared with those found
to have tested negative.[39]
<P>
The extent to which individuals commit &quot;drug-related crimes
only&quot; is overstated.  Most incarcerated &quot;drug&quot;
offenders violated other laws as well.  Princeton University professor
John Dilulio found that only 2 percent -- i.e., 700 -- of those
in federal prisons were convicted of pure drug possession.  They
generally committed other and violent crimes to earn a sentence.[40]
 However, 70 percent of current inmates were on illegal drugs
when arrested and, if drugs become cheaper, violent crime could
reasonably be expected to increase.[41]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MYTH #3: LEGALIZATION MAKES ECONOMIC SENSE.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke believes drugs can be a revenue source
for the government.  &quot;Remove the profit motive, and you put
the dealers out of business... have government stores and buy
marijuana cigarettes... nicely wrapped, purity and potency guaranteed
with a tax stamp.&quot;[42]
<P>
Ethan Nadelmann, a former Princeton University professor and now
director of the Lindesmith Center, states: &quot;Make sure that
junkies have access to clean needles; make it easy for addicts
to obtain methadone; give heroin-maintenance programs a chance
to work; decriminalize marijuana; stop spending billions on incarcerating
drug users and drug dealers.  We know we can reduce drug abuse
more effectively by spending that money on education, pre- and
post-natal care and job-training programs.&quot;[43]
<P>
Nadelmann told the <I>Rolling Stone</I> audience, &quot;...The
Pentagon's interdiction efforts, which cost U.S. taxpayers close
to $1 billion... had no impact on the flow of drugs....  [The]
drug war has been most efficient at filling up the country's prisons
and jails.&quot;[44]
<P>
Dr. Robert Dupont, founding director of the National Institute
on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and president of the Institute for Behavior
and Health in Rockville, Maryland, refutes the economic myth.
 &quot;We now have two legal drugs, alcohol and tobacco.  We have
113 million current users of alcohol and 60 million tobacco users.
 The reason marijuana and cocaine use is so much lower is because
they are illegal drugs.  Cocaine and marijuana are more attractive
than alcohol and tobacco.  If we remove the prohibition of illegality
we would have a number of users of marijuana and cocaine similar
to that of tobacco and alcohol.&quot;[45]
<P>
Health costs associated with legalization would be very high.
 And legalization would have consequences elsewhere.  For example,
the Drug Enforcement Administration says legalization of drugs
will cost society between $140-210 billion a year in lost productivity
and job-related accidents.  And insurance companies would pass
on accident expenses to consumers.[46]   
<P>
The Institute for Health Policy at Brandeis University found that
in 1990 dollars the societal cost of substance abuse is in excess
of $238 billion, of which $67 billion is for illicit drugs.  The
report states, &quot;As the number one health problem in the country,
substance abuse places a major burden on the nation's health care
system and contributes to the high cost of health care.  In fact,
substance abuse -- the problematic use of alcohol, illicit drugs
and tobacco -- places an enormous burden on American society as
a whole.&quot;[47]
<P>
The claim that legalization provides an opportunity to tax new
products is misleading.  For example, total tax revenue from the
sale of alcohol is $13.1 billion a year, but alcohol extracts
over $100 billion a year in social costs such as health care and
lost productivity.[48] There is no evidence to demonstrate that taxing
cocaine, heroin, and marijuana would bolster revenues any more
than do alcohol and tobacco, nor would the revenue from such taxation
offset the social and medical costs these illicit drugs would
impose.
<P>
The pro-drug lobby argues that legalization will save on enforcement
costs.  But elimination of drug enforcement would provide little
funding for other uses.  The government now spends 3.3 percent
of its budget on the criminal justice system and half of that
goes to enforcement.  Less than 12 percent of law enforcement
money goes to drug law enforcement.[49] 
<P>
Former Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare Joseph Califano
cautions that in a post-legalization world, &quot;Madison Avenue
hucksters would make it as attractive to do a few lines [of cocaine]
as to down a few beers.&quot;[50] This would line the pockets of
legal drug producers, but it will clearly hurt the American taxpayer
and American families.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MYTH #4: CRIMINALIZATION OF DRUGS IS LIKE ALCOHOL PROHIBITION.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Conservative columnist William F. Buckley, Jr., writes that the
&quot;...New York Bar in 1986 advocated the repeal of all federal
legislation dealing with drugs, leaving it to the states to write
their own policies.  This will remind you of the 21st Amendment:
when prohibition was repealed in 1933, each state was left free
to write its own liquor laws.&quot;[51]
<P>
Lindesmith Institute director Nadelmann argues that &quot;Prohibition...
financed the rise of organized crime and failed miserably as social
policy.  Likewise, the war on drugs has created new, well-financed,
and violent criminal conspiracies and failed to achieve any of
its goals.&quot;[52]
<P>
Prohibition was a solitary effort by this country while the rest
of the world was essentially &quot;wet.&quot;  However, most drugs
are illegal throughout much of the world.  This makes enforcement
much easier.
<P>
History shows that prohibition curbed alcohol abuse.  Alcohol
use declined by 30 to 50 percent; deaths from cirrhosis of the
liver fell from 29.5 per 100,000 in 1911 to 10.7 in 1929; and
admissions to state mental hospitals for alcohol psychosis fell
from 10.1 per 100,000 in 1919 to 4.7 in 1928.[53] Mark Moore, Harvard
professor of criminal justice, wrote: &quot;The real lesson of
prohibition is that society can, indeed, make a dent in the consumption
of drugs through laws.&quot;[54]
<P>
The DEA found that during prohibition, suicide rates decreased
50 percent.  The incidence of alcohol-related arrests also declined
50 percent.[55]
<P>
Yale history professor David F. Musto comments on the myth that
prohibition is a good parallel for illicit drug legalization:
&quot;Unless drugs were legal for everyone, including children...
illicit sale of drugs would continue.  Legalization would create
more drug-addicted babies, not to mention drug-impaired drivers.&quot;[56]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MYTH #5: OTHER NATIONS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY LEGALIZED DRUGS.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Mr. Nadelmann points to foreign nations when he writes, &quot;We
can learn much from Europe and Australia, where governments have
turned their backs on the 'war on drugs.'  They began by accepting
the obvious:  that it is both futile and dangerous to try to create
a drug-free society.&quot;[57]
<P>
Dr. John Marks of Liverpool, England promotes Great Britain's
&quot;enlightened&quot; drug programs.  &quot;The results are
zero drug-related deaths, zero HIV infection among injecting drug
takers, a... reduction of... 96 percent [in] acquisitive crime.
 And perhaps most puzzling of all, a fall in the incidence of
addiction, among the public at large of... 92 percent.&quot;[58]
<P>
History provides evidence that legalization of drugs in foreign
nations has not been successful.  For example, opium was legalized
in China earlier this century.  That decision resulted in 90 million
addicts and it took a half-century to repair the damage.[59]
<P>
Egypt allowed unrestricted trade of cocaine and heroin in the
1920s.  An epidemic of addiction resulted.  Even in Iran and Thailand,
countries where drugs are readily available, the prevalence of
addiction continues to soar.[60]
<P>
Modern-day Netherlands is often cited as a country which has successfully
legalized drugs.  Marijuana is sold over the counter and police
seldom arrest cocaine and heroin users.  But official tolerance
has led to significant increases in addiction.  
<P>
Amsterdam's officials blame the significant rise in crime on the
liberal drug policy.  The city's 7,000 addicts are blamed for
80 percent of all property crime and Amsterdam's rate of burglary
is now twice that of Newark, New Jersey.[61] Drug problems have forced
the city to increase the size of the police force and the city
fathers are now rethinking the drug policy.[62]
<P>
Dr. K. F. Gunning, president of the Dutch National Committee on
Drug Prevention, cites some revealing statistics about drug abuse
and crime.  Cannabis use among students increased 250 percent
from 1984 to 1992.  During the same period, shootings rose 40
percent, car thefts increased 62 percent, and hold-ups rose 69
percent.[63]
<P>
Sweden legalized doctor prescriptions of amphetamines in 1965.
 During the first year of legalization, the number of intravenous
&quot;speed&quot; addicts rose 88.5 percent.  A study of men arrested
during the legalization period showed a high correlation between
intravenous use and a variety of crimes.[64]
<P>
Dr. Nils Bejorot, director of the Swedish Carnegie Institute and
professor of social medicine at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm,
believes the solution to the growing drug problem is consistent
social and legal harassment of both users and dealers.[65]
<P>
Great Britain experimented with controlled distribution of heroin
between 1959 and 1968.  According to the <I>British Medical Journal</I>,
the number of heroin addicts doubled every sixteen months and
the increase in addicts was accompanied by an increase in criminal
activity as well.[66] And British authorities found that heroin addicts
have a very good chance of dying prematurely.  On the crime front,
Scotland Yard had to increase its narcotics squad 100 percent
to combat the crime caused by the &quot;legal&quot; addicts.[67]
<P>
The Swiss opened a &quot;legalized drug&quot; area in Zurich seven
years ago and local addicts were given drugs, clean needles, and
emergency medical care.  Unfortunately, the liberal policy backfired
and the number of addicts surged to 3,500; violence surged, too.
 &quot;Needle Park,&quot; as it came to be known, was a place
of open warfare among rival gangs, and even police faced gunfire.
Their cars were attacked and overturned.  In February 1995, officials
ended the experiment, conceding that it had evolved into a grotesque
spectacle.[68]
<P>
In April 1994, the mayors of 21 major European cities formed a
group called &quot;European Cities Against Drugs,&quot; an acknowledgement
that legalization had failed.[69]
<P>
There are some countries, especially in the Middle East, which
extract a high price for drug trafficking.  These countries enjoy
relative freedom from the plague of drug abuse and crime associated
with illicit sales.  This is never mentioned by <I>Legalization</I> proponents.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MYTH #6: LEGALIZATION WOULD LEAD TO HEALTH BENEFITS.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Nadelmann states, &quot;We should immediately decriminalize the
sale and possession of small amounts of marijuana and make it
easily available by prescription to those suffering from cancer,
AIDS, multiple sclerosis and other diseases.&quot;[70] He tells <I>Rolling
Stone</I> readers, &quot;DEA's own administrative law judge Francis
Young declared in 1988, marijuana is possibly Uone of the safest
therapeutically active substances known to man.&quot;[71]
<P>
Arnold S. Trebach, former president of the Drug Policy Foundation,
calls for the medical use of certain illegal drugs.  He claims
there is &quot;no scientific or ethical reason why government
denies heroin and marijuana to people suffering from cancer, glaucoma,
multiple sclerosis, and other diseases.&quot;[72]
<P>
In January 1994 the Clinton Administration decided to review the
federal ban against the use of marijuana for medical purposes.
 Allen St. Pierre, deputy director of the National Organization
for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), commented on the review
decision: &quot;It's encouraging to see that the public health
service is going to get information about the efficacy of marijuana
as a therapeutic agent....  If marijuana can never be made available
to people suffering pain or going blind, it's never going to be
legalized more generally.&quot;[73]
<P>
Legalization advocates cite cases like that of James Burton, who
has glaucoma.  Drug agents seized his home for growing marijuana,
and he now lives in the Netherlands where &quot;I can buy or grow
marijuana here legally, and if I don't have the marijuana, I'll
go blind.&quot;[74]
<P>
Burton has a rare form of low-tension glaucoma.  At Burton's trial,
ophthalmologist Dr. John Merritt testified that Burton needed
marijuana to keep him from going blind.[75] 
<P>
Others claim that marijuana can be used to treat the side-effects
of chemotherapy such as nausea and vomiting and the &quot;wasting&quot;
phenomenon associated with AIDS.
<P>
There is substantial and contradictory evidence indicating that
illicit drugs should not be legalized for medical purposes.  Most
advocates for medical use of illicit drugs only address marijuana.
 Consider the evidence:
<P>
<LI>Philip Lee, Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services,
announced in July 1994, &quot;The scientific evidence doesn't
support using marijuana to treat glaucoma or nausea caused by
AIDS or cancer treatment.&quot;  Harvard medical school professor
Lester Grinspoon has challenged Lee's decision.  Grinspoon said
there is only anecdotal evidence that marijuana smoking is beneficial
because &quot;the government has prevented the scientific studies
for years.&quot;[76]
<P>
<LI>The DEA reports that marijuana is not accepted as medicine by
a single American health association.[77]
<P>
<LI>Dr. David Ettinger, professor of oncology at the Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine, states, &quot;There is no indication
that marijuana is effective in treating nausea and vomiting resulting
from radiation treatment or other causes.&quot;[78]
<P>
<LI>A research review published in the <I>Annals of Pharmacotherapy</I>
found no scientific studies that confirmed the benefit of the
use of crude marijuana on HIV-wasting syndrome.  The use of marijuana
might actually be counter-productive because it poses a needless
and serious endangerment to the already compromised immune systems
of AIDS patients.[79]
<P>
<LI>Two studies in a 1991 book entitled <I>Drugs of Abuse: Immunity
and Immunodeficiency</I> found that the active ingredient in marijuana,
THC, suppresses or interferes with the function of white blood
cells, which fight bacterial infection.[80] Any reduction in the
fighting power of white blood cells could accelerate an HIV-positive
patient's transition to AIDS.  Additionally, marijuana increases
the health risk to AIDS patients because the smoke causes pulmonary
problems.
<P>
<LI>Glaucoma studies found that THC can decrease intraocular pressure.
 However, in order to ingest sufficient THC, the patient would
have to be stoned all day.  Alcohol also decreases intraocular
pressure.  According to Dr. Keith Green, who has served on the
boards of eight eye journals, &quot;Marijuana... has little potential
future as a glaucoma medication.&quot;[81]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MYTH #7: LEGALIZE TO REDUCE ADDICTION RATES.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Mayor Schmoke told the 1993 Drug Policy Foundation conference,
&quot;The United States' war on drugs and similar campaigns in
other countries have failed.  Only a harm reduction policy, led
by public health experts and emphasizing treatment, can be expected
to reduce addiction.&quot;[82]
<P>
Previous efforts to legalize drugs like marijuana saw an increase
in abuse.  The National Families in Action found that during the
decade when 11 states decriminalized marijuana, regular use tripled
among adolescents, doubled among young adults, and quadrupled
among older adults.[83] 
<P>
Today, there are more than 8,000 emergency room visits for marijuana
abuse each year, and 77,000 persons each year are admitted to
treatment programs for marijuana abuse.[84]
<P>
It is alleged that the problem may be worse today because marijuana
is more addictive.  The pro-legalization Lindesmith Institute
challenged this in a recent <I>Wall Street Journal</I> letter.
 &quot;The myth that marijuana is three times as potent [and therefore
more addictive] as it was in the 1970s is based on a statistically
invalid comparison.  The potency of today's marijuana is measured
by a large and diverse number of confiscated marijuana samples.
 The potency of 1970s marijuana was measured by a small and unrepresentative
number of DEA-seized samples.&quot;[85]
<P>
But the DEA cites tests of THC content.  For example, the marijuana
seized at Woodstock '69 had 1 percent THC; in 1974 the average
THC was 3.6 percent; in 1984 it was 4.4 percent; and samples analyzed
in 1992 were 29.86 percent.  Based on these findings, DEA claims
that marijuana may be between 30 and 60 times as potent as were
the joints in the 1960s.[86]
<P>
ONDCP director Lee Brown confirms the addictive nature of marijuana.
 &quot;The public may have grown more blasJ about marijuana over
the years; the marijuana on the streets today is up to 10 times
more potent than that available to teenagers a generation ago.&quot;[87]
<P>
Cocaine is, of course, more addictive than marijuana.  President
William Howard Taft identified cocaine as &quot;[M]ore appalling
in its effects than any other habit-forming drug in the United
States.&quot;  He wanted it banned back in 1910.  And the ranks
of cocaine addicts grew before the substance was outlawed in 1915.[88]
<P>
During the late 1960s, Dr. Marie Nyswander experimented with opiate
addicts at the Rockefeller University, giving them free morphine,
and saw the addicts' daily tolerance for morphine rise swiftly.
 Her partner, Dr. Vincent Dole, commented, &quot;The doses on
which you could keep them comfortable kept going up and up; the
addicts were never really satisfied or happy.  It was not an encouraging
experience.&quot;[89]
<P>
Nyswander noted, &quot;Most drug abusers simply want to get high.
 Because the body daily develops more tolerance for abused drugs,
addicts must use escalating dosages to achieve euphoria.&quot;[90]
<P>
The DEA says that up to 75 percent of crack cocaine users could
become addicts.  And Mitchell Rosenthal believes that cheap and
legal cocaine would increase addiction.  He explains that &quot;given
unlimited access to cocaine, lab animals will consume increasingly
greater amounts until they die....  [He points out that] in the
U.S. there are between 650,000 and 2.4 million cocaine addicts.&quot;[91]
<P>
Dr. Mark Gold, formerly the research director at Fair Oaks Hospital
in Summit, New Jersey, now a professor at the University of Florida
medical school and a recognized expert on cocaine, states, &quot;Whereas
one out of ten alcohol users become alcoholics, one out of four
users of cocaine become addicted.  If, for example, cocaine becomes
legalized and use rose from 6 million to 60 million, this would
mean we would have 15 million addicts in need of treatment, without
prospects for a complete cure, constantly relapsing.&quot;[92]
<P>
Dr. Herbert Kleber of Columbia University suggests that legalizing
cocaine would increase use up to sixfold.  And Joseph A. Califano,
founding president of the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse
at Columbia University, notes that any &quot;stamp of legality&quot;
on cocaine would lead to big increases in the number of addicts
and &quot;light a new flame beneath health care spending.&quot;[93]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MYTH #8: LEGALIZATION IS A CIVIL LIBERTIES ISSUE.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
NORML's Allen St. Pierre states, &quot;If you took the illegality
out, pot wouldn't mean anything to rappers....  [B]ut it's an
injustice they can sing about.&quot;[94]
<P>
Chicago commodities trader Richard Dennis has contributed more
than $1 million to the pro-legalization Drug Policy Foundation.
 He opposes criminal penalties for drug use and states, &quot;It's
a self-evident proposition that people shouldn't go to jail for
things they do to themselves.&quot;[95]
<P>
To legalize behavior is in large measure to condone it.  DEA agent
Wayne Roques visits many high schools in Florida to discuss illicit
drugs.  At every session at least one student defends use of illicit
drugs explaining, &quot;Surgeon General Elders supports legalization.
 So drugs must be okay.&quot;[96]
<P>
Illicit drug use is not a victimless crime because the user, his
family, and society suffer social and economic costs.  For example,
drug use by pregnant mothers causes in utero damage to the child.
 It increases the risk of mortality threefold and the risk of
low birthweight fourfold.  Drug abuse is a key factor in most
child abuse cases.  In Philadelphia, cocaine is implicated in
half of the cases in which parents beat their children to death,
and in 80 percent of all abuse cases.[97]
<P>
In the nation's capital, 90 percent of reported child abusers
are also illicit drug abusers.  In nearby Maryland, one-third
of all car accidents involve drivers who test positive for marijuana.
 And a few years ago, a Conrail disaster took the lives of 16
and hurt another 175, because the train conductors were intoxicated
with illegal drugs.[98] If those drugs were legal, the result would
have been no less lethal to the innocent victims.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
There is no &quot;civil right&quot; to do what is wrong or harmful
to yourself, your family, or your society.  
<P>
The facts show that legalization is a mistake for America because:
<P>
<LI>Illegal drugs are more addictive and dangerous than the legal
drugs alcohol and tobacco, which is verified by thousands of scientific
studies.  
<P>
<LI>Legalization would result in more crime such as driving while
intoxicated; child abuse, including child pornography; random
violent crime; and a prosperous black market.
<P>
<LI>Legalization has no economic justification.  Taxing illicit
drugs would offset only a small fraction of the social costs.
<P>
<LI>Banning illicit drugs is not like alcohol &quot;Prohibition.&quot;
 Drug laws reduce abuse and the medical costs associated with
abuse.  Legalization would do the opposite.
<P>
<LI>Other nations have learned that liberalizing drug policies only
leads to more addicts and unacceptable social consequences.  
<P>
<LI>Illicit drugs offer no offsetting health benefits.  Rather,
marijuana damages most major body systems and provides minimal
help for glaucoma victims and only when they are constantly stoned.
<P>
<LI>Cocaine is far more addictive than alcohol, and marijuana is
at least 10 times more potent today than a generation ago.

Drug abuse among teenagers has risen significantly in recent years.
 A nationwide survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)
in 1994 found that annual marijuana use among 8th graders rose
from 6.2 percent in 1991 to 13 percent in 1994.  The trend is
also evident among 10th (16.5 percent to 30.4 percent) and 12th
(36.7 percent to 38.2 percent) graders.  And cocaine, crack, heroin,
and LSD use among teenagers is also rising and may soon rival
the high rates of the 1970s.[1]
<P>
The NIDA found that drug-related emergency room cases increased
eight percent from 1992 to 1993.[2] Cocaine-related hospital emergency
room visits grew from 101,200 in 1991 to 119,800 in 1992; during
the same period, heroin-related emergencies soared from 35,900
to 48,000.[3]
<P>
In one study of reckless drivers who were not obviously drunk
from alcohol, 59 percent tested positive for cocaine or marijuana[4]
and thirty-five percent of all automobile accident victims in
another study had detectable levels of marijuana in their blood.[5]
<P>
The biggest rise is in marijuana abuse, possibly because it is
perceived differently from the &quot;hard&quot; drugs.  Although
some young people don't even consider marijuana a &quot;drug,&quot;
Dr. Carlton Turner, former NIDA director and head of the Marijuana
Research Project at the University of Mississippi, warns, &quot;There
is no other drug used or abused by man that has the staying power
and broad cellular actions on the body that cannabis [marijuana]
does.&quot;[6]
<P>
The short-term effects of marijuana include impairment in learning
and memory, perception, judgment and complex motor skills.  It
can cause difficulty in speaking, listening effectively, thinking,
retaining knowledge, problem-solving, and forming concepts.[7]
<P>
These effects can translate into poor job performance.  An article
in the <I>Journal of the American Medical Association</I> found
that marijuana users had &quot;55 percent more industrial accidents,
85 percent more injuries and a 78 percent increase in absenteeism.&quot;[8]
<P>
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala states, &quot;Young
people 
must understand that there is clear scientific evidence that marijuana
is a dangerous drug that can have acute and hazardous effects.&quot;[9]
 Over 10,500 published scientific papers show that marijuana damages
brain cells, the lungs, may adversely affect reproduction in women
and fertility in men, endangers the unborn baby and newborns of
pot-smoking women, and could damage the heart.[10] 
<P>
Shalala calls for &quot;strong and comprehensive solutions....Young
people must grow up knowing unambiguously that drug use -- including
smoking marijuana -- is unwise, unhealthful, illegal and wrong.
 They must hear this from everyone in their communities -- their
parents, their teachers, their employers, their peers, the media
-- all of us.  We need anti-drug messages that are every bit as
pervasive and strong as the pop culture images that tell our youth
drugs are o.k.&quot;[11]
<P>
Dr. Lloyd Johnson, lead researcher for NIDA's 20th annual survey,
says the aggressive anti-drug messages of the 1980s have receded
into the background.  &quot;If the softening of attitudes...continues
unabated, we can expect to see continued increases in drug use
among our children.&quot;[12] 
<P>
Dr. Johnson blames the culture.  &quot;The arduously woven fabric
of attitudes, beliefs and peer norms which brought about that
decline (in the 1980s) is beginning to unravel....  Conversely,
we're seeing drug abuse, and specifically marijuana use, talked
about positively in rock and rap music, in television programming
and in other areas like fashion.&quot;[13]
<P>
The consequences of unabated illicit drug use go beyond those
already outlined.  For example, illicit drug use correlates with
crime.  The Bureau of Justice Statistics found that 32 percent
of inmates have used cocaine and half had used drugs in the month
before their offense.  Seventy-five percent reported having used
marijuana in the past.[14]
<P>
Drugs numb the conscience and lower inhibitions.  They contribute
to mood disorders and depression and low self esteem.  A high
proportion of cocaine users admit the drug makes them feel violent
at times.
<P>
Consider some recent examples of youth violence that involved
drug abuse.
<P>
<LI>Five Dodge City, Kansas teenagers, high on marijuana,
killed a stranger for no obvious reason.[15]
<P>
<LI>Three West Palm Beach, Florida teenagers mixed beer,
rum, marijuana and cocaine and then kidnapped and set ablaze a
tourist from Brooklyn.[16]
<P>
<LI>A New Scandia Township, Minnesota teen shot his mother
and stepfather to death.  He admitted to almost daily abuse of
marijuana.[17]
<P>
<LI>Two Miami, Florida teenagers were smoking marijuana
when one accidentally shot and killed the other.[18]
<P>
Social scientists confirm the relationship between drug use and
juvenile deliquency.  A 1990 study published in the <I>Journal
of Drug Issues</I> found the strongest association between the
severity of the crime and the type of substance used -- the more
intoxicating the substance, the more serious the incident.[19]
<P>
A study in <I>Today's Delinquent</I> found alcohol and marijuana
users commit twice the number of delinquent acts as non-users,
and a study in <I>Adolescence</I> found that half of all polydrug
users had engaged in delinquent acts.[20]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>THE CULTURE'S PRO-DRUG INFLUENCE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Evidence of &quot;drug glorification&quot; in the culture is pervasive.[21]
<P>
Maureen Ketchum, executive director of the Youth Leadership Institute
in San Francisco, states, &quot;Some young people see that to
be hip, sexy, cool they have to drink, party and take drugs....Pop
culture is a factor and young people emulate what is put out there
to emulate.  The industry creates the norm and people live up
to it.&quot;[22]
<P>
Phil Salzman, director of the Gloucester [Massachusetts] Prevention
Network, which works with teenagers in school, writes, &quot;The
power of being accepted and wanting to be normal is a lot stronger
than the truth in the antidrug message....If there is a party
with beer, pot and 60 kids, the norm is determined by the majority
behavior.&quot;[23]
<P>
&quot;Woodstock '94&quot; shows that the sex-drug-rock counterculture
of the 1960s is not dead.  It was temporarily stalled in the 1980s
when the Reagan administration, activists and citizen groups mobilized
against it.  But youth drug use has not disappeared.  And glamorization
of drug use in the industry appears to be on the rise.  Consider
the evidence.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>DRUGS ARE A MAINSTAY IN ROCK AND RAP MUSIC</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML)
has counted 45 music groups that have declared their support for
legalizing marijuana.[24] Here is a profile of some of the pro-drug
groups.  
<P>
<LI>The Black Crowes often unfurl a 48 x 24 foot curtain
bearing a marijuana leaf and the words &quot;Free Us&quot; at
their shows and sell rolling paper for marijuana cigarettes on
the side.[25] They wear trousers covered with images of cannabis
leaves.  Lead singer Chris Robinson told rock magazine <I>High
Times</I>, &quot;We did 350 shows, smoked every night and never
got busted.&quot;  He explains, &quot;Pot's got nothing to be
taboo about, man.  It's part of pop culture.&quot;[26] 
<P>
<LI>Cypress Hill, a rap group, cites the history of marijuana
on the inside cover of its compact disc, &quot;Black Sunday.&quot;
 That disc includes the songs &quot;Legalize It,&quot; &quot;I
Wanna Get High,&quot; &quot;Stoned Is the Way of the Walk,&quot;
and &quot;Light Another.&quot;  Group member Sen Dog states, &quot;We
made it popular to be into the blunt,&quot; which refers to the
trendy practice of smoking a hollowed-out Philly Blunt cigar packed
with marijuana.  Their 1993 album has sold more than a million
copies and included the hit single, &quot;Insane in the Membrane.&quot;[27]
<P>
<LI>Tom Petty's double platinum album &quot;Wildflowers&quot;
includes &quot;You Don't Know How It Feels,&quot; which has the
line, &quot;But let's get to the point, let's roll another joint.&quot;
 Another song on the same album, &quot;It's Good to Be King,&quot;
includes the line, &quot;It's good to get high and never come
down.&quot;  And Petty's non-album track titled, &quot;Girl on
LSD,&quot; has the following lyrics, &quot;Through ecstasy, crystal
methane glue, I've found no drug compares to you.... I was in
love with a girl on LSD.&quot;
<P>
<LI>Green Day's album, &quot;Dookie,&quot; which has sold
more than five million copies, includes songs like &quot;Basket
Case,&quot; with the lyrics, &quot;I think I'm cracking up.  Am
I just paranoid?  I'm just stoned.&quot;  Green Day bassist Mike
Dirnt told <I>Rolling Stone</I>, &quot;I think drinking and doing
drugs are very important.... [He comments on a recent concert.]
 I was flying on acid so hard, I was laying up against the wall
with my bass lying on my lap.&quot;  Tre Cool, Green Day's drummer,
said, &quot;When people bring weed to our shows, that's wonderful.
 I'm the guinea pig.  If somebody throws a bag of weed onstage,
Billie will watch to make sure we don't get all [expletive deleted]
on it, but I dive right in.&quot;  Billie Joe Armstrong concludes,
&quot;...Tre really likes pot -- but the main thing of choice
was speed.  People think that we're this big pot-smoking band
even though we sound like an amphetamine band, but I dabbled a
lot in speed for a long time.  That was the drug of choice on
the scene I came from.&quot;  The band, originally named Sweet
Children, renamed itself in 1989 &quot;after one of its songs
about hanging out and smoking pot.&quot; [28]
<P>
<LI>Nine Inch Nails' album, &quot;The Downward Spiral,&quot;
includes &quot;My Self Destruct&quot; with the lyrics, &quot;I
am the needle in your vein and I control you, I am the high you
can't sustain and I control you.&quot;  &quot;Hurt&quot; has the
following lyric, &quot;The needle tears a hole, the old familiar
sting, try to kill it all away.&quot;  &quot;Hurt&quot; explores
drugs as a means of escape.  Lead singer, Trent Reznor, was voted
<I>Spin</I> magazine's &quot;Best Artist&quot; for 1995, and Nine
Inch Nails was voted the &quot;Best Metal Band&quot; in 1995 by
<I>Rolling Stone</I> readers.  
<P>
<LI>Time Warner distributes an album by rapper Dr. Dre
titled, &quot;The Chronic,&quot; a slang term for a potent strain
of marijuana.  The cover features marijuana leaves.  The album
peaked at number two on the Billboard charts, stayed in the top
10 for eight months, and has sold more than three million copies.
<P>
<LI>The Beastie Boys' latest album, &quot;Ill Communications,&quot;
includes a pro-pot song, &quot;Legalize the weed, and I'll say,
'Thank heavens.'&quot;  The Beastie Boys were declared &quot;Best
Rappers&quot; by <I>Spin</I> and <I>Rolling Stone</I> magazines
for 1995.
<P>
<LI>Snoop Doggy Dogg's album &quot;Doggystyle,&quot; includes
a rap, &quot;Bathtub,&quot; which states, &quot;You can smoke
a pound of bud [marijuana] every day...That's the American dream&quot;
and another, &quot;Gin and Juice,&quot; which states, &quot;Rolling
down the street smoking indo [Indonesian marijuana], sippin' on
gin and juice,&quot; and a third, &quot;Tha Shiznit,&quot; which
states, &quot;I gotta fat bud, sack full of chronic in my back
pocket...Need myself a lighter so I can take a smoke.  I smoke
every day.&quot;  Snoop Doggy Dogg was arrested on December 21,
1994 in Lake Charles, LA, for possession of marijuana and drug
paraphernalia.  He was named by <I>Rolling Stone</I> as &quot;Best
Rap Group&quot; for 1995.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>DRUG MUSIC'S IMPACT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Parent's Music Resource Center reports that teens listen to
an estimated 10,500 hours of rock music between the seventh and
12th grades alone -- just 500 hours less than the total time they
spend in school over 12 years.  Typical estimates are that the
standard teen listens to rock music four to six hours each day.[29]
<P>
Dr. Joseph Stuessey, professor of music history at the University
of Texas, told the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee that, &quot;Music
affects behavior.  This simple fact has been known intuitively
for centuries.... In the 20th century, especially in the last
four decades, tons of research has been done on the interrelationship
of music and human behavior.... It affects our moods, our attitudes,
our emotions, and our behavior.  It affects us psychologically
and physiologically.&quot;[30]
<P>
Child and adolescent psychiatrist Dr. Robert Demski identifies
music as one of the most powerful influences on youth.[31]
<P>
Dr. Sheila Davis, a professor of lyric writing at New York University,
states that songs &quot;are more than mere mirrors of society;
they are a potent force in the shaping of it....[P]opular songs...provide
the primary `equipment for living' for America's youth.&quot;[32]
<P>
Child psychologist Dr. David Elkind writes in <I>The Hurried Child,</I>
&quot;Music can influence young people as much as any visual media.&quot;[33]
<P>
Pharmacologist Dr. Avram Goldstein of Stanford University writes
in <I>Physiological Psychology</I> that for 96 percent of the
respondents in his study, their biggest thrills came from music.[34]
<P>
Dr. Paul King, medical director of the adolescent program at Charter
Lakeside Hospital in Memphis, warns that &quot;80 percent of the
teenagers he treats have listened to heavy metal rock several
hours a day.&quot;[35]
<P>
<H3><CENTER>MTV'S TREATMENT OF ILLICIT DRUG USE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Dennis Cooper writes in the March 1995 edition of <I>Spin</I>,
a rock music magazine, that pro-drug visual images are especially
provoking.  He explains, &quot;Just the mention of the word
'heroin' in a lyric, or a photograph of a hypodermic
on a CD cover, or the sight of junkie musicians all wrapped up
in some glamorous video, and they [recovering addicts] go crazy
with longing for the stuff.&quot;[36]
<P>
Researchers have found that the marriage between television and
music is powerful.&quot;  The video clarifies the meaning of a
song.[37] MTV's meteoric rise in popularity evidences the power.
 According to the authors of <I>Dancing in the Dark</I>, an eleven-month
study of the growing, changing, and powerful influence of music
and media on youth, music television is &quot;one of the most
powerful forms of contemporary propaganda.&quot;[38]
<P>
MTV founder Robert Pittman explains music television's impact
on youth:  &quot;We're dealing with a culture of TV babies.  They
can watch, do their homework, and listen to music all at the same
time.... At MTV we don't shoot for the fourteen year olds, we
own them.&quot;[39]
<P>
Author Donna Gaines explains, &quot;With MTV, drug use has just
taken on the status of a commodity.&quot;[40] Video director Samuel
Bayer disagrees.  He gives MTV more credit: &quot;I grew up in
the '70s, when there were drug references all over the place....
Kids are smart enough to read between the lines.  Something like
Kurt Cobain dying -- that's what happens when your life is [expletive
deleted].  If anything, videos have the opposite effect.&quot;[41]
<P>
MTV has a drug policy.  Carole Robinson, a senior vice president
at MTV, says that her network does not &quot;promote, glamorize,
or show as socially acceptable the use of illegal drugs or the
abuse of legal drugs.&quot;[42] But Cooper points out, &quot;You
don't need a degree in deconstruction to see the signs of drugginess
all over MTV, whether it's Alice in Chains' elegant little travelogues
of junkie life, or Ministry's 'Just One Fix' clip, in which heroin
withdrawal is given a snazzy, action-packed movie-trailer look,
or even Tori Amos's clip for 'God,' in which a character simulates
'tying off.'  If kids are smart enough to know what's fiction
and what's not, then they are smart enough to decode these kinds
of messages too.&quot;[43]
<P>
Cooper compares MTV's drug policy to a makeup artist's covering
of crow's-feet on an aging actress.  &quot;Pot leaves, pills,
and hypodermic needles are successfully smudged beyond recognition,
but the subtleties remain.&quot;[44]
<P>
MTV and Black Entertainment Television (BET) digitally blur images
of marijuana leaves and names in music videos, such as Dr. Dre's
&quot;Nothing but a G Thang&quot; which features men wearing baseball
caps emblazoned with marijuana leaves.[45] A former member of several
prominent alternative rock bands told Cooper, &quot;I can't even
watch MTV anymore, it's so full of junkies.  I can spot them in
an instant, and I feel like they're calling to me from this terrible
and fascinating place in my past.&quot;[46]
<P>
MTV aired a pro-drug program, &quot;Straight Dope&quot; on August
27, 1994.  Host Kurt Loder introduces the program stating, &quot;We
are going to spend the next hour taking a very close look at drugs,
what they are, what they do to people who use them, and how well
or poorly official government prohibition, the eight-year long
war on drugs, has worked.&quot;
<P>
A teen on the program says, &quot;It's not like I'm trying to
commit suicide or anything -- it's no worse than drinking coffee,
smoking a cigarette, drinking a beer, or taking a shot of tequila.&quot;
<P>
Loder portrays some drug users as rational, everyday people who
are minimally affected by the illicit substances.  The three-part
film was publicized for public school use by &quot;MTV Community
of the Future&quot; and is endorsed by the National Education
Association.  MTV offers &quot;teacher support material&quot;
to help with classroom discussions.[47]
<P>
<H3><CENTER>YOUTH PRINT MEDIA ENCOURAGE ILLICIT DRUG USE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The May 5, 1994 edition of <I>Rolling Stone</I> is headlined,
&quot;Drugs in America:  The Phony War, the Real Crisis.&quot;
 The magazine is devoted to a pro-drug message.
<P>
The March 1995 edition of <I>Details</I>, a pop culture magazine,
includes an article about the Sativa Hemp Store in San Marcos,
Texas, which stamps dollar bills with the words &quot;I grew hemp&quot;
coming out of George Washington's mouth.  The first president
grew rope hemp at his Northern Virginia estate, Mount Vernon.
 &quot;Hemp activists say the stamp helps to draw attention to
the utility -- and former respectability -- of the plant.&quot;[48]
<P>
Drug advertisements are in many metal, rap and hip hop magazines.
 The college edition of <I>Rolling Stone</I> recently included
an invitation to join NORML which states, &quot;Every 2 minutes,
another American is arrested on marijuana charges.  You could
be next!&quot;[49] Another ad solicits for a bumpersticker, &quot;There's
no hope -- let's do dope.&quot;  <I>Rolling Stone's</I> December,
1994 Double Issue (December 29, 1994 to January 12, 1995) advertises
a &quot;Genuine Ostrich Egg&quot; with a marijuana leaf and the
words &quot;Get High Tonight&quot; emblazoned on the egg.[50] 
<P>
<I>Q</I> magazine's February 1995 edition contains an ad, &quot;Grow
Yer' Own, The Home-Gro Company, Everything You Need to Grow the
Best!!!&quot; [51] February, 1995's <I>Relix</I> advertises for &quot;Indoor
Grow Lights&quot; and adds the bold statement, &quot;We sell lights
<B>that's all we do</B> just mail order, just lights!&quot;[52]
<P>
The same edition of <I>Relix</I> includes a very sympathetic article
entitled &quot;Families Against Mandatory Minimums.&quot;[53] FAMM
president Julie Stewart's brother is serving a five-year term
for cultivation of marijuana.  She accuses the Drug Enforcement
Agency of preying on naive Grateful Dead fans.  &quot;They are
not serious professional drug dealers and so they don't expect
the person who they're selling drugs to, to be an undercover agent.&quot;[54]
 Stewart makes her case by stating, &quot;[T]he drug offenders
are actually pushing violent offenders out of prison because the
violent offenders do not have a mandatory minimum time that they
have to serve.&quot;[55]
<P>
<I>Relix</I> includes a section inviting readers to write to &quot;Incarcerated
Deadheads.&quot;[56] Although the section does not list their convictions,
a personal ad reads, &quot;Help!  In April of 1986 I was arrested
at Irvine Meadows for possession.&quot;[57]
<P>
&quot;Friday at Four&quot; is an America Online interactive computer
talk show with special guests.  It recently hosted Yale law professor
Steven Duke, who taught President Clinton and is the pro-drug
author of <I>America's Longest War: Rethinking Our Tragic Crusade
Against Drugs</I>.  
<P>
Duke responded to questions about drugs.  He said that banned
drugs should be legalized &quot;Absolutely, without a doubt, immediately!&quot;
 He favors lifting the ban on &quot;marijuana, opiates (heroin
and morphine) and cocaine, including crack.&quot;  He also promoted
needle exchanges.  He explained, &quot;I think drug prohibition
causes half of our serious crime....Our biggest problem, worst
drug problem is the tobacco problem.  Legalizing drugs will reduce
the use of alcohol, which is far more damaging than any popular
illegal drug.&quot;[58]
<P>
Even the popular &quot;Dear Abby&quot; syndicated advice column
has gone pro-drug.  Abigail Van Buren recently wrote in favor
of legalization.  She wrote, &quot;The legalization of drugs would
put drug dealers out of business.&quot;[59]
<P>
<H3><CENTER>CALLING ALL PARENTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Government leaders and scientists recognize that curbing drug
abuse requires positive prevention programs, messages to counter
the pro-drug cultural bent, strong enforcement, and involved parents.
<P>
Joseph Podgorski, a principal of Amherst Central High School near
Buffalo, New York, faults parental naivete for teen drug abuse.
 &quot;There is certainly a lot of drinking going on, especially
on the weekends, and I'm sure there is casual drug use...The biggest
problem is trying to get kids' parents to admit that their kids
have a problem.  A lot of it is just not wanting to deal with
it.&quot;[60]
<P>
Numerous studies show that parents can make the difference for
children faced with peer and cultural pressures to take illicit
drugs.  For example, a study in the <I>Journal of Children in
Contemporary Society</I> found that childhood predictors of adolescent
substance abuse include: family history of drug abuse, family
management and discipline styles, family communication patterns,
and the child's own early use of the gateway drugs.[61]
<P>
A 1985 NIDA study of the use of illegal drugs among children states
that &quot;traditionality, family intactness, self-awareness,
monitoring, and firmness&quot; are parental traits found in the
families of drug-free children.[62]
<P>
A 1990 study in the <I>Journal of Youth and Adolescents</I> considered
peer versus parental influence for substance use.  It found that
parents are the most influential people in the teenager's life,
both for drug users (63.2 percent) and abstainers (79.1 percent).
 Abstaining teens still go to their parents first (66 percent)
when problems arise.  However, drug-using teens tend to go to
friends more often with their problems.[63]
<P>
There are conflicting studies which found that friends and peers
have replaced parents as the greatest influencers of teen values.
 And for the 1990s quite possibly the media will emerge as dominant.
 <I>Dancing in the Dark</I> warns, &quot;Youth...need the media
for guidance and nurture in a society where other social institutions,
such as the family and the school, do not shape the youth culture
as powerfully as they once did.&quot;[64]
<P>
<H3><CENTER>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Lois Haight chaired a 1988 White House Conference
on a Drug-Free America.  She heard from 1,000 recovering addicts
who unanimously gave the same heartfelt message, &quot;Make it
difficult, very difficult to use [illicit drugs], because if you
don't, the lure and seductiveness of the 'high' will prevail.&quot;[65]
<P>
Youth attitudes and behaviors have changed with regard to the
threat associated with illicit drugs.  Although the culture has
increasingly embraced pro-drug messages, concerned citizens can
effectively counter these negative influences by educating themselves
to the threat and exercising their responsibility to listen and
lovingly guide children to &quot;Just Say No&quot; to drugs.

<h3>Russell Amos Kirk</h3><br>
<b>1918-1994</b><br></center>
<p>
"For more than forty years, Russell Kirk was the conscience of the conservative movement. As a scholar, essayist, lecturer, and critic, he saw contemporary political events against the backdrop of history, philosophy, and literature -- subjects in which his background was astonishingly thorough. Following the publication of his masterful <I>The Conservative Mind</i>, Dr. Kirk watched the conservative intellectual revival develop around him until his solitary cause of the early 1950s became the dominant trend of the 1980s. As much as any other living American, Russell Kirk was responsible for the growth of that movement. His works have given the conservative movement sage guidance in its efforts to redeem the time and champion the permanent things."

<P>
Our friend Russell Kirk, &quot;The Wizard of Mecosta,&quot; seemed
an ill-suited visitor to Washington back in 1978. He was accompanied
by his loving wife Annette, and he shared with a packed auditorium
some of the truths that made his published works so powerful and
so influential.
<P>
Then sixty years old, Russell Kirk was not a newcomer to Washington,
and yet he was certainly not a part of this unreal, political
place.
<P>
Despite his visits here in subsequent years, Russell Kirk was
always more comfortable surrounded by his family and his books
in Mecosta. He was at home among inquisitive students on one of
the college campuses where he held visiting appointments or where
he lectured.
<P>
Despite his discomfort, however, he made a real impact on Washington.
In a city of constant change, Kirk reminded opinion leaders, journalists,
legislators and staffers of prudence and of taking the long view.
<P>
It was at an I.S.I.-sponsored seminar, more than thirty years
ago over the Christmas holidays, that I first met Dr. Kirk. He
was already a fixed star in the conservative firmament. Although
he has described himself in those days as &quot;roly-poly and
benign,&quot; all of us students were in awe of him.
<P>
Had we known that he was an occasional eater of beaver and an
habitual smoker of &quot;dark, thick,&quot; Burmese cigars, &quot;looking
and tasting . . . Like torpedoes,&quot; we probably would have
addressed him with even greater trepidation. Yet, as he talked
with a small group of us on that frosty night in Detroit I could
not project that twenty years later Russell Kirk would be a Heritage
Distinguished Fellow and that three of his books would be based
on lectures that he first delivered here.
<P>
Over the years, Russell's Washington lecture themes would include
natural law, the prospects for conservatives, and individual rights.
They are masterpieces of clear thought and eternal truth.
<P>
These volumes and his other works mean that Russell Kirk's influence
in Washington will continue to be far greater than many
of the transient politicians who descend upon this city, cycle
after cycle.
<P>
As a back row observer at his soirees for the last sixteen years,
I never ceased to be amazed by the inevitable overflow crowd of
young people who couldn't get enough of him.
<P>
I asked one of them what his hold was on them. Her reply: &quot;I
had only admired him from afar and, of course, reading his books
at my university was not politically correct.&quot; Or, as a young
Reagan appointee said, &quot;He taught us all why our role was
important beyond ourselves and beyond politics.&quot;
<P>
Russell Kirk's operating guide was prudence and what Patrick Henry
called &quot;the lamp of experience,&quot; which abhorred all
forms of ideology claiming some instant substitute for genuine
tradition, custom, and experience.
<P>
He often described himself as a &quot;Bohemian Tory.&quot; A Bohemian
Tory who adapted to his environment, whether this meant a humble
cellar, a rustic cabin, a city mansion, or one of the great country
houses of Europe.
<P>
From time to time here in Washington, Russell was entertained,
feted, or downright idolized. While he seemed to enjoy this, his
heart belonged to Mecosta.
<P>
Russell Kirk has left an indelible mark on us, on Washington,
and on our nation. Perhaps his words have more meaning for us
today because, as one of his friends, T.S. Eliot puts it:
<P>
&quot;The communication of the dead is tongued with fire beyond
the language of the living.&quot;<A NAME="gleaves"></A>
<P>
<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Gleaves Whitney<BR>
on behalf of <BR>
The Honorable John Engler, Governor of Michigan</CENTER></b>
<p>
 Russell
Kirk once wrote: &quot;Men are put into this world . . . to struggle,
to suffer, to contend against the evil that is in their neighbors
and in themselves, and to aspire toward the triumph of Love. They
are put into this world to live like men and to die like men.&quot;
<P>
By his own measure, Russell Kirk lived a robust and manly life,
and he died a noble and manly death.
<P>
Let it be said at the outset--without hesitation and without qualification--Russell
Kirk was a great man. His work will stand as one of the most significant
intellectual achievements of our time. That is because he understood
our time. Before his most famous book, <i>The Conservative Mind</i>,
was accepted for publication, Russell Kirk wrote a letter to Henry
Regnery, saying: This work is &quot;my contribution to our endeavor
to conserve the spiritual and intellectual and political tradition
of our civilization; and if we a e to rescue the modem mind we
must do it very soon . . .The struggle will be decided in the
minds of the rising generation.&quot;
<P>
There can be no doubt that Russell Kirk reached many minds-- and
touched many hearts--over the last four decades. His words coursed
over the continents and across the generations. He touched us
not just because of what he said, but how he said it. This &quot;Bohemian
Tory,&quot; this &quot;Canny Scot,&quot; possessed an excellent
ear for the language, and his readers felt all the force of his
personality in his prose.
<P>
And then there were the many personal qualities that endeared
Russell Kirk to us. He was a loyal friend and a faithful correspondent.
Who could forget his keen wit, those fantastic ghost stories,
and that mischievous twinkle in his eyes? He was devoted to his
family--a wonderful family so many of us have come to know: his
lovely wife Annette, their four beautiful daughters, his sons-in-law,
and the larger family. For years they have opened their arms to
us, as today we open our arms to them.
<P>
Russell Kirk had an uncommonly generous spirit--a spirit that
never flagged, but gave tirelessly. It is evident in his letters
and lectures, his books and conversation. Weakened though he was
toward the end of his life, Dr. Kirk's last public gesture was
to sign books from his bed, because he knew how much that would
mean to his readers
and friends. The last book he signed, just a week before his passing,
vas to Governor Engler.
<P>
Russell Kirk was very much a Michigan man--one of us. We can imagine
him as a young boy, reading historical adventures by the train
yards in Plymouth where his father worked. We can think of him
as a gifted teacher at his alma mater, Michigan State. We can
see him walking out of that drafty old library at Piety Hill and
turning down the road which leads to the woods.
<P>
Russell loved Michigan. Recently his heart made its final journey
back to the &quot;stump country&quot; that he called his ancestral
home, to return to the land that shaped him. But his spirit now
knows its true and eternal home. And the wisdom in his writings
will remain to help those of us still on this earthly pilgrimage.
Indeed, for generations to come, his words will find a resting
place wherever there is right reason, and wherever there is a
heart in search of the Permanent Things.
<P>
Today we mourn. We have lost a friend. Michigan has lost its preeminent
man of letter. America has lost one of the men who understood
her best. We mourn, but Russell would not want us to become too
melancholy this day. In the epilogue of his memoirs, which he
recently composed and which will be published next year, Russell
Kirk tells us that he lived a good life. At the age of seventy-five,
he says that what he sought in life had come down to three things.
<P>
First, he had sought to defend the Permanent Things -- truth, justice,
freedom, a tolerable moral order and in so doing he was more successful
than he thought would be possible at the outset of his career.
<P>
Second, he had sought to lead a life of decent independence, living
much as his ancestors had lived, on their land, in circumstances
that would enable him to utter the truth and make his voice heard:
a life uncluttered and unpolluted, not devoted to getting and
spending. This, he tells us, he had achieved as a man of letters
at Piety Hill.
<P>
Third, he had sought to marry for love and to rear children who
would come to know that the service of God is perfect freedom.
Words cannot express how filled with gratitude he was for Annette
and his children, who are endowed with the unbought grace of life.
In this, too, he had been wonderfully blessed.
<P>
To Russell Kirk, the three goals of his life had been reached,
and he was grateful. And we who are here today can be grateful
that we knew him, and that he walked a little distance with us
in our journey to our eternal home.<A NAME="pat"></A>
<P>
<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Pat Buchanan<BR>
Founder and Chairman <BR>
The American Cause</CENTER></b><p> We are here today to mourn the passing
of a wonderful friend, and to celebrate a great life, that of
Dr. Russell Kirk, Patriarch of Piety Hill, Sage of Mecosta, gentle
giant of American conservatism. And, I am proud and honored to
add, leader of the Buchanan Brigades in the Michigan primary of
'92.
<P>
In 1953, when Dr. Kirk's seminal work, The Conservative Mind,
appeared In a desert of liberal orthodoxy, it was celebrated,
not only here but across the West. For the wise men of the age
were aware something new had been born, a genuine conservative
movement, and Russell Kirk was its father. His was the spark that
set fire to the minds of so many of my generation.
<P>
For forty years, Dr. Kirk wrote his columns and commentaries,
essays, and stories, books and reviews- a treasure house of work
that now becomes part of the deposit of faith--of the cause in
which we believe. And his books will be read and reread and cherished,
when most of what his contemporaries published is long since forgotten.
Why?
<P>
Because Russell Kirk wrote not only for his time, but for all
time. He was the custodian, the caretaker of &quot;The Permanent
Things&quot;, the eternal truths that do not change. All his life
he wielded his pen to expose the false gods of modernity, and
in particular, the false god of ideology.
<P>
To Dr. Kirk, ideology, whether of Left or Right, was something
that took possession of a soul that was empty. &quot;Ideology,&quot;
he wrote, &quot;provides sham religion . . . comforting in its
way to those who have lost or never have known genuine religious
faith.&quot;
<P>
When Dr. Kirk discovered this heresy in the camp of the saints,
he used a needle to winkle it out. A few years back when the ideology
of democracy was being exalted to the status of high dogma, he
wrote, &quot;A trouble with this civil-religion notion is that
the large majority of Americans think they already have a religion
of their own, not one cobbled up by some department in Washington.&quot;
<P>
When some great minds arose in our midst to declare The End of
History, Dr. Kirk merrily laughed. Because he knew more history
than all of them put together; and because he knew that the seedbed
of conflicts and war lay in the human heart, which is unchanged
and unchanging, save through grace.
<P>
As the presence here today of Russell Kirk's wife and four daughters
so beautifully testifies, Russell Kirk did not simply preach the
values of family and faith, he lived them. He not only wrote of
the search for truth, he persevered all his life; and when he
came upon the truth in the Roman Catholic Church, Russell Kirk
embraced it. This was a man, whole and entire, whose hierarchy
of values were in perfect order and synchronization, as are the
planets in God's heaven that circle the sun. And because his values
were in harmony, Dr. Kirk was one off the most genuinely, visibly
happy men I have ever met.
<P>
I recall the last time we met, in Philadelphia near midnight for
a drink after a speech; Annette and Dr. Kirk invited me out to
Piety Hill, to see the library in which he took such joy.
<P>
And, upon occasion, Dr. Kirk would undertake my instruction.
<P>
After listening to me propound the latest economic nostrum for
America's ills, this gentle teacher sent me a slim book that contained
his own introduction: &quot;I have regarded with some suspicion
many practitioners of the Dismal Science,&quot; Dr. Kirk had written.
&quot;I have found economists a blindered breed, worshipping the
false god, Efficiency.&quot;
<P>
Dr. Kirk believed in a market economy, but all his life he fought
this Cult of Efficiency--because it dehumanized man; and because
he knew there is a higher order of things in God's universe, ruled
by a law higher even than the law of supply and demand.
<P>
If today a man should ask me what is conservatism, I would tell
him: Read Russell Kirk. He endures; he speaks to the ages of what
it means to be one of us.
<P>
If there is an image I will carry with me all my days of Dr. Kirk,
it is the image of the loving father of the Prodigal Son, the
father who; nightly, walks to the edge of his estate to look to
the horizon to see if his wandering boy is ever coming home again.
And when the son appears, disheveled, having squandered his patrimony
chasing after the fads and follies of the age, the gentle father,
never reproachful, rejoices to take his son back home.
<P>
He was that--to us.
<P>
&quot;Men are put into this world . . . to struggle, to suffer,
to contend against the evil that is in their neighbors, and in
themselves, and to aspire toward the triumph of Love,&quot; Russell
Kirk wrote forty years ago. &quot;They are put in this world to
live like men and to die like men.&quot;
<P>
A brave man all his life, Russell Kirk died like a man, passing
away in the arms of the wife and daughters he loved. <i>Ave atque vale</i>,
my friend.<A NAME="russell"></A>
<P>
<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Russell Hittinger<BR>
Professor, Department of Philosophy <BR>
The Catholic University of America</b></CENTER><p> In <i>The Roots of American
Order</i>, Russell wrote: &quot;Whatever America's incertitudes today,
it is difficult to find American citizens who can sketch any convincing
ideal new order as an alternative to the one long rooted here.&quot;
This sentence was aimed particularly at the malcontents of the
1960s. But it might just as well have been aimed at all of us;
especially those of us who work in universities, think tanks,
and newspapers. Who among us knows so much as to offer the prospect
of any &quot;convincing&quot; alternative to an order long rooted
in the experience of a people? Our answer to this question will
determine how we understand the word &quot;conservative.&quot;</B>
<P>
We know how Russell Kirk answered the question. To his eternal
credit, he did not impart to this movement the name &quot;Kirkianism.&quot;
When he wrote <i>The Conservative Mind</i>, he certainly did not suggest
that the &quot;mind&quot; was his own. The whole point of the
book was to have the reader draw quite the opposite conclusion.
The permanent things are not known by merely one mind or party;
thanks to the gift of culture, they are known by many minds. Whether
we speak of culture in its moral and religious sense, or culture
in terms of liberty and economic markets, the conservative believes
that the kind of social order worth living in most certainly is
not something vouchsafed exclusively to a privileged class of
theorists.
<P>
Russell Kirk kept a distance, both spiritual and geographical,
from the institutions of the elite. He did most of his thinking
and writing outside of the academy. While it seems at least paradoxical
to say this about a conservative, he needed no institutional credentials
to certify his ideas. It was enough for him to call upon the authority
Cicero, Burke, and John Randolph of Roanoke. He certainly kept
a distance from the imperial institutions of this city. Except
for two terms as Justice of the Peace in Morton Township, Mecosta
County, Michigan, Russell never held public office.
<P>
Nonetheless, he had the chief virtue of a public man: he regarded
cultural order as a gift, even if it had been neglected and despoiled
by the age. One might think that it was a great misfortune for
him to have lived in our time, with its rejection of authority
and its rejection of the vicarious communion of the living with
the dead. Russell was, of course, duly critical of the age.
<P>
But criticism was rarely his first word, and never his last. 1
recall the first time I met him, during one of his annual seminars
at Piety Hill. I never, by the way, met a man of his prominence
who spent such time with young people, especially college undergraduates.
That year he was considering the subject, &quot;Is Virtue Teachable?&quot;
After citing all of the classical authorities, and making every
argument (pro and con) of which we were capable, we retired to
the living room on the final evening, whereupon Russell told ghost
stories. I returned more than once to these annual affairs in
Mecosta, and I can assure you that the ghosts always had the final
word.
<P>
When we consider the life of Russell Kirk, we may ask ourselves:
Can a virtuous man be happy in a decadent time? Aristotle said
of Priam's misfortunes: &quot;A truly good and intelligent person
will bear strokes of fortune suitably, and from his resources
at any time will do the finest actions, just as a . . . good shoemaker
will produce the finest shoe from the leather given him . . .
If this is so, then the happy person could never become miserable.&quot;
<P>
And so it was with Russell Kirk. &quot;Happiness,&quot; he concluded
in <i>The Roots of American Order</i>, is first expressed in &quot;gratitude.&quot;
Gratitude is found neither in sadness nor in protest, but in &quot;restoring
and improving the order of the soul and the order of the republic.&quot;
<P>
For his piety, for his example, for his paternal solicitude for
his students, and above all for his sanity, we will miss him.
But we. are grateful for his extraordinary defense of the ordinary,
civilizing virtues.<A NAME="irving"></A>

<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Irving Louis Horowitz<BR>
Professor of Sociology and Political Science<BR>
Rutgers University</b></CENTER><p> It would be futile, not to say frustrating,
to try summarizing Russell Kirk's life and work in a few well
chosen words. Russell him self was wise enough to leave for paradise
ultimate summaries and judgments. He understood that our world
was comprised, if not shrouded, in mystery and paradox; and hence
in need of dispositions not dogmas. He lived his extraordinary
life accordingly.
<P>
He was a huge public presence with a private life that remained
ever intact. He was a man who wrote fiercely, but who yet managed
to speak softly. Russell gave substance to a movement floundering
in search of theory, and yet only episodically participated in
partisan politics. He was as dedicated to what Veblen called the
higher learning with an unmatched ferocity, and yet chose the
life of what Mannheim called the <i>freischwebende Inelligenz</i> -- 
or loosely translated, the free-wheeling intellect. He was a political
philosopher in the strictest, Burkean, sense of the word, and
yet could produce ghost I stories and aphoristic works with equal
aplomb and ease. And yes, he was Catholic in the exacting sense
of that word, and yet fully able to register a catholicity that
knew no boundaries of religion or culture.
<P>
In short, he was one of us: a human being with aspirations no
less than accomplishments. His conservatism was ample enough to
take the measure of man as a complex bundle of twine; touched
by original sin but in search of ultimate redemption, and filled
with such tumult as to make possible an appreciation of order.
But having said this, one must add a qualifier: Russell did not
use paradox as a mechanism for avoiding decisions or skirting
issues. Better than nearly any I person I have ever known, he
took forthright positions on basic ques tions. For Russell, what
ought to be is at least as important as what is in the conduct
of human affairs.
<P>
I take this passion for the political as his secret war against
empiricism and for moralism. He was at heart, an essayist. He
loved preparing introductions to his favorite contemporary authors:
Irving Babbitt, Christopher Dawson, William H. Mallock, John Randolph,
Forrest McDonald, Donald Davidson, Wilhelm Roepke, Victor Kravchenko, Louis deBonald, George Scott-Moncrieff -- to name some of
them. They spoke at levels that provided meaning without fueling
animus.
<P>
I suspect that this opportunity to dialogue with his friends and
mentors of ages past no less than times present was a large part
of Russell's reason for sponsoring the Library of Conservative
Thought a series wthich has brought such distinction to Transaction,
 no less than pleasure to its readers. He shared with Montaigne
the deep belief that the essay form was that most amenable to
give I expression to ethical considerations. If this made him
at times appear I avuncular, it was a small price to pay for giving
intellectual shape to the struggles of our century and our nation.
<P>
Russell's life spanned much of the century: he knew many victories,
and suffered defeats as well. He handled both ends of the public
spectrum with equal equanimity. I suspect that the warmth of his
private life above all, his unabashed love and beaming pride of
his wife and four daughters allowed him to put into perspective
any indignities, and put into practice his belief in the values
of family, tradition, and faith. There was a seamless movement
from the private to the public that gave an informed unity of
purpose to his life.
<P>
In the short few weeks since his death, I have received many encomiums
about the Library of Conservative Thought. Several of them have
spoken of the series as somehow complete, or near completion,
with his passing. While well-intentioned, this is simply not the
case. That rich body of analysis to which Russell both contributed
so mightily and recovered so consistently, is no more near completion
than the planet earth itself. It would be high irony that a person
dedicated to the search for eternal values in a changing polity
would advocate or announce the competition of such a stupendous
task.
<P>
I suspect that these letters are giving expression to a feeling
of deep sorrow at the loss of a spiritual leader in a spiritless
environment. But the need for the comfort of belief, the instinct
for tradition, the impulse to maintain, if not create order, must
ultimately overcome our sorrow at the loss of a human being, however
talented and whatever achievements he may have registered. The
fact is that Russell is now one with the great tradition he helped
to articulate and recover. He is one with Plato, Augustine, Burke,
Brownson, Calhoun, Eliot and countless other names who helped
Russell give definition to western civilization. May his soul
rest in peace. May our souls remain restless in the pursuit of
peace.<A NAME="honorable"></A>

<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Honorable T. Kenneth Cribb,
Jr.<BR>
President<BR>
Intercollegiate Studies Institute</b></CENTER><p> The priceless regalia
of the Scottish kings--the crown, the scepter, the sword of state--are
known as the Honors of Scotland. They are more ancient by far
than the British Crown Jewels, and it is said that the gold circlet
of the richly reworked crown was worn by Robert the Bruce. Despite
their incalculable worth, the Honors of Scotland were put away
following the union of the English and Scottish nations, and then
were lost to memory for 150 years.</B>
<P>
It was none other than Sir Walter Scott who, understanding their
significance, used all the powers of his scholarship and imagination
to deduce their forgotten resting place. After infinite pains,
he himself lifted the Honors of Scotland from the dusty recess
where they had been consigned by an earlier generation careless
of its patrimony.
<P>
In our age, it was Russell Kirk who, with ground-breaking scholarship
and moral imagination, rediscovered what we may call the Honors
of the West. At a time when the American heirs to conservatism
had fallen into forgetfulness of the great tradition, and liberal
intellectuals had proclaimed its demise, Dr. Kirk, like the Walter
Scott he so admired, lifted with his own hands our forgotten patrimony
from dusty oblivion.
<P>
In his early work Dr. Kirk treated modern exemplars of the conservative
tradition from Burke to Eliot, but always with respect to their
insights into timeless truths. Later, he more explicitly traced
these eternal verities to their ancient historical roots, and
to their Source beyond history. All along the way he erected guideposts
for those who would follow--all of us here and so many others--that
we too could travel the path he had marked toward order in the
soul and order in the commonwealth; that we too could discover
the Honors of the West.
<P>
Friend or foe would occasionally address him as Professor Kirk--not
realizing that he had held professorships no longer than he had
to--such was his contempt for Behemoth University. But teacher
he was, all his life. More than a few volumes on his long shelf
of books were written explicitly to instruct the young, not to
F mention hundreds of college lectures from coast to coast, scores
of Wilbur Fellows who served as his research assistants, or the
Piety Hill seminars begun more than twenty years ago. As with
Chaucer's Clerk, gladly would he teach and gladly learn.
<P>
Russell Kirk also taught by the example of his towering integrity.
Here was the man of letters who, without the usual sinecures,
actually lived by his pen. Here was the scourge of the Welfare
State who quietly practiced the arts of private charity. He and
Annette made their house a home to the troubled, to the dispossessed,
to great eccentrics seeking refuge from the commonplace world.
Who has not visited Piety Hill only to find himself dining with
the deposed imperial family of Ethiopia, or a young person with
grave family problems, or an intellectual expatriated from the
totalitarian East. There was even the Burglar Butler who before
finding shelter with the Kirks, made his way by robbing church
poor boxes, taking--as he said--only what was absolutely necessary.
<P>
Yes, Dr. Kirk taught us by the very nature of the household that
he established, graced by Monica, Cecilia, Felicia, and Andrea,
and presided over by Annette with an encompassing love.
<P>
In January of 1993 Russell Kirk learned that he suffered from
congestive heart failure, and realist that he was, understood
that his remaining time was short. He took the news as no more
and no less than an artifact of the human condition, and in his
last year and-a-half neither despaired in his spirit nor flagged
in his Herculean literary feats. After all, this was a man who
measured his intellectual pursuits in millennia and who planted
trees throughout his life as a symbol of our duty to strive for
good that we may not live to see.
<P>
Well into his seventies, Dr. Kirk could canoe on the rivers of
Mecosta County or walk the hills of the Scottish Borders, only
to sit down later at his typewriter and engage in learned disputation.
This past December nineteenth, Dr. Kirk wrote me, &quot;I fear
that my days of canoeing and hill-walking are over,&quot; and
then proceeded to outline a series of literary projects that daunted
even in the reading. Since the onset of his illness in 1993, he
had produced two of his most important works: <i>America's British
Culture</i>, a consummate defense of our common patrimony against
the destructive sallies of the multiculturalists; and <i>The Politics
of Prudence</i>, a series of essays instructing the rising generation
in the essence of conservative thought and exhorting them to nurture
and transmit their precious cultural heritage.
<P>
But perhaps the most significant work of his last days was the
completion of his final literary gift to us, <i>The Sword
of Imagination: Memoirs of a Half-Century of Literary Conflict</i>.
This 874-page treasure of a manuscript is currently being prepared
for publication by Eerdmans Publishing Company and, according
to Dr. Kirk, is a memoir humbly penned in the tradition of Julius
Caesar and Henry T Adams.
<P>
During his final illness, Dr. Kirk would gather his daughters
around him to tell stories of his youth and of their family history--as
well as an occasional gothic tale. He mustered the energy to read
aloud to his family Walter Scott's <i>Tales of a Grandfather</i>,
and, on Easter Sunday, Chesterton's <i>Ballad of the White
Horse</i>;.
<P>
On his last morning, he heard on the radio that the Pope had slipped
and fallen. He asked his family to pin him in prayer for the Holy
Father's recovery. At the end, he sat up in his bed at his beloved
Piety Hill, and sank back with eyes closed. As Annette went for
the nurse, two of his young daughters took his hands and began
to sing the songs he had sung to awaken them from their a slumbers.
He opened his eyes once more to the angelic voices that sang him
to his rest. His life was gentle in the old sense; his death,
in all senses.
<P>
The final works and days of Russell Kirk were at one with his
long life. From across the ages the best minds of the West spoke
to Dr. Kirk of permanent things which eclipsed the paltry preoccupations
of our time, and he made those thinkers our contemporaries. It
is across the ages that Russell Kirk's own voice will be heard
by future voyagers embarked on the reflective journey toward order
in the soul and order in the commonwealth. May they redeem for
their time, as Russell Kirk has done for ours, the Honors of the
West.<A NAME="homily"></A>

Mass of Dr. Russell Kirk<BR>
Reverend Winthrop Brainerd<BR>
St. Matthew's Cathedral, Washington, D.C. </CENTER></B>
<P>
On Sunday we celebrated Pentecost, and on Monday, I was at Yale
graduation. The contrast between them was extreme. Certainly at
Yale I discovered much knowledge. Certainly at Yale, I discovered
much learning. Yet, with all of this knowledge and learning, was
the lack of moral imagination; and in the midst of &quot;political
correctness,&quot; the refusal of the truth; and therefore the
absence of all wisdom.
<P>
Certainly, there was much talk of &quot;freedom from,&quot; and
lamentably little understanding of &quot;freedom to:&quot; a multiplication
of rights; and a convenient amnesia of duty.
<P>
Yet as Pentecost reminds us, the vocation of a Catholic is to
witness to the truth. To this end, God reveals Himself in covenant;
in sacrifice; in flesh and blood; and through the Holy Spirit.
<P>
Poured out upon the Church at Pentecost, and upon us at our baptism,
that Spirit leads us into the truth, and as we discover the truth,
if we are to live our lives with integrity, we must proclaim it.
<P>
For it is in this fearless proclamation of truth, that we ourselves
learn: from each other; from tradition; from grace; and from that
radical transformation of the heart. Truth comes from the entirety
of the human condition and has been refined and forged in the
inner conflicts between truth and lies; between good and evil;
between the world and the kingdom. And from the proclamation of
the truth, we discover wisdom.
<P>
Given the corruption of human nature, it is, perhaps, too much
to expect gratitude from those challenged and exposed by the proclamation
of the truth, but in the midst of persecution, explicit or implicit,
we see &quot;<i>Cor ad Cor loquitur</i>,&quot; heart speaks to heart.
Like the rim of a bell, it does not matter where it is touched,
for it rings clear, out across the earth. Wisdom speaks heart
to heart, because it perceives not only truth, but the purpose
of truth, which is God.
<P>
Wisdom speaks to the human: body, soul, mind, for wisdom both
understands the truth of the human condition, and is the ground
of its healing. It mines the individual he art for the good for
which humanity was made; for the good of which it is capable;
and for that fragile good confronted by the dark destructive selfishness
of which each one of us is daily tempted to succumb.
<P>
Such wisdom comes from God who is wisdom Himself; Himself the
author, the purpose and the end and it is the birthright of every
Catholic.
<P>
Here in the presence of the author of truth and seat of wisdom
we are given a sign: we see the bread and wine; we perceive the
flesh and blood. We see in what we have made, in bread, in wine,
the seeds of our mortality: the bread must rot and the wine spoil.
Yet we see God take what we have made, and by them, give to us
immortality.
<P>
This sign shows us what God will do, not with what we have made,
but with what he has made: ourselves. &quot;Now we see a dim reflection
in a mirror; but then we shall be seeing face to face. The knowledge
that I now have is imperfect; but I shall understand as I am understood.&quot;
(1 Cor. 13:12)
<P>
&quot;To understand as I am understood&quot; is the ultimate wisdom.
It is still the vocation of our brother Russell Kirk; it is the
lesson of his life; and it is the legacy, like Elijah's mantle,
that falls upon us here.<HR>

<H2>Business Relations Department</h2>

<hr>
<p>
The primary mission of the Business Relations department is to educate and mobilize the business community -- entrepreneurs, corporate leaders, trade associations, and activists -- on behalf of the  free enterprise/limited government policy agenda.  The department has coordinated briefings for industry groups on the current status of health care reform, telecommunications deregulation, trade, budget and tax reform, and deregulation.  
<p>
	In addition to meeting and briefing corporate representatives, the Business Relations department is working with industry coalitions to advance our agenda; coordinating working group meetings on the flat tax and regulatory reform; creating a "Resource Bank of Business" by identifying businessmen willing to speak, write, and testify on behalf of free enterprise/limited government policies; coordinating the activities of  our <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/physc.html"><b>Physicians Council</b></a>; and launching a new <a href="#council"><b>Business Council</b></a> of the Heritage Foundation.
<p>
	In addition to smaller, informal briefings, we host Heritage's regular <b><i>Washington Policy Roundtable</i></b> meetings which bring Heritage experts, industry representatives, and policy makers together to discuss issues that are being debated on Capitol Hill.  <b><i>Roundtable</i></b> meetings this year have included:
<p>

	Business Relations also launched two new fax publications this year to update and inform the business community.  Both are targeted to representatives in the corporate, public relations, legal, and association fields.  The <i>Business Bulletin</i> presents an occasional essay on topics of special interest to this community.  The first <i>Bulletin</i> on <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/bb596.html">"Corporate Responsibility"</a> was authored by Rebecca Lukens Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/wilson.htm">Mark Wilson</a> and timed for release just prior to the White House conference on corporate responsibility.  The second <i>Bulletin</i> highlights the Heritage publication on "<a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/bb696.html">How the Congress Won the Budget War</a>" and offers free copies of our new pocket-sized summary card on the paper.  <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/octbrcal.html"><i>This Month at Heritage</i></a> is a faxed monthly calendar previewing upcoming Heritage lectures and events for the business community.

<h3>Business Council</h3>
<p>
Heritage launched a Business Council, which will educate business executives, small business owners, and entrepreneurs about issues that directly affect them.  Our goal in establishing a Business Council of the Heritage Foundation is to identify a group of businessmen activists who, through their civic, business and community activities will help us leverage our own work on issues like tax and regulatory reform, health care, the federal budget, and education reform.
<p>
Members of the Council receive receive Heritage reports through the mail and by fax.  And serve as a source of information for Heritage experts on the impact government policies have on real people. 
 <p>
	If you are interested in joining the Business Council of The Heritage Foundation, please contact:  Bridgett Wagner, Director of Business Relations at 202/608-6050 or via email at <a href="mailto:wagnerb@heritage.org">wagnerb@heritage.org</a>.

<p>
<a name="flattax">
<h3>Flat Tax Transition Rules Working Group</h3>
<p>

	The Heritage Foundation and the Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation have conducted a series of meetings that address various aspects of making a successful transition to a fundamentally reformed tax system.  These meetings will result in "white papers" and recommendations on moving towards effective transition rules. Topics have included: Accumulated Depreciation; Interest Deductibility; Health Care and Employee Benefits; Border Adjustability and Foreign Taxation; and Charitable Contributions.  If you are interested in learning more about these meetings or being added to our mailing list, please contact Bridgett Wagner at (202) 546-4400 or via e-mail at <a href="mailto:wagnerb@heritage.org">wagnerb@heritage.org</a>.

<p><a name="regs">
<h3>Regulatory Reform Working Group</h3>
<p>

	The Heritage Foundation leads the way in promoting regulatory reform by bringing together Hill Staff, lobbyists, and regulatory reform experts to address the ways in which we can make regulatory reform become a reality.  Topics include "How to Win the Environmental Debate," as well as other business, health and safety regulations.

<B><i>Helping the States be Heard in Washington</i></B>
<BR>
<BR>


	The  Project on Federalism and the States, formerly the Governors' Forum, was established in 1993 to enhance the role of the chief executives and legislators of the fifty states in the public debate on issues of national importance.  The broad purpose of the Project is to help increase the voice of the states in Washington to ensure that their interests command greater attention from officials in the federal government.
<P>
	The  Project on Federalism and the States is committed to restoring a balance between federal and state responsibilities through a reinvigoration of federalism.  The transfer of power from the states to Washington over the past decades has reached an unprecedented level, with virtually no area of public policy free from directives from Washington.  As the authority of state and local governments has declined, their ability to protect the interests of their constituents has continued to erode.  With decision-making on most major issues now firmly centered in Washington, state and local governments and their constituents are subjected to an ever-expanding list of mandates, regulations, and financial burdens which take little or no account of the differences between the states or of the wishes of their electorates.
<P>
	The  Project on Federalism and the States provides a platform in Washington for governors, state legislators, attorneys general, and other state and local officials to articulate directly to the Congress their positions on issues such as welfare reform, crime, education, and unfunded federal mandates on the states.   The Project highlights public policy innovations occurring outside Washington DC  through activities such as gubernatorial lectures, press conferences, position papers and editorials on key issues affecting the states, and extensive networking with national, state, and local media.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Asia-Pacific region is becoming increasingly important to the United States. In 1995, U.S. two-way merchandise trade with the Asia-Pacific region rose to $503 billion, 38 percent of America's global two-way merchandise trade. Despite such economic intensity, however, Asia-Pacific trade remains susceptible to political upheaval that could endanger American security. The People's Republic of China is building a large military which could be used to enforce its territorial claims on the Spratly Islands and Taiwan. North Korea simultaneously poses the threats of military aggression and internal collapse. In Southeast Asia, Cambodia and Myanmar continue to repress their citizens.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To protect its economic and security interests in the Asia-Pacific region, America needs partners. The U.S. already has a number of defense partners in Asia; but some, like Japan, are not very good at liberalizing trade and other commercial activities in the region. Australia, however, in addition to being a military ally, could function effectively in helping to advance America's interest in liberalizing trade in Asia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Australia became a major player in the Asia-Pacific region only recently. For most of this century, the government in Canberra purposely developed a strong Western cultural and economic identity; but its protectionist policies also brought the country to the edge of economic ruin by the 1980s. Following the Labor Party's victory in the March 1983 elections, Prime Minister Bob Hawke began to deregulate the economy and dismantle protectionist trade barriers. Over the next decade, Australia was transformed from the developed world's second most protected economy into a leading proponent of free trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Under Hawke, Australia embraced the Asian market, welcomed Asian immigration, and reoriented Canberra's diplomatic and economic ties away from Europe and toward Asia and the United States. The result has been economic vitality, and newly elected Prime Minister John Howard is continuing these successful policies.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, Canberra has developed especially close relations with countries in the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).<sup>1</sup>  As an outside superpower, the U.S. cannot easily duplicate the diplomatic, economic, and military ties that proximity and dedication have presented to Australia. By cooperating with Canberra on trade and security issues, Washington can benefit from Australia's unique relations with other Asian countries to secure vital American interests in the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unfortunately, however, the U.S.-Australian relationship is not living up to its potential. While Canberra and Washington are cooperating more closely on defense matters,<sup>2</sup> the U.S. often pursues counterproductive agriculture and trade policies that cost Americans and Australians dearly. For example, President Bill Clinton's vacillating trade policy is undermining Canberra's hopes for trade liberalization at the upcoming meetings of APEC ministers in the Philippines on November 22-25 and of the WTO in Singapore on December 9-12. The U.S. should be working with, not against, Australia to make these meetings a success for free trade.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Improving relations with Australia will help the U.S. better protect its interests in the caldron of economic opportunity and geopolitical danger that is Asia. To accomplish this goal, the President should:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Ask Congress to eliminate the dairy, agriculture export subsidy, and sugar programs</b> that together cost American consumers and taxpayers more than $10 billion every year.
<p>
<li><b> Ask Congress to allow intracoastal shipping to use foreign-built, foreign-operated, or foreign-owned vessels.</b> The current Jones Act requirement that intracoastal shipping use U.S.-built, U.S.-operated, and U.S.-owned vessels adds between $3 billion to $10 billion annually to the logistics costs of American firms.
<p>
<li><b> Ask Congress for fast-track authority to negotiate trade agreements free of contentious environmental and labor standards issues.</b> Fast track is needed to bring Chile into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), to present a substantive action plan for trade and investment liberalization in APEC, and to participate in any future round of WTO negotiations.
<p>
<li><b> Support Australia's initiative to harmonize such existing free trade agreements</b> as the North American Free Trade Agreement, Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Agreement (CER), and ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) within APEC. This would enhance the prospects for expanding liberalization within APEC itself.
<p>
<li><b> Participate fully in APEC's "concerted unilateralism" process.</b> Under concerted unilateralism, each APEC member prepares its own action plan to liberalize trade and investment, with each plan then subject to peer review to help assure compliance in achieving the ultimate goal. At present, there still are too many differences among APEC members for formal trade negotiations to succeed. Concerted unilateralism allows APEC members to take small but concrete steps each year toward APEC's ultimate goal of free trade and investment by 2020. Only if members gain confidence in each other can a more formal negotiating process be successful.
<p>
<li><b> Work with Australia to complete unfinished items from the Uruguay Round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).</b> These include sector agreements to liberalize trade in basic telecommunications and maritime transport, and new negotiations to liberalize agricultural trade.
<p>
<li><b> Propose convening a new WTO round with the goal of achieving a global free trade and investment agreement by 2020.</b>
<p>
<li><b> Enhance American military ties to Australia by offering to sell Canberra Tomahawk long-range cruise missiles and by including Canberra in the development any future Asian missile defense network.</b>
</ul>
<p>

<b>AUSTRALIA: A RISING POWER IN ASIA</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is easy for Americans to overlook Australia when thinking about Asian countries. Both stable and prosperous, Australia demands little attention from the crisis-dependent U.S. media. Moreover, most Americans do not really think of Australia as an Asian country. Unlike Asian countries with exotic cultures and languages, Australia and the U.S. share a common culture and language. It can be argued that Australia is more like the U.S. than any other country in the world.
</td></tr>But to overlook Australia when examining the Asia-Pacific region is a serious omission. There are four reasons for drawing this conclusion:
<p><blockquote>
<b>REASON #1: Australia is a major market for American goods and services</b>, with a large and vibrant economy. For example:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) in 1995 was $347.6 billion, making Australia's economy the fourth-largest in Asia and the 14th-largest in the world.</b> Despite Australia's relatively small population of 18 million, its GDP is larger than that of India, Taiwan, or any Southeast Asian country. Only China, Japan, and South Korea have larger economies.
<p>
<li><b> Australia is the world's 21st-largest trading power and America's 20th-largest trading partner.</b> Merchandise trade between Australia and the U.S. was $13.4 billion in 1995. In fact, the U.S. enjoyed a $7.5 billion merchandise trade surplus with Australia -- the largest such U.S. surplus with any of the world's trading powers.
<p>
<li><b> Australia hosts American direct investments of $24.7 billion.</b> Australia is the ninth-largest host to U.S. direct investment in the world and the second-largest in Asia, ranking only behind Japan.
<p>
<li><b> Trade and investment liberalization has expanded U.S. exports to Australia significantly in recent years.</b> U.S. merchandise exports to Australia have grown by 94 percent, from $5.5 billion in 1986 to $10.8 billion in 1995, and currently provide jobs to approximately 215,000 American workers. Under Canberra's liberal economic policy (especially its policy of privatization), U.S. direct investment in Australia has exploded by 165 percent, rising from $9.3 billion in 1986 to $24.7 billion in 1995.
</ul><p>
<b>REASON #2: Australia is a major proponent of free trade and investment.</b> For example:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Australia led the fight to include agricultural trade liberalization in the Uruguay Round Agreements.</b> In 1986, Australia organized the Cairns Group of 14 agricultural exporting countries to promote free trade in farm products.<sup>3</sup>  Under Australian leadership, the Cairns Group succeeded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations in winning the first multilateral agreement to liberalize trade in agricultural products. Along with Brazil, the European Union, Japan, and the U.S., Australia is widely considered to be one of the five most influential members of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
<p>
<li><b> Australia founded the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.</b> In January 1989, Prime Minister Bob Hawke proposed a meeting of government ministers from the Asia-Pacific region to establish a framework for economic cooperation. This led to the formation of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Canberra in November 1989.<sup>4</sup>  In November 1994, at Bogor, Indonesia, Australia and the other APEC member economies established the goal of "achieving free and open trade and investment" by 2010 for developed economies and by 2020 for developing economies.
<p>
<li><b> Australia and New Zealand were the first countries to outlaw antidumping procedures in a free trade agreement.</b> In 1988, Australia and New Zealand agreed to revise the original Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (CER) to make it the world's most comprehensive trade agreement. The CER removed all tariffs and quotas on trade in goods by 1990, established free trade in services, abolished antidumping procedures in bilateral trade, created a common labor market, and harmonized business and trade practices laws. As tariffs have fallen, protectionists in the U.S. and elsewhere increasingly have been employing antidumping procedures to curb imports. By abolishing antidumping procedures, the CER prevents such abuses.
<p>
<li><b> Unlike the U.S., Australia has lowered its trade barriers unilaterally.</b> In May 1988, Australia announced that tariffs on most manufactured goods would be lowered from 15 percent to 10 percent by July 1992. In March 1991, it announced that tariffs on most manufactured goods would be reduced further to 5 percent by July 1996, and that tariffs on textiles, clothing, and footwear would be reduced from 55 percent to 25 percent by July 2000. 
</ul>

</table>
<p>
<b>REASON #3: Australia is a strong military ally.</b> Australia is one of America's most steadfast military allies. Australian and American troops fought together in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Persian Gulf War. Australia and the U.S. also are parties to a mutual defense treaty: the Australia, New Zealand, and United States Security Treaty, commonly known as ANZUS.<sup>5</sup>  Australia and Japan are among America's major military allies in the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Moreover, the Howard government recently has shown its willingness to enhance cooperation with the United States on defense and regional security issues. On July 26, 1996, Canberra agreed to host a new series of biennial military exercises called "Tandem Thrust."  The first war game in March 1997 will involve 17,000 U.S. Marines and 5,000 Australian troops near Shoalwater Bay in Queensland. Subsequent American military training exercises will occur in the Northern Territory of Australia. Because of this cooperation, the U.S. can shift much of its Asian battle training away from densely populated Japan and Korea to sparsely populated areas of Australia (and possibly help to defuse local political tensions over American bases in Japan and Korea as well).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Canberra and Washington also have agreed to cooperate on missile defense issues. China is modernizing its missile forces and twice in the last year has used its missiles to threaten democratic Taiwan. During a July 1996 meeting in Canberra, Australian Minister of Defense Ian McLachlan and U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry signed a new ten-year lease that will allow the U.S. to use a jointly manned intelligence facility at Pine Gap. The functions of this base will expand to include intelligence satellite downlinks now at the Nurrungar, Australia, facility, which soon will be closed. The Nurrungar facility enabled the U.S. Space Command to help Patriot missile operators defeat Iraqi Scud missiles during the Persian Gulf War, and Pine Gap could help the U.S. provide defense support that Israel can use to defeat missile threats. Such capabilities also could help Australia defend itself from missile threats.<sup>6</sup>  Australia is in an ideal position to facilitate regional missile defense cooperation, and the facilities at Pine Gap could be expanded to provide intelligence information that might help the United States verify a future arms control agreement to limit the number of missiles deployed by Asian countries.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
<b>REASON #4: Australia maintains close diplomatic ties to Asia.</b> Australia can influence economic policymakers in Asian countries in ways the U.S. cannot. Canberra originated the concept of a regional economic forum that led to the formation of APEC in 1989. It also worked closely with President Suharto of Indonesia to persuade more reluctant APEC members to agree to the 1994 Bogor Declaration, which set as APEC's objective "achieving free trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific by 2010 for developed economies and 2020 for developing economies."  Australia's successful trade liberalization encouraged the ASEAN countries to create their own ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) in January 1992 and to reduce the period for its implementation from 15 to ten years in October 1995. Canberra's cooperative attitude toward trade with Asia has increased Australian influence in Asian capitals. For example, the Howard government is working closely with ASEAN leaders to coordinate strategy in APEC and the WTO.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>HOW AUSTRALIA TRANSFORMED ITS WORLD PRESENCE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This remarkable new role for Australia has not occurred overnight. It is the result of a long transformation with deep roots in Australian history.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Despite Australia's proximity to Asia, for most of its history it has thought of itself as a European country. Because of this self-conception, Australian governments pursued policies known collectively as the "Australian Settlement."  Among other things, the Australian Settlement encompassed a "whites only" immigration policy, dependence on the United Kingdom for defense and markets, and a highly protected and regulated domestic economy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Throughout most of this century, Canberra tried to promote industrial development through a system of high tariffs and subsidies to Australian manufacturers. But this protectionism caused a protracted decline in Australia's economy relative to the economies of other developed countries. In 1900, Australia had the highest per capita gross domestic product in the world. Over the next 80 years, it experienced the slowest growth in per capita GDP of all developed countries. By 1980, Australia had fallen to 14th place in per capita GDP.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

During the 1970s, Australia's defense and trade ties to Great Britain diminished. The United Kingdom's accession to the European Union in 1973 denied Australia preferential access to its historically most important export market. Meanwhile, the economic rise of Japan and the other "Asian tigers" provided Australia with vast new markets for its agricultural and mineral products. The integration of separate national economies into a single global economy made Australia's inward-looking economic policies increasingly burdensome.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Thus began a gradual backing away from the Australian Settlement policies. In 1973, Prime Minister Geoff Whitlam ended the "whites only" immigration policy. The result was significant Asian immigration, which caused Canberra slowly to begin to see itself more as an Asian country. Asian immigrants, with their cultural knowledge and language skills, have become a major asset for Australian firms doing business in Asia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

However, the decisive break with the Australian Settlement came in March 1983. Suffocating from double-digit inflation and unemployment rates, Australian voters elected a Labor Government led by Prime Minister Bob Hawke and Treasurer Paul Keating. Contrary to what people normally expected of a Labor government, Hawke and Keating, driven by fear of an economic crisis, began to liberalize Australia's economy. Keating himself best summarized the challenges facing Australia:
<p>
<blockquote>
	We must let Australians know truthfully, honestly, earnestly, just what sort of international hole Australia is in.... If this government cannot get... a sensible economic policy, then Australia is basically done for. We will end up being just a third rate economy....  Then you are gone. You are a banana republic.<sup>8</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Hawke and Keating boldly rejected Australia's traditional policy of protectionism. The Labor government exposed Australia's domestic economy to global market forces through deregulation, privatization, and trade liberalization. The Hawke (1983-1991) and subsequent Keating (1991-1996) governments reoriented Australia's trade policies toward Asia, and Australia began to think of itself as an Asian country. Labor sought to broaden and deepen Australia's diplomatic and economic ties to China, Japan, South Korea, the countries of Southeast Asia, and the U.S.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These policies have made Australia a major player in the Asia-Pacific economy. Japan is now Australia's largest trading partner (receiving 24.3 percent of total Australian exports in 1994-1995), followed by South Korea (7.9 percent), New Zealand (7.1 percent), and the United States (6.9 percent). Australia annually hosts 43,000 foreign students (mainly Asian) in its universities, earning more than $1 billion annually in service export income.
<p>
<b>THE LEGACY OF U.S. POLICY: NEGLECT AND ABUSE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite Australia's growing importance in Asia, U.S. policy toward Australia is best described as benign neglect punctuated with occasional abuse -- even though Australia and the United States are long-standing allies with shared interests in commercial and military travel on oceans and seas, promoting access by American and Australian firms to domestic markets in Asia, and preventing the domination of Asia by a hostile power.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

However, it is undeniable that the U.S. has pursued agriculture and trade policies that have soured its relations with this emerging power. This may not have been intentional; American leaders simply did not pay adequate attention to the effects their decisions had on Australia. But the consequence has been undeniable: a missed opportunity to advance mutual economic interests in the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>U.S. Agriculture Policy: A Losing Proposition.</b> Over the past decade, the most serious dispute between Australia and the United States has been over agriculture policy. American and Australian farmers produce a wide range of agricultural commodities that compete with each other on world markets. Because of America's role as a large, if not dominant, producer and consumer of many farm commodities, U.S. agriculture policy profoundly affects world agricultural markets. Therefore, the level of agricultural protection and subsidies that Washington gives its farmers not only determines U.S. food production, consumption, and trade patterns, but also sets world prices for major agricultural commodities.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
By contrast, Australian farmers receive world prices for most of their agricultural products.<sup>10</sup>  Thus, to the extent that U.S. agricultural subsidies distort world prices, Australian farmers are affected adversely by U.S. agricultural policy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This problem was particularly serious in the 1980s when falling commodity and land prices caused agriculture subsidy costs to soar both in Australia and in the United States. Prime Minister Hawke and President Ronald Reagan chose radically different responses to this farm crisis. Hawke initiated a phaseout of Australia's agriculture price supports and subsidies. With the exception of its dairy industry subsidy (which will have been phased out completely in 2000), Australia now limits government agriculture assistance to inspection, quarantine efforts, pest control, education, and research.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By contrast, President Reagan created new export subsidies to improve the price competitiveness of American farm exports. Through the Food Security Act of 1985, the Reagan Administration established the Export Enhancement Program and the Dairy Export Incentive Program to subsidize U.S. agricultural exports. President George Bush later expanded these programs through the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the years since 1990, the attitude of American farmers toward federal agriculture programs has changed. Convinced in part by the successful transition of Australian farmers to subsidy-free agriculture, many American farmers have realized that they would be better off producing for the market instead of relying on government subsidy programs. When Congress began considering the reauthorization of federal agriculture programs in 1995, a revolution in American farm policy was at hand. The result was passage of the Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act of 1996. In addition to granting wheat, feed grain, rice, and cotton farmers fixed but declining subsidies through seven-year transition contracts, the FAIR Act terminates production controls on wheat, feed grains, rice, and cotton. While the Act made progress toward a free market in agriculture, however, the dairy and sugar programs were modified only slightly, and the export subsidy programs were left intact. Thus, many subsidies remain. For example:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>The Dairy Program.</b> The U.S. government maintains high domestic prices for dairy products through a complex and interlocking system of support prices, milk marketing orders, and tariff rate quotas. This system severely restricts access to the American market by foreign competitors such as Australia.<sup>11</sup>  The dairy program costs American consumers approximately $9 billion annually through high prices for milk, butter, and cheese, and American taxpayers will pay another $1.6 billion to maintain this program over the next five years.
<p>
<li><b>The Dairy Export Incentive Program.</b> The Dairy Export Incentive Program provides subsidies to exporters of dairy products.<sup>12</sup>  In addition to the fact that it will cost taxpayers approximately $120 million over the next five years without increasing the American dairy industry's international competitiveness, the Dairy Export Incentive Program depresses world dairy prices and reduces Australian dairy exports to third country markets.
<p>
<li><b>The Export Enhancement Program.</b> The Export Enhancement Program has paid out more than $6 billion since 1986, mainly to assist wheat exports. Intended to make American grain more competitive abroad, the Export Enhancement Program is counterproductive. U.S. export subsidies depress world grain prices (to the obvious objection of Australian farmers) while raising domestic U.S. grain prices, thereby discouraging American farmers from exporting.
<p>
<li><b>The Sugar Program.</b> The U.S. government maintains a high domestic price for sugar through a system of import tariff rate quotas.<sup>13</sup>  In 1993, the U.S. General Accounting Office concluded that the sugar program hiked the domestic price of sugar to twice the world level and cost American consumers $1.4 billion a year. Higher U.S. prices caused sugar's share of the domestic sweetener market to fall from 79 percent in 1981 to 55 percent in 1994, forcing American sugar refiners to close processing facilities. Higher domestic prices also have driven American candy companies to move confectionery plants overseas to obtain cheaper sugar. At the same time, the sugar program has reduced world prices by an average of 4.8 cents per pound and caused Australia to export 89 percent less sugar to the U.S. since 1981. Thus, this program costs Australian exporters $274 million annually.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>The Jones Act: A Burden on the American Economy.</b> Another burden on both the U.S. and Australian economies is the Jones Act. Contained in Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, this law restricts maritime commerce between points within the United States to ships that are American-built, American-operated, and American-owned. In September 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission found that the Jones Act adds from $3 billion to $10 billion annually to the logistics costs borne by American business firms.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Jones Act also is a major irritant in relations with Australia. Canberra complains that this law prevents the sale of competitively priced Australian-made high-speed vessels to U.S. firms. On a broader scale, the Jones Act is an impediment to reaching an agreement in the WTO on liberalizing trade in maritime services. It prevents the President from opening intracoastal shipping to foreign-built, foreign-operated, or foreign-owned vessels. Because the U.S. refuses to liberalize its maritime industry in areas in which foreigners are competitive, many other countries are unwilling to liberalize their maritime industries in areas, such as logistics and port management, in which Americans are competitive. As a result, WTO negotiations on liberalizing maritime services have stalled.

<P>
<b>THE IMPACT OF U.S. PROTECTIONISM ON RELATIONS WITH AUSTRALIA</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While Australia has opened its economy, protectionist voices in the U.S. are urging Americans to shield themselves from the global economy. President Clinton's trade policy has been a series of mixed signals which have caused anxiety and confusion in Canberra. On the one hand, Clinton supported both the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993 and the Uruguay Round Agreements in 1994. He also signed the FAIR Act in 1996 to dismantle some protectionist and trade-distorting U.S. agriculture programs. On the other hand, however, Clinton appears to have strayed from his support of free trade in a number of different areas. For example, the President has:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b> Blocked an agreement with Congress to reauthorize fast-track negotiating authority for trade agreements.</b> President Clinton let fast-track authority for negotiating new trade and investment liberalization agreements expire in 1994. Under fast-track authority, trade and investment agreements negotiated by the President are submitted to Congress for a straight up-or-down vote; Congress may not amend any portion of a proposed agreement before voting on it. For two years now, the Clinton Administration has insisted that any bill reauthorizing fast track must allow the President to negotiate on environmental and labor standards issues.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This position has caused fast track to stall in Congress. Republican leaders fear that environmental and labor rules in trade agreements could be misused to protect certain industries. Republicans in Congress therefore offered to pass a "clean" fast-track bill without the authority to negotiate on environmental and labor standards issues, but the Administration rejected this approach. Without fast-track authority, no country will enter into serious trade and investment liberalization negotiations with the U.S.<sup>14</sup>  The result: Canberra fears that the failure to pass fast track will stall progress on trade and investment liberalization in the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
<li><b> Pushed for managed trade.</b> The Clinton Administration attempted to impose managed trade policies on Japan in the automotive parts and motor vehicles dispute of 1995 and with respect to semiconductors in 1996. This strategy alarmed Canberra. Although Tokyo and Washington ultimately reached agreements in 1995 and 1996, respectively, which avoided mandatory quotas, Clinton's approach to the conflict alienated Australia and other Asian countries. The result: American influence over the direction of trade and investment liberalization in the Asia-Pacific region has been diminished.
<p>
<li><b> Shown ambivalence toward the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.</b> Canberra is happy that President Clinton embraced Australia's APEC initiative and hosted the first APEC Leaders' Meeting near Seattle in 1993. It also is pleased that in 1994 the United States agreed to create a free trade and investment area in the Asia-Pacific by the year 2020. President Clinton and the other APEC leaders adopted a process known as concerted unilateralism to achieve the goal of a free trade and investment area in this region. Under this process, instead of negotiating a formal trade agreement like NAFTA, each member proposes its own action plan for realizing the common goal of free trade prior to the 1996 APEC meetings; each action plan is then subject to peer review to help assure that all will work toward the ultimate goal.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Nevertheless, President Clinton's actions in the last two years have caused Canberra to question America's commitment to the APEC process. First, President Clinton skipped the 1995 APEC Leaders' Meeting in Osaka, Japan, because of the budget stalemate with Congress. This decision disappointed Australia's Prime Minister at the time, Paul Keating, and raised questions among other leaders in the region. Second, the Clinton Administration has yet to offer a substantive U.S. action plan for APEC liberalization; its proposed plan is confined merely to a list of liberalization commitments previously made in the Uruguay Round Agreements. Canberra fears that the Clinton Administration's failure to offer anything new will discourage other APEC members from making substantive trade liberalization commitments.
<p>
<li><b> Failed to keep its commitment to liberalize trade in the WTO.</b> One of the Uruguay Round Agreements, the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), established a general framework for liberalizing trade in various services in 1994. It also established a timetable for reaching specific agreements covering the financial services, telecommunications, and maritime transport sectors.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Clinton Administration backed away from its WTO commitments in 1995 and 1996. Claiming that India, Japan, Korea, and certain ASEAN countries had not made adequate offers to open their financial services markets, the Administration unexpectedly withdrew from the WTO negotiations to liberalize financial services markets on June 29, 1995, the day before the agreement was to be completed. When Australia and the European Union were unsuccessful in persuading the Clinton Administration to return to the bargaining table, they joined with other WTO members and signed a two-year interim financial services agreement excluding the United States. For the first time, a multilateral trade agreement was reached without U.S. consent. This demonstrates President Clinton's declining influence over the course of world trade liberalization.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While GATS established rules to be used in opening markets for certain telecommunications products such as electronic mail, voice mail, on-line information and data base retrieval, and electronic data interchange, Uruguay Round negotiators were unable to fashion rules covering such other basic products as long distance and international services. Therefore, the WTO continued the negotiations on trade liberalization in these basic services. Once again, claiming that offers from India and the ASEAN countries were inadequate, the Clinton Administration withdrew American support for a WTO telecommunications agreement on April 30, 1996, the day negotiations were scheduled to conclude. When Australia and the European Union failed to broker a compromise, the WTO extended its negotiating deadline to February 15, 1997.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Howard government interprets this failure to reach sector agreements as evidence of President Clinton's unwillingness to subordinate the special interests of certain American firms to the general benefits of trade liberalization. At the same time, Canberra feels that Clinton Administration policies are fueling deep division within the WTO by attempting to link trade with issues related to environmental and labor standards. Australia and other Asian countries see this as nothing but thinly veiled protectionism and a brake on global trade liberalization. Not only has the Clinton Administration once again alienated potential allies (as it did in APEC), but it may have forfeited America's leadership role in the upcoming December 9-12, 1996, WTO Ministerial Meeting in Singapore as well.
<p>
<b>BUILDING A STRONGER U.S.-AUSTRALIA RELATIONSHIP</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Despite Australia's growing economic and geopolitical importance in the Asia-Pacific region, President Clinton continues to ignore Canberra. His agriculture and trade policies have hurt Australia needlessly. Moreover, the Clinton Administration's opposition to renewing fast-track authority, its campaign for managed trade with Japan, and its vacillation regarding APEC and the WTO have raised doubts in the Howard government about America's commitment to free trade.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These policies must be changed if the United States is to build a stronger relationship with Australia. Australia has changed greatly over the last decade. While maintaining its defense ties to the United States, it has developed closer diplomatic and economic ties to its neighbors in East and Southeast Asia and stands today as a leading advocate of free trade and investment. This new approach creates new avenues for cooperation between the U.S. and Australia. To facilitate this relationship and to enhance U.S. security and economic interests in Asia, there are several important steps that the Administration and Congress can take. Specifically, the President should:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ask Congress to terminate the dairy, agriculture export subsidy, and sugar programs.</b> With passage of the FAIR Act, the U.S. began to wind down many economically irrational programs. However, the Dairy Program, Dairy Export Incentive Program, Export Enhancement Program, and Sugar Program survive largely intact. These programs raise U.S. consumer prices, cost American taxpayers billions of dollars annually, and decrease world prices for agricultural commodities. Eliminating them would remove a major impediment to improved U.S.-Australia relations and strengthen both economies.
<p>
<li><b> Ask Congress to allow intracoastal shipping to use foreign-built, foreign-operated, or foreign-owned vessels.</b> Repealing the Jones Act would help both the U.S. and Australia by allowing the use of competitively priced, Australian-made high-speed ships in U.S. waters. The result would be to lower logistics costs for American business firms and consumers.
<p>
<li><b> Ask Congress for fast-track authority to negotiate trade agreements free of contentious environmental and labor standards issues.</b> The U.S. needs fast-track authority to offer a substantive action plan for trade and investment liberalization at APEC, to harmonize NAFTA with other regional free trade agreements, and to commence a new round of WTO negotiations. The President should drop his insistence that authority to negotiate on environmental and labor standards issues must be included in any fast-track legislation. Environmental and labor standards issues may have an international dimension, but they should be addressed in separate negotiations on their own merits.
<p>
<li><b>Support Australia's initiative to harmonize existing free trade agreements within APEC.</b> At upcoming APEC meetings, Canberra will urge members to harmonize existing free trade agreements such as NAFTA, the CER, and the ASEAN Free Trade Area. The President should support this Australian initiative. Harmonizing NAFTA, CER, and AFTA is a practical step toward trade and investment liberalization in the Asia-Pacific.
<p>
<li><b>Participate fully in APEC's concerted unilateralism process.</b> There are too many differences among APEC members at present for negotiations on an APEC free trade and investment agreement to succeed. Before work can begin on a region-wide free trade zone, the APEC process must be strengthened. The strategy of concerted unilateralism allows members to take small but concrete steps each year toward APEC's ultimate goal of free trade and investment by 2020. Only if APEC members gain confidence in each other over the next few years can a more formal negotiating process be expected to succeed.
<p>
<li><b> Work with Australia to complete unfinished items from the Uruguay Round of GATT talks.</b> At the WTO Ministerial Meeting in Singapore, the President should support Canberra's proposal to complete unfinished items from the Uruguay Round. Washington must work with Canberra to reach agreements on liberalized trade in basic telecommunications and maritime transport services by 1997. They also should work together to prepare for the new negotiations on agricultural trade liberalization that are scheduled to begin in 1999.
<p>
<li><b> Propose convening a new WTO round with the goal of achieving a global free trade and investment agreement by 2020.</b> The President should exercise bold leadership and press other WTO members at Singapore to convene a new round of global trade liberalization talks by 1998. The new WTO round should subsume APEC's goal of free trade and investment by 2020 as its own. This policy could encourage APEC to accelerate the liberalization of trade and investment in Asia. It would not be the first time that trade liberalization in one set of negotiations spurred liberalization in another. In the early 1990s, for example, the creation of APEC helped bring the Uruguay Round negotiations to a successful conclusion.
<p>
<li><b> Enhance American military ties to Australia.</b> The agreement to stage military exercises in Australia will provide U.S. forces with a better location than Japan and Okinawa for training. Relocating training exercises from these highly populated areas also may reduce public opposition to critical U.S. defense bases there. A renewed lease on the Pine Gap intelligence facility will benefit U.S. strategic goals in Asia and the Middle East. In return, the U.S. should offer to sell Canberra <i>Tomahawk</i> long-range cruise missiles for Australia's new <i>Collins</i>-class submarines. The U.S. also should include Australia in the development of any future Asian missile defense network.
</ul>
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Like Rip Van Winkle, who slept through the American Revolution, an Australian who dozed off 20 years ago and suddenly woke up today would find a very different country. For many years, Australia resisted developing an Asian Pacific identity. That resistance has given way to acceptance of Australia's destiny as a country embracing Asia and immersing itself in the Asian market.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Australia's transformation benefits the United States in ways that should not be overlooked by U.S. policymakers. By opening its economy, Australia has expanded the market for American exports and investments. It also is a well-positioned ally that can help the United States promote trade and investment liberalization throughout the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The U.S. has an unprecedented opportunity to help itself by working more closely with Australia in the Asia-Pacific region. Washington should take the fullest possible advantage of this opportunity by making every effort to remove irritants in its bilateral relations with Canberra. Chief among these irritants are counterproductive agriculture programs and the Jones Act, which hurt not only Australia farmers and shipbuilders, but also American consumers. The U.S. and Australia also should cooperate closely to ensure the success of the upcoming APEC and WTO meetings. Finally, the U.S. should continue and strengthen its military ties to Australia to help maintain peace in the Asia-Pacific. In these ways, the U.S. can expand markets for American goods and services while reversing the dangerous perception of declining American influence in Asia.

<li>    The "Banana republic" comment was made during a radio interview with John Laws on May 14, 1986.<p>
<li>    Prior to 1996, U.S. agricultural programs were like a dike separating two bodies of water. One body is domestic prices; the other, world prices. When the U.S. increases agricultural subsidies and import barriers to maintain domestic prices at a higher level than world prices, foreign production that would have been sold in the U.S. is sold in other markets, and the larger supplies in other markets drive down world prices. But when the U.S. lowers agricultural subsidies and import barriers, American food imports increase. Thus, removing the dike simultaneously lowers domestic agricultural prices and raises world prices until they become identical.<p>
<li>    Dairy products are an exception.<p>
<li>    To maintain domestic prices of butter, cheese, and powdered milk, the federal government purchases any surplus of these products from processors at a fixed price ($10.35 per hundredweight in 1996). The federal government and the state of California use milk marketing orders that restrict the sale of fluid milk between different regions to maintain domestic milk prices. To limit foreign competition, the U.S. employs a tariff rate quota system that establishes country-by-country quotas for dairy imports. Under this system (as distinguished from a pure quota system), exporting countries may exceed their dairy import quotas, but the U.S. levies a prohibitively high tariff on dairy imports exceeding the quota.<p>
<li>    American exporters receive cash or surplus dairy products from the federal government as a bonus for exporting dairy products to targeted markets. This moves dairy products from the domestic market to targeted foreign markets such as Algeria, Brazil, Jamaica, India, Iraq, and Mexico, simultaneously raising domestic dairy prices while reducing dairy prices in targeted foreign markets.<p>
<li>    A tariff rate quota system differs from a pure quota system. It permits imports above the quota but also levies a prohibitively high tariff rate on them. Thus, imports effectively are limited to the quota amount in most circumstances. <p>
<li>    If Congress were allowed to amend trade agreements, Congress would likely accept the concessions that foreign governments made to reach a deal while voting to reject U.S. concessions. Such an outcome obviously is unacceptable to any foreign government. To encourage foreign governments to negotiate trade agreements with the United States, Congress devised the fast-track procedure to force itself to accept or reject trade agreements as a whole.<p>
<li>    The most important dispute concerns how to prevent telecommunications firms with monopolies in their home market for international services from undercutting other suppliers in competitive markets for international services. As a compromise, Australia proposed a safeguard that would allow a country to revoke a foreign firm's license to provide international services if that firm distorts the market with such cross-subsidies.<p>

<title>AID Should Release Economic Freedom Report Now - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>AID SHOULD RELEASE ECONOMIC FREEDOM REPORT NOW</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan T. Johnson</a><br>
Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 464<br>
October 16, 1996 <br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Concerned over the wastefulness of America's foreign aid program, Congress last year mandated that the Agency for International Development (AID) submit a report on the status of economic freedom in countries receiving U.S. aid. The report was due this summer. It is now October, however, and still no report. The Clinton Administration should fulfill its obligation under the law and submit AID's economic freedom report to Congress immediately.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Economic Freedom Report.</b> The appropriations bill for foreign operations, passed in November 1995 and signed into law by President Clinton in February 1996, requires AID to "submit to the appropriate congressional committees an annual report providing a concise overview of the prospects for economic and social growth.... For each country, the report shall discuss the laws, policies and practices of that country that most contribute to or detract from the achievement of this kind of growth."<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why this report has not been completed is a mystery. The reason certainly cannot be a lack of resources. With operating expenses of $465 million, 2,400 permanent employees, and some 6,000 long-term contractors and consultants, AID should have had no difficulty finding the resources to produce such a report and submit it to Congress on time.<sup>2</sup>  Nor can the reason be a lack of information on levels of economic freedom in the world. There now are three privately produced studies this subject: The Heritage Foundation's <i>Index of Economic Freedom</i>, Freedom House's <i>World Survey of Economic Freedom</i>, and the Fraser Institute's <i>Economic Freedom of the World</i>. While there are minor differences among these studies in the methodologies used to measure economic freedom, all three agree that economic freedom is essential to economic growth.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The most likely reason for AID's failure to submit its report is the low priority the foreign aid bureaucracy gives to economic freedom. For example, of the $12 billion in foreign aid spending, AID earmarks only 13 percent for what it calls "achieving sustainable development."  Of this 13 percent, most of money is spent to protect the environment, educate the poor, control populations, and immunize infants. Some of these programs may be useful, but they hardly qualify as programs aimed at promoting economic growth in less developed countries. A well-educated person living in a clean environment and given good health care will not be able to enjoy those benefits if private property is outlawed, there is no rule of law, and people are not free to work. Economic freedom, not environmental or population controls, creates economic growth.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>AID's Neglect of Economic Freedom.</b> This failure to understand the central role of economic freedom in economic development is a principal reason for AID's failed approach to foreign aid. The Heritage Foundation's 1996 <i>Index of Economic Freedom</i> evaluates the level of economic freedom in 142 countries. Examining taxation, trade and investment, banking, regulation, monetary, and other policies, the <i>Index</i> demonstrates that of these 142 countries, those with the greatest economic freedom also are the richest. Conversely, those that are the most economically repressed are the poorest. Consider the following:
<p><ul>
<li> Of the 76 countries ranked as "mostly unfree" or "repressed," 35 have received U.S. foreign aid for at least 36 years, many for as long as 52 years;
<p>
<li> Of these 35 countries, 25 are no better off economically today than they were before receiving aid;
<p>
<li> Of these 25, 13 actually are poorer today than they were over three decades ago.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The evidence in the <i>Index</i> demonstrates what many economists have known for years: No matter how much foreign aid is pumped into less developed economies, they will not grow economically until they begin to free their economies from excessive government constraint.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It was Congress's belief in this fact that prompted it last year to require that AID submit a report on economic freedom. Critics of AID will be watching to see how reliable and accurate it will be in evaluating the economic policies of U.S. aid recipients. They will be scrutinizing AID's assessment of barriers to U.S. exports, whether American companies are free to invest in other countries, and whether aid recipients still do not respect private property rights.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
With over 8,000 employees, consultants, and contractors, and $465 million in operating expenses, AID surely has enough resources to fulfill its legal obligations to Congress and the American people. By not submitting its report on economic freedom to Congress, AID is violating a specific congressional directive. Whether AID is finally giving economic freedom the attention it deserves cannot be known until it submits its report. However, one thing is already clear: The agency remains one of the most poorly run and ineffective in the U.S. government. AID should release its report on economic freedom immediately.

Conservative Successes in the 104<sup>th</sup> Congress</h3><br><hr></center><br>
<table border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=5><tr><td>
Conservatives have achieved amazing success in transforming government and the way Congress does business. Despite setbacks and  presidential vetos, the 104th Congress has met the high expectations of conservatives in several key areas by beginning a revolutionary reversal of failed liberal policies in such areas as welfare, agriculture, and regulation.
<p>
	It took 60 years to build the modern welfare state, and it will take more than just two years to do what is needed to reform it. The 104th Congress, however, has taken significant steps to reduce the size of the federal government and to empower states, local communities, and individuals. President Clinton has stated that "the era of big government is over." The 104th Congress actually has done something to turn this rhetoric into reality.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b><BR>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
U.S. military strength in Asia underpins deterrence and U.S. leadership in Asia. If the two Koreas were to reunify, American ground troops would likely be reduced, and American air power in Asia would become much more important in maintaining deterrence. China's recent purchase from Russia of co-production rights for the Sukhoi SU-27 <I>Flanker</I> jet fighter represents a significant step in Beijing's ambition to build a world-class air force. Currently, the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) is saddled with thousands of obsolete Soviet-era combat aircraft and is deficient in advanced munitions, electronic warfare systems, logistics, and training. The SU-27 will be China's first jet fighter with capabilities roughly equivalent to current U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine fighters. U.S. intelligence reportedly estimates that China may obtain up to 300 SU-27s. If successful in absorbing the Sukhoi's technology and production know-how, China eventually could challenge American air superiority in Asia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

To sustain deterrence in Asia, the U.S. must proceed with programs to build advanced fighter aircraft and munitions that will guarantee American air superiority in Asia. Specifically, the U.S. should:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Sustain funding for the F-22A jet fighter.</b> This is the only U.S. jet fighter currently in development that promises a clear level of superiority to the SU-27.

<p><li><b>Maintain 12 Navy aircraft carrier battle groups.</b> The Clinton defense budget puts at risk the Navy's ability to project power in Asia. Should budget pressures force a reduction in carrier battle groups, the Navy may be required to deploy its Seventh Fleet carrier, now homeported in Japan, to non-Asian trouble spots for increasing periods of time, thereby reducing the U.S. deterrent in Asia.

<p><li><b>Develop an air-superiority fighter for the Navy.</b> With the Navy's F-14 Tomcat to be phased out by 2010, the Navy will need a fighter that is clearly superior to the Russian SU-27.

<p><li><b>Accelerate development of a helmet-sighted missile and make advanced U.S. air-to-air missiles available to U.S. allies.</b> The U.S. and its allies should have such a system to counter current Russian helmet-sighted missiles sold to China.

<p><li><b>Develop advanced versions of the F-16 and F-18 for allied and friendly Asian air forces.</b> The danger is that the U.S. could lose sales to future European or Russian aircraft.

<p><li><b>Ask Russia and Israel to curtail sales of advanced combat aircraft and related technology to China.</b> Russia and Israel should be told that they are helping to accelerate a military modernization program that could destabilize Asia.
</ul>
<p>

<b>CHINA'S SU-27 DEAL</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In February, it was reported that Moscow and Beijing had reached agreement on a $2.2 billion deal for China to begin co-producing the Sukhoi SU-27.<sup>1</sup>  The Chinese designation for this aircraft will be the J-11. China had purchased an initial batch of 24 SU-27s in 1991 for about $1 billion. These aircraft were reported to have been delivered by the end of 1992 and are based at Wuhu Air Base, about 150 miles east of Shanghai.<sup>2</sup>  In May of last year, it was reported that China had purchased a second batch of 22 aircraft as a prelude to the larger co-production deal.<sup>3</sup>  Former Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said the second batch of SU-27s was delivered in April.<sup>4</sup>  These aircraft will be based at Suixi Air Base in Southern China.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Estimates vary as to the final number of SU-27s that China may purchase or co-produce. According to one report, the first co-production contract would enable the Chinese to produce 40 to 60 aircraft from Russian-made components over the next three years.<sup>5</sup>  According to another source, China may obtain a total of 72 to 78 SU-27s from this deal, enough to equip three regiments of the PLAAF, followed by co-production after five years.<sup>6</sup>  Yet another source states that China will purchase 120 sets of prefabricated components for assembly in China, with indigenous production phased in later.<sup>7</sup>  Finally, a Pentagon intelligence assessment concludes that China eventually may obtain as many as 300 SU-27s.<sup>8</sup>  In any event, it is reasonable to assume that the total could exceed 100; and if China masters full co-production, the total (to include Chinese-designed variants) could exceed several hundred.

<b>COMPARING THE SU-27 WITH CURRENT U.S. FIGHTERS</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Because the SU-27 will play a significant role in modernizing the PLAAF, it is useful to compare it to existing U.S. fighter aircraft. Some key performance parameters are listed in Table 1. Since entering service in 1986, the SU-27 has been the best fourth-generation air-superiority fighter in service with the Russian Air Force.<sup>9</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The SU-27 is roughly comparable to the F-15C, the best U.S. Air Force fighter. The F-15C is the only U.S. fighter used almost exclusively for air-superiority missions. Over 400 F-15Cs have been purchased by the United States Air Force, and 108 are deployed in U.S. Pacific Command.<sup>10</sup>  This aircraft accounted for 36 of the 39 USAF air-to-air victories in the Gulf War. The F-15C will remain the principal U.S. Air Force air-superiority fighter until replaced by the Lockheed-Martin F-22 later in the next decade.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The F-15C and the SU-27 have comparable ranges, though the SU-27 can carry ten missiles while the F-15C can carry eight. The F-15's ability to maneuver is about the same as the SU-27's.<sup>11</sup>  Both are capable of difficult maneuvers that stress the airframe to nine times the weight of the aircraft. The F-15C uses the AN/ANG-70 radar, which can detect targets about 100 miles away and can track and engage multiple targets. The SU-27's Phazatron N001 radar has a search range of over 62 miles with the ability to track 10 targets and engage two. However, unlike the F-15, the SU-27 is equipped with an infrared search and tracking (IRST) system with a range of from 15 to 31 miles that directs gun and missile systems.<sup>12</sup>  This system allows the <I>Flanker</I> to track and engage targets while turning off its radar, decreasing the chances of detection by opposing aircraft.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Grumman F-14, the U.S. Navy's primary air-superiority fighter, is a better all-around combat interception system than the SU-27. Were it not for the F-14's swing-wing, the SU-27 might be much more maneuverable that the F-14. The F-14 can carry six long-range or medium-range and two short-range air-to-air missiles (AAMs), but its unrefueled range is less than the SU-27's. With the added flexibility of a two-man crew, the F-14A's AN/AWG-9 weapons control system can detect targets out to 190 miles, track 24, and engage six at long range with its 100-mile-range AIM-54 <I>Phoenix</I> missiles.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Fourteen Navy squadrons are now equipped with F-14As, including two deployed with the Japan-based Seventh Fleet. The F-14A's principal weakness has been its Pratt and Whitney TF-30 turbofan engines, which are prone to stalling during hard maneuvers. This has led to engine failures and many crashes. Consequently, certain combat maneuvers are now restricted until these aircraft are modified with updated control systems. All F-14As are due to be retired from service by 2004. Over 90 F-14Bs, which now equip five Navy squadrons, have been fitted with more powerful and responsive General Electric F110 engines. The Navy also has acquired 56 F-14Ds with the F110 engines and more powerful radar combat systems. Three squadrons are outfitted with the F-14D. The F-14B and D are expected to serve through the next decade. A program to build a successor to the F-14, the A/F-X, was canceled by the Clinton Administration in 1993.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Later in the next decade, as the F-14 is being retired from U.S. Navy inventory, the numerically most important U.S. Navy fighter will be the F/A-18E/F. The Navy expects to purchase over 1,000 of these aircraft by 2015. They are designed to replace the current C/D version of the F/A-18, the F-14, and the long-range ground-attack Grumman A-6 <I>Intruder</I>.<sup>13</sup>  Compared to both versions of the F/A-18, however, the SU-27 has an advantage in unrefueled range and may be more maneuverable due to its more powerful engines and larger wing. The F/A-18E/F is about 25 percent larger than the C/D; has more powerful engines and a longer range because of larger external fuel tanks; and is to be equipped presently with an AN/AGP-73 multi-mode radar, which also equips the most current production model of the F/A-18C. More advanced radar upgrades already are planned for the F/A-18E.<sup>14</sup>  In terms of offensive and defensive electronic systems, the F-18E/F will be superior to the SU-27.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The F-16 also is a multi-role fighter designed for ground-attack as well as air-defense missions. It is the most numerous combat aircraft in the U.S. Air Force, currently numbering over 1,200 aircraft. Forces with the U.S. Pacific Command possess 138 F-16Cs, the major combat aircraft for South Korea. An earlier version, the F-16A, is the most capable combat aircraft in the air forces of Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand, and soon of Taiwan. Shorter in unrefueled range than the SU-27, the F-16C carries only six medium-range or short-range AAMs. The F-16 is a single-engine aircraft, while the SU-27, F-15, F-14, and F/A-18 are twin-engine aircraft with greater survivability in combat. The F-16 is roughly comparable to the SU-27 in maneuverability; both airframes can be stressed to nine times their weight.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Northrop F-5E <I>Tiger II</I> currently is the most numerous combat aircraft for Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The F-5E is no match for the SU-27 in maneuverability, range, or weapons load. Several companies offer upgrades for the F-5's radar and combat systems. These upgrades can ease pilot workload and increase search and detection capability, but they cannot alter the F-5's inferior aerodynamic performance. As a consequence, prosperous Asian countries are acquiring new, more capable aircraft like the F-16 and F-18.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>The U.S. Technology Advantage.</b> Compared to the SU-27, all current U.S. combat aircraft benefit from better cockpit design and better avionics. For example, the U.S. practice of placing most combat relevant information on a large Head-Up Display (HUD) which combines the functions of a monitor and a weapons sight, or on large, easy-to-read flat-panel displays on the instrument panel, increases combat potential by allowing pilots to spend more time watching for opposing aircraft than tending instruments. Better U.S. aircraft computers and cockpit displays enable U.S. pilots to evaluate information more quickly and accurately. By contrast, similar Russian systems used in early models of the SU-27 are less advanced. American aircraft also are equipped with better countermeasures against radar and missile threats. These include electronic jamming systems and decoys that use several methods to confuse attacking missiles.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine fighters have long benefited from a well-developed system of in-air refueling which extends range or combat patrol time. The U.S. also benefits from advanced airborne warning and control (AWACS) aircraft, such as the E-2C <I>Hawkeye</I> and E-3 <I>Sentry</I>. In addition, the three services employ a range of electronic intelligence aircraft that warn fighters of enemy radar and missile defenses. The Navy's EA-6B is designed to jam enemy radars, while the F-16 HTS, F/A-18, and EA-6B can use anti-radar missiles to destroy enemy air defenses.
<p>

<b>THE CHINESE AIR FORCE AND THE CHALLENGE OF THE SU-27</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The acquisition of the SU-27 and its production rights marks a major turn for the Chinese Air Force. Nevertheless, this service is beset with major weaknesses. The foremost is that the PLAAF currently is saddled with over 2,000 aircraft (including MiG-19s, MiG-21s, and TU-16s) of 1950s-era Soviet design comparable to outdated U.S. fighters like the F-100, F-8, and B-47. These aircraft are no match for current U.S. jet fighters. In addition, the Chinese Air Force lacks the capability to refuel its combat aircraft during flight, and this shortens their range. It also is bereft of AWACS aircraft that manage air battles, fire-and-forget long-range air-to-air missiles, anti-radar missiles to attack enemy air defenses, and precision-guided munitions (PGMs) like laser-guided bombs. These systems were critical to U.S. air superiority during the Persian Gulf War.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The PLAAF compares poorly to the USAF and some Asian air forces in areas of training and maintenance. A RAND Corporation study issued last year concludes that Chinese Air Force pilots do not fly as often as their U.S. counterparts.<sup>15</sup>  Chinese pilots typically fly 100 hours a year, while U.S. pilots train more than 200 hours per year. Chinese air combat tactics resemble old Soviet-style tactics that stress tight ground control of aircraft.<sup>16</sup>  PLAAF commanders place a high priority on flight safety, and this reduces pilots' initiative and inhibits the utilization of aircraft to their fullest capabilities. While the PLAAF is beginning to utilize "Aggressor" squadrons which specialize in adversarial combat tactics in an attempt to raise tactical skills proficiency, it remains to be seen whether these new training squadrons will be effective. The PLAAF also faces another severe problem:  a lack of spare parts. One of the reasons for this is that production standards vary between differing aircraft and engine manufacturers, inhibiting interchangability of parts between aircraft and engines of the same type.<sup>17</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

RAND questioned whether China can afford the SU-27 as well as indigenous aircraft programs, pointing to recent reforms that have devalued China's currency, thereby reducing PLA purchasing power.<sup>18</sup>  However, the actual size of China's defense budget is unknown. Official figures typically fail to include all military-related expenditures and earnings from PLA-controlled businesses. For example, while the official 1994 PLA defense budget figure was $6 billion, the Washington-based Defense Budget Project estimates that it could range between $92 billion and $143 billion.<sup>19</sup>  A higher budget such as this increases the possibility that the PLA could afford multiple new aircraft programs.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The RAND study estimated that China would have only 70 SU-27s in the year 2005.<sup>20</sup>  The SU-27 co-production agreement suggests that China has placed a greater emphasis on acquiring higher numbers of this aircraft in addition to its production technology. The PLA appears to want a phased transition to full co-production, preceded by domestic assembly of a large number of aircraft from major components fabricated in Russia. Co-production of the SU-27 will be difficult for the Chinese because this aircraft incorporates technologies the Chinese cannot yet produce. But PLA aircraft manufacturers will benefit from advanced Russian production techniques and from the presence of Russian technicians, who will assist SU-27 assembly and eventual production.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Chinese Air Force Difficulties with the SU-27.</b> Integrating the SU-27 into its inventory will not be easy for the PLAAF. The Chinese Air Force has had difficulty maintaining the SU-27 and was not prepared for its additional cost. Moreover, some runways are not capable of handling this heavier fighter aircraft.<sup>21</sup>  However, the SU-27 is being used in exercises. In August 1995, Chinese SU-27s approached the Senkaku Islands north of Taiwan, which are claimed by China, Japan, and Taiwan. And in March 1996, the SU-27 flew in major military exercises intended to intimidate Taiwan on the eve of its presidential election. The SU-27 possibly will be seen more frequently over the South China Sea, flying from Suixi Air Base in South China. From Wuhu and Suixi Bases, the SU-27 can reach Taiwan, many disputed areas in the South China Sea, and U.S. forces based on Okinawa (see map). Despite early difficulties in tactics and training, as well as enduring PLAAF institutional constraints, it is entirely possible that as more SU-27s enter service, the PLAAF will learn how to exploit this system to its fullest capabilities some time in the next decade.

OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THAT MAY ASSIST CHINA'S AIR FORCE MODERNIZATION

	</b><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Advanced military technology from Russia and Israel plays a major role in China's effort to modernize its military forces. This is especially true for the PLAAF. Russia in particular is viewed by China as a potential source for many systems and technologies that comprise a modern, all-weather, multi-mission air force. Advanced air-to-air missiles, precision-guided munitions, radar aircraft, and electronic countermeasures are all on China's shopping list. For now, Russia appears to be more interested in profit than in any potential threat to its interests arising from sales to China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Advantage <i>Archer</i>.</b> The SU-27 is equipped with a series of advanced Russian missiles that in some cases exceed or equal U.S. missile capabilities. The PLAAF is the only air force in Asia to possess the Russian R-73 (NATO codename:  AA-11 <i>Archer</i>) air-to-air missile. China is believed to have an early version of the <i>Archer </i>(M1) and is known to have used it against parachute flares during March 1996 exercises near Taiwan. The AA-11 is the first effective "helmet-sighted" air-to-air missile to be employed anywhere. With this missile, a pilot can aim his weapon by turning his head, and does not have to line up his plane with the target, which has been the main practice in aerial combat since World War I. The M1 version can be fired 45 degrees off the aircraft's forward line-of-direction, or off-boresight, to a range of 12.4 miles (see chart).<sup>22</sup>  The M2 version of the AA-11 can be fired up to 60 degrees off-boresight and has a range of 18.6 miles.<sup>23</sup>  In targeting aircraft beyond visual range, the AA-11 can be cued by the <i>Flanker's </i>infrared tracking system.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In the hands of a capable pilot, the <i>Archer </i>conveys a decisive margin for victory. During 1994 air combat exercises between German and U.S. aircraft, MiG-29s of the German Air Force armed with the less capable version of the <i>Archer </i>had a clear advantage over U.S. F-16s armed with <i>Sidewinder</i>.<sup>24</sup>  Even though the F-16 was able to outmaneuver the MiG in 60 percent of the exercise engagements, the MiG already had "fired" its <i>Archer</i>, meaning the F-16 most likely was defeated.<sup>25</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The U.S. is not expected to field a helmet-sighted thrust-vectored AAM for at least six years. The AIM-9M <i>Sidewinder</i>, the most modern U.S. short-range air-to-air missile -- which lacks a helmet sight -- can acquire targets only 27.5 degrees off the forward line-of-sight and has a range of only 4.8 miles. American defense officials assert that the lack of a helmet-sighted missile is compensated for by the 32-mile-range Advanced Medium-Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM). This missile, called the AIM-120, is guided by its own radar, allowing the pilot to break aircraft radar contact with the target and begin evasion. This was not the case with earlier U.S. radar-guided missiles. U.S. officials argue that the AIM-120 confers much of the same tactical flexibility as the <i>Archer</i>.<sup>26</sup>  However, the U.S. still has some difficulty in exploiting the long range of the AIM-120. For one thing, it has problems with identifying targets.<sup>27</sup>  Moreover, this missile cannot be used by the F-16A or the F-5E. While U.S. fighters in Asia have the AIM-120, so far only South Korea and Thailand are approved to buy it. Equipped with AIM-120, the F-15, F-14, F-16, and F/A-18 all have a fighting chance against the SU-27. But the Russians also have their AIM-120 equivalent in the AA-12. This missile could be marketed to China in the future, and apparently has been offered for sale to the U.S.<sup>28</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

China also could acquire newer, more advanced Russian missiles and precision-guided munitions. For example, the Kh-17 (NATO codename:  AS-17 <i>Krypton</i>) missile has multiple versions that are designed to attack ships and AWACS radar aircraft at long range. The U.S. Navy is evaluating this missile for possible use as a target to simulate future threats for naval missile defense systems. One version of this missile is credited with a 125-mile range, and all versions are capable of flying at almost three times the speed of sound.<sup>29</sup>  U.S. Naval Intelligence also is concerned about a new 200-mile-range AAM designed to attack AWACS and other long-range radar aircraft.<sup>30</sup>  Russia also produces a series of laser-guided and television-guided bombs that could arm future variants of the SU-27 produced by China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Russian Technology and China's SU-27s.</b> Russia now plans to market advanced versions of the SU-27 to China, as it already has to India. There are reports that a deal for China to purchase the more advanced SU-30 broke down over financing disagreements.<sup>31</sup>  The SU-30 is a two-seat dedicated attack variant of the SU-27 with more advanced attack systems that allow for delivery of precision-guided munitions.<sup>32</sup>  Moscow and Beijing also may have discussed Chinese co-production of the SU-35.<sup>33</sup>  The SU-35 features a better cockpit display, better missile fire-control systems, and forward horizontal control surfaces that boost maneuverability. According to Lt. General George Muellner, Principal Deputy to the Air Force Assistant Secretary, the SU-35's "missile fire control system is as good or better than the F-15."<sup>34</sup>  Sukhoi unveiled last year a variant of the SU-35 with thrust-vectored engines, called the SU-37, which Russian pilots claim will be "10-times" better in close-in dogfights than unmodified fighters.<sup>35</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>AWACS and Aerial Refueling.</b> A number of reports indicate China also is seeking other "force-multipliers" the U.S. has long utilized, like AWACS and air-refueling capabilities. Russian AWACS aircraft and Israel's <i>Phalcon </i>early-warning aircraft appear to be on Beijing's shopping list.<sup>36</sup>  In a reported $250 million deal with China, Israel will put its <i>Phalcon </i>200-mile-range airborne early warning radar on a Russian Il-76 transport aircraft.<sup>37</sup>  This aircraft may also carry advanced Israeli electronic sensing and intelligence systems. China is reported to have modified up to five of its H-6 bombers to refuel J-8II <i>Finback </i>fighters -- the most advanced fighter China currently produces. This extends the range of the J-8II from 430 to over 630 miles. U.S. intelligence reportedly estimates China may convert up to 20 H-6 bombers into air-to-air refueling aircraft.<sup>38</sup>  China's SU-27s are not modified for air-to-air refueling, but this capability could be acquired later.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

China is using Russian technology to upgrade the J-8II with modern radar and engines which give the aircraft greater combat capability.<sup>39</sup>  An upgraded version of this aircraft, the J-8II M, was test-flown at the end of March.<sup>40</sup> There are about 200 J-8s in the Chinese Naval Air Force and Air Force. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

China is co-developing the FC-1 lightweight fighter with Pakistan which also may use a Russian engine radar and avionics, or a European radar.<sup>41</sup>This aircraft may be slightly less maneuverable than the F-16, and China initially may buy 100 copies. The FC-1 also could be marketed as a low-cost successor to aircraft such as the F-5E and Mig-21, which continue to be used widely in less-developed countries.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Israeli Assistance and China's J-10 Advanced Fighter Program.</b> Israel maintains a quiet but significant military technology relationship with China. Its largest military program with China involves the development of the J-10 advanced fighter aircraft, modeled on Israel's <i>Lavi </i>fighter that was canceled in 1987.<sup>42</sup>  Russian radar and engines also may feature prominently in the J-10 program.<sup>43</sup>  Last year, RAND Corporation analyst Mark Lorell concluded that the J-10 will benefit from the <i>Lavi's </i>"advanced airframe technology, [and] superior avionics.... "<sup>44</sup> China revealed in April a model of the J-10 that was similar to the <i>Lavi</i>. The model also showed the J-10 armed with the PL-10 short-range air-to-air missile, a copy of the Israeli <i>Python </i><i>3 </i>missile. The U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence estimates the J-10 may be more maneuverable than the F/A-18E/F but will carry less sophisticated radar and countermeasures.<sup>45</sup>  The first prototype may fly this year, and China eventually may produce 300 J-10s.<sup>46</sup>  Washington is concerned that U.S.-originated technology from the <i>Lavi </i>has been transferred to China.<sup>47</sup>  Israel is reported to have rebuffed Clinton Administration attempts to end this program.<sup>48</sup>

<b>Could China's SU-27 Go to Sea?</b> Central Military Commission (CMC) Vice President Liu Haquing, a former top PLA Navy commander, believes China needs the ability to dominate the Pacific from Japan down to the Philippines and should be able to fight as far away as Guam.<sup>49</sup>  Acquiring an aircraft carrier to help fulfill this goal appears to be a high PLA priority, and there are reports that at a December meeting of the CMC, President Jaing Zemin endorsed construction of an aircraft carrier as part of the next five-year plan.<sup>50</sup>  However, the cost of a carrier and its attendant defensive and logistic support ships may prove prohibitive for the Chinese Navy. But should China acquire its first aircraft carrier, perhaps in the next decade, the U.S. could face a Chinese sea-borne version of the SU-27. China could follow the example of Russia, which now uses a version of the SU-27 (called the SU-33) as the principal combat aircraft for its sole aircraft carrier, the <I>Admiral Kuznetzov.</I> Unlike the basic version of the SU-27, the SU-33 is equipped for air-to-air refueling, both to receive fuel and to carry a modified fuel tank that can perform in-flight refueling. The SU-33's engines generate enough thrust to allow the use of a ski-jump to get airborne, eliminating the need for complex steam-driven catapults used on U.S. Navy carriers.
<p>

<b>MEETING THE CHALLENGE OF CHINA'S SU-27</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

American leadership in Asia rests upon several factors, including a willingness to maintain sufficient military force to deter potential adversaries. In the event Korea is reunified, the U.S. very likely will withdraw ground troops stationed there, leaving the Air Force and the Navy to function as the dominant elements of the U.S. military presence in Asia. The U.S. Pacific Command now relies on about 350 Air Force, Navy, and Marine fighter and attack aircraft deployed in South Korea, Japan, Alaska, and Hawaii. One aircraft carrier, the <I>USS Independence</I>, provides the most flexible component of American airpower in Asia. In March 1996, two carrier battle groups, led by the <i>Independence </i>and the <I>USS Nimitz</I>, were ordered to locations near Taiwan in response to China's threatening military exercises. The U.S. reportedly has decided to halt regular Middle East deployments by the <I>Independence</I> in order to respond to possible scenarios involving North Korea or China.<sup>51</sup>  Such is the importance of U.S. naval power to peace and stability in Asia.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Were it to occur, China's acquisition of large numbers of SU-27s would pose a serious challenge to U.S. air superiority. Since World War II, American military commanders have aimed to establish air superiority in order to win battles on the sea and ground. Although China may not today be able to utilize the SU-27 to its fullest extent, it cannot be assumed that this will continue indefinitely. To sustain deterrence, the U.S. needs to maintain its all-around edge in strategy, tactics, and weapons systems.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In particular, aircraft that are "good enough" or slightly superior to the SU-27 do not provide a sufficient margin of superiority to guarantee U.S. dominance in the air. The U.S. must proceed with plans to field advanced combat aircraft superior to the SU-27. Current and future aircraft must be equipped with an effective helmet-sighted missile to counter the <i>Archer</i>. Failure to do so risks allowing the Asian balance of power to shift dangerously in favor of China. To prevent this from happening, Washington should:<p>

<b>Sustain funding for the F-22A jet fighter.</b><br>
To ensure U.S. air superiority in Asia, the U.S. should proceed with full funding for the Lockheed-Martin F-22A. This aircraft promises better uses of radar-evading stealth technology, engines that can achieve supersonic speeds without using fuel-guzzling afterburners, thrust vectoring that enhances maneuverability at high speeds, and advanced radar and electronic combat systems. It can carry four short-range air-to-air missiles and up to ten AMRAAM missiles and has a combat range comparable to the F-15C. There are suggestions from Pentagon officials that the planned purchase of 442 F-22As may be cut in half due to funding constraints.<sup>52</sup>  This would be a mistake because it would likely reduce the number of F-22As, which are needed to deter potential adversaries. The Air Force is requesting $2 billion for FY 1997 for research and development as part of an expected $70 billion program. This is indeed expensive, but the F-22A is the only U.S. fighter in development that can offer decisive air superiority for U.S. forces.
<p>
<b>Maintain 12 Navy aircraft carrier battle groups.</b><br>
The U.S. Navy needs at least 12 aircraft carrier battle groups in order to sustain peacetime security commitments. These commitments include the maintenance of one carrier battle group with the Seventh Fleet in Japan. However, the Clinton defense budget could force a reduction to eight carrier battle groups by the year 2002. If this occurs, the U.S. may have to deploy its Seventh Fleet carrier to potential crisis areas outside of Asia,<sup>53</sup> in which case carriers would not be available to respond sufficiently to some future Chinese provocation against Taiwan. This would be regarded by Washington's friends and potential adversaries in Asia as a significant reduction in the traditional U.S. commitment to preserve peace in Asia. To deter future potential conflicts in Asia that could damage U.S. economic and military security, the U.S. must have 12 carrier battle groups to sustain deterrence.
<p>
<b>Develop an air-superiority fighter for the Navy.</b><br>
The Clinton Administration should review its 1993 decision to forgo development of a dedicated successor to the Navy's F-14 fighter aircraft. The A/F-X program, canceled in 1993, had attracted proposals from Lockheed to develop a naval variant of the F-22. If U.S. naval task forces are to be superior to all opponents, the Navy will need a fighter with at least the capability of the F-22. While the F/A-18E/F is an impressive aircraft that incorporates advances in air combat and ground-attack systems, it does not present a decisive advance in capability over the SU-27/35 family. The Navy needs the F/A-18E/F to fulfill fighter and ground attack missions. But the Navy also needs an aircraft that will guarantee naval air superiority against the SU-27 and its advanced variants. In the meantime, as the F-14A is cycled out of Navy inventory early in the next decade, it is essential that the Asia-deployed Seventh Fleet receive priority in retaining F-14B/Ds.
<p>
The only other major combat aircraft program in the Navy's future is the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), which is scheduled to enter service after 2010. But this aircraft also is the next major aircraft program for the Marines and the Air Force. In all, the JSF is intended to replace such diverse aircraft as the A-6, the AV-8 <i>Harrier</i>, Britain's <I>Sea Harrier</I>, the F-14, the F-16, and the F-18. The Air Force wants an F-16 replacement that is inexpensive, while the Navy seeks stealthy long-range strike aircraft. The JSF is not expected to be much larger or much more maneuverable than an F-16, but it will incorporate stealth and advanced combat systems. According to General Muellner, for the Air Force, the JSF would "not be on the leading edge of air supremacy," but would compliment the F-22.<sup>54</sup>  The Navy version of the JSF should pay greater attention to the air-superiority mission, meaning increased range and increased internal air-to-air missile carriage; if it cannot approach the air superiority capabilities of the F-22, the Navy should be directed to begin development of a fighter that provides a dedicated replacement for the F-14.
<p>
<b>Accelerate development of a helmet-sighted missile and make advanced U.S. air-to-air missiles available to U.S. allies.</b><br>
It is critical that the Pentagon be directed to accelerate the development of a helmet-sighted and highly maneuverable short-range AAM. Israel, for example, was able to field its 90-degree off-boresight-capable, helmet-sighted <I>Python 4</I> short-range AAM in about half the time it is expected to take the U.S. to field its helmet-sighted AAM.<sup>55</sup>  A former senior Joint Chiefs of Staff officer was quoted recently as saying that "For the Air Force and Navy not to have a helmet-mounted sight and off-boresight missile is absolutely criminal."<sup>56</sup>  U.S. aircraft and those of Asian allies armed only with <i>Sidewinder </i>AAMs are at a distinct disadvantage when compared with Chinese SU-27s armed with the Russian <i>Archer </i>AAM. When a helmet-sighted missile enters U.S. service, it also should be made available for sale to Asian allies and friends. In the meantime, the U.S. should sell the AIM-120 to allies and friends with compatible aircraft. Specifically, the AIM-120 should be offered to the Republic of China as its F-16s enter service next year.
<p>
<b>Develop advanced versions of the F-15, F-16, and F-18 for allied and friendly Asian air forces.</b><br>
Most countries in Asia, except possibly Japan, will not be able to afford the F-22. The JSF also may prove to be too expensive. Therefore, the U.S. should develop advanced, more affordable versions of the F-16 and the F/A-18E/F for Asian friends and allies. The danger is that unmodified U.S. types could lose markets to newer and very capable European combat aircraft like the French <I>Rafale</I> and the <I>Eurofighter-2000</I>.<sup>57</sup>  Maintaining commonality between U.S. and Asian air forces is an important U.S. interest.
<p>
<b>Ask Russia and Israel to curtail advanced weapons sales to China.</b><br>
Sales of advanced military technology to China do more than strengthen China's military capabilities:  They also constitute a potential threat to regional peace and stability. To Russia, the U.S. should stress that a well-armed China could be less benign and more inclined, for example, to press old territorial claims. To Israel, the U.S. should stress that China might sell advanced aircraft to rogue states like Iran which pose a threat to Israel. Last June, for example, China was suspected of having shipped missile components or technology to Syria.<sup>58</sup>  The U.S. also should enlist its allies and friends in Asia to warn Russia and Israel that by arming China, they are creating a potential threat to peace.


<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

For over 50 years, the United States has enjoyed air superiority in Asia. American industry has produced combat aircraft that have been proven superior over Korea, the Taiwan Strait, Vietnam, the Middle East, and the Persian Gulf. With the demise of the Soviet Union, delay in building a fifth-generation fighter to succeed the F-15 and F-14 was justifiable. But should it occur, China's acquisition of a large inventory of SU-27 aircraft would present a major challenge to American air superiority in Asia. This poses the first major post-Cold War challenge to U.S. strategy in Asia, as America's ability to deter conflict in Asia will rely increasingly on air power.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

To preserve U.S. air superiority and sustain deterrence in Asia in the next century, the U.S. should produce the F-22A jet fighter, field a helmet-sighted air to air missile, and make the AIM-120 advanced air to air missile available to allies and friends like the Republic of China. Equally important, it also is time to re-examine whether an F-14 follow-on must be built if U.S. naval air power is to retain the superiority critical to sustaining the credibility of U.S. naval forces in Asia. Finally, the U.S. should tell Russia and Israel that their sale to China of advanced weapons and technology is helping to create a potential threat to the peace and stability of the Asia region.

  <p><li> The F-15 has slightly better thrust-to-weight ratio, though wing-loadings are even at combat weights. A greater thrust-to-weight ratio and a lower wing-loading confers better combat potential. These variables help determine acceleration and turn rate in combat, and improve as aircraft weight decreases through fuel consumption. The SU-27 is said to have an instantaneous turn rate of 20 to 22 degrees per second and a sustained turn rate of 14 to 16 degrees per second.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress has kept its promise to the American people that it would begin to cut regulatory red tape and return common sense to regulation. It has reduced the size and cost of government and increased the health and well-being of all Americans. But alarmists have done a good job of convincing the American people that exactly the opposite has been true, seizing the moral high ground with rhetoric designed to convince the public that a reformed regulatory system would have disastrous consequences. Nevertheless, this Congress can point to a record of solid reforms and progress toward a more flexible and less burdensome regulatory system that will cost less and achieve the same or higher levels of public health, safety, and environmental protection.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What is the reality?  Legislation passed by the 104th Congress and signed into law:
<p>
<ul> 
<li> Repealed the federally mandated 55-mph speed limit that had been on the books since 1974.
<p>
<li> Deregulated two major industries: agriculture and telecommunications. Farmers will now be able to grow what their customers want, not what bureaucrats demand.
<p>
<li> Stemmed the tide of costly new unfunded mandates on states and localities.
<p>
<li> Moved away from "one-size-fits-all" regulations by making it easier for the needs of small businesses to be taken into consideration.
<p>
<li> Established clear goals for agencies to reduce the paperwork burden, which will save Americans as much as 70 million hours of their time (valued at more than $1 billion) this year to use for more productive activities.
<p>
<li> Made itself directly accountable to the public by giving itself the authority to review and stop burdensome, unjustified new regulations developed by federal regulators.
<p>
<li> Forced a review by the Clinton Administration of all existing and proposed federal regulations.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition, Congress:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Passed and sent to the President the Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act, which would have required federal regulators to follow a set of rational principles in deciding whether and how to regulate. These include the use of cost-benefit analysis, sound science, and risk assessment, as well as market-based alternatives and performance standards. President Clinton vetoed this bill.
<p>
<li> Passed and sent to the President with bipartisan support the Common Sense Liability Reform Act which would have curbed abuses of the legal system by relieving the crushing burden of frivolous and unfounded cases brought against state and local governments, charitable organizations, and America's product manufacturers. President Clinton vetoed this bill.
<p>
<li> Passed legislation to reduce the existing burdens of the Safe Drinking Water Act, one the largest unfunded environmental mandates. Signed by President Clinton on August 6, 1996, the legislation will give states and localities the flexibility to target their resources more effectively to achieve greater levels of protection.
<p>
<li> Started an important national debate about how to resurrect commonsense regulation. This Congress, for example, introduced proposals to restructure the Superfund program in ways that would encourage faster cleanups, eliminate most of the need for lawyers and the courts, and reduce federal spending while improving public health, safety, and the environment. Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration so far has blocked reform, choosing to leave in place a program in which one-third of the money will continue to go to lawyers and transaction costs while failing to clean up many of the most hazardous waste sites.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Taken together, in just 18 months this Congress has accomplished and initiated the most significant changes in more than 20 years, and has changed the terms of the debate in a way that will affect the shape of federal regulation for decades.

<p>
<b>THE BOLDEST AGENDA IN 20 YEARS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Alarmists did a good job in this first round, convincing the American public that regulatory reform was just another term for the rollback of important public health, safety, and environmental protections. As a result, Congress has not yet seen many of its most ambitious efforts to reform the Superfund program, the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, the Food and Drug Administration, or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration signed into law. Many in Congress believe they lost the battle to reduce the burden of regulation and cut away the approximately $700 billion in red tape<sup>2</sup> that strangles American businesses and consumers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Nothing, however, could be further from the truth. In less than two years, the 104th Congress accomplished unprecedented and far-reaching reforms that impose discipline on the federal regulatory decisionmaking process, deregulate the agriculture and telecommunications industries, and fundamentally change the way the federal government and the American people think about public health, safety, and environmental regulation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Surpassing Reagan.</b> The regulatory agenda of the 104th Congress is the boldest of the past 20 years. The successful enactment of legislation to deregulate the agriculture and telecommunications industries is comparable to the transportation deregulation successes of the late 1970s.<sup>3</sup>  Although the Reagan Administration had bold intentions to reverse the growth of economic and social regulation, the completed action fell short. Other than modest steps to deregulate the energy and communications industries and a new administrative review process that enjoyed some success in reducing the rate and cost of new rules, for example, the Reagan Administration could not follow through with new versions of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and Superfund, or with FDA or OSHA reform.<sup>4</sup>  Thus, the 104th Congress stands alone in the scope and scale of its reform efforts. Until now, the deregulatory accomplishments of the last 20 years focused on freeing industries to rely on market forces. But the 104th Congress also has taken on for the first time the rapid expansion of major health, safety, and environmental programs which have increased steadily since the 1970s. The costs of these "social" regulations, particularly environmental regulation, has almost tripled over the last 20 years from about $80 billion in 1977 to more than $220 billion in 1995.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress needed to take such bold action because the problems have never been worse. For example:
<p>
<ul>
<li> According to <a href="/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a>, the total cost of government has been estimated at $3.38 trillion, nearly $1 trillion of which results from federal and state regulation. The federal government is responsible for imposing more than $700 billion in regulatory costs each year: more than $2,800 for every man, woman, and child in America. Of the 366 days in 1996, the average American will work 184.6 days for the government. More than 40 of these days will be just to pay for the cost of federal regulations.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<li> As the number of regulations has grown, so has the number of federal regulators enforcing these rules. The number of permanent, full-time regulatory staff has increased from 69,946 in 1970 to 128,566 in 1994.<sup>7</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
 And more is not always better. A seminal new study from Harvard University reveals that roughly 60,000 lives are lost every year because of the current command-and-control regulatory system, which squanders billions of dollars on efforts to eliminate risks that are negligible or nonexistent while failing to protect the public from others that are much more serious.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress has fought to bring common sense back to the way federal agencies make decisions about whether and how to regulate to improve the environment and public health and safety. Today, federal regulators are no longer giving Americans the highest levels of protection for the billions of dollars they take from taxpayers, consumers, and businesses. By making sure that regulators follow rational principles that tell them to evaluate risks sensibly and consistently, consider the costs and benefits of their actions, and use market-based solutions, policymakers can do an even better job of protecting the environment and public health and safety while spending less and with fewer rules.
<p>
<b>COMMONSENSE REGULATORY REFORMS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In just 18 months, the 104th Congress has put in place a number of important reforms that will provide significant benefits to the economy and the well-being of all Americans.
<p>
<b>The Telecommunications Act of 1996</b><br>
The 104th Congress succeeded in passing the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-104), signed into law by President Clinton on February 8, 1996. This is the most important industry-wide deregulatory initiative undertaken by Congress in over a decade. The Act removes unnecessary layers of federal rules governing telephone, cable, and broadcasting competition.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Act eventually will eliminate restrictions that prohibit competition between local and long-distance companies, as well as cable companies, so that they can offer consumers a full range of communications and entertainment services.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One 1993 study estimated that complete deregulation would help create 3.6 million more jobs by 2003 and pass along savings of roughly $63 billion a year to consumers.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Although the Telecommunications Act does not go quite as far as the more rapid, comprehensive deregulation this study envisioned, comparable gains can still be expected over time as a result of the bill.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Deregulation also will mean the end of the Cable Act of 1992, numerous restrictions on beneficial merger and alliance activity, and many other needless Federal Communications Commission activities.
<p>

<b>The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996</b><br>
The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-127) eliminates federal programs that manipulate production and prices of major crops (wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice) through production subsidies and acreage reduction. This legislation will mean greater freedom and enormous opportunities for rural America. By dismantling much of the restrictive straitjacket on farmers, the new law will free the U.S. economy -- farmers and related businesses -- to take full advantage of the growing global market, which should mean huge economic benefits for Americans. According to an analysis by The Heritage Foundation,<sup>10</sup> the new law will mean that:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Farmers will earn an additional $16 billion in net income between 1996 and 2002.
<p>
<li> Suppliers of the inputs used in agricultural production will sell an additional $14.6 billion in products during the same period.
<p>
<li> Taken together, the agriculture community will enjoy a rise of $30.6 billion in income.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition, the Act establishes an Environmental Quality Improvement Program to provide funds for a cooperative effort with farmers to protect wetlands, using a flexible, incentive-oriented approach while increasing wetland acreage under the conservation program. 
<p>
<b>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</b><br>
In response to the increasingly hostile reaction of states and localities to unchecked and costly federal mandates, Congress in March 1995 enacted the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-4). The Act requires Congress to take into consideration the cost to states, localities, and Indian tribes of new mandates. Federal agencies must assess the impact of new regulations both on state, local, and tribal governments and on the private sector; and the U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations is tasked with a review of existing mandates.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One year later, states already feel the relief from new unfunded mandates.<sup>11</sup>  Thanks to this legislation, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is tasked with estimating the costs of these new legislative mandates. Now many Members of Congress can find out the costs of proposed mandates and reduce the cost to the states.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Some examples of how these additional consultations and deliberations have resulted in important policy changes that saved hundreds of millions dollars:
<blockquote><p>
<b>Immigration.</b> The benefits of CBO's input were evident in the development of the immigration bill. Originally, the Senate bill required that all drivers' licenses without valid Social Security numbers would be invalid immediately upon the date of enactment of the law. CBO estimated that this would cost from $80 million-$200 million for states that would have to purchase new equipment and make other necessary changes to handle the volume of people who suddenly would need to have new licenses issued. <sup>12</sup> This provision was changed in the final legislation to allow for a six-year phase-in period during which states could renew licenses when they normally would come up for renewal. This dropped the costs to states to around $20 million.
<p>
<b>Agriculture.</b> The House version of the farm bill contained provisions that would require milk sold for fluid uses to contain greater amounts of nonfat solids than currently required and lock in higher fluid milk prices under the archaic Milk Marketing Order System. CBO estimated the direct costs of this provision to dairy processors and manufacturers at somewhere between $800 million and $1 billion annually. The final farm bill did not contain a national higher fluid milk standard, and CBO's estimates were used to help make the case for its elimination.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
<b>Health Care.</b> The Kennedy-Kassebaum health care reform bill initially included a provision that would have required insurers to provide the same benefits for mental health coverage as for other illnesses, and the case for dropping this unjustified mandate was greatly facilitated by CBO estimates of the cost. The CBO noted that imposing this mandated benefit on private health insurance would have huge public and private sector costs. It projected that the Senate mandate would impose $423 million in additional costs on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) between 1996 and 2002, rising to $739 million by 2005. If it was applied to Medicare and Medicaid, program outlays would increase by almost $80 billion for Medicare between 1997 and 2000, and by another $35 billion for Medicaid during the same period. CBO also estimated that the premiums for traditional fee-for-service plans would increase by 5.3 percent, while managed care plans would see an increase of 4 percent.<sup>14</sup>  The costly provision was taken out of the bill.
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The National Highway System Designation Act (P.L. 104-59)</b> ended a burdensome, costly unfunded mandate requiring states to satisfy a minimum tonnage utilization requirement for asphalt pavement containing recycled rubber on federal-aid projects. According to the CBO, the Federal Highway Administration estimates that states would save up to $1 billion annually in paving costs by not having to comply with the crumb rubber requirements.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Amendments to the 1990 Clean Air Act employee commute option (ECO) program (P.L. 104-70)</b> make the program optional for states if they can undertake alternative methods that will achieve equivalent emissions reductions. While the EPA had estimated the cost of the ECO program at $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion annually,<sup>16</sup> it also called the impact of the program "minuscule" because it proved to be relatively ineffective at achieving emission reductions.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Land Disposal Program Flexibility Act (P.L. 104-119)</b> exempts waste determined to be non-hazardous under the Clean Water Act or Safe Drinking Water Act from regulation under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, since chemical compounds safe enough to drink presumably are safe enough to bury. Municipal solid waste landfills likewise are exempt from ground water monitoring requirements if they are small (waste disposals of less than 20 tons daily).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Repeal of the federal speed limit.</b> As part of the National Highway system bill that President Clinton signed on November 28, 1995, the federally mandated 55-mph speed limit was repealed unconditionally. Beginning on December 8, 1995, states were able to begin freely adjusting speed limits within their boundaries. Several states immediately took action to raise their limits in response to the bill.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

<b>Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996</b> Small businesses are the engine of economic growth in this country. For small business owners, Washington looms as "public enemy number one." Small businesses want to get government off their backs so they can do what they do best -- create jobs and generate tax revenue -- without the excessive burden of reporting and regulatory compliance.<sup>18</sup>  Regulation also does not affect all businesses equally. "One-size-fits-all" regulations impose the heaviest burden on small and medium-sized businesses because they find it harder to spread the high overhead costs of paperwork, attorney and accountant fees, and staff time needed to negotiate the federal regulatory maze.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In response to the concerns of small business, Congress passed the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) of 1996 (P.L. 104-121), which was signed by the President on March 29, 1996. This legislation:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Authorizes judicial enforcement of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, which requires agencies to provide information on the impact of their regulations on small businesses and other entities;
<p>
<li> Allows small business to recoup expenses and legal fees incurred when agencies make excessive demands for penalties that cannot be sustained in court;
<p>
<li> Provides for an independent ombudsman to receive confidential complaints from small businesses about their dealings with federal regulators; and
<p>
<li> Requires federal agencies to prepare "Plain English" compliance guides spelling out in easy-to-follow language how small businesses can comply with federal regulations.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress deserves credit for this modest reform in the face of the Clinton Administration's overwhelming opposition to more fundamental reforms that small businesses desperately need. For example, President Clinton vetoed a number of important regulatory, tax, and legal reforms proposed by the 104th Congress that were important priorities not just for small businesses, but for all businesses so they can promote economic growth and create more jobs. These included environmental and workplace reform, secure property rights, a reform of outdated labor laws, repeal of Davis-Bacon, capital gains tax reduction, estate tax reform, tax equity in health care reform, pension reform, and tort reform.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995</b> More than one-third of the costs of regulation -- about $200 billion -- in 1995 was due to paperwork.<sup>19</sup>  Thus, even a modest reduction in the total paperwork burden imposed on the public can save Americans thousands of hours of time and hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars in lost productivity. Most Americans fill out some kind of paperwork, such as federal tax forms or forms to obtain some type of government benefit. Businesses also must maintain a myriad of records to demonstrate compliance with environment, workplace, and other rules.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Intent on easing the burden imposed by the federal government on individuals and businesses, the 104th Congress voted overwhelmingly to pass the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-13), and President Clinton signed it into law on May 22, 1995. The Act further amended and recodified the original Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. The new law sets a government-wide paperwork reduction goal of 10 percent in each of the first two years after its enactment, and 5 percent from FY 1998 through FY 2001.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The General Accounting Office (GAO) recently released a report showing that the number of hours of paperwork imposed by the government rose by 500 million in the one-month period immediately before the effective date of the Act, from 6.39 billion hours on August 30, 1995, to 6.90 billion hours on September 30, 1995.<sup>20</sup>  The estimated burden imposed by OSHA rose the most dramatically, from 1.5 million hours to about 208 million hours.<sup>21</sup>  These significant increases were due to the fact that the new law forced agencies to more accurately acknowledge the level of paperwork burden they impose on the public.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The GAO projects that federal agencies are expected to reduce the paperwork burden by about one percent in FY 1996.<sup>22</sup>  For the first time since 1989, Congress has managed to force a decrease of as much as 70 million hours in the government paperwork burden. This is equivalent to allowing 36,350 people now working full-time on paperwork each year to engage in other, more productive activities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Congressional Review Act of 1996</b> For too long, federal agencies have blamed Congress for many of the burdensome regulations it has crafted, and often this blame is justified. The 104th Congress now has made itself accountable and responsible to the American public for all regulations. The Congressional Review Act, part of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, allows Congress to review each new rule and consider a joint resolution of disapproval to overrule it. Under this Act, no rule may go into effect until it is delivered to Congress for its review. A "rule" is defined very broadly to include all general agency statements that affect the public, including "interpretive" rules, agency "policy statements," "guidelines," and "staff manuals."  Federal agencies will have to report to Congress on each rule, stating whether they have evaluated the costs of the rule relative to the benefits, whether the rule takes private property, and whether it affects the relationship between the federal government and state and local governments. Congress can reject a rule, which would then have to be changed substantially before it could be resubmitted to Congress.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
More reform would have been achieved had President Clinton not vetoed other measures passed by the 104th Congress. Among them:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

<b>The Common Sense Liability Reform Act (vetoed by President Clinton)</b> The Act would have curbed abuses of the legal system. It had strong bipartisan backing in Congress but was vigorously opposed by the trial lawyers -- incidentally, among the largest contributors to Clinton's presidential campaign. Liability reform is desperately needed to reduce the crushing burden of frivolous and unfounded cases brought against state and local governments, charitable organizations, and America's product manufacturers. Unfortunately, Congress did not have the votes necessary to override Clinton's veto of May 2, 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995 (vetoed by President Clinton)</b> In September 1993, President Clinton had revised and reissued the regulatory review executive order first issued by President Reagan. Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, established a set of principles to guide federal regulators in developing rules and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in reviewing rules. These principles include consideration of costs and benefits and the use of market-based alternatives and performance standards. The Clinton Administration, however, did not appear very committed to making sure the regulatory principles it embodied were being taken into consideration by federal agencies. A review of EPA rulemaking between April 1994 and September 1994 showed that:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Of 45 significant rules reviewed by OMB, only six contained a determination that the benefits justified the costs; only three contained a determination of a compelling public need; and only nine considered alternative approaches to regulating. Of the other 177 EPA rules issued during that six-month period but not reviewed by OMB, no rule determined that the benefits justified the costs.<sup>23</sup>
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress recognized that for regulatory reform to be truly effective, it must force regulatory agencies to behave differently, and a statutory change was the only way to achieve it. Federal regulators needed to be required to base their decisions on costs, benefits, and actual risks faced by Americans, and they need Congress to give them the roadmap to do it. Congress enacted such legislation as part of a temporary increase in the debt ceiling. But President Clinton vetoed this bill on November 13, 1995.

<p>

<b>THE BAND-AID APPROACH: THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S "REGULATORY REINVENTION INITIATIVES" </b>
<p><blockquote>
<center>	I am going to stop handing down mandates to you and regulating you to death.</center>

<P>
--Bill Clinton, remarks before the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Houston, Texas, June 22, 1992.
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Despite campaign promises to cut red tape, the growth of regulation has continued during the Clinton Administration.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
At the end of 1992, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), the annual accumulation of all federal regulations in effect, filled 199 volumes and 128,344 pages. By the end of 1995, the CFR had grown to 205 volumes and 138,186 pages -- almost 10,000 pages of new executive branch rules in just three years.<sup>24</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
To be sure, soon after the 104th Congress took office, the Clinton Administration initiated a number of steps that made it look as if it was really serious about slowing the growth of new rules. For example, on February 21, 1995, the White House directed federal agencies to conduct a review of their existing regulations to determine which should be eliminated and which should be streamlined, updated, overhauled, or otherwise improved.<sup>25</sup>  However, one year later, it is clear the Administration is making no real progress in reducing the overall burden of regulation. For example:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In June 1995, the Administration claimed that agencies had identified over 16,000 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations that they would be eliminating.<sup>26</sup>  But some of the pages being eliminated are for rules for which the underlying statute has long since been repealed, treaties that no longer exist, and the like. This alone easily could achieve a 10 percent reduction in the CFR without accomplishing any real changes in the way the federal government goes about regulating the public. So while it sounds impressive, it is not. At the same time, the Administration already has added 10,000 pages of new regulations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
While EPA claims to be streamlining various permitting, review, and reporting requirements for a number of programs, the Clinton Administration simultaneously is pushing forward with burdensome regulatory initiatives, such as expanding the universe of sources that must be reported as part of the Toxic Release Inventory. Critics argue that last year's expansion will mean as much as $331 million in compliance costs.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Administration, while asserting that it is committed to sound science, is pursuing federal guidelines on cancer assessment to make it easier to regulate or ban substances despite the lack of sound scientific evidence that they pose any risk. Virtually all scientists who conduct statistical analyses to determine cancer risks -- or any other analyses, for that matter -- use confidence levels to determine the likelihood that their results are accurate. But the EPA proposed new rules this April that would eliminate the current requirement that EPA use confidence levels in doing risk assessments. Under this new rule, EPA would be able to conclude that something is dangerous on the basis of evidence that would fail under any rigorous scientific study.<sup>28</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Although the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is consolidating a few rules and eliminating duplicative pages in the Code of Federal Regulations, it also is working on new regulations that will impose over $12 billion in compliance costs on consumers and businesses (indoor air quality and ergonomics) and increase the cost of a home by $1,000 to $5,000 (fall protection).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Clearly, the Clinton Administration's "reinvention" effort does little to curb the rising costs and inefficiencies of regulation. The Administration claims to be reinventing regulation but goes about implementing new burdensome regulations about as fast as it can take old ones off the books.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
When the 104th Congress began in January 1995, the federal government's ever-expanding reach into the lives of Americans -- the food they eat, how they use their private property, how they run their businesses -- was a source of great concern to the American people. The 104th Congress has made historic progress toward fundamentally changing how the federal government regulates the lives of all Americans. And it has done so by applying a set of principles: free markets, competition, consideration of costs and benefits, sound science and risk assessment, priority setting, and assigning of property rights.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Clinton Administration will now attempt to take credit for regulatory reform through its "reinvention" efforts, but all it actually has done is try to play "catch-up" by repackaging the same old regulatory system and passing it off as something new. Making it easier for businesses to comply with regulations that were unjustified in the first place or claiming to take away rules while simultaneously adding new ones does not represent true regulatory reform. The American people are too smart for that. In the final analysis, they know that true reform gives them more freedom and incentives to take actions for their own benefit, and that the 104th Congress has delivered on its promise in a way that will affect the shape of federal regulations for decades.

A Special Report to the House Banking and Financial Services Committee
<P>


<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 requires a number of government agencies--the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the General Accounting Office (GAO), the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)--to report on the feasibility and effects of privatizing the two largest housing-related government sponsored enterprises (GSEs): the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac).
<p>

As these reports are being submitted to Congress,<sup>1</sup> the House subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities and Government Sponsored Enterprises is holding oversight hearings to study the issue of privatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The hearings have highlighted the diverse opinions of the federal agencies on the advantages and disadvantages of privatization. Several of the academic studies and the Congressional Budget Office report indicate that federal sponsorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provides stockholders with a significant subsidy that may indicate government sponsorship is unnecessary. On the other hand, the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Housing and Urban Development both conclude that government sponsorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac continues to be necessary to preserve the mission and ensure the success of these GSEs.


<p>
Because of the divergent views among government agencies and outside experts on privatization, some observers are arguing that, even if the GSEs are not privatized, congressional oversight is inappropriate because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are legally private corporations and not government agencies. Thus, Congress now finds itself defending its oversight role as well as considering the option of privatization.
<p>

Although Congress will hear many different views on these issues, it must keep in mind  two important facts to help guide its decisions:
<ol>

<p><li><b>Congress is ultimately responsible for safeguarding the interests of taxpayers.</b> Congressional oversight of government sponsored enterprises is not only appropriate but indeed critical as long as GSEs like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac receive government subsidies, undertake a public mission, and place taxpayers at risk.

<p><li><b>The original mission of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, establishing an efficient secondary mortgage market, has been fulfilled.</b> Thus, Congress should take steps to end the relationship between these organizations and the federal government.
</ol><p>
<b>Congressional Oversight of GSEs Is Critical As Long As 
Taxpayers Are At Risk</b>
<p>

The structure and mission of government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) makes their relationship to the federal government and role in the economy ambiguous and at times risky. GSEs typically are stockholder-owned corporations, and therefore private, but chartered and overseen by the federal government, and therefore public. This dual personality can create a conflict between a GSE executive who is responsible for maximizing profit for the corporation's stockholders and the federal official whose duty is to ensure that the public mission of the corporation is met.
<p>

Because GSEs are private organizations responsible to their stockholders, they may view congressional oversight and investigations as intrusions into the internal affairs of their private business. At the same time, none of the GSEs want to lose the special privileges afforded them by federal charter and implicit government guarantees. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are active across the country and easily can mobilize broad-based support within Congress for favorable treatment. This is especially true when the topic of discussion is privatization.
<p>

However, there are several reasons why congressional oversight and investigation is important and necessary as long as GSEs remain under the umbrella of taxpayer support and protection. These include: 
<ul>
<p><li><b>The GSEs were chartered by Congress to fulfill a specific public policy goal.</b> In exchange for the government support enjoyed by GSEs--such as exemption from state and local taxes, the ability to borrow money from the federal treasury, and participation in Federal Reserve Open Market transactions--these private organizations are expected to fulfill a specific public policy goal. In the case of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, this goal is to make home mortgages more readily available by creating an efficient and fluid secondary mortgage market. Although this mission has been met, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac continue to receive significant benefits from the federal government. It is necessary, therefore, to ensure that the GSEs do not use these benefits to stray from their original charters.

<p><li><b>The federal oversight agency can have conflicting roles as regulator and advocate, putting taxpayers at risk.</b>The Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 created the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) to oversee the activities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Specifically, the OFHEO is required to establish minimal risk-based capital standards to be met by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These requirements limit the potential risk faced by taxpayers in the case of a serious failure. However, the risk-based capital requirements also have the effect of limiting the profitability of the GSEs by restricting the amount of productive investments that can be made at any one time. Therefore, the goals of advocacy and regulation can be in direct conflict. If the OFHEO chooses to lean toward advocacy rather than regulation, then taxpayer risk could increase.<sup>2</sup>  The Congressional Budget Office reports that "OFHEO's objective of minimizing risk is inconsistent with the current objective of using the GSEs to finance the achievement of social goals."<sup>3</sup> Thus, Congress also must oversee the activities of the OFHEO.

<p><li><b>Congress is ultimately responsible for avoiding a GSE failure that potentially could cost taxpayers billions of dollars.</b> Congress is responsible for protecting the interests of the American taxpayers. Taxpayers have a large vested interest in government sponsored enterprises and it is incumbent upon Congress to ensure that this interest is carefully protected.
</ul><p>
<b>Privatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac</b>
<p>

Privatization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would have a number of important economic benefits. In the short-term, the loss of an implicit government guarantee would increase the cost of business for GSEs, and it is likely that part of this increase would be passed on to consumers in the form of higher mortgage interest costs. In the long-run, however, the end of Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's implicit government guarantee would create a more competitive secondary mortgage market. Increased competition would counter the loss of federal subsidies and help to keep mortgage costs down. Competition also would lead to greater innovation and hence more consumer choice. In addition, privatization would mean an end to taxpayer support and the mandate to achieve certain public policy objectives. Thus, the federal government's oversight role would end, and the GSEs would be free to exit existing lines of business and enter more profitable ones. 
<p>

Several important factors make privatization a viable and attractive option. These include:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have fulfilled their original mission; secondary mortgage markets are established and fluid.</b> There is a consensus that the secondary mortgage market in America is well established and fluid. In fact, each of the four studies mandated by the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 concludes that an efficient secondary mortgage market exists today (see box). Along with other private firms, they would able to take advantage of the established market without posing a threat to taxpayers. </ul>

</td></tr></table>
<ul><p>

<p><li><b>There is no rationale for further government intervention in the mortgage credit markets.</b> Fannie Mae was created in 1938 in an attempt to increase the availability of affordable home mortgages. At that time, technological shortcomings and a Depression-era private economy prevented the widespread availability of home mortgages. Even in 1970, when Freddie Mac was chartered, an efficient secondary market was an illusive goal. However, today technology and more fluid capital markets have increased the availability of mortgages to all potential home buyers. 
<p>
Indeed, the development and efficiency of the home mortgage markets in America is, at least in part, a credit to the activities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. After having met their original goals, however, these GSEs are now involved in activities that relate only tangentially to their original missions. The Congressional Budget Office reports, "Having achieved their original purpose, the housing GSEs can now cite the authority to undertake a large number of tasks whose precise nature is not always clearly defined."<sup>8</sup>  The expansion of activities undertaken by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac indicates that they have fulfilled their original public policy mission. These expanded activities also pose new risks to the taxpayers.
<p>

<li><b>The tremendous size of the housing GSEs, which is made possible only by implicit federal guarantee,  presents a dangerous presence in the capital markets.</b> Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac together have more than $1.4 trillion in debt and mortgage-backed securities. This is equivalent to nearly two-fifths of the publicly held federal government debt.<sup>9</sup>  Together the two housing GSEs purchase more than 50 percent of all conforming mortgages.<sup>10</sup>  By any measure, then, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are "800-pound gorillas" in the capital markets. This tremendous size is made possible only by the distinct advantages enjoyed by the organizations as government sponsored enterprises.
<p>
The advantages enjoyed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and their enormous size present several dangers to the credit markets in general and the mortgage markets specifically. Private firms cannot compete with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.<sup>11</sup> The federal government, in essence, has created a duopoly that hinders innovation and prevents consumers from obtaining the most efficient delivery of home mortgages. Moreover, in the case of a GSE failure, the mortgage credit market would be severely crippled because of the lack of participants able to fill the void left by such a primary participant.
<p>
In addition, the large number of transactions carried out by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have significant effects on other credit markets. Demand for mortgages is abnormally high because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are able to borrow money in the credit markets at a subsidized rate. This subsidy is partially passed on to consumers, who will forego other investment activities when faced with a lower mortgage price. In fact, residential structures today represent nearly 30 percent of total tangible wealth in the United States. This figure has slowly been rising over the past two decades. Government distortion of the capital markets means that natural demands within other sectors--such as small business loans, consumer loans, and farm loans--are not being fully met. This distortion may have a long-term impact on the strength of the American economy as more capital is diverted away from productive business activities and into home ownership.
<p>
<p><li><b>The mixed private/public nature of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac constitutes a conflict of interest.</b> Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are stockholder-owned companies. As such, they are responsible for earning the highest possible profits for their shareholders. In the private market this would be completely acceptable. However, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are accountable for meeting several public goals that may conflict with their private incentive to earn a maximum profit. If Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac vigorously pursue their private goals, then the public mission is lost and taxpayers are placed in jeopardy. On the other hand, stockholders are denied a maximum rate of return if Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pursue their public missions too vigorously. This conflict between public and private interests will continue as long as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac remain government sponsored, but structurally private, enterprises.
<p>
Fannie Mae admits that the value of its stock depends largely on federal government subsidies. Responding to one of the five academic studies prepared for Congress, Fannie Mae writes, "[I]f shareholders are not compensated fully, they will likely claim that privatization constitutes an appropriation of private property without just compensation in violation of the Due Process or the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment."<sup>12</sup> Thus, even Fannie Mae recognizes that the current structure of the housing GSEs constitutes a transfer of wealth from the entire pool of taxpayers to the relatively small number of GSE stockholders. As in all areas of government, such a transfer is highly suspect.
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
The reports mandated by the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act and the current congressional hearings represent a positive step in addressing the need for and appropriateness of federal interference in the financial markets. Congress has a responsibility to oversee the ongoing activities of all GSEs, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as long as American taxpayers provide support and assume risk for GSE activities.
<p>

With their original goal of a comprehensive and fluid secondary mortgage market fulfilled, however, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac no longer require government support. Increasingly, housing GSEs are venturing into new areas of operation that pose a significant threat to taxpayers. With the job done, Congress should break the links between Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the federal government and completely turn these profitable operations over to the private sector.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One of the most important fiscal policy debates developing in this election involves the question of whether changes in tax policy have "supply-side" effects. In other words, will lower tax rates increase economic growth, resulting in more jobs, higher wages, and bigger profits?  If the answer is yes -- meaning that lower tax rates cause taxable income to rise -- it is reasonable to argue that a tax cut will be at least partially self-financing. The extent to which increased revenue from a bigger tax base helps offset the revenue loss from lower tax rates then becomes an empirical question. This is what "static" versus "dynamic" scoring is all about. Static analysis assumes that tax changes have no impact on economic growth, meaning no increases in revenue; dynamic analysis recognizes that taxes do affect the economy. Unfortunately, government estimators use a static approach.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The battle over revenue-estimating methodology may seem an esoteric, inside-the-Beltway issue, but it has important implications. Politicians generally favor tax cuts, but they do not relish voting for higher deficits and certainly are loathe to approve offsetting savings from the spending side of the budget. Dynamic scoring, assuming it is used properly, can facilitate sound tax policy by reducing the politically "unpleasant" side-effects of tax cuts.<sup>1</sup>  In the short term, a proper understanding of the importance of dynamic scoring would make it easier either to repeal the 1990 and 1993 tax hikes or to provide an across-the-board reduction in tax rates.<sup>2</sup>  In the long term, the move to a flat tax would be expedited if dynamic scoring were used to allow the lowest possible rate.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Because dynamic scoring would make tax rate reductions more attractive, it is understandable that those who oppose tax cuts want to maintain the current system of static scoring. An objective examination of the historical evidence, however, demonstrates that dynamic scoring gives policymakers more accurate information.<sup>3</sup>  When taking steps to modernize the revenue-estimating process, policymakers should consider the following points:<ul><p><li><b>Learn from history.</b> Static scoring routinely overestimates how much revenue will be generated by tax increases. The 1990 luxury tax, the income tax rate increases of 1990 and 1993, and the 1986 capital gains tax rate increase are all examples in which revenues fell far short of static predictions. By contrast, the 1981 Reagan tax cuts, the 1978 capital gains tax reduction, the Kennedy tax cuts of the 1960s, and the 1986 Tax Reform Act all demonstrate how pro-growth tax changes will generate revenue feedback.<sup>4</sup><p><li><b>Don't make the perfect the enemy of the good.</b> It is impossible to predict all the effects of any single change in government policy. The fact that dynamic scoring cannot pinpoint all the multiyear effects of a change in tax policy, however, is not an argument for maintaining a static process guaranteed to give an answer that is wrong and farther from the truth.

<P><LI><B>Not all tax cuts are created equal.</b> The higher the tax rate, the bigger the supply-side response when the rate is reduced. Likewise, reducing tax rates on capital income, which is more easily controlled by the taxpayer, will have a greater impact than similar tax reductions on labor income. And some tax cuts, such as credits, will have little or no revenue feedback effects since incentives to engage in productive behavior remain unchanged.<sup>5</sup><p><li><b>Open the process to public scrutiny.</b> Even though they are the ones who pay the bills, taxpayers today are not allowed to examine the static models and methodology used by revenue estimators at the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Treasury Department. Whether or not the revenue-estimating process is improved, policymakers should insist on full disclosure. If policymakers adopt dynamic scoring, an open process will keep the system honest by inhibiting those who are tempted to exaggerate the benefits of tax cuts.

<p><li><b>The goal of tax policy is to maximize growth, not tax revenues.</b> For years, budget deficits have played a big role in the political debate. As a result, some tax policy proposals, such as reductions in the capital gains tax, are judged primarily by their effect on tax collections. This myopic approach inevitably interferes with sound tax policy and should be discarded.

<p><li><b>Include estimates of private and governmental compliance costs.</b> According to the Tax Foundation, the current tax system imposes $225 billion in compliance costs on the productive sector of the economy.<sup>6</sup>  In addition to these private costs of lawyers, lobbyists, accountants, tax preparers, and lost man-hours, about $13 billion in direct government expenditures is associated with taxation.<sup>7</sup>  Yet revenue estimators confess that "staff does not estimate the administrative costs incurred by either the IRS or taxpayers that may result from proposed legislation."<sup>8</sup></ul><p><b>WHAT IS STATIC SCORING, AND WHO DOES IT?</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are two official sources of revenue estimates in Washington. The Administration uses the Office of Tax Analysis (OTA), which is part of the Treasury Department, and Congress uses the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). Both use static scoring, though it is important to define the term.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Static scoring does not mean there is absolutely no recognition that taxpayers might modify their behavior in response to changes in tax policy. Defenders of the status quo thus argue that dynamic effects are incorporated into revenue forecasts. To a limited extent, they are right.<sup>9</sup>  If asked to estimate the revenue impact of a change in the gasoline tax, for instance, the current process attempts to measure the degree to which the change in the tax will affect the amount of gasoline purchased. Likewise, changes in income tax rates will include some calculation of tax avoidance behavior.<sup>10</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Missing from the equation, however, is any effort to capture the revenue effects caused by changes in macroeconomic variables. Revenue estimators assume that economic growth, job creation, and income will remain unchanged, regardless of how much taxes are reduced or increased. The Treasury Department's Office of Tax Analysis, for example, in a 1995 analysis of the flat tax wrote that:
<blockquote>
	no attempt is made to estimate the tax-induced behavioral responses of either individuals or corporations. Following the standard revenue estimating conventions used by both the Office of Tax Analysis and the Joint Committee on Taxation, the macroeconomic aggregates, such as the level of compensation, prices, employment, and gross domestic product, have been assumed to be unchanged by the proposal.<sup>11</sup></blockquote><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These assumptions effectively require the Treasury Department and the Joint Committee on Taxation to ignore the real world. This may be a reasonable approach for minor alterations of the tax code,<sup>12</sup> but it certainly produces inaccurate answers when examining significant changes. Thus, if asked to predict what would happen if tax rates were doubled, for instance, revenue estimators would assume that tax collections, with some minor modifications, would double as well. Some may think this is an exaggeration, but consider the actions of the Joint Committee on Taxation. In 1988, Senator Robert Packwood (R-OR), ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, asked the JCT to estimate the revenue impact if the government confiscated all income over $200,000 annually.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The revenue estimators at JCT responded that such a tax would raise $104 billion the first year, $204 billion the second year, $232 billion the third year, and $263 billion and $299 billion in the fourth and fifth years, respectively.<sup>13</sup>  As Senator Packwood noted, however, this view of the world is impractical because it "assumes people will work if they have to pay all their money to the Government. They will work forever and pay all of the money to the Government when clearly anyone in their right mind will not."<sup>14</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To be fair, the revenue estimators are not really the ones at fault.<sup>15</sup>  The decision to modernize and improve the scoring process will have to come from the top. At the Office of Tax Analysis, presidentially appointed officials at the Treasury Department are the only ones with the power to authorize this change. On Capitol Hill, this power lies with the Members of Congress who serve on the Joint Committee on Taxation, particularly the Chairman and Vice-Chairman. Indeed, the JCT has set up a Revenue Estimating Advisory Board to explore "ways to improve the estimating process and estimating methodology."<sup>16</sup><p><b>WHAT IS DYNAMIC SCORING?</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In simple terms, dynamic scoring means that estimates would be designed to capture revenue effects from changes in overall economic conditions. Instead of deliberately ignoring these variables, as is the convention today, revenue estimators would predict whether a change in policy would be likely to affect the level of compensation, prices, employment, and gross domestic product (GDP). If there is an effect on one or more of these variables, they would then calculate the amount of revenue feedback or loss.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How would this work?  Take the example of the 15 percent across-the-board tax cut proposed some weeks ago by Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI). Static revenue estimates reportedly show this proposal reducing tax revenues by about $500 billion over a six-year period.<sup>17</sup>  If such a proposal boosted the economy's rate of growth by one-half of one percentage point over the same period, however, Congressional Budget Office sensitivity tables (designed to measure the effects of selected economic changes on budget projections) indicate that $170 billion of that loss would be recouped in the form of revenue feedback and lower interest costs. Administration figures show the feedback would be more than $200 billion.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As shown in <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090t1.gif">Table 1</a>, both the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) agree that faster growth helps reduce the budget deficit. These numbers work both ways, incidentally, with slower growth boosting the budget deficit. The key questions are whether a change in tax policy will promote growth and, if so, by how much.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Contrary to popular wisdom, dynamic scoring does not mean that tax cuts pay for themselves. The degree of revenue feedback depends on what tax rate is being reduced and by what amount. Only in extremely rare circumstances is it believed that a tax rate reduction will generate enough economic activity to offset all of the revenue loss associated with the lower rate.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c1.gif">Chart 1</a>, popularly known as the Laffer curve, illustrates this principle. A zero rate tax will stimulate considerable growth but, by definition, collects no revenue. A 100 percent tax rate also generates no revenue, however, because it eliminates all incentive to earn income -- not to mention what happens to the rest of the economy. What happens, though, if the government imposes a tax rate of, say, 10 percent?  With a low, flat rate, almost all taxpayers presumably will continue to work, so the government will collect one-tenth of the income earned. As tax rates rise, however, taxpayers gradually become discouraged and reduce their earnings. As long as tax rates are not excessive, the increase in revenue associated with the higher tax rate exceeds the revenue loss caused by lower levels of income. At some point, however, the tax rate reaches a revenue-maximizing level. Any efforts to raise tax rates beyond this level will reduce revenues because of the fall in taxable income.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Tragically, there are some taxes in America that fall on the wrong side of the Laffer curve. These include:<ul>

<p><li><b>Income tax rates on the rich.</b> Wealthy taxpayers are particularly sensitive to high tax rates. Not only can they afford the best tax lawyers, accountants, and financial planners, but they also receive most of their income in the form of dividends, interest, capital gains, and other business income (see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). When tax rates become too onerous, these taxpayers can shift their assets to tax-free status, move their money offshore, or take other steps to alter the timing or composition of their income.<sup>18</sup>  According to recent research by James Poterba of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, lower tax rates on the richest 0.5 percent would generate higher rather than lower tax revenues.<sup>19</sup>

<p><li><b>Estate taxes.</b> The government confiscates 55 percent of a person's assets in excess of $4 million upon death.<sup>20</sup>  Those smart enough to build up businesses and portfolios of this value, however, typically are also smart enough to protect their families' wealth from the government.<sup>21</sup>  Thus, even though the estate tax collects about $15 billion annually, it is estimated that the government loses money because of reduced income tax collections caused by aggressive estate planning (which occurs in the years prior to death when wealthy taxpayers transfer funds, cease working, set up trusts, give to charity, and take other steps to reduce the tax value of their assets).<sup>22</sup><p><li><b>Capital gains taxes.</b> Revenue estimators from both Congress and the Administration acknowledge that lower capital gains taxes will boost sales (or realizations) of stock, bonds, real estate, and other assets. This "unlocking effect," by itself, may be large enough to produce a net revenue increase.<sup>23</sup>  Unfortunately, both the JCT and the OTA fail to calculate the impact of lower capital gains taxes on economic growth. If the revenue estimates included the effects of higher growth, they almost surely would show a significant revenue gain.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tax rates that are so punitive that they actually lose revenue certainly should be reduced. The lower rate would please conservatives who favor economic growth, and should please liberals who want the government to collect more money.<sup>24</sup>  It is important to recognize, however, that there is a huge difference between the revenue-maximizing tax rate and the growth-maximizing tax rate. Largely because of hefty value-added taxes (a form of national sales tax), many countries in Europe take a much higher percentage of their citizens' money than America does.<sup>25</sup>  These nations may be near the revenue-maximizing point of the Laffer curve, but it comes at a heavy price. European countries, compared to the United States, suffer from higher unemployment, slower growth, larger budget deficits, and lower incomes.

<p>

<b>HISTORICAL EXAMPLES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The strong theoretical argument for dynamic scoring is augmented by a great deal of historical evidence. The United States has experienced significant shifts in tax policy over the years, and the historical record both demonstrates the shortcomings of static analysis and provides ample proof that the revenue-estimating process should be modernized.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Before looking at specific examples, however, it may be useful to look at the broad picture. As <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c3.gif">Chart 3</a> illustrates, tax revenues traditionally have consumed about 19 percent of America's economic output.<sup>26</sup>  This relationship has been remarkably stable even though tax rates have shifted by large amounts. At times, the top income tax rate has exceeded 90 percent, while at other times it has fallen to less than 30 percent. The chart also shows income tax collections as a percentage of GDP. As is the case with total tax revenues, income tax collections are remarkably stable, hovering between 8 percent and 9 percent. The only two times they reached 9.4 percent or more, in 1969 and 1981, the economy fell into recession.<sup>27</sup><p><b>The Tax Cuts of the 1920s.</b> Tax rates were slashed dramatically during the 1920s, falling from 73 percent to 24 percent.<sup>28</sup>  The economy boomed, growing at an average annual rate of 6 percent between 1921 and 1929.<sup>29</sup>  Personal income tax revenues increased substantially, rising from $719 million in 1921 to $1,160 million in 1928.<sup>30</sup>  This 61 percent increase in revenue occurred at a time of no inflation. As <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c4.gif">Chart 4</a> shows, the percentage of the tax burden borne by the rich jumped dramatically, climbing from 44.2 percent in 1921 to 78.4 percent in 1928. These results, not surprisingly, would not have been predicted by static analysis.<p><b>The Kennedy Tax Cuts.</b> Lower taxes on savings and investment were approved in 1962, followed by across-the-board tax rate reductions in 1964. Economic growth picked up, with GDP increasing at an average annual rate of 5 percent between 1961 and 1968.<sup>31</sup>  The Kennedy tax cuts triggered the longest expansion in America's history, and revenues grew by 62 percent over the seven-year period.<sup>32</sup>  One of the most compelling pieces of supply-side evidence is the way different income groups responded to lower tax rates. As seen in <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c5.gif">Chart 5</a>, wealthy taxpayers wound up paying significantly more tax revenues after their tax rates were reduced -- exactly as dynamic forecasting would have predicted.
<p>
<b>The 1978 Capital Gains Tax Cut.</b> The more control a taxpayer has over a taxable activity, the more pronounced the supply-side effect. Capital gains taxes are the best example of this phenomenon since a taxpayer can avoid the tax by not selling assets. In 1968, legislation was approved raising the capital gains tax from 25 percent to 49 percent. (Effective tax rates almost always were higher--sometimes over 100 percent -- since the government did not, and still does not, allow taxpayers to adjust asset prices for inflation.) Not surprisingly, capital gains revenues were sluggish throughout the 1970s. In 1978, however, the rate was reduced to 28 percent.<sup>33</sup>  The very next year, revenues jumped 45 percent.<sup>34</sup>  Capital gains tax revenues continued to rise, climbing even more when the Reagan tax cuts lowered the rate even further, down to 20 percent in 1981.<p>
<b>Windfall Profits Tax.</b> During the Carter Administration, a heavy tax was imposed on crude oil. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated in 1979 that the tax would collect $184.5 billion between 1980 and 1985. But it brought in just $77.7 billion.<sup>35</sup>  To be fair, the huge revenue gap probably was due to President Reagan's decision to decontrol oil prices, something the JCT could not have predicted in 1979. At the same time, however, foreknowledge of this move may have caused the revenue estimators to make an even bigger mistake, since most liberals believed that restoring competition to the petroleum market would cause oil prices to skyrocket.<sup>36</sup><p><b>The Reagan Tax Cuts.</b> Campaigning on across-the-board tax cuts, Ronald Reagan took office at a time when the economy was in horrible shape. The economy was in the middle of a severe double-dip recession. Inflation was running at double-digit rates, unemployment was rising, and interest rates had climbed to more than 20 percent.<sup>37</sup>  Critics claimed the tax cuts would be inflationary and would do nothing to boost growth, but just the opposite happened. Americans did not receive a net tax cut until sometime between July 1982 and January 1983 because previously legislated payroll tax increases and bracket creep offset the portions of the tax cut that took effect in 1981 and 1982.<sup>38</sup>  Once the tax cuts did take effect, the longest peacetime economic expansion in the nation's history began.<sup>39</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The most comprehensive analysis of the revenue effect of the Reagan tax cuts shows two things: The lower tax rates on the rich more than paid for themselves, and there were substantial feedback effects from lower tax rates on other income classes as well (see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c6.gif">Chart 6</a>). Defenders of high tax rates condemn the Reagan program, noting that tax revenues in the early 1980s were well below the Administration's original projections.<sup>40</sup>  But this reasoning is seriously flawed. First, it blames the tax cuts for the second half of the double-dip recession of 1980-1982, a drop in the economy that began before the economy received a tax cut. Second, it fails to recognize the irony that two-thirds of the revenue shortfall occurred because inflation was reduced much faster than was originally thought.<sup>41</sup>  Significantly, the forecast of the Democrat-controlled Congressional Budget Office closely matched the Administration's.<sup>42</sup><p><b>The 1986 Tax Reform Act.</b> This legislation provides one of the best examples of why dynamic forecasting is needed. The Tax Reform Act lowered tax rates on individual income and increased the tax burden on corporate income.<sup>43</sup>  According to the static estimates, the shift in taxes amounted to more than $100 billion over the five-year period. Actual tax collections, however, showed a very clear and pronounced supply-side effect. As taxpayers responded to lower rates, individual income tax revenues grew faster than expected, nearly 6 percent above projections. The higher tax burden on corporate income, meanwhile, had the opposite effect. Corporate income tax receipts were very sluggish, falling nearly 25 percent below the static estimates.<sup>44</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The divergent responses of personal and corporate income tax collections are critical. Defenders of static forecasting always try to argue that the dynamic effects are a coincidence. The booming economy and rapid revenue growth of the 1920s, 1960s, and 1980s, for instance, are said to have had nothing to do with lower tax rates. Likewise, the economy's poor performance during the 1930s, 1970s, and 1990s is said to be just bad fortune completely unrelated to higher tax rates. These arguments fall apart when analyzing the Tax Reform Act, since it is impossible to blame sluggish corporate tax collections on a weak economy while at the same time claiming that strong personal tax collections are the result of a strong economy.
<p>
<b>The 1986 Capital Gains Tax Rate Increase.</b> As part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, policymakers increased the capital gains tax from 20 percent to 28 percent. Two noteworthy things happened. Capital gains realizations (asset sales) and revenues soared before the tax rate increase took effect and then collapsed by more than 50 percent when the higher rate took effect.<sup>45</sup>  When the Congressional Budget Office put together its revenue baseline in 1990, however, it assumed that capital gains realizations would grow at the same rate they did during the early 1980s when the tax rate was low. This proved to be a huge error. In fact, the high capital gains tax discouraged asset sales, and realizations were stagnant, usually less than half of CBO's projections.<sup>46</sup>  Moreover, the Joint Committee on Taxation used this inflated baseline in 1990 to put together static revenue estimates suggesting that a reduction in the rate would lose money and primarily benefit the wealthy. But the 1986 increase in the capital gains tax rate actually hurt middle-income taxpayers more than the rich, since the tax rate on their gains rose from 14 percent to 28 percent.<sup>47</sup><p><b>The Luxury Tax.</b> The 1990 budget agreement included provisions imposing excise taxes on products thought to be purchased by the "rich," including luxury boats and private airplanes. These taxes backfired so badly that Congress repealed them. Actual collections from the boat tax reached $32.5 million, according to the Treasury Department, far below the $53 million originally forecast.<sup>48</sup>  The Joint Committee on Taxation, meanwhile, admitted that the airplane tax collected just 10 percent of the static estimate.<sup>49</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Defenders of the tax have tried to argue that the revenue shortfall was coincidental,<sup>50</sup> but the actual effects are even worse than these numbers indicate. When boat builders lost their jobs and boatyards shut down, the federal government lost income and payroll taxes and also had to pay out unemployment benefits.<sup>51</sup>  The static estimates recognized that some people might have lost jobs as a result of the tax but assumed that those workers would immediately get jobs someplace else paying the same wage.<sup>52</sup>  Life in the real world, unfortunately, does not operate as flawlessly as these static blackboard models.<p><b>The Bush Tax Rate Increase.</b> In 1990, President Bush reneged on his no-new-taxes promise and signed into law a major tax increase, including an increase in the top rate from 28 percent to 31 percent. Rather than bring in new revenues, however, the government began to collect less revenue than was projected before tax rates were increased.<sup>53</sup>  In 1991 alone, revenues fell by more than $6 for every $1 the tax increase was supposed to generate.<sup>54</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Defenders of static scoring admit this happened but blame the stagnant economy for the drop in revenues. Since the tax increase certainly helped throw the economy into the tank, however, this excuse rings hollow. Even if one accepts the unlikely assumption that the tax increase had nothing to do with the recession, there are other compelling numbers showing the dynamic effect. In 1991, income tax receipts from those making more than $200,000 fell by more than 6 percent.<sup>55</sup>  Yet tax collections from those making less than that rose by 1 percent. In other words, the government wound up collecting less in revenue from the taxpayers who were slapped with higher tax rates, but collecting more from those whose taxes did not go up.
<p>
<b>The 1993 Clinton Tax Rate Increase.</b> Without a vote to spare in either the House or the Senate, President Clinton during his first year in office imposed the largest tax increase in history. His increase in tax rates, from 31 percent to 39.6 percent,<sup>56</sup> was the biggest jump since Herbert Hoover boosted the rate from 25 percent to 63 percent in 1930. Harvard economist Martin Feldstein estimates that the tax rate increase raised only one-third of the promised revenue.<sup>57</sup>  The combined effect of the Bush and Clinton tax rate increases has been an utter failure. As shown in <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c7.gif">Chart 7</a>, revenues from the personal income tax actually have declined as a percentage of economic output since Reagan left office.<sup>58</sup><p><b>REVENUE ESTIMATES AND THE FLAT TAX</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The perils and pitfalls of static forecasting are clearly evident in the flat tax debate. Representative Richard Armey (R-TX) resuscitated the idea of moving to a simple and fair one-rate tax system in 1994. Almost immediately, the proposal was attacked by the Administration. Shortly before the mid-term elections that year, the press reported a Treasury Department estimate that the flat tax would require a rate of 25.8 percent to be revenue neutral.<sup>59</sup>  Six months later, the Administration criticized the flat tax yet again, but this time charged that the rate would have to be 22.9 percent to avoid increasing the deficit.<sup>60</sup>  More recently, the Treasury Department issued its third static estimate of the flat tax, this time claiming that the revenue neutral rate would be 20.8 percent.<sup>61</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Clinton Administration's inability to settle on a single rate is instructive for two reasons. It demonstrates that even static revenue estimates, which involve more simplistic calculations, are far from exact. Even more important, the White House inadvertently has provided compelling evidence for the flat tax. The Treasury Department's most recent estimate, predicting a revenue neutral rate of 20.8 percent, is still exaggerated.<sup>62</sup>  But it confirms that Representative Armey's 20 percent flat tax, which includes $40 billion in budgetary savings,<sup>63</sup> is deficit-neutral -- even using static analysis.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not surprisingly, dynamic estimates of the flat tax, using more sophisticated econometric and modeling techniques, find that growth increases significantly. This additional growth, as illustrated earlier, results in substantial revenue increases. An important question, of course, is who benefits from the economy's expansion. Representative Armey and Senate co-sponsor Richard Shelby (R-AL) believe that taxpayers should reap the benefit of faster growth. As a result, they reduce the flat rate to 17 percent in the third year.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Numerous studies support the contention that the economy will expand dramatically if the existing tax code is replaced by a single-rate flat tax. For example:<UL>

<p><li>Professor Dale Jorgenson, Chairman of the Economics Department at Harvard, testified before the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform that a single-rate system could boost the economy by 15 percent or more within a decade.<sup>64</sup><p><li>University of California professor Alan Auerbach, formerly an economist with the Joint Committee on Taxation, estimates that the economy would be 5.7 percent larger within five years with a flat tax.<sup>65</sup><p><li>Stanford University economist Michael Boskin, a former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, has testified that a flat tax would boost growth by 10 percent within ten years.<sup>66</sup><p><li>Even without growth effects, two former Treasury Department economists estimate that a flat tax would be revenue neutral at 17 percent.<sup>67</sup><p><li>Boston University economist Laurence J. Kotlikoff estimates that a move to a single-rate tax that does not double-tax capital income would raise living standards by between 7 percent and 14 percent.<sup>68</sup><p><li>A study by two academic economists found that a 17 percent flat tax would boost growth so much that tax revenues would increase by 1.8 percentage points.<sup>69</sup></ul><p><b>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT DYNAMIC SCORING</b><p><b><i>Q: Will lower tax rates reduce the underground economy, and will dynamic forecasting reflect this shift?</i><p>A:</b> Yes, but probably not enough to affect revenue forecasts. By definition, measuring the size of the underground economy is difficult. Those that have tried have produced estimates ranging from a low of 5 percent of GDP to a high of more than 25 percent of GDP.<sup>70</sup>  An added problem is that no one knows how much of the underground economy exists for the purpose of evading taxes. It is safe to assume that most drug dealers, bookies, and prostitutes do not pay taxes, but that will not change if tax rates are lowered. For activities that are legal, however, lower tax rates would reduce tax evasion. The American Bar Association conducted a three-year study which concluded that lower tax rates encourage greater compliance.<sup>71</sup><p><b><i>Q: What safeguards would be needed to ensure that the party in power did not abuse dynamic forecasts?</i><p>A:</b> This is a legitimate concern. Politicians often exaggerate the benefits of legislation they support, and it does not take a wild imagination to envision revenue estimators pressured to produce excessively optimistic numbers. The Congressional Budget Office, for instance, was often accused of tailoring its figures to help the Democrats when they were in the majority.<sup>72</sup>  This is why public disclosure of the model and methodology is so important. If outside experts were allowed to review all decisions, the potential for mischief would shrink dramatically.<sup>73</sup><p><b><i>Q: Should there be dynamic forecasts of spending legislation?</i><p>A:</b> If the scientific evidence is clear, the answer is yes. Considerable research has been done to show that government spending, particularly for consumption items, is a drag on economic growth.<sup>74</sup><p>Incorporating this new research into budget analysis would help policymakers make proper decisions. As with dynamic scoring of tax legislation, full disclosure is critical. The Congressional Budget Office, for instance, used a version of dynamic scoring during the debate over the 1995 Balanced Budget Act. Unfortunately, in predicting dramatic reductions in interest rates following enactment of legislation to reduce budget deficits,<sup>75</sup> the CBO was almost surely wrong.<sup>76</sup>  If the CBO had to publish its analyses and defend them before outside experts, estimators would be forced to refine and improve their techniques.<p><b>CONCLUSION</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;During the post-Reagan years, the economy has experienced its worst seven-year performance since the end of World War II.<sup>77</sup>  The average family has lost more than $2,000 of real purchasing power,<sup>78</sup> and there is little reason for optimism about the future. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that economic growth over the next ten years will average only 2.1 percent if current tax and spending policies are maintained.<sup>79</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America can do better. From the end of World War II until the end of the Reagan years, the economy's growth rate averaged well over 3 percent -- and that includes recession years.<sup>80</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To get America growing again, tax policy will have to change. In the short term, immediate tax rate reductions are needed to boost growth; in the long term, the entire tax code should be replaced by a simple, flat tax. Unfortunately, these pro-growth changes will be harder to achieve if revenue estimators continue to use outdated and inaccurate static models. Dynamic revenue estimates, by contrast, would provide policymakers with more accurate information. Dynamic forecasting is based on a proper understanding of how the economy works, and history has shown this approach to be far more realistic.

<p><li>     It is conventional wisdom that voting for lower spending is bad politics. This fear may or may not be justified, but it certainly is true that lower spending is good economics. Ideally, lawmakers would want to reduce both taxes and spending as part of an overall effort to boost growth and enhance freedom.<p><li>    Harvard Professor Martin Feldstein, former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, estimates that repeal of the higher tax rates approved in 1993 would result in a revenue loss of less than $10 billion, or less than one-third of the static estimate.

 <p><li>   When estimating the effect of higher tax rates in 1993, the JCT examined several non-macroeconomic factors, such as "shifting from investments which yield interest and dividend income, taxed at the new higher rates, into investments that provide capital appreciation, which is taxed at unchanged lower rates. Also considered were shifts from taxable to tax-exempt assets, conversion to C corporation business form, conversion of wage income into tax-deferred compensation or tax-exempt fringe benefits, and increased noncompliance and avoidance." All these factors, however, only reduced the pure static revenue loss by 7 percent over the five-year period.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress soon will be considering major legislation that would enable poor children to attend the schools of their choice. Representatives J. C. Watts (R-OK) and James Talent (R-MO) have introduced a comprehensive legislative initiative, Saving Our Children: The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3467:">H.R. 3467</a>).<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Title II, the Low Income Educational Opportunity Act of 1996, would establish an education choice scholarship program that includes both private and religious schools in "renewal communities."  Each locality would determine the value of the scholarship for poor children, but the maximum value of the scholarship would not exceed the per capita cost of educating children in a local public school. The scholarships available to poor children would have a minimum value not less than 66 percent of the per capita cost of educating children in the local public schools or the tuition normally charged by the private school. Parents would not be forbidden from using scholarships to pay for tuition in religious schools, and local authorities would not be able to discriminate against parents or children who do so. The scholarship program would be supported from existing federal funds.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Where their children go to school is a serious question for parents. President and Mrs. Clinton are willing to pay an annual tuition of more than $11,000 to send their daughter Chelsea to the exclusive Sidwell Friends School. Vice President and Mrs. Gore chose St. Albans School, a few blocks from Sidwell, for their son, as did D.C.'s Shadow Senator Jesse Jackson. The Clintons, like the Gores and many other parents among the nation's social and political elite, have made a conscious decision that the Washington, D.C., public schools, recently the subject of failed congressional reform efforts, are not good enough for their children. They also have decided that a school with religious affiliation is important.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While most Americans intuitively understand what is best for their children, public policy has made it difficult for all but the well-to-do to choose the school they prefer. Indeed, implicit in public policy is the assumption that where a child goes to school is unimportant. But the evidence is in: Where a child goes to school matters a good deal -- better a good school than a bad school.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More important, the empirical evidence clearly reveals that most private schools do a better job than most public schools, particularly with poor and minority youngsters. Yet for more than a century, public policies in the United States have made it virtually impossible to provide public funds for children to attend private schools.<sup>3</sup>  In this regard, the United States stands virtually alone among the world's democracies.<sup>4</sup>  With enactment of the Watts-Talent bill, this dubious distinction would come to an end.
<p>
<b>THE CHANGING INTELLECTUAL CLIMATE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For many years -- in the 1960s and 1970s in particular -- a body of thought developed in this country which emphasized a child's "background" characteristics, which were assumed to be paramount. Success in school was the luck of the socioeconomic draw. It made little or no difference where children went to school, whether urban or rural, north or south, east or west, public or private; what was important was what they brought to school with them.<sup>5</sup>  If they were poor and dispossessed, they probably would do poorly. If they were poor and members of a minority group, they were almost certain to do poorly. By way of contrast, advantaged youngsters from enriched backgrounds did well. That was -- and is -- the argument. That it flies in the face of experience and common sense has done nothing to temper its enthusiastic reception among policymaking elites.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The modern incarnation of this general argument emerged from both the incomplete interpretation and the substantial misinterpretation of early work by James Coleman, a nationally prominent sociological researcher, then at Johns Hopkins.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In research conducted under the auspices of the U.S. Office of Education (predecessor to the U.S. Department of Education), Coleman and his colleagues initially found little in the way of school effects; factors like race, income, and parental level of education were stronger than school characteristics as predictors of school performance. What did seem to make a modest difference was who you went to school with; poor black youngsters appeared to do better in integrated settings. But as any competent policy analyst knows, absence of proof is not proof of absence. Because "school effects" were elusive or hard to find and measure did not mean they did not exist.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To the contrary, if "school effects" really were only weak (or worse yet, if they did not exist at all), the whole rationale of public education would come tumbling down. Indeed, so might that of private schooling. If nothing matters, there is no point in worrying about the right way to educate children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There was, however, a widespread desire to believe a variation of such an unlikely interpretation. Among liberals who believed in vigorous, interventionist government, the lack of "school effects" was interpreted to mean that these effects were not sufficiently robust. What was needed was "more" impact: more money for schools. If race and socioeconomic status (or SES in the jargon of sociologists) were more powerful determinants of school performance than schools themselves, the schools must be weak. Other larger, even more ambitious government programs would be in order.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Just as geography was destiny in the 19th century, SES became destiny in the 20th. The ironies in this development were many. In liberal hands, it became an argument designed to bolster the theory that the only good school is a rich school (and a rich public one at that). At the same time, it became an argument that absolves the existing school of its obligations to its students. It "blames the victim."  The school is not at fault if students do not learn. Schools have little or no effect; it all depends on the raw material.<sup>7</sup>  This sentiment is nicely encapsulated in a song ("Gee, Officer Krupke!") from Leonard Bernstein's classic <I>West Side Story</I>: "Hey, I'm depraved on accounta I'm deprived."
<p>
<b>WHY SCHOOLS MATTER</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Such conventional liberal theory is bad pedagogy and worse public policy. Indeed, it fell to James Coleman, then a professor at the University of Chicago, to reopen the argument with extraordinarily powerful research that demonstrated the strong effect of Catholic schools, particularly on poor black children.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This research, widely reported in 1981 when it appeared in summary form in <I>The Public Interest</I>, is as valid today as it was then. Coleman also noted the embarrassing fact, still a stark feature of today's school choice debate, that "there are many who vigorously oppose making private school attendance easier and at the same time have their own children enrolled in private school."<sup>9</sup>  Coleman set out to answer three vital questions:
<p><ol>
<b><li></b> Do private schools provide better education?
<p>
<b><li></b> If they do, what is the public policy interest in denying poor children access to them?
<p>
<b><li></b> Is it true, as opponents of public funding allege, that private schools racially segregate children?
</ol> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Coleman's first hurdle was methodological: how to distinguish "the effects of selection from the effects of the school itself" to control, "even to the extent of overcompensating," for selection into the schools. This he did. His academic findings are hardly surprising: "higher learning in the Catholic schools than in the public school."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The literature in this area is not restricted to Coleman's seminal work, as John Convey's 218-page <I>Catholic Schools Make a Difference</I> reveals.<sup>10</sup>  Convey reports that in a series of studies based on National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) data, Lee and Stewart "documented consistently higher scores of Catholic school students compared with public school students."  For example, the average Catholic school student in grades 4 and 8 scored significantly higher in reading and writing.<sup>11</sup>  In addition, Andrew Greeley's analysis of data from the High School and Beyond longitudinal study showed superior performance among whites, blacks, and Hispanics in Catholic school by every single category (Vocabulary, Reading, Math 1, Math 2, Science, and Writing), and Marks and Lee, writing in 1989, found higher scores in Catholic schools in grades 3, 7, and 11 among whites, blacks, and Hispanics in every single category for math, science, and reading.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The most imposing studies, however, are those of Coleman and his colleagues. Catholic school sophomores, for example, scored 10 percent higher in science and 12 percent higher in civics, and from 17 percent to 21 percent higher in mathematics, writing, reading, and vocabulary. Catholic school seniors also consistently outscored public high school students: 10 percent to 17 percent higher in reading, mathematics, and vocabulary, and from 3 percent lower to 7 percent higher on three tests that measure ability more than achievement.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The last finding strongly suggests that the explanation for higher scores lies not in some "ability" differential, but in what the schools do with what they have. Catholic schools expect much of their students, whatever their race and background, and expecting much, get much.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although Coleman found even higher scores in non-Catholic private schools, the more important sample is Catholic schools, which are the dominant force in the non-government school market. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Coleman also was concerned with other issues, most notably the impact of choice on racial integration. Here the findings were equally unambiguous: A child is more likely to attend school with a child of another race in the private sector than in the public sector. The importance of this early finding would be hard to overstate; "suburban schools within the public sector are used as a haven to a much greater extent than in the private sector."  Counterbalancing "bright" flight to the suburbs is the behavior of students in Catholic school. Coleman's figures on dropouts are striking. Among white students in public school, 13.1 percent dropped out compared with 2.6 percent in Catholic schools; among Hispanic students, the difference was two to one (19.1 percent to 9.3 percent); and among black students, the difference was more than 3.5 to one (17.2 percent to 4.6 percent).<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Coleman's first finding concerning school effects should have been received with rejoicing by the professional educators who had endured their share of bad press. Their magazines and journals should have featured articles on why schools make a difference. So also should the nation's civil rights leadership have reacted positively to Coleman's finding about racial integration in the private sector. Indeed, the refusal of the U.S. Supreme Court to establish "metropolitan" remedies for past cases of racial discrimination makes the Coleman finding all the more important, because private school attendance is almost never geographically based. Private schools, already better integrated than public schools, offer more fertile fields for expanded racial integration over time than do the public schools.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Such reactions, however, were rare, and the reason is not hard to fathom. Had Professor Coleman's rigorous social science work revealed stronger public than private school effects, there would have been joy in the great halls of the education establishment.<sup>15</sup>  But because one of the bastions of "good schooling" is the private sector,<sup>16</sup> public school educators could not -- would not -- accept his findings. Coleman, on the other hand, did no such disservice to the authorities who run the public schools. He followed the evidence where it led and found that all schools that exhibit similar characteristics have strong school effects. All schools, whether public or private, that exhibit the same cluster of attributes -- high expectations, a focused curriculum, good order and discipline, caring teachers, enterprising students -- have relatively robust "school effects."  What is important is that these characteristics are found more readily and more often in private schools.
<p>
<b>THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL CAPITAL</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to his school effects work, Professor Coleman returned to the questions that had intrigued him originally: Even if some schools are better than others, what difference does what the student brings to school make?<sup>17</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What are the cultural and social traits that make a difference?  The potential for synergy is obvious, as are the public policy implications.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Social capital" is the cluster of skills, attitudes, and (to a lesser extent) knowledge that the student acquires in the non-school environment. Clearly, a child who is disruptive and unruly and who has only weakly developed academic interests is less likely to do well in any school, "good" or "bad," while youngsters who bring with them a love of learning, disciplined and orderly habits, and respect for themselves and other students, as well as for the teacher, are much more likely to do well, all other things being equal. These traits -- what might be called pro-academic traits -- are the product of caring and supportive communities, voluntarily created and maintained. Though they may include people who look alike, in the final analysis they are not defined by race, socioeconomic status, or ethnicity; they bridge all those gaps. They are associative communities made up of superficially similar or different people who share common values and virtues. In a school setting, to use a quaint term, they are "communities of scholarship."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Members of Congress and state and local legislators alike should recognize the public policy implications of "social capital."  The most important single thing they can do in this regard is to encourage its formation and continuance by underwriting education choice. Not only does choice permit the expression of "social capital;" it builds and reinforces the habits of mind that are essential to voluntary association -- the same habits of mind that are essential to civil society. In a school setting, choice imposes the burden of choosing; there is no escape. One must make one's bed and lie in it; no one else does it for you. School choice proposals, including the school choice component of the Watts-Talent legislation, foster democratic habits of mind that are essential to a free society.
<p>

<b>THE HIGH STAKES IN SCHOOLS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The reasons for the high quality of private schools are several and have to do largely with organization, incentives, and rewards. Most simply, voluntary association makes a difference. In the public sector, the organizational climate conspires against dedicated teachers and hard-working students; in the private sector, it encourages and rewards high levels of performance. In short, monopolies are no better in the public sector than in the private sector. They serve only the interests of the "owners," never the interests of workers or clients.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the public sector, of course, the "owners" do not literally own the schools. Rather, they are managers and bureaucrats, and the schools are run for them, not for teachers and students. This rather unappealing picture is not restricted to the public sector; managerial capitalism also looks a good deal like this, which is why it is under fire from liberal and conservative critics alike. The Watts-Talent legislation would permit parents of poor children to "own" their own schools instead of having to submit to the bureaucracy that runs government schools.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
America's policymakers seem willing to tolerate failures and weaknesses in education that they would not tolerate in any other area of public policy. Coleman's findings are so powerful that were he dealing with any other area of public policy -- health, welfare, housing, transportation, or juvenile justice -- shifts in public policy would begin to reflect the new knowledge he contributed. But public schooling is a nearly immovable object; public schools are run for the convenience of, and at the pleasure of, their managers, not for the benefit of students and their families.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	When they debate the issue of school choice, Members of Congress should consider the "school effects" literature in terms of academic outcomes; its conclusions are wholly unsurprising. In light of their "environment," one would expect private schools to "do better."  They must if they are to survive. All parents who enroll their children in private school go through at least a two-step process.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>First</b>, they must decide to enroll their children in a non-government school and find the financial wherewithal to deliver on this decision. Almost without exception, this involves the payment of substantial tuition and fees out of pocket. Indeed, because people value what they pay for, "full-ride" scholarships are almost unknown in private elementary and secondary education. Even -- perhaps particularly -- schools like Father Clemens's Our Lady of Angels in Chicago charge at least a modest tuition.<sup>18</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Second</b>, the financial commitment families make to send their children to private school is a proxy for a personal commitment to education, the importance of which is hard to overestimate. It makes schools and their families partners in a way that the a public sector monopoly can never hope to achieve.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Probably the most important "school effects" issue is not the measured academic "outcomes" of schooling, but the school's impact in the market. In a market, a school must "sell" and parents must "buy."  That is the market<I>par excellence</I>. Goods and services that do not sell have no effect; indeed, they do not stay in the market. Only monopolists -- particularly government monopolists -- stay in markets when no rational consumer wants their product or service. Poor children, for all practical purposes, today have no options.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This issue came to a head this year when Congress considered school choice as part of the Washington, D.C., FY 1996 appropriations bill. Representative Steve Gunderson (R-WI) offered an amendment that would have given scholarships of up to $3,000 for students whose family incomes were at or below the poverty level and up to $1,500 for students whose family incomes were not more than 185 percent above the poverty level. The Senate, however, when presented with this opportunity to expand choice for children in Washington's failing public school system, refused to do so. Only four members of the Senate had sent their children to D.C.'s public schools.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The obvious assumption, of course, is that D.C.'s public school system is tolerable for poor children but not a serious option for members of the United States Senate.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On the wisdom of these official restrictions, let the late Professor James Coleman answer the critics. His is an eloquent summation of the case for justice and dignity:
<p><blockquote>
	There may be a rationale for some protective barriers to encourage participation in the public schools, but certainly not those that exist now, which harm most the interests of those least well-off and protect most those public schools that are the worst. In short, the tuition barrier to private schooling as it exists now is almost certainly harmful to the public interest, and especially harmful to the interests of those least well-off.<sup>20</sup>
</blockquote> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As Members of Congress consider the Watts-Talent school choice provisions, they have another chance to do the right thing.

<li>    The most important work in this field is that of the late sociologist James Coleman. A researcher of towering intellect and erudition who also was devoid of ideological predisposition, Coleman followed the data wherever they led, often at the cost of personal peace of mind. He was vilified by the American Sociological Association for taking the politically incorrect position that public support of private schooling was a defensible public policy option (although, to its credit, the ASA retracted its condemnation to award him a medal shortly before his death). Coleman never wavered in his quiet and determined defense of the truth as he understood it. While his prose style and the heavy quantitative emphasis of his major works are a bit daunting for the generalist, his articles are clear, concise, and lively. A perfect example -- as current today as when it was published -- is "Public Schools, Private Schools, and the Public Interest," <I>The Public Interest</I>, No. 64 (Summer 1981). Father Andrew M. Greeley's work is on point as well. In particular, see <I>Catholic High Schools and Minority Students</I> (New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Books, 1982).<p>
<li>    In particular, see "Foreword," in Thomas Vitullo-Martin and Bruce S. Cooper, <I>Separation of Church and Child: The Constitution and Federal Aid to Religious Schools</I> (Indianapolis, Ind.: Hudson Institute, 1987).<p>
<li>       See Charles L. Glenn, <I>Choice of Schools in Six Nations</I> (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Education, 1989), and <I>Educational Freedom in Eastern Europe</I> (Washington, D.C.: Cato Institute, 1995). Glenn, one of the nation's leading authorities on public funding for attendance at private schools, for 21 years was the Massachusetts State Department of Education official responsible for civil rights and urban education opportunity. Recognizing the failure of busing, Glenn pioneered education choice programs.<p>
<li>   One long-standing trend, the concentration of high test scores in the Northern tier of states from Maine to Montana, led Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY) to propose facetiously the following policy remedy to states concerned about low test scores: Move your state north.<p>
<li>    Coleman's first major study which permitted a systematic examination of this and related questions was prepared under the terms of a major grant from the U.S. Office of Education, part of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare (now the Department of Health and Human Services). Titled <I>Equality of Educational Opportunity</I>, it was released in 1966 and caused an immediate sensation. Coleman and his colleagues could find no school effects of consequence; indeed, any school effect seemed to be overwhelmed by student background characteristics. Policymakers were led in two different directions by this surprising "non-finding."  Many analysts concluded that school effects were minimal (at least from a public policy standpoint; they still put their own children in "good" schools). Needless to say, their public policy conclusion was a counsel of despair; after all, the whole American experiment in self-governance was based on the Founders' conviction that an educated citizenry is essential to democracy. The other direction, equally misleading, fueled the notion that black children could learn only if they were integrated with white children. While racial integration is a laudable objective, it is patronizing in the extreme to argue that black children must be integrated to learn. More to the point is the quality of facilities, books, teacher preparation, and the like.<p>

<li>    Although most Americans are convinced that private schools are simply better than public schools, this is not an altogether implausible proposition. It was true in Australia, leading the Australian Labour Party (similar to the Democratic Party in the United States) to support public aid to private schools. Sparked by the work of Father James Carroll, who later became Bishop of Sydney, public funding was made available on the basis of the following argument: Catholic schools are inferior (by almost any academic or fiscal measure) and will remain so unless public funding is provided; Catholics (and non-Catholics who attend these schools) will not abandon their schools; and no good public end is served by denying poor Australian children a quality education in the schools in which they chose to enroll. For more on this interesting situation, see Denis P. Doyle, "Family Choice in Education: The Case of Denmark, Holland and Australia," in <I>Private Schools and Public Policy: International Perspectives</I>, ed. William Lowe Boyd and James G. Cibulka (New York, N.Y.: Falmer Press, 1989), and "Why Congress Should Give Poor Children Choice of Religious Schools," Heritage Foundation <I>Backgrounder</i>, forthcoming.<p>

<li>  
 Not to put too fine a point on it, but private schools are a red flag to the public school bull. The intensity of the hostility most public school leaders feel for private schools is understood more easily in psychological terms than in logical terms. Private schools, for example, are accused of being "elitist," a sin as serious as racism or sexism in the modern pantheon of bad attitudes. But the facts, as Coleman and others have revealed, are otherwise. For a longer disquisition on this general subject, see "A Din of Inequity?  Private Schools Reconsidered," <I>Teachers College Record</I>, Vol. 82, No. 4 (Summer 198l).<p>

<li>   An example of more than passing importance, Father Clemens's school operates on an extended day and year, is in the middle of the ghetto, has a waiting list, accepts only children from families on welfare, and still charges tuition. His reasoning?  If they can afford a phone, a TV, sneakers, and Bulls jackets, they can scrape together some tuition. Moreover, all families are expected to give time to school projects -- not just the PTA, but painting and fix-up activities as well. Finally, families that really cannot afford any tuition are allowed to "work off" the obligation: Families that pay something are families that take school seriously.<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Congress soon will have an opportunity to promote the moral renewal and economic revitalization of America's most poverty-stricken urban and rural areas. The measure to accomplish this task is Saving Our Children: The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3467:">H.R. 3467</a>), sponsored by Representatives J. C. Watts (R-OK) and <a href="http://www.house.gov/talent/welcome.html">James Talent</a> (R-MO). The bill would assist families in areas with high rates of poverty, crime, welfare dependency, joblessness, and poor schools. Through serious tax incentives and regulatory relief, coupled with innovative school reform pilot projects and home ownership incentives, the bill would achieve:<ul>

<p><li>Increased job creation;

<p><li>Small business expansion and formation;

<p.<li>Moral renewal;

<p><li>Expanded educational opportunities;

<p><li>Greater private philanthropy to aid the poor; and

<p><li>Greater participation by religious organizations in providing services to the poor.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Far too many of America's urban and rural neighborhoods are characterized by large numbers of people in poverty, as well as by juvenile crime, illegitimacy, joblessness, and female-headed households. Because companies are not investing in these areas, local economic growth and opportunity are hampered. And quick-fix short-term solutions, such as raising the minimum wage, do little to help improve the lives of people entangled in a web of poverty, crime, and illegitimacy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The problems of these communities are related to weaknesses of the local economy and the weakening of the moral and social fabric of the community itself; for policymakers to view the decline of these communities as the result of only one or the other prevents them from bringing about real and sustainable reform. Congress needs to strip away regulatory and institutional barriers that thwart rebuilding the broken lives and economies of these areas. The adoption of a wholly new and comprehensive urban policy of the sort that is embodied in the Saving Our Children bill would help the citizens of these communities achieve a better life for themselves and their children, not just by creating a far more favorable climate for business activity, but also by empowering the citizens of these communities to become active decision makers in their own lives and the lives of their children rather than merely passive subjects of the decisions of inflexible government social service and education bureaucracies.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Recent studies have shown that a comprehensive approach to community development is the best way to bring substantive change to distressed and impoverished communities. It also appears that the social programs that work best are community-based. Such local initiatives are the most effective means of attacking the often difficult problems that individuals and families have with joblessness, poor education, crime, drugs, and welfare dependency. For example, a 1989 study reported that 81 percent of families in poverty face multiple obstacles to achieving self-sufficiency.<sup>1</sup>  For many years, government agencies have tended to focus on single issues, such as housing or health. But policymakers increasingly are realizing that a piece-by-piece approach to urban policy is not likely to succeed. As Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros puts it, "We believe the best strategy to community development is a community-driven, comprehensive approach which coordinates economic, physical, environmental, community and human needs."<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The Saving Our Children bill gives Congress and the Administration an opportunity to act on this commitment and change the way the federal government has been involved in community development over the last 30 years. By lessening federal regulations and taxes, and increasing parents' freedom to choose schools that reflect their ideals, the communities that need the most assistance can serve as local laboratories of reform, generating ideas and inspiration for various other communities across the nation, as well as for policymakers in Washington.
<p>
<b>WHAT THE SAVING OUR CHILDREN BILL DOES</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The Saving Our Children bill has five main elements. The first two apply to the 100 "renewal communities" created by the bill. The remaining three major reforms apply nationwide.
<p>
<b>1. Creation of Renewal Communities.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Title I creates up to 100 renewal communities across the nation, based on the degree to which an area is characterized by poverty and distress. Through tax relief, regulatory reform, and savings incentives for Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) recipients, this title would aid the poorest communities in the nation. Specifically, it would:<ul>

<p><li><b>Provide</b> federal, state, and local tax and regulatory relief through provisions such as 100 percent capital gains tax exclusion on qualified assets held within a renewal community for at least five years.

<p><li><b>Enhance and increase</b> community involvement and ownership, in part through the creation of Family Development Accounts. These accounts would encourage EITC recipients to save money tax-free for certain expenditures such as higher education or buying a home for the first time.

<p><li><b>Improve</b> the delivery of local government services by encouraging privatization and increases in efficiency.

<p><li><b>Encourage</b> financial institutions to maintain a presence and invest in designated renewal communities.
</ul>
<p>
<b>2. Education Scholarships for Poor Children within Renewal Communities.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

As a condition of becoming a renewal community, a locality would administer the federally funded Low-Income Educational Opportunity Scholarship Program established under Title IV of the bill. Low-income parents within the renewal community would be given federally funded scholarships to send their children to primary and secondary schools chosen by the parent. Poor parents would be able to use these scholarships to choose to send their children to a variety of schools, including alternative public schools, private schools, and private religious schools. Because religious schools can play a critical role in rebuilding the moral foundation of America's inner cities, they are included as an essential component of the scholarship program.

<p>
<b>3. Charitable Contribution Tax Credit.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

To encourage charitable contributions to private organizations aiding the poor, the bill would create a tax credit that refunds 75 percent of a taxpayer's contribution to any private charity engaged primarily in providing direct services to the poor. The maximum eligible contribution would be $200 for single filers and $400 for joint filers. The credit would be available to all federal income tax filers nationwide, regardless of whether they itemize deductions on their tax returns.
<p>

<b>4. Prevention and Treatment of Substance Abuse.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Until now, religiously affiliated drug treatment centers have been hampered in their ability to receive funds under the Public Health Service Act. Title III of the bill would amend current law to allow such organizations to receive federal funds for the treatment services they provide without restricting their religious activity. In addition, this section recognizes that religious education and religiously motivated drug treatment personnel can have a vital and important role in effective drug treatment. Thus, it would loosen unnecessary bureaucratic credentialing requirements on treatment staff which may bar religious drug treatment programs from receiving federal drug rehabilitation funds. These provisions would apply nationwide.

<p>
<b>5. Work Opportunity Tax Credit.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
With teenage unemployment at nearly 20 percent, this provision gives employers tax incentives to hire individuals who are welfare recipients or "high-risk" youth, the persons who have a more difficult time securing permanent employment. This tax provision also would apply nationwide.
<p>

<b>CREATING RENEWAL COMMUNITIES</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under Title 1, state or local governments would apply to the U.S. Department of Housing and Development (HUD) to have certain depressed areas designated as "renewal communities."  Up to 100 such communities would be created nationwide. To qualify under the terms of the bill, the local area must be low income, and local authorities must agree both to ease regulations that impede economic activity and to operate the scholarship program for poor children provided in Title IV. If more than 100 localities applied to become renewal communities, HUD would select the 100 poorest. Upon becoming a renewal community, a locality would receive substantial tax and regulatory relief. Designated renewal communities would retain their status for seven years.
<p>

<b>1) Eligible Areas.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To become one of the 100 renewal communities, a local area would have to be nominated by a state or local government officials and would have to meet the following criteria:
<ul>
<p><li>The locality must be an economically depressed area within a larger city or county.

<p><li>The locality must be characterized by pervasive poverty and distress and entirely located within the jurisdiction of a local government eligible to receive Community Development Block Grant funds (according to Section 119 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974). This means that a renewal community must be a subsection within the jurisdiction of a local government that is itself characterized by poverty and distress, not simply a pocket of poverty within an area of general affluence.

<p><li>The unemployment rate within the locality must be 1 1/2 times the national unemployment rate.

<p><li>Each census tract within the locality must have a poverty rate of at least 20 percent.

<p><li>At least 70 percent of the households within the locality must have incomes below 80 percent of the median income of households within the jurisdiction of local government.

<p><li>The locality must have a continuous boundary and be located within the jurisdiction of one local government.

<p><li>If any part of an area is located within a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) with a population greater than 50,000, the minimum population within the renewal community area must be at least 4,000. For all other non-rural and non-MSA areas, the population within the proposed community must be at least 1,000 or located entirely within an Indian Reservation.

<p><li>Ten percent of the renewal communities must be in rural areas. For an area to be considered "rural," it must be within a local government jurisdiction with less than 50,000 people, be outside a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) as defined by the Census bureau, or otherwise be considered rural by the Secretary of HUD.
</ul>
<p>
<b>2) Required Commitments by Local Officials.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For an area to become a renewal community, state and local government officials and representatives of neighborhood organizations must express in writing their commitment to reduce taxes, regulations, and burdens on businesses within the renewal community area in at least five of the following seven ways:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Reduce</b> taxes and fees;

<p><li><b>Increase</b> the level of efficiency of local services;

<p><li><b>Develop and implement</b> crime reduction strategies;

<p><li><b>Streamline</b> government requirements and regulations;

<p><li><b>Foster</b> coordination between and involvement of private organizations and community groups, and encourage such groups to provide jobs and job training, technical, financial, or other assistance to employers, employees, and other residents from the renewal community;<sup>3</sup>

<p><li><b>Provide</b> state or local income tax benefits for fees paid for services, such as trash collection, that formerly were performed by the government but now are privatized; and

<p><li><b>Encourage</b> the donation or sale of land, homes, and commercial/industrial structures to neighborhood organizations, community development corporations, or private companies.
</ul><p>

<b>3) Required Economic Growth Measures.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To establish a renewal community, state and local officials must repeal or suspend government regulations, except for those required to protect health and safety. These include:
<ul>
<p><li><b>License requirements</b> for occupations that do not require a professional degree;

<P><li><b>Zoning restrictions</b> on home-based businesses that are not a public nuisance;

<p><li><b>Permit requirements</b> for street vendors that are not a public nuisance;

<p><li><b>Zoning and other restrictions</b> that impede the formation of schools and child care centers; and

<p><li><b>Restrictions on competition</b> for businesses providing public services, such as cable TV, taxicabs, or trash removal.
</ul>
<p>
<b>4) Tax Breaks to Stimulate Jobs in Poor Neighborhoods.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Enterprise Zones, if crafted correctly, hold great promise in restoring economic vitality to poor neighborhoods.<sup>4</sup>  Experience with "enterprise zones" has shown that targeted tax relief on business activity in depressed inner city areas over time can cut the unemployment rate in those areas by a third or more.<sup>5</sup>  To create jobs and stimulate business activity in local communities, the Watts-Talent bill will match tax cutting and deregulation at the local level with a sharp reduction in federal taxes within the locality.
<p>
<b>Exclusion from Capital Gains.</b> Once a local area has been designated a renewal community, the bill would reduce federal taxes on private investment in any qualified renewal community enterprise (defined as a business that derives at least 80 percent of its gross income from within the community and has at least 35 percent of its employees living in the renewal community). The tax benefits for investment in qualified businesses within the renewal community area include a 100 percent exclusion of capital gains tax. An individual would not be taxed for any capital gains resulting from the sale of assets of a qualified renewal community enterprise held for more than five years. This exclusion is limited to $100,000 per tax year and a $500,000 total.
<p>
<b>Deduction of Stock Purchases.</b> Individuals in these communities would have the option to deduct certain purchases of stock of qualified renewal community enterprises instead of taking the 100 percent exclusion from capital gains.
<p>
<b>Deduction for Tangible Property.</b> Individuals and businesses in these communities also would have reduced up-front taxation on investments in tangible property within the renewal community. Under current federal income tax law, businesses and individuals may deduct up $17,500 from their federal income tax to cover current year capital investment costs.<sup>6</sup>  Under the Watts-Talent bill, an extra $35,000 could be deducted for investment in renewal community businesses.<sup>7</sup>
i<p>
<b>Tax Credit for Revitalization.</b> To encourage the renovation of decaying buildings that often blight impoverished areas, Section 107 of the bill gives taxpayers a tax credit equal to a percentage of their qualified revitalization expenditures within the renewal community. A person either could receive up front a tax credit of 20 percent of revitalization expenditures for the tax year a revitalized building is completed or could elect to receive a credit of 5 percent each year for ten years, beginning with the year the building is completed. The maximum expenditure for which a taxpayer may receive credit is $10 million. The building may not be a residence and must be located within the renewal community, and the revitalization costs must exceed 25 percent of the fair market value of the structure.
<p>
<b>Establishing Family Development Accounts for Renewal Community EITC Recipients.</b> Section 106 of the bill also authorizes the creation of Family Development Accounts (FDAs) designed to encourage low-income families to save a portion of their income or their Earned Income Tax Credit refund. Cash donations would be deductible, even if the individual does not itemize. Withdrawals from these accounts would be tax-free if the money is used for certain specified expenditures. Contributions to FDAs would be limited to the lesser of $2,000 or the total amount of a person's compensation included in gross income for a given tax year. Persons donating to the family accounts of others would be limited to a deduction of $1,000.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Family Development Account funds can be used tax-free for the following expenses:
<ul>
<p><li>Post-secondary education tuition and expenses;

<p><li>First-home purchasing costs;

<p><li>Business capitalization expenditures, including capital, plant, equipment, working capital, and inventory expenses, with such businesses required to have an approved business plan;

<p><li>Medical expenses not otherwise covered by insurance; and

<p><li>Qualified rollovers which involve paying into another individual's FDA with funds from one's own account.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If an employer paid into a worker's FDA, the employer's contribution also would be counted as compensation. Matches also could be provided by state or local governments, service organizations, corporations, local churches, foundations, or other such organizations.
<p>

<b>5. FDA Matching Fund Program Demonstration Areas. </b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under the bill, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development could select up to 25 communities, with a minimum of two rural areas and based on their relative impoverishment, to serve as demonstration areas for an FDA matching fund program. Within these areas, each qualified individual would have an amount, equal to the amount deposited into the FDA account by the individual, matched by the federal government. This matching amount would be limited to $1,000 each year. The maximum one person could ever receive from the federal government is $2,000.

<p>
<b>6. Community Reinvestment Act.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  
To encourage financial institutions to maintain a presence and invest in designated renewal communities, Section 501 of Title V directs that such efforts be taken into account when assessing an institution's compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (12 USC 2903).
<p>
<b>7. FDA Application Fees.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  
Section 502 waives "application fees" required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve a drug developed within a renewal community.

<p>
<b>LOW-INCOME EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In order to become a renewal community, local officials also must agree to operate the bill's Low-Income Educational Opportunity Scholarship Program for poor children within the community. The program provides federally funded scholarships to enable poor parents to send their children to a broader range of primary and secondary schools. It has two goals:
<ul>
<p><li>GOAL #1: To expand educational opportunity for poor children by giving their parents a broader range of choice in determining where the child goes to school; and
<p><li>GOAL #2: To foster moral renewal in a community by enabling poor parents to send their children to religious schools which teach moral principles and instill virtue as an essential ingredient of education.
</ul><p>
<b>Parental Right of Choice.</b> Parents would be eligible to receive funds under the scholarship program for their children if (a) they live in the designated renewal community; (b) the family income does not exceed 185 percent of the poverty line; and (c) they have elected to participate in the program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Parents of children who received financial assistance under this program would be free to choose from a wide range of types of schools, including alternative public schools, charter schools, private schools, and private religious schools.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A parent would be able to redeem a scholarship at any private or private religious school within the locality which meets the health and educational standards for private schools within the locality which existed as of January 1, 1996.<sup>8</sup>  All schools which redeemed these special scholarships would be required to comply with the anti-discrimination provisions of Section 601 of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and not to discriminate on the basis of race.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill would require renewal communities to give parents timely information to enable them to make informed decisions about the education of their children. At the very least, the information would have to explain the scholarship fund, describe the eligibility requirements and selection procedure, and provide information about alternative public schools and scholarship schools.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A locality would have to allocate scholarships and transportation aid to eligible parents who apply for aid on a first-come, first-served basis or through another mechanism of selection determined by the locality which does not discriminate on the basis of the type of school selected by the parent. The scholarships are not entitlements.

<p>
<b>Types and Value of Scholarships for Poor Children</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Far too many poor children are trapped in poorly performing schools. Funds under the program are intended to broaden the educational choices of poor parents and children within the renewal community. If the parents chose to send their child to an alternative public school where tuition is already paid, under the bill they would receive funds to cover the costs of transportation. If they elected to send their child to a private school, they would receive a scholarship for the child which could be used only to pay for tuition and educational fees at the selected school.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Each locality would determine the precise monetary value of scholarships for children in their locality. The bill establishes the range of local options, but the maximum value of the scholarship also must not exceed the per capita cost of educating children in a public school in the locality. Further, the scholarship must have minimum value, which shall not fall below the lesser of a) 60 percent of the average cost of educating children in the public schools in the locality during the preceding year or b) the normal tuition charged by the private school.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Each renewal community would be given a fixed amount each year to pay for scholarships and transportation aid for poor children. If the number of low-income parents who applied for scholarships and or transportation aid was insufficient to utilize all the funds available, any surplus funds could be used to assist in educating low-income children within the community's public schools.
<p>

<b>Poor Parents, Poor Children, and Religious Schools</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Americans are increasingly concerned about the character and quality of the social order, the apparent decline in the culture, and the corrosive influences of that culture on family life and the moral condition of the country. These concerns are common to Americans, regardless of their racial or income group or where they live and work. For a variety of reasons, individuals and families, children especially, are even more vulnerable to social pathologies, including violent crime, illegal drug use, and illegitimacy and family breakdown.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
<b>Importance of Religion.</b> A central goal of the  Saving Our Children bill is to foster moral renewal in inner-city communities wracked by crime, drug abuse, sexual promiscuity, and family disintegration. The sponsors of the bill recognize that building a sound moral foundation is the most important aspect of a child's education and that moral renewal is critical to solving urban social problems. The power of religion to help the poor help themselves is amply documented.<sup>11</sUP>  Investigating the condition of black inner-city youth, Richard Freeman of Harvard University finds that boys who regularly attend church are 50 percent less likely to engage in crime than boys of similar backgrounds who do not attend church; they also are 54 percent less likely to use drugs and 47 percent less likely to drop out of school.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Boys and girls who attend church regularly are two-thirds less likely to engage in sexual activity in their teens. Regular church attendance halves the probability that a woman will have a child out of wedlock.<sup>13</sUP>  Children attending religious schools are two-thirds less likely to drop out than are nearly identical children who attend secular schools.<sup>14</sup>  Children ages 10 to 18 who do not attend church are a third to a half more likely to exhibit anti-social and dysfunctional behavior.<sup>15</sUP>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Social consequences follow from school choice.<sup>16</sup>  The bill therefore helps poor parents give their children a sound moral upbringing by allowing them to use scholarships to send children to religious schools.
<p>
<b>Constitutional Issues.</b> The Supreme Court has held that as long as the parent, not the government, decides where the scholarship will be spent on a child's behalf, public funds can be used for education in a religious institution because the government has neither advanced nor inhibited a particular religion and therefore has not violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment.<sup>17</sup>  For example, in the 1986 case of <I>Witters v. Washington Department of Services for the Blind,</I> Larry Witters, a blind man, wished to use state vocational funds to attend religious seminary to help him fulfill his personal goal of becoming a minister. The U.S. Supreme Court held unanimously that Witters's use of state vocational funds to attend seminary did not violate the U.S. Constitution. Writing for the majority, Justice Thurgood Marshall asserted:
<blockquote>
	It is well settled that the Establishment Clause is not violated every time money previously in the possession of a state is conveyed to a religious institution. For example, a State may issue a paycheck to one of its employees, who may then donate all or part of that paycheck to a religious institution, all without constitutional barriers.<sup>18</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Justice Marshall further argued that it was permissible for Witters to use government vocational funds to attend seminary because the individual, not the government itself, was determining how to allocate the money:
<blockquote>
	Any aid provided under Washington's program that ultimately flows to religious institutions does so only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients. The decision to support religious education is made by the individual, not the state.<sup>19</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under the bill, local officials may not prohibit poor parents from using the Watts-Talent scholarships to pay for tuition in religious schools and may not discriminate in any way against parents who choose to place their child in a religious school. If provisions of a state constitution prohibit state and local funds from being spent at religious institutions,<sup>20</sup> the renewal community can segregate all federal funds from state funds. But state and local officials may not prevent poor parents from using federal scholarship funds designated for poor children to pay for tuition in religious schools.
<p>

<b>Eligible Schools and Civil Rights Safeguards</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To receive scholarships, a school must comply with relevant anti-discrimination provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and also must satisfy applicable state and local requirements for curriculum and facilities and meet health and safety standards which existed as of January 1996. Schools are ineligible, however, if they advocate criminal behavior or are operated by an organization advocating criminal behavior.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The sponsors of the bill are careful to ensure that the scholarships will not become a Trojan horse leading to a government takeover of private or religious schools. The bill includes specific safeguards both to protect private schools which redeem scholarships from government intrusiveness and to protect the liberty of religious schools:
<ul>
<p><li>No additional regulations on burdensome paperwork may be imposed on private schools which redeem scholarships;

<p><li>Private schools redeeming scholarships will not be subject to regulations restricting religious instruction and shall be protected by the rights granted in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993;

<p><li>Any religious school may require its employees to adhere to its religious tenets and moral code of behavior;<sup>21</sup> and

<p><li>Private schools will be permitted to operate as single-sex institutions, or to operate classes separated by gender (Section 409[b][6]).
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill's language also includes a critical clarification to protect personal and religious liberty: No provision may be construed to give the federal government authority to direct or control the curriculum, administration, or personnel of any private school participating in the scholarship program (Section 410[c]).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill would require evaluation of the effects of the scholarship program. It authorizes studies comparing the performance of children with similar backgrounds to determine whether those from renewal communities who participate in the scholarship program outperform those who do not. In addition, the authorized studies would examine parental involvement and the degree to which it is improved when parents are able to choose where they send their children to school.

<p>
<b>Targeting Education Funds to Poor Communities</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Federal scholarship funds would be channeled to renewal communities through two funding tiers, with 80 percent of the funds allocated through the first tier. Under the first tier, the share of federal funds received by a renewal community shall be pro-rated based on the number of school-age children with family incomes below 185 percent of poverty residing in the community, relative to the total number of such low-income children residing in all renewal communities nationwide.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Twenty percent of scholarship funds must be allocated through the second tier. To encourage private-sector and state and local government contributions to the scholarship program, second tier funds are to be divided according to the level of non-federal financial support given to the program within each locality. The share of these funds given to a specific renewal community would be equal to that community's pro-rated share of non-federal contributions to the scholarship program within all renewal communities nationwide.
<p>

<b>REINFORCING AMERICA'S INDEPENDENT SECTOR</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To an increasing degree, Americans realize that government solutions to poverty enacted during the latter part of this century have failed. Since the beginning of the War on Poverty in 1965, the U.S. has spent $5.4 trillion to aid low-income Americans.<sup>22</sUp>  But in many ways, poor communities are worse off now than when Congress started to establish this vast array of federal social programs over 30 years ago. The following provisions would apply nationwide.
<p>
<b>A Charitable Tax Credit</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Saving Our Children bill creates a new tax credit, intended to encourage Americans to allocate more of their charitable contributions to private organizations that are fighting poverty effectively with low administrative overhead. According to Section 201 of Title II, taxpayers who donate to a qualified charity would receive a 75 percent tax credit for donations up to $200 for single and $400 for joint filers. This credit would be available regardless of whether a taxpayer itemizes deductions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A charity is qualified to receive donations under this provision if its predominant activity is the provision of direct services to individuals whose annual incomes generally do not exceed 185 percent of the official poverty line. A qualified charity must provide direct services to low income persons and may not participate in political activities such as lobbying, litigation on behalf of service recipients, public policy advocacy, public policy research, or voter registration.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill's underlying philosophical premise is that individual taxpayers, because they are closer to the needs of their communities, are better able to make decisions about where funds should go than are bureaucrats in Washington. They can target funds to programs that work. Giving taxpayers additional means with which to make financial contributions to worthy poverty-fighting organizations would enable them to become more involved in their communities, fostering a greater sense of civic duty and fellowship.
<p>
<b>Using Faith-Based Drug Treatment Centers</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 301 of Title III (Prevention and Treatment of Substance Abuse: Services Provided through Religious Organizations) applies nationwide. It amends the Public Health Service Act to meet three goals:<ul>

<p><li><b>To permit</b> faith-based substance abuse treatment centers to receive federal assistance and to prohibit discrimination against such centers;

<p><li><b>To make</b> it easier for individuals receiving federally funded drug treatment to select drug treatment therapy that is religious in nature; and

<p><li><b>To protect</b> the rights of individuals receiving drug treatment by ensuring that no individual can be required to receive services from a religious organization and guaranteeing that individuals who do not wish to receive drug treatment services from religious entities must be provided with alternative secular services.
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Faith-based drug treatment is different from secular treatment in that it encourages a person to look beyond himself for the strength to overcome addiction. That apparently is why faith-based treatment is more effective than secular treatment: Individuals in any religious denomination or group have lower levels of drug use regardless of whether the denomination teaches against the use of alcohol, although denominations that teach against any use of drugs or alcohol exhibit the highest rates of drug avoidance.<sup>23</sup>  Likewise, religion has been shown to be a powerful force in helping alcoholics abstain from alcohol. For over half a century, Alcoholics Anonymous has encouraged participants to invoke a higher power to help them recover from their addiction.<sup>24</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In reviewing the religious treatment of addicts, research psychiatrists at the Duke University Department of Psychiatry concluded in 1992 that the "role of religious commitment and religiously oriented treatment programs can be significant factors which ought to be considered and included when planning a mix of appropriate treatment alternatives.... Perhaps the greatest advantage of religious programs is their recourse to churches as a support system.... Religious treatment programs are not suitable for everyone. For those men and women who can accept the creeds, rituals, and commitments required of such programs there seem to be certain advantages."<sup>25</sup>
<p>
<b>Eliminating Discrimination.</b> Under Title III of the bill, religious organizations are eligible to receive program funds and provide drug treatment services on the same basis as any other nonprofit private organization. While religious organizations would be required to meet the general requirements for effective drug treatment, neither the federal government nor any state government receiving federal treatment funds shall discriminate against an organization because of its religious character. Neither the federal nor any state government could interfere with the definition, practice, or expression of an organization's religious beliefs; nor could they require the organization to alter its form of internal governance or remove religious art, icons, sacred scripture, or other such symbols. Religious organizations which receive funds under the bill also could require any or all employees to adhere to their organizational religious and moral tenets.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At the same time, the language of the bill would protect the religious liberty of drug users receiving treatment. Any person who objects to participating in a drug treatment program operated by a religious organization shall be given the option of receiving treatment in an alternative program operated by a secular organization.
<p>
<b>Personal Help.</b> States may provide beneficiaries with vouchers that enable them to choose among a wide variety of drug treatment programs under Title III. If a person needing drug treatment is given a voucher or other mode of reimbursement which enables that person to select the treatment program in which he will participate, the drug treatment monies may be used for any religious worship and instruction which is part of the overall drug treatment. This provision is fully in accord with U.S. Supreme Court rulings on the religious establishment clause in <I>Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District , Mueller v. Allen, and Witters v. Washington Dept. of Services for Blind.</I>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If a person with a drug abuse problem freely elects to participate in a religious drug treatment program rather than secular alternatives, the individual could be required to follow the rules set forth in the program and to participate in any religious practice or instruction that is part of the treatment program. Any individual who does not wish to participate in a drug treatment program operated by a religious organization is given the full right to refuse such treatment. Such individuals must be given the option of attending an equivalent alternative secular treatment program.
<p>
<b>Broadening Help for the Addicted.</b> The bill's language also stipulates that state or local governments should recognize that religious education can have a critical role in providing effective drug treatment. In applying education qualifications as a condition for receiving federal funds, state or local governments would have to give credit for religious education that is equivalent to the credit given for secular course-work of similar grade levels and duration. Furthermore, any religious organization which is barred from receipt of federal drug treatment funds by means of education and credentialing standards imposed by state or local government could appeal to the Secretary of Labor to waive such standards. The Secretary must waive the standards if:
<ul>
<p><li>The organization has provided effective drug treatment for at least three years;
<p><li>The Secretary determines the requirements for education and training of personnel effectively bar the organization from receipt of funds; and
<p><li>The state or local government is unable to demonstrate empirically that such qualifications are necessary to have a successful drug treatment program.
<p>
</ul>
<b>CREATING REAL JOBS IN POOR NEIGHBORHOODS</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Work Opportunity Tax Credit, found in Section 201 of Title II of the bill, is designed to encourage the employment and economic betterment of those whose past makes it difficult for them to secure a job and make a fresh start. The bill would replace the expired Targeted Jobs Tax Credit (TJTC). The Work Opportunity Tax Credit offsets the cost of hiring persons who fall into a number of categories, including AFDC or food stamp recipients and their families; economically disadvantaged veterans, ex-felons, and high-risk youth; vocational rehabilitation referrals; and qualified summer youth employees.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Employers would be eligible to claim a 35 percent credit on the first $6,000 of first-year wages paid to a qualifying individual (for a maximum credit of $2,100). In the case of certain summer youth, employers could claim a 35 percent credit on $3,000 of wages (for a maximum credit of $1,050).
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress has an opportunity to change the direction of American social policy. The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 contains a new comprehensive strategy to help resolve America's urban problems. It assumes that the choices and decisions of low-income Americans who want to help each other and themselves should be respected, is grounded in the experience of local organizations and community groups, and harnesses the initiative and genius of local institutions in an empowerment strategy that can work.
<p>
Specifically:<ul>

<p><li><b>The bill would reduce urban unemployment by reducing the tax and regulatory burden on businesses in inner-city areas.</b> This type of economic policy can reduce unemployment in affected localities by a third or more.

<p><li><b>The bill would expand educational opportunity by providing poor parents with scholarships which could be used to pay for tuition in private schools.</b> By giving poor parents the same sort of choice in education that middle-class families already have, the bill would increase parental involvement, improve the quality of education, and reduce the rate of school failure.

<p><li><b>The bill would help churches and religious institutions rebuild the moral foundations of inner cities by allowing poor parents to enroll their children in religious schools.</b> The authors of the bill recognize the simple and uncomplicated truth that the development of a strong moral character, reinforced by religious discipline and the habitual practice of virtue, is the necessary basis for success in school, in work, and in life itself. The church, as an institution, is society's most effective weapon in saving children from alcohol abuse, illegal drugs, violent crime, sexual promiscuity, illegitimacy, and dependence. By allowing inner-city churches, through a school choice program, to play a far greater and more decisive role in shaping the hearts and minds of America's young people, the Saving Our Children bill would be a large step forward in combating the social ills that plague America's inner cities.

<p><li><b>The bill would further encourage Americans from all walks of life to become more directly involved in the basic business of financing social service programs to help the poor.</b> It would expand the role of private-sector charity in aiding the poor. Federal, state, and local governments spend nearly $400 billion each year on a wide variety of programs to aid low-income Americans. By a wide margin, the public regards many, if not most, of these government programs as failures. By providing a generous tax credit for individual taxpayer donations to private charities which aid the poor, the Watts-Talent bill would enable the private sector, and religious charities in particular, to bring new and innovative local approaches to the struggle against poverty, drugs, family disintegration, and crime through programs that work and can make a real difference in the lives of young men and women.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The comprehensive urban policy embodied in the Saving Our Children bill gives Congress an excellent opportunity to make a bipartisan stand for children. It rejects the premise that all that is needed for our nation's poorest communities are larger benefit checks from the government. It goes beyond simply managing the symptoms of impoverishment to tackle the root causes of poverty, crime, and illegitimacy. It establishes the economic conditions which enable depressed communities to become more profitable places for work and business. And it recognizes and harnesses the positive energy of the nation's churches and religious institutions to advance the character and quality of American life.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States Supreme Court noted many years ago that "The primary role of the parents in the upbringing of their children is now established beyond debate as an enduring American tradition."<sup>3</sup>  And President Bill Clinton, in his 1994 State of the Union speech, declared that "We cannot renew our country until we realize that governments don't raise children, parents do."<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Congress is poised to give legislative form to these sentiments. The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act (S. 984 and H.R. 1946), introduced by Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) and Representative Steve Largent (R-OK), would give parents the standing in law to protect their rights to direct the education and to protect and form the moral character of their children. In fact, it would give them superior standing over government and its agencies in these matters: The bill declares that parents' rights to direct the upbringing of their children are fundamental rights which government can curtail only under conditions of "compelling interest" and under "strict guidelines" of judicial procedure, legal terms which guide courts in their decisions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congressional proponents of the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act contend that parental rights over the rearing of children are so basic that the Founders never even conceived of their being usurped by government. These rights, precisely because they are basic to the concept of liberty, should not be abridged by government except in the most unusual circumstances. They are liberty rights, protected by the Fifth Amendment. The bill would make this clear.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Parental rights concern the relationship between government -- federal, state, and local -- and parents in the raising of children. This area of civil liberties is the domain of Congress and the Supreme Court, with the Fourteenth Amendment clearly giving Congress the power to pass legislation to enforce such constitutional rights and protecting citizens against the abridgment of their rights by government:<blockquote>
	All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States....<sup>5</sup>
<p>
	The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.<sup>6</sup>
</blockquote><P>

<B>The Erosion of Parental Authority</B>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Over the years, widely scattered and repeated attacks on the fundamental rights of parents have come from state and local courts; from federal, state, and local government bureaucracies and officials; and from policy initiatives inspired by a number of the major professions dealing with children. Certain members of these professions seem more concerned with displacing parents than with aiding them. In fact, the bill is opposed by many liberal groups wishing to change the relationship between government and the family, including the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the National Education Association.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While critics say the bill would cause confusion in child abuse and domestic relations law and procedure, congressional sponsors argue that child abuse is not a parental right and that they explicitly left all child abuse and domestic relations concerns outside the scope of the bill. These clearly are within the proper scope of state authority.
<P>

<B>WHAT THE BILL DOES</B>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 4 of the bill clarifies and codifies the rights of parents already affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court: "No Federal, State or local government, or any official of such a government acting under color of law, shall interfere with or usurp the right of a parent to direct the upbringing of the child of the parent."

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

According to Section 3, the parent's right to direct the upbringing of a child includes the right to:
<UL>
<p><li><b>Direct or provide</b> for the education of the child;

<p><li><b>Make</b> a health or mental health decision for the child, with exceptions;<sup>7</sup>

<p><li><b>Discipline</b> the child, including reasonable corporal punishment as already defined by the Supreme Court; and

<p><li><b>Direct or provide</b> for the religious and moral formation of the child.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It also makes clear the procedure the courts must follow when these rights are to be denied by the state. The standard to which the courts must hold all levels of government in any move to deny parents their rights is laid out simply in Section 5:<blockquote>

	No exception to [the right] shall be permitted, unless the government is able to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence, that the interference or usurpation is essential to accomplish a compelling government interest and is narrowly drawn or applied in a manner that is the least restrictive means of accomplishing the compelling interest.</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This would establish a clear standard of judicial review whenever a state challenges parents. The government or its agencies would have to demonstrate a compelling interest in the contravention of parental authority. "Compelling interest" is a standard that demands "strict scrutiny" or "clear and convincing evidence" of the government's compelling and narrowly drawn interest in removing parental authority in the case before the court. It is the highest standard that can be adopted in a civil issue and is the traditional standard used by all when reviewing all other fundamental rights issues. If parental rights are fundamental, therefore, the "strict scrutiny" and "compelling interest" tests ought always to follow.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 7 specifically puts certain areas outside the scope of the bill, either because they properly are subject to state law or because they are not parental rights. These areas include the abuse or neglect of a child; domestic relations conflicts between parents, such as divorce and child custody battles; and adoption proceedings.
<p>

<b>Deference to States' Rights</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the United States, family law is made at the state level. The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act therefore would uphold the role of the states in their relationship to families and parents by depriving no state of any power it retains under the federal Constitution. By clarifying the rights of parents, it would be a defense against intrusion into parental authority either by government (including legislatures, courts, and agency bureaucracies) or by professions acting as agents of government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As noted, the bill delineates the areas of state law within which it does not apply. Because family law, as opposed to individual rights, is the domain of the states, the bill does not change definitions in state family law. "The term `child' has the meaning provided by state domestic relations statute," for instance. "The term `parent' has the meaning provided by state domestic relations statute....  The term `direct upbringing of a child' shall not include abandonment, abuse and neglect as the terms have been defined in state statute."<sup>8</sup>  Furthermore, "Nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit the ability of state or local governments from granting greater protection to parental rights."<sup>9</sup>
<p>

<b>THE NATURE OF PARENTAL RIGHTS</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under American constitutional law, "fundamental rights" are inherent in the person, and government at any level can abridge them only in cases of compelling state interest. The Constitution spells out or provides the basis for a number of such fundamental rights: free speech, freedom of religious practice, freedom from racial discrimination, freedom of the press. Many of these rights are spelled out in detail in statutes enacted by Congress pursuant to the Constitution.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"Legal rights," by contrast, are not inherent in the person. They are granted by government and therefore can be altered or withdrawn by it. Social Security, Medicare, and welfare entitlements all are examples of legal rights.

<p>
<b>Parental Rights As Fundamental Rights</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is the settled view of the U.S. Supreme Court that parental rights are fundamental rights. In 1943, for example, the Court said:<blockquote>

	Constitutional interpretation has consistently recognized that the parents' claim to authority in their own household to direct the upbringing of their children is basic in the structure of our society. It is cardinal with us that the custody, care, and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary functions and freedom include preparations for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder.<sup>10</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Supreme Court repeatedly has affirmed the fundamental nature of these rights, including the right to marry; to establish a home and bring up children;<sup>11</sup> to raise these children in their own fashion<sup>12</sup> (whether the children like the way they do it or not);<sup>13</sup> to direct the education of their children and to pass on to them their own principles, faith, and values;<sup>14</sup> to direct their children's religious and moral education;<sup>15</sup> to make medical decisions for their minor children;<sup>16</sup> and to inflict corporal punishment when it is deemed necessary.<sup>17</sup>  In cases as far apart in time as 1925 and 1979, the Court has declared that:<blockquote>

	Our jurisprudence historically has reflected Western civilization concepts of the family as a unit with broad parental authority over minor children. Our cases have consistently followed that course; our constitutional system long ago rejected any notion that a child is the "mere creature of the state" and, on the contrary, asserted that parents generally "have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare [their children] for additional obligations."

<p>
	The law's concept of the family rests on a presumption that parents possess what a child lacks in maturity, experience, and capacity for judgment required for making life's difficult decisions. More important, historically it has recognized that natural bonds of affection lead parents to act in the best interest of their children.

	<p>
	That some parents "may at times be working against the interest of their child"... creates a bias for caution, but is hardly a reason to discard wholesale those pages of human experience that teach that parents generally do act in the child's best interest. The statist notion that governmental power should supersede parental authority in all cases because some parents abuse and neglect children is repugnant to American tradition.<sup>18</sup>

	<p>
	[P]arents and guardians, as part of their liberty, might direct the education of children by selecting reputable teachers and places.
<p>
	The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in this Union repose excludes any general power of the state to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only. The child is not a mere creature of the state; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
	Simply because the decision of the parent is not agreeable to the child or because it involves risks does not automatically transfer the power to make that decision from the parents to some agency or officer of the state.... Most children, even in adolescence, simply are not able to make sound judgments concerning many decisions, including their need for medical care or treatment. Parents can and must make those judgments.<sup>20</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In 1972, the Supreme Court summed up its intent in these earlier rulings: "The primary role of the parents in the upbringing of their children is now established beyond debate as an enduring American tradition."<sup>21</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

While parental rights are fundamental, however, they are not absolute. The Supreme Court has ruled repeatedly that states have the right to regulate the activities of family life for reasons of compelling state interest. Nonetheless, this governmental right is not unlimited. As the Court found in 1972, for example, "The state's interest in universal education, however highly we rank it, is not totally free from a balancing process when it impinges on fundamental rights and interests."<sup>22</sup>
<p>

<b>Complementary Roles of Congress and the Supreme Court</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Fundamental rights under the U.S. Constitution are the domain of the federal government because they regulate the relationship between government -- all government -- and the citizen. Clarity on these rights results from their being spelled out in the Constitution, in Supreme Court rulings, in legislation passed by Congress, or in some combination of the work of these two branches of the federal government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Redundancy of affirmation of fundamental rights is frequent between Congress and the Supreme Court. This has been the case in the last few decades, for instance, with the right to freedom from racial discrimination. There is a rich history of such clarification underlying the fundamental rights of U.S. citizens. At times, the Supreme Court will correct Congress, as it did in <I>Brown v. Board of Education</I> in 1954, clarifying the right to segregation-free education.<sup>23</sup>  At other times, Congress will correct the Supreme Court, as it did with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, clarifying the right to freedom of religious practice.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Congress's responsibility to enforce the protection of fundamental rights is described in the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution:<blockquote>

	No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.... <sup>24</sup>
<p>
	The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.<sup>25</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In the event of confusion over the nature of fundamental rights, it is the federal government's responsibility to clarify or protect them. Congress did this with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Supreme Court did so in <I>Brown v Board of Education</I> in 1954. Both Congress and the Court also may act if one state upholds fundamental rights and another denies them (as happened in certain states which persisted in countenancing racial discrimination). With the Parental Rights and Responsibility Act of 1995, Congress would assume this task with respect to parents' rights.
<p>

<b>THE NEED TO RESTORE THE PRIMACY OF THE FAMILY</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The family is the indispensable institution of civil society; for it is the family that is primarily competent and responsible for developing the good character of children. When families are strong and function well, their children grow into adults who are truthful and responsible, and who practice private virtue and public citizenship. When families falter, their children grow into adults who can be vicious and irresponsible. Thus, because a free and civil society depends so utterly on the work of families, individuals take on extraordinary responsibilities when they become parents. As the bipartisan National Commission on Children observed in its final report in 1991:
<blockquote>
	The family is and should remain society's primary institution for bringing children into the world and for supporting their growth and development throughout childhood.... Parents are the world's greatest experts on their own children. They are their children's first and most important caregivers, teachers, and providers. Parents are irreplaceable, and they should be respected and applauded by all parts of society for the work they do.<sup>26</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

As Urie Bronfenbrenner, professor of child psychology at Cornell University, has explained:
<blockquote>
	In order to develop -- intellectually, emotionally, socially, and morally -- a child requires participation in progressively more complex reciprocal activity, on a regular basis over an extended period in the child's life, with one or more persons with whom the child develops a strong, mutual, irrational emotional attachment and who is committed to the child's well-being and development, preferably for life.<sup>27</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It is parents -- not teachers, child care providers, social workers, or a "village" -- that are most likely to give this all-encompassing commitment to the welfare of the child. This is not to denigrate the important work done by teachers, child care providers, and social workers, but simply to acknowledge an important truth: Only parents can reasonably be expected to put the interests of their children above their own. Thus, government must assume that parents, not bureaucrats or politicians, are in the best position to make decisions about their children because only parents can be expected to have this overriding commitment to their children's welfare.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

This does not mean that all parents will put their children's interests above their own at all times. Indeed, some parents -- especially those who are under the influence of drugs like crack cocaine or alcohol -- even abuse their children physically or sexually. In such cases, the state can act to curtail the right of an individual parent or couple to care for a child. But the state can never lawfully curtail the fundamental rights of parents as a class; its duty is to uphold these rights. In all areas of public policy, government should assume that because parents are best able to make decisions about the welfare of their children, they must retain the maximum decision-making authority when it comes to raising those children. This is the underlying assumption of the Parents' Rights and Responsibilities Act of 1995.

<p>
<b>WHY PARENTS' RIGHTS NEED TO BE CODIFIED</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are four reasons for codifying parental rights in law, even though the Supreme Court has ruled clearly on the issue in the past. First, certain legislatures have transgressed against parents. Second, there is evidence that these rights have been violated in the courts at lower federal and state levels. Third, state government agency actions sometimes violate these rights. Fourth, an increasing hostility to the fundamental rights of parents is evident in the activities of certain prominent members of the very "humane professions" (education, law, medicine, social work, and psychology) that are supposed to aid parents in the work of raising children.<ol>

<p><li><b>Legislative Threats.</b> State legislators have encroached on parents' rights. Though the courts or the people eventually have repelled these attacks, the very fact that such rights are subject to assault illustrates the danger. A few examples:<ul>

<p><li><b>Oregon.</b> In the 1920s, when the state of Oregon passed a law banning private schools, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the fundamental right of parents to choose the type of education they desire for their children:
<blockquote>
The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in this Union repose excludes any general power of the state to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only. The child is not a mere creature of the state; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations.<sup>28</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Nevertheless, a whole state government, including both chambers of the legislature, the governor, and the state judiciary, had attempted to violate the fundamental rights of parents as a group.

<p><li><b>Utah.</b> In 1980, the Utah legislature, with the governor concurring, passed an Amendment to the Children's Rights Act which changed the test by which parents could be denied the right to custody of their child. The old criterion of "unfit or incompetent" was supplanted by a new one: "the best interest of the child."  In 1982, however, the Utah Supreme Court rejected the new criterion because it would have allowed the state rather than the parent to determine what constitutes a child's "best interest":
<blockquote>
	[T]he 1980 amendment did not merely <I>refine or elaborate</I> the requirement that the parent be found "unfit or incompetent" in order to terminate his or her parental rights. Instead it <I>replaced</I> that subsection, and in doing so deleted a statutory protection for the parental rights of fit parents.... 
<p>
	No court is warranted in applying the "polar star [guiding] principle" of the welfare of the infant until the natural parents' rights have been lawfully severed and terminated.... 
<p>
	We are not aware that this Court has ever espoused the view, and it is not our view, that the termination of parental rights can be decreed without giving serious consideration to the prior and fundamental right of a parent to rear his child; and concomitantly, of the right of the child to be reared by his natural parent.<sup>29</sup>
</blockquote><p>
<li><b>The U.S. Congress.</b> In February 1994, Representative George Miller (D-CA), long-standing chairman of the House Select Committee on Children, Youth, and Families, introduced an amendment to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (H.R. 6) that would have required a home schooling parent to be teacher-certified in any subject before being able to teach that subject to his or her child. This measure would have deprived parents of the hard-won recognition of their freedom to educate their children at home. Once the legislative threat became known, constituent phone calls to Congress reached historic levels,<sup>30</sup> illustrating the growing level of parental sensitivity to such encroachments. Thanks in large part to this public outrage, the Miller amendment failed by a vote of 382 to 53.
</ul><p>
<li><b>Judicial Threats.</b> Parental rights also have been threatened by the courts.
<ul>
<p><li><b>Massachusetts.</b> In 1995, the Supreme Court of Massachusetts affirmed the decision of the School Board of Falmouth to deny parents the ability to "opt out" of sex education classes and condom distribution for their children. The court further claimed that the freedom of parents was not violated because the children were not forced to take the condoms, the parents were free to tell their children to avoid the classes in question, and the children were free to avoid the classes if they chose.<sup>31</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The parents contended that the most critical and powerful element was missing from this formulation: the requirement that schools honor the parents' right to "opt out" even when their children did not want to do so. Thus, the ruling struck directly at parental authority. The court contended that the parents failed to demonstrate how their interests as parents were burdened by the school's condom or sex education programs. In other words, the state does not have to demonstrate "compelling state interest" when it decides to override the fundamental rights of parents; parents have to demonstrate unconstitutional interference by the state. The state is assumed to possess superior authority to direct the education and health of the child unless the parents can demonstrate otherwise.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

This ruling directly contradicts many other state court rulings on the same issue.<sup>32</sup>  Massachusetts parents thus do not have parental rights that are recognized in other states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In another notable case, the Massachusetts Supreme Court moved against parents who sought advance notification from the school so that they could exercise the "opt-out" provision.<sup>33</sup>  They contended that there was not much point in being able to "opt out" if they learned of the need only after the damage had taken place -- in this case, an AIDS awareness program conducted for the children by an outside consulting firm, "Hot, Sexy and Safer Productions Inc.," which included demonstrating the use of condoms and discussing many sexual acts traditionally regarded by parents as perverse and immoral.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Both the federal district court and the federal circuit court found the Massachusetts parents' case to be without standing, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case. As a result, Massachusetts parents have no recourse from rulings of the Massachusetts Supreme Court. Both state and federal courts, in effect, have denied the existence of the parents' fundamental rights, and there is no legal procedure by which these parents can protect themselves from this violation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Both of these rulings illustrate the need for Congress to clarify a right deemed fundamental in many states but not in all.


<p><li><b>Michigan.</b> In 1993, the Michigan Supreme Court issued two rulings on home schooling which illustrate that court's confusion with regard to parents' rights in education. According to the first, a set of parents has the right to home school their children because of their religious beliefs.<sup>34</sup>  But according to the second, another set of parents does not have the same freedom because, not claiming religious liberty principles, their rights to educate their children are controlled by the state of Michigan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In denying the "secular parents" their right to direct their children's education, the Michigan Supreme Court held "that a parent's Fourteenth Amendment right to direct a child's education is not one of those rights described by the United States Supreme Court as fundamental, and, thus, the strict scrutiny test is unwarranted."<sup>35</sup>  Thus, "religious" Michigan parents have a freedom to direct the education of their children that "secular" Michigan parents do not have. Michigan appears to have established a religious test for home schooling.

<p><li><b>Washington.<sup>36</sup></b> In 1980, the Supreme Court of the State of Washington ruled that it was not a violation of parents' rights to remove an eighth grade girl from her family. The parents had grounded her because she wanted to smoke marijuana and sleep with her boyfriend. She did not like her parents' rules, even though they were reasonably enforced, and asked the local child welfare agency to place her elsewhere.<sup>37</sup>  Rather than back the parents as the best way to correct the child's behavior, this agency honored the child's request that she be placed in someone else's home. One of the dissenting judges in the case described the situation:
<blockquote>
	They [the parents] asked their 15-year-old daughter not to use drugs, or associate with those who had furnished drugs, that she not use alcohol, that she not be sexually active, and that she be in at a reasonable hour. Because of the daughter's unwillingness to follow these obviously reasonable standards, these parents are summarily deprived of custody and the best opportunity to resolve these problems within the family.<sup>38</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

At no time did the state's lawyers contend that the parents' rules and their enforcement of them were unreasonable. Nor did they argue that the parents abused or neglected the child. The child simply wanted to avoid these restrictions, and the local child welfare agency and the courts backed her rather than her parents. Subsequently, the child's teenage and early adult years were extraordinarily troubled. Now an adult and mother herself, she sees the wisdom of her parents' approach and says that she wishes the local and state authorities had backed them instead of her.<sup>39</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Though the majority of the Washington Supreme Court denied the parents' rights (and in doing so differed clearly from both the Utah Supreme Court and the West Virginia Supreme Court), the three dissenting judges wrote:
<blockquote>
	There is no claim or proof [by the state] of unfitness or neglect by the parents. There was no claim of proof of any imminent threat of harm or danger to this 15-year-old.... Petitioning juvenile was asked at the court hearing the following: Q. "Could you please tell us why you believe there is a conflict in that home?"  A. "I just feel that there's a communication gap there."...  That is the sum and substance of the petitioner's testimony upon which she was taken from her parents' custody over their objections....  The court's justification for this extensive deprivation of fundamental parental rights consisted merely of conclusory findings of fact which met the unconstitutionally vague and inadequate standards of the statute.<sup>40</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Washington court's ruling was possible because of the lack of clear procedural legal guidelines for the denial of parental rights. This would not have happened if the court had been required to use the "compelling interest of the state" standard of review required by the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act now before Congress.
</ul>
<p><li><b>Threats from Boards and Bureaucrats.</b> Perhaps more than anything else, what has made parents increasingly aware of their fundamental rights is the frequent violation of these rights by state and local government officials.<ul>

<p><li><b>New York City.</b> The violation of parental rights can lead to confrontation. In 1992, one such dramatic and widely reported confrontation between parents and education authorities occurred over the teaching of "gay sex" in New York City's proposed "Rainbow Curriculum."  Despite hearings attended by hundreds of parents (and the declared opposition of tens of thousands more), the Board of Education pressed forward with its plans. While the voters ousted the offending board members shortly thereafter, the incident highlighted the depth of opposition to the fundamental right of parents to direct the education of their children, even in the area of intimate family-generating behavior.

<p><li><b>Virginia.</b> Sometimes the irony of this opposition escapes bureaucrats. In 1995, during a debate in Fairfax, Virginia, at a local school board meeting convened to vote on sex education, there was standing room only for parents, most of whom wanted something different from what the board intended to give them. School Superintendent Robert Spillane, annoyed with this supposed parental interference, complained: "You can see why parents should not be involved in family life education."<sup>41</sup>

<p><li><b>Maryland.</b> In 1996, a similar hearing in Montgomery County, Maryland, on the issue of "gay sex" in the public school curriculum evoked similar outrage from parents at open school board meetings. Again, the school board decided to disregard the parents' concern and go forward with the curriculum change. Maryland parents and students are not permitted to "opt out" of sexual education courses.

<p><li><b>Texas.</b> Many officials simply discount parental rights. One recent case involved a disagreement between parents and the Texas Board of Education on parents' access to standardized state test materials. When the lower court ruled in favor of the parents, the Texas Attorney General appealed the ruling. Though many might side with the school board on the particulars of the case, it is disturbing that the State Attorney General based his appeal on a rejection of the fundamental right of parents to direct the education and upbringing of their children.<sup>42</sup>

<P><LI><B>North Carolina.</b> In 1995, the county of Durham, North Carolina, drew up its own guidelines for judging the presence of child abuse. Though most of these "Minimum Standards of Care" make sense as indicators of potential child abuse, a number of them indicate a dangerous overreach by bureaucrats, who can claim authority to come into any home to check the suitability of parents. For instance, a parent may be investigated for "child abuse" if he confines a child to his room or violates any of a number of detailed government standards governing the supervision, nutrition, clothing, cleanliness, and even the bedtime of children. According to the Durham County Department of Social Services:
<blockquote>
 	The document reflects, to the extent possible under state law, the standards of care which the Durham community deems to be minimally acceptable for its children....  The period of supervision (baby-sitting by minors) must not extend beyond a reasonable bedtime: 9:00 p.m. for 12-14 year olds and midnight for 15-17 year olds.... Parent or caretaker insures proper hygiene by providing care, instruction, or necessary items for cleanliness (water, soap, toothbrush etc.).<sup>43</sup>
</blockquote>
These guidelines, undoubtedly drafted with the best of liberal intentions by the Department of Social Services, nonetheless reflect a desire to police parents. They are an excellent illustration of a trend described by Dr. Ed Zigler, Professor of Developmental Psychology at Yale University: the growing tendency to classify parental behaviors as abusive. "It's a terrible problem," says Professor Zigler. "I see an expansion of parental behaviors that are classified as abuse....  The whole area has become too subjective."<sup>44</sup>
</ul>
<p><li><b>Threats from Professionals.</b> Within the major professions of education, medicine, psychology, social work, and school counseling, there is increasing evidence that too many people and associations think they are more qualified than parents to judge what is good for particular children. There also is increasing evidence that they assume their professional judgment is superior and therefore can be exercised independently of parental judgment.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The conception of the relationship between state and family held by many professionals is wholly unlike that held by most parents. The big contest is over the sexual morality of children. The work of Stanley Rothman and Richard Lerner, professors of sociology at Smith College and experts on the sociology of America's elites, points to a vast difference on matters related to sexual morality. Aside from wide discrepancies over the morality of abortion, Rothman and Lerner find "very large differences in the two groups' views regarding homosexuality, extra-marital and premarital sex, divorce, the ideal number of children in a family, voluntary suicide, and euthanasia."<sup>45</sup>  Differences between the therapeutic professions and the general population likewise are often stark. For instance, 72 percent of people generally describe religion as the most important influence in their lives,<sup>46</sup> while religion is much less important in the lives of the "mental health" elites.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In effect, the divisive politics of "family values" is basically a contest between most Americans and a relatively small elite whose members, because their ideology is estranged from the views of Americans generally, do not want parents to have the legal power to resist their attempts to impose on America's children a set of beliefs sharply different from those of their parents.
<ul>
<p><li><b>Medicine.</b> In East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, about 60 girls recently underwent a physical examination, including examination of the genitalia by a school nurse and doctor, without the permission of many of their parents. All the girls were 11 and 12 years old. Several objected, some started crying, and others asked to inform their parents. One of the girls said, "We tried to get out the windows but they pulled us back."<sup>47</sup>  Parents, understandably, were outraged.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Instead of operating according to a straightforward policy of obtaining written parental consent, the school simply assumed the right to conduct invasive medical examinations as long as there was nothing in writing to the contrary. And instead of seeing themselves as assisting parents in the work of raising children, school officials saw themselves as the locus of primary responsibility for the medical examination of other people's children. Rather than live by the Supreme Court's ruling that parents have the fundamental right to direct the upbringing of their children, these officials apparently assumed the right was theirs. Pennsylvania law protects the school in its conduct of these examinations. In New York, however, a state health education teacher, contrasting the East Stroudsburg incident with practices in her school, said, "No child is ever touched without a permission slip. How dare they do this."<sup>48</sup>

<p><li><b>School Counseling.</b> Under the code of conduct for professional psychologists, those in private practice may not offer mental health services without the prior, informed consent of the child's parents.<sup>49</sup>  The law in this instance recognizes that no matter how much training a psychologist may have, he cannot substitute his judgment, arbitrarily and presumptively, for that of the child's parents. But school counselors have a very different situation: "The authors are not aware of any state or federal statutes requiring school counselors to obtain parent permission to counsel minors of any age.... "<sup>50</sup>

<p><li><b>Librarians.</b> By the nature of its work, the American Library Association is in the forefront in educating children. But the Association apparently sees the need to protect children from parents as a group, and stands firmly against parents' rights to direct the education of their children. Consider the following extract from the "ALA's Library Bill of Rights" discussing R-rated and X-rated videos:<blockquote>

Policies which set minimum age limits for access to videotapes... with or without parental permission, abridge library use for minors. MPAA [Motion Picture Association of America] and other rating services are private advisory codes and have no legal standings.... [T]o attempt to enforce such ratings through circulation policies or other procedures constitutes labeling, "an attempt to prejudice attitudes" about the material, and is unacceptable.<sup>51</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In some states, officials also have moved to undermine the right of parents to monitor and control their children's reading material. If a child has a library card, the state forbids library staff to answer parents' questions on what books their children have taken out of the library, no matter what the child's age. For example, Maryland state law declares that "a custodian shall prohibit inspection, use, or disclosure of a circulation record of a public library or other item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual...."<sup>52</sup>  This is reinforced elsewhere in the Maryland code: "a free association, school, college or university library in this State shall prohibit inspection, use or disclosure of any circulation record or other item, collection or grouping of information about an individual...."<sup>53</sup>  The code then lists the exceptions, none of which involves any recognition of the parents' right to direct the education of their minor children.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Safeguarding the confidentiality of library patrons is important to anyone concerned with the rights of individuals. But it is significant that in the development of reading by minors -- an area in which parents are the key players, recognized by the Supreme Court as the agents with the fundamental right to direct the education of their children -- libraries make no accommodation for parents and jealously guard against any parental intrusion. This has led to a bizarre situation in which parents, still financially responsible for books their children lose, are frustrated when they try to learn the names of these books so that they can search for them at home. Maryland public librarians may not tell them. But much more is at stake than this ludicrous inconvenience.

<p><li><b>The Education Establishment.</b> The gradual erosion of parents' standing in the eyes of the nation's powerful educational establishment is already far advanced, notwithstanding Supreme Court rulings to the contrary. Sammy Quintana, President of the National School Boards Association (NSBA), for example, denies the fundamental right of parents to direct the education of their children:
<blockquote>
	None would argue that active parental involvement in the care, upbringing, and education of our children is the cornerstone of a strong, healthy society....  This legislation could place federal judges in the position of requiring the school district to implement policy in conflict with the state's requirements. This is in direct disregard of the constitutionally recognized education function of the state.<sup>54</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In testimony on the bill before the House Committee on the Judiciary, Vicki Rafel, representing the National Parent Teacher Association, stated the NPTA's views on the relationship between parents, teachers, and other professions with similar bluntness:
<blockquote>
 	These institutions are not just part of a local community. They are also part of a total system of services and accountability that must be intertwined to provide an optimum environment for all children. Decisions affecting children should be made in a collaborative effort involving all the stakeholders including parents, educators, health care givers, and government bodies.<sup>55</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Rafel's testimony is striking because of what it does not affirm:
<blockquote>
	Since parents are their children's first teacher, we believe firmly that parents must be involved in every facet of their children's education. However, both the state and federal governments have responsibilities for the education of children. Parents and schools, working together as partners, make the best decision for children in the field of education.... From constitutional and historical perspectives, the states are primarily responsible for education. Under state laws, local school boards have a central role in providing education services with support from other governments.<sup>56</sup>
<p>
	We do not believe that any one single entity, operating outside of the collaborative framework [federal government, states, local school boards, and parents] can adequately address the educational needs of children.... <sup>57</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In other words, the National School Boards Association believes parents may be "involved" but that government officials enjoy the fundamental rights in education, and the National Parent Teacher Association denies the primary and fundamental right of parents in directing the education of their own children -- part of the same right the Supreme Court has described as "beyond debate as an enduring American tradition."
</ul></ol>
<p>
<b>INTERNATIONAL BUREAUCRATIC INTRUSIVENESS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On February 23, 1995, President Clinton signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which now awaits the advice and consent of the United States Senate. This Convention states that providing for the well-being of children is primarily the right of government. Article 3 establishes legal opposition between parent and child: "State Parties undertake to ensure the child such protection and care as is necessary for his or her well-being, taking into account the rights and duties of his or her parents, legal guardians, or other individuals legally responsible for him or her, and, to this end, shall take all appropriate legislative and administrative measures."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

With respect to the rights and duties of parents, Article 5 declares that "State Parties shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents... to provide... appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the present Convention."  In other words, parents have the right to guide their children's exercise of rights enumerated by the Convention. According to Article 3, for example, "The child shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of the child's choice."  In addition, "States recognize the rights of the child to freedom of association and to freedom of peaceful assembly."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The right of a minor to free association makes sense when it has parental sanction. But the universal right to free association outside of parental sanction leaves minor children open to exploitation by others, including those who challenge the right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children. Nowhere in the Convention is the right of the parent to direct such activity acknowledged. To the contrary, Article 15 states: "No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of these rights other than those imposed in conformity with the law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security or public safety, public order, the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."  Thus, under the U.N. Convention, only the state may restrict the right of assembly of minors, as a group or as individuals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The idea of a child's right to privacy also has merit, especially when threats to this privacy come from outside the home. But given the clear responsibility of parents to direct their children's upbringing, the right to privacy articulated in the Convention is a threat to parental authority. While the overall themes of the Convention and many of its specific articles may be laudable, they are vitiated by the absence of any clear articulation of the rights of parents to direct the upbringing of their children. Worse, the Convention's language gives children a right superior to the rights of their parents: "States Parties [governments and government agencies] shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents... to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the present Convention."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

With its detailed elaboration of the rights of the child, coupled with the absence of any legal protection for the rights of parents against intrusive action by the state in the upbringing of children, the U.N. Convention is incompatible with traditional Western conceptions of the liberty of parents and with the U.S. Supreme Court's settled view of parental rights as "beyond debate."  Worse, the state is the only other entity whose rights are made clearly superior to the domestic life of the family as an institution.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Parents should be very concerned over the dangerously intrusive impact of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. The reasons for this concern are indicated by a 1995 evaluation report from the United Nations to the government of Great Britain, a signatory to the Convention:
<blockquote>
	In relation to the implementation of article 12, the Committee is concerned that insufficient attention has been given to the right to the child to express his/her opinion, including in cases where parents in England and Wales have the possibility of withdrawing their children from parts of the sex education programmes in schools. In this as in other decisions, including exclusion from school, the child is not systematically invited to express his/her opinion and those opinions may not be given due weight, as required under article 12 of the Convention.<sup>58</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

While the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act does not specifically address the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, and Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, so far has blocked consideration by the Senate, this treaty is nonetheless a significant illustration of the thinking on the family among elites in government and the humane professions.
<p>

<b>QUESTIONS RAISED BY THE BILL
<p>

Q: Would the bill establish a new right?
<p>
A:</b> No. The right of parents to raise their children is not new. It is a basic liberty issue for all parents everywhere, in all times, and under all political conditions and regimes. The Supreme Court affirmed this ancient tradition in the jurisprudence of Western civilization over 70 years ago.
<p>
<b>Q: Would the bill grant ambiguous rights to parents?
<p>
A:</b> No. It denies ambiguous rights to government and to others acting on behalf of government. By applying the "compelling interest" clause to parents' rights, as is done with all other fundamental rights recognized under the Constitution, the bill curtails the ability of government officials to be ambiguous or arbitrary in their dealings with parents. When "overriding" the fundamental rights of parents (as it can, for parents' rights are not absolute), the state must do so in a very narrowly defined and defensible fashion. The same principle holds for all other groups and professions in their relations with parents and children.
<p><b>
Q: Would the bill violate the "rights of the child?"
<p>
A:</b> No. The rights of children and parents are complementary. Children have the right to be formed as competent human beings by those who brought them into the world, and parents have the right to develop these capacities in their children. Parents give their children life and continue to influence the development of their children's individuality through their actions as parents. In developing this individuality, which includes intellectual and moral capacities, parents are fulfilling natural rights and responsibilities that not only are an essential component of the Western concept of the individual liberty of the parent, but also are recognized as fundamental under the federal Constitution. Parental exercise of these rights does not violate the child's rights; it fulfills them.
<p><B>
Q: Would the bill eliminate the "best interest of the child" criterion in public policy?
<p>
A:</b> No. It would make the parent the arbiter of the child's best interest. This also is the position of the United States Supreme Court. The community can affect parents' conception of what is in their children's best interest, but children are the progeny of their parents, brought into existence by them, and naturally subject to the parent's conception of what is in their best interest.
<p><b>
Q: Would the bill breach the confidentiality of professional counseling relationship in school settings?

A:</b> No. There is a difference between establishing a professional-minor relationship and preserving the confidentiality of that relationship once established. The bill would do nothing to alter the confidentiality of professional relationships. Confidentiality is a sine qua non of a therapeutic relationship and is widely understood as such. The bill would clarify the process through which such a confidential relationship is established: No professional could enter into such a relationship with a minor without the express permission of the parent, for it is the parent's right, not the professional's, to decide what is in the best interest of the child. The bill would make no difference to many of the therapeutic professions, including psychology and psychiatry, for this already is their established ethic.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Other professions, however, are less explicit in their ethics or professional guidelines. According to the American Counseling Association's professional code of ethics, "When counseling minors or persons unable to give voluntary informed consent, counselors act in the client's best interest."<sup>59</sup>  By contrast, consider the guideline of the American Psychological Association: "When persons are legally incapable of giving informed consent, psychologists obtain informed permission from a legally authorized person, if such a substitute consent is permitted by law."<sup>60</sup>  There is a very big difference between the two: Psychologists defer to parents as the arbiters of their children's best interests in establishing the relationship; school counselors try to claim that right for themselves.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Parents send their children to school to be taught, not to be counseled one-on-one in private professional settings guarded by the rules of confidentiality, unless these relationships are expressly established in cooperation with the parent. Any relationship with a minor that is guarded by confidentiality should be contingent upon the prior written permission of the parent. The very presence of a confidentiality requirement is a signal that there is a need for the express permission of the parent. Under the laws of certain states, older children who also are unemancipated minors may enter into such confidential relationships without their parents' permission. But state laws often prescribe the ages and describe the situations in which these minors may do so.
<p><b>
Q: Would the bill violate the principle of federalism?
<p>
A:</b> No. The Fourteenth Amendment grants Congress explicit authority to legislate to protect the fundamental rights of citizens. Congress and the Supreme Court are the two venues in which this legal clarification takes place. It cannot be done at the state or local level.
<p><b>
Q: Does the bill not threaten and weaken parental rights by involving Congress and the federal courts in family issues?
<p>
A:</b> No. The liberty of parents increasingly is being violated by government agencies and professions acting under government agency authority and protection. Congress and the Supreme Court are the only two institutions which can articulate parental rights in ways that bind all levels of government. Moreover, Congress has the constitutional ability to correct the Supreme Court. Though the Court has articulated parents' fundamental rights, these rights still need to be operationalized by the clear articulation of "compelling interests, narrowly drawn" when the rights of parents are to be set aside. This is not currently the criterion, and its absence is the main reason for the erosion of parents' liberty in the moral formation of their children.
<p><b>
Q: Would this legislation impose an unfunded mandate on the states?
<p>
A:</b> No. Guaranteeing the fundamental rights of citizens is not an unfunded mandate. It is a fundamental duty of each state's judicial system. Section 422 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 states clearly that "this part shall not apply to any provision in a bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report before Congress that (1) enforces constitutional rights of individuals...."  Furthermore, the state and its bureaucracies, as the main violators of these rights, can avoid such costs simply by not infringing on the fundamental rights of parents.
<p>
<b>Q: Would codifying the fundamental rights of parents allow parents to sue in both federal and state court systems?
<p>
A:</b> Yes. As a fundamental right, it can be violated at any level, including the federal. Also, violations at the state court level (and there are many instances of these) are properly appealable at the federal court level, as are violations of all other fundamental rights under the federal Constitution.
<p><b>
Q: Would the codification of parents' fundamental rights be a bonanza for trial lawyers?
<p>
A:</b> No. By clearly defining these fundamental rights and establishing a compelling interest test, the bill would reduce the number of cases moving to litigation. It is the absence of this clarity that contributes to the current flood of litigation in local, state, and federal courts.
<p><b>
Q: Would the cost of enforcement be prohibitive?
<p>
A:</b> No. The National Education Association, which openly defends violations of the fundamental rights of parents, says the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act would cost $3.3 billion per year. Even if the NEA's exaggerated estimates were correct, however, such a demand for fiscal conservatism is odd coming from the NEA. According to one recent estimate, the NEA's own legislative agenda would cost the American taxpayer $700 billion.<sup>61</sup>
<p><b>
Q: Could parents use codification to challenge welfare reform?
<p>
A:</b> No. Welfare entitlements are legislative grants, not fundamental individual rights. The state may attach requirements to such grants, but only insofar as they do not violate fundamental rights.
<p><b>
Q: Would the bill permit parents to use child labor to supplement family income?
<p>
A:</b> No. The U.S. Supreme Court has established the right of the state to regulate parents in the matter of child labor, an evil against the child. This bill would do nothing to contravene this state right; nor would it allow parents to deprive their children of the minimum of education required by the state. According to the Supreme Court, "It is cardinal... that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first with the parents.... [T]he family itself is not beyond regulation in the public interest.... [L]egislation appropriately designed to reach such evils [as child labor] is within the state's police power."<sup>62</sup>
<p>
<b>Q: Would defining parents' fundamental rights hinder states in their task of protecting children from child abuse?
<p>
A:</b> No. No parent has a right to abuse a child. When such abuse happens, the state, acting on the child's behalf, has a duty to protect the child. The truth is that this bill would reinforce the right of states to protect children from abuse. A much greater threat to the state's ability to protect abused children is the "family preservation philosophy" in child care social work, which leads to repeated efforts to reunite the child with an abusive family in the hopes that eventually the parents will improve. By failing to heed the evidence of abuse, this approach frequently places the child in grave danger. In 1992, in New York City, 21 children were killed by a parent or a mother's boyfriend after the Child Welfare Administration had intervened. Both Arizona and Oregon have instituted special units to investigate severe child abuse situations to help the courts move quickly to terminate the parental rights of such abusing parents, and to rescue the children.<sup>63</sup>  This bill would pose no threat to such action by states or local governments, but by the clarity of its statements on child abuse could be cited in support of such actions.
<p><b>
Q: Would codifying the fundamental rights of parents endanger the right of states to guarantee public health by such means as school vaccinations and other public health interventions?
<p>
A:</b> Not at all. The Supreme Court has established the role of the states in safeguarding public health.
<p><b>
Q: Wouldn't people who suspect child abuse be disinclined to report their suspicions?
<p>
A:</b> Far from it. The bill makes clear that no one acting to protect a child from abuse can be subjected to a lawsuit based on such action.
<p><b>
Q: Would parents be able to impede investigations of child abuse by the state?
<p>
A:</b> No. The bill specifically leaves all state child abuse state laws unaffected. The states would retain the duty to protect children who are being abused.
<p><b>
Q: Wouldn't the corporal punishment clause give parents a license to abuse their children or encourage them in the use of abusive punishment?
<p>
A:</b> No. All states currently allow "reasonable corporal discipline," and the Supreme Court has ruled that even school authorities may use "such corporal punishment as is reasonably necessary for the proper education and discipline of the child."<sup>64</sup>  Thus, both state law and the Supreme Court have affirmed that parents and schools may use reasonable corporal punishment.
<p><b>
Q: Would defining fundamental parents' rights overturn state compulsory education laws and prohibit state regulation of home schooling?
<p>
A:</b> No. The Supreme Court has ruled that the state has an interest in establishing compulsory attendance laws and regulating education.<sup>65</sup>  The Court also has stated that parents must demonstrate to the state that their alternative education is appropriate, both in standards of literacy and in terms of the child's eventual self-sufficiency, and has reaffirmed that states may set educational standards for children within their borders.
<p><b>
Q: Would this bill pit school boards and parents against each other?
<p>
A:</b> No. The essence of the American tradition of control by local school boards is to encourage parents to play a full role in the direction of their schools. All this bill would do is create an official atmosphere more sensitive to parents' views. Where these views cannot be accommodated, especially in cases involving sensitive moral issues, parents would have the freedom to withdraw their children from controversial classes.
<p><b>
Q: Would the bill require schools to provide individual tuition or curricula whenever a student's parents disagree with curriculum content?
<p>
A:</b> No. The Supreme Court has ruled that local school boards have the right to set curricula, and the federal courts have held that for the federal judiciary to intervene on behalf of parents, those parents must establish that their constitutional rights have been violated.<sup>66</sup>
<p><b>
Q: Wouldn't the bill require alternative curricula for each race or religion, overturn curriculum decisions, overturn decisions on textbooks, remove free inquiry from the classroom, and forbid mandatory graduation requirements?
<p>
A:</b> No. Establishing the fundamental right of parents to direct the education of their children, as well as their religious and moral formation, does not diminish the right of the community, as represented in its local school board, to act on all these issues. The Supreme Court recognized these local community rights in 1988,<sup>67</sup> affirming the school's right to teach even curricula opposed to the beliefs or values of parents. According to the Court, this does not violate the parents' rights; at the same time, however, for the school board to require the student to act on these values would violate the student's rights.
<p><b>
Q: Wouldn't codifying these fundamental parental rights lead people to use the courts as a solution of first rather than last resort, and cause money to be diverted from the classroom to the courtroom?
<p>
A:</b> No. With the passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, religious parents gained the heightened scrutiny standard of "compelling state interest."  Under the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, all parents would benefit from this standard. There has been no diversion of discussion and energy from classroom to courtroom under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act; rather, official sensitivity and discussion increase when these issues arise. If parents raised ridiculous claims under the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, their cases would be thrown out of court. The Supreme Court has established school board rights as well. Frivolous litigation would be costly for parents and of no benefit to them.
<p><b>
Q: Would codifying the fundamental rights of parents force local bodies to pay for private or sectarian tuition?
<p>
A:</b> No. Repeated Supreme Court decisions show that the state does not have to pay either for services a person may freely choose in law or for services (such as private education and health care) to which the law may not deny access.
<p><b>
Q: Wouldn't the bill move authority over education to the federal government?
<p>
A:</b> No; quite the opposite. By codifying the fundamental nature of parental rights, it would strengthen the hand of parents in dealing with government, whether federal, state, or local. It also would increase dialogue at the local level and ensure greater sensitivity to parents' rights on the part of government officials.
<p><b>
Q: Does the bill threaten the rights of girls to receive education on contraception and abortion?
<p>
A:</b> Parents have the fundamental right to direct the moral formation of their children. They also have the right to protect their children from behavior that is immoral in their eyes. In a society deeply divided on what is moral and what is immoral, mainly in the area of sexual morality, either school officials would refrain from entering this area of moral teaching (as they do already with respect to religious teaching), or parents would have the clear right to opt out from the official imposition of "values" hostile to their beliefs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The bill would give parents on both sides of these and other sensitive issues the ability to exercise their right and duty to direct the moral formation of their children as they see fit. Government officials have no right to form moral beliefs in children that contradict the beliefs of parents. According to the Supreme Court government officials are not obliged to teach the sexual morality that parents want taught, but neither do they have any right to teach children a sexual morality opposed to that of their parents.

<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The rights of parents as a group are disregarded or endangered all too frequently by government officials. The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act would codify a fundamental right already articulated by the Supreme Court. It is needed because of repeated threats to parents' rights from the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government at all levels -- federal, state, and local -- and from the humane professions. The bill is consistent with a tradition of freedom long recognized by the Supreme Court. It also is appropriate to the federal legislative process, because it articulates a fundamental right that applies to all American citizens in relation to all levels of government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

There has been a disturbing pattern over the past century. Child rearing in America increasingly has come to be viewed as a public matter, a matter for the national "village."  As early as 1901, the Indiana State Supreme Court, in a ruling upholding the state's compulsory education law, stated that "The natural rights of a parent to the custody and control of his children are subordinate to the power of the state."<sup>68</sup>  In 1960, writing in the professional journal <I>Child Welfare</I>, one social worker noted that "daycare can offer something valuable to children because they are separated from their parents."<sup>69</sup>  Today, believing that government is in the best position to ensure the well-being of children, many take it for granted that government should have great authority over their upbringing.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Because of the persistent danger to the fundamental rights of parents from state court rulings, professional associations, government bureaucracies, the educational establishment, and international agencies and bodies, it is clear that these rights need codification in law. The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, sponsored by Senator Grassley and Representative Largent, would do just that, erecting a barrier against the mounting erosion of these rights. In an increasingly fragmented and hostile culture, American parents deserve to have their liberty and legitimate rights established as clearly in law as they were in the assumptions of those who founded the American Republic.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Latin America has bounced back from the economic meltdown caused by the Mexican peso on December 20, 1994, but the United States has not. The democracies of Latin America have stayed on course with free-market reforms, trade liberalization policies, and efforts to create a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). However, the U.S. appears to have turned its back on Latin America. As free trade has faded from the foreign policy agendas of both the Clinton Administration and the 104th Congress, U.S. relations with Latin America have deteriorated significantly. On issues such as Cuba, drug trafficking, illegal immigration, and even the creation of the FTAA, America today is increasingly at odds with important hemispheric trading partners such as Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Colombia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

America's flight from enlarging the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has damaged U.S. leadership and economic interests in the Western Hemisphere, but hemispheric trade expansion has not been interrupted. Mexico has signed free trade agreements (FTAs) with Chile, Bolivia, and Costa Rica, is negotiating its association with the South American Common Market (Mercosur),<sup>1</sup> and soon will launch trade negotiations with the European Union. Chile recently became an associate of Mercosur and is negotiating a bilateral FTA with Canada. Other countries interested in joining Mercosur include the five members of the Andean Community.<sup>2</sup>  Mercosur also wants to sign an FTA with the European Union. Clearly, no one is waiting for America to climb back aboard the free trade express in the Western Hemisphere.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

From 1980-1992, the Reagan and Bush Administrations established the closest and strongest relationship with Latin America that the U.S. has enjoyed in more than a century. The bases of this new hemispheric partnership were democracy and the creation of a hemispheric free trade area, as provided for in the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative (EAI) and the NAFTA.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But since 1993, the Clinton Administration has dissipated the achievements of more than a decade by pursuing a policy of neglect and indifference toward Latin America. Since the collapse of the Mexican peso at the end of 1994, NAFTA has become a political football for politicians who claim that free trade is the cause of such domestic problems as increased drug trafficking and illegal immigration. Instead of responding by making a strong case for NAFTA, however, some previously strong supporters of free trade have scaled back their support for its enlargement, and for the FTAA process in general. America's retreat from NAFTA's expansion is hurting American consumers and workers, undermining U.S. economic interests in Latin America, and weakening U.S. leadership in the Western Hemisphere.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If this situation is not reversed, U.S. interests in Latin America could suffer lasting damage. To regain America's leading role in the FTAA process and heal the recent rifts in U.S. relations with Latin America, the U.S. Administration should:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Approve a new fast-track negotiating authority.</b> Without fast-track, U.S. participation in and influence at the third post-Summit of the Americas Trade Ministerial, to be held during the second quarter of 1997 in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte, will be marginal at best.
<p>
<li><b> Expand NAFTA during 1997 to include Chile.</b> The accession of Chile to NAFTA would reaffirm America's commitment to an FTAA with Latin America and the Caribbean, open a new gateway for U.S. exports in South America and the nations of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC), and provide America with valuable strategic leverage in future convergence talks with Mercosur.
<p>
<li><b>Include the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries in NAFTA.</b><sup>3</sup> H.R. 553, stalled in Congress since 1995, would improve market access for U.S. exports to Caribbean and Central American markets. It also would require CBI beneficiaries to strengthen rules relating to investment, labor standards, and the environment, among other improvements that strongly favor U.S. interests.
<p>
<li><b>Launch a dialogue to integrate NAFTA and Mercosur.</b> The goal of such talks should be to deepen and harmonize trade disciplines between NAFTA and Mercosur as both groups take on new members; the ultimate objective should be to merge these two regional groups into a single hemispheric FTAA by 2005.
<p>
<li><b>Define a pathway and timetable for creating the FTAA.</b> Western Hemisphere nations should define quickly whether the FTAA will include commitments that go beyond those already made in NAFTA and the World Trade Organization (WTO). America should insist on FTAA trade disciplines that improve on NAFTA and the WTO.
<p>
<li><b>Implement reforms that do not require negotiations,</b> including unilateral cuts in tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, simplification and harmonization of existing rules and regulations affecting the flow of goods and services in the region, removal of barriers to trade in services, enactment of world-class protection for intellectual property rights, and revision of investment regulations.
<p>
<li><b>Establish separate negotiations on issues unrelated to free trade,</b> such as drug trafficking, corruption, illegal immigration, labor standards, and preserving the environment. The action plan approved at the Summit of the Americas on December 11, 1994, outlines such a framework; in practice, however, the Clinton Administration has sought consistently to establish conditions and linkages between free trade and other issues. As a result, tensions between the U.S. and Latin America have increased in the past two years, and U.S. leadership and credibility have suffered.
<p>
<li><b>Negotiate FTAs with New Zealand, Singapore, and Australia.</b> The negotiation of bilateral free trade agreements with these countries could create momentum for the convergence of the FTAA and APEC processes into a single free trade area encompassing more than 2 billion consumers.
<p>
<li><b>Convene a second Summit of the Americas in 1997.</b> Strong leadership is required to prevent regionalism from derailing the FTAA process. The goals of a second Summit of the Americas should include creation of a WTO-type entity to advance negotiations, expansion of FTAA technical working groups to propose policies and specific actions, and a commitment by all democracies in the Western Hemisphere to a specific timetable and pathway for launching the FTAA by 2005.
<p>
<li><b>Dismantle domestic U.S. barriers to free trade.</b> U.S. protectionism is the greatest impediment to free trade and creation of an FTAA. Overall, congressionally mandated protection and managed trade policies cost American consumers over $70 billion a year and encourage U.S. trading partners to retaliate with measures that hinder free trade and penalize American consumers and exporters.<sup>4</sup>
</ul><P>

<b>TRADE POLICY BLUNDERS IN LATIN AMERICA</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The greatest failure of U.S. Latin American policy in recent years has been in the area of trade policy. The U.S. no longer leads the Western Hemisphere FTAA process, primarily because the Clinton Administration has chosen to retreat from free trade and NAFTA's enlargement rather than defend the trade pact's record of success. As a result, the FTAA process has lost momentum and the U.S. has surrendered leadership and negotiating advantage to Brazil, which has tilted the FTAA process toward the enlargement of Mercosur into a South American Free Trade Area (SAFTA) centered on Brazil and capable of challenging U.S. economic interests and leadership in the Americas.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This retreat from free trade is severely damaging to U.S. relations with Latin America, not to mention economic and security interests in the Western Hemisphere. Without the goodwill and greater economic interaction that come with increased trade and investment, it will be more difficult for the U.S. and Latin America to develop and implement effective policies for managing such hemispheric problems as drug trafficking, corruption, illegal immigration, and environmental destruction. Moreover, Washington's reluctance to expand NAFTA means that American companies and workers risk missing out on the fast-paced trade expansion occurring today throughout Latin America. Opportunities missed by U.S. companies will be seized by investors from other countries. Exports, jobs, and wealth creation possibilities lost in Latin America by U.S. firms will accrue to others.
<p>

<b>NAFTA: TWO YEARS OF SOLID GROWTH</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since the peso's collapse on December 20, 1994 -- only nine days after the Summit of the Americas concluded in Miami -- critics of NAFTA have been claiming that the trade pact is a failure. Many critics also blame NAFTA for the growing problems of drugs, illegal immigration, and declining real wages in U.S. manufacturing. But NAFTA did not cause the Mexican peso crisis and is not responsible for America's social problems. Moreover, far from being a failure, NAFTA has scored some impressive trade and investment successes during its first two years.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
NAFTA helped Mexico overcome the peso crisis. The international obligations created by NAFTA and by Mexico's membership in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) enabled the embattled government of Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo to rebuff intense political pressure to roll back Mexico's economic reforms after the peso collapsed. As a result, the Mexican economy now is recovering from the crisis, although years will pass before per capita income returns to pre-peso crisis levels.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

During NAFTA's first two years, trade and foreign direct investment among the U.S., Mexico, and Canada have increased. Since 1994, the average U.S. tariff on Mexican products has fallen from 3.5 percent to 1.5 percent, while average Mexican tariffs on U.S. products have dropped from 10 percent to 4.9 percent. As a result, trade among the three NAFTA countries rose by 17 percent in 1994 to $350 billion, and bilateral U.S.-Mexico trade grew by 20.7 percent, surpassing $100 billion for the first time.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1995, despite the recession caused by the peso's collapse, overall U.S.-Mexico trade increased 8 percent to $108 billion, while total intra-NAFTA trade grew 10.6 percent to $380 billion.<sup>5</sup>  Moreover, after declining by 8.9 percent in 1995 to $46.3 billion, U.S. exports to Mexico increased by 12.1 percent during the first three months of 1996, compared with the same period in 1995.<sup>6</sup>  More than 75 percent of all U.S. states reported a rise in exports to Mexico during the first quarter of 1996.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The U.S. trade deficit with Canada and Mexico during 1995 totaled $33.49 billion, compared with a 1994 trade deficit of $14.69 billion with Canada and a trade surplus of $1.34 billion with Mexico. Critics have used these figures to defend their claim that NAFTA is costing jobs in America. The reason Mexico imported fewer U.S. goods in 1995, however, is simply that the peso's collapse reduced the buying power of the Mexican people by more than 50 percent, and poorer people buy fewer goods. Americans consumed more Mexican products in 1995 because the average American is much wealthier than the average Mexican. The truth is that more jobs in America today rely on imports than exports, since nearly 90 percent of American manufacturers utilize imported materials or components in their production.<sup>8</sup>  Moreover, the $80 billion jump in three-way trade during the first two years of NAFTA's implementation added over 1.6 million new jobs to the North American economy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
NAFTA is restructuring the North American economy as firms in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada create cross-border enterprises that lower manufacturing costs, improve productivity, and expand the volume and diversity of products at lower prices for consumers in all three countries. A recent study by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) found that half of Mexico's total exports to the U.S. are manufactured by U.S.-owned firms, or by production-sharing partnerships<sup>9</sup> whose products have an average U.S. content of 50.2 percent, compared with 35.3 percent for Canada, 32 percent for Taiwan, and 27.8 percent for Korea. As the output of Mexico-based co-production ventures increases, the volume and value of U.S.-made inputs imported by Mexican firms also increase, creating more jobs in America. Moreover, the rise in U.S.-Mexico co-production ventures is diverting investment away from alternative co-production sites in Asia. In 1994, Mexico was America's largest production-sharing partner, accounting for $22.9 billion, or 39.1 percent of all U.S. co-produced imports.<sup>10</sup>  U.S.-Mexico production partnerships increasingly play a prominent role in such key industries as motor vehicles, auto parts, computers, televisions and other electrical products, and textiles and apparel, among others.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>NAFTA Aiding Mexico's Recovery.</b> Only 18 months after the peso's collapse, the Mexican economy is showing signs of a promising, if uneven, recovery. Following five consecutive quarters of decline, the Mexican economy grew sharply during the second quarter of 1996 as real gross domestic product (GDP) rose 7.2 percent compared with the second quarter of 1995. For all of 1996, Mexico is expected to grow about 3 percent, compared to a contraction of 6.9 percent in 1995.<sup>11</sup>  Moreover, despite a 22 percent rise in the peso against key currencies during the first seven months of 1996, Mexican exports of manufactured goods have gained 22.8 percent, while imports have increased 22.1 percent.<sup>12</sup>  Nevertheless, about 70 percent of all economic activity in Mexico is tied to the domestic economy, which may not feel the overall, export-driven economic upturn for at least another year.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Political and social instability have increased in Mexico as a result of the economic crisis, the spread of drug trafficking, a weak judiciary incapable of fighting corruption, and entrenched political and economic dinosaurs that continue to block democratic reform and true economic freedom. However, NAFTA is not responsible for Mexico's current social and political difficulties. In fact, NAFTA has provided Mexico with a strong anchor and a stable point of institutional reference on the road to true capitalist democracy. Meanwhile, there is reason to be optimistic about Mexico's political future.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Impressive Growth in U.S.-Canada Trade.</b> Canadian exports to the U.S. and Mexico have risen impressively since NAFTA was implemented. Foreign investment in Canada from all sources also has increased significantly. In 1995, two-way trade between the U.S. and Canada grew nearly 12 percent to $272 billion, while total foreign direct investment in Canada increased by 10 percent to $168 billion. The U.S. is the largest foreign investor in Canada. Direct investment in Canada by American firms increased by 11 percent to $113 billion in 1995, representing 67 percent of total foreign direct investment in Canada. Similarly, the U.S. remains the destination for the largest share of Canadian foreign direct investment, with a total of $76.5 billion invested.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Canada's exports in 1994 represented 30.1 percent of its total GDP, compared to 21.6 percent in 1991. Canada's strong export performance during the 1990s was closely related to the growth in Canadian exports to the U.S., and Canadian production of goods for international markets is closely linked to the U.S. through the intra-firm trading of U.S.-controlled firms operating in Canada.<sup>14</sup>  Transactions between related firms account for 57 percent of Canadian exports to the U.S., and 72 percent of exports by U.S.-con-trolled Canadian firms are related-party transactions. According to one survey, "U.S.-controlled [multinational companies] are responsible for the largest share of sales by the Canadian manufacturing and wholesale firms studied, and account for the largest share of their imports and exports."  Overall, the Canadian economy is "linked intra-regionally to the U.S. economy."<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>A Hemispheric Free Trade Emporium.</b> When Mexico defaulted on its external debt obligations in 1982, it triggered the Latin American debt crisis and plunged the region into a decade of negative growth and falling per capita income. However, when the Mexican peso collapsed in December 1994, Latin America was hardly affected. Economic growth in Latin America and the Caribbean slowed to 0.8 percent in 1995 as the effects of the Mexican peso crisis rippled through the region's financial markets. However, U.S. exports to Latin America and the Caribbean rose to $102 billion in 1995, up 12 percent from 1994 and 72 percent higher than total U.S. exports to the region in 1990. Although individual countries such as Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico are struggling to resolve diverse economic, political, and social difficulties, the region overall has shrugged off the aftershocks of the Mexican peso crisis.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The World Bank predicts that Latin America and the Caribbean will grow by 3.1 percent in 1996 and 4 percent in 1997, with Chile leading the region at 6.5 percent this year while Venezuela lags at 0.5 percent.<sup>16</sup>  The bank also predicts that average GDP growth should rise to 3.8 percent in 1996-2005, compared to average growth of 2.4 percent during the past decade.<sup>17</sup>  Free trade and foreign direct investment are driving the region's growth. Latin America's exports and imports increased rapidly as tariff barriers dropped from 50 percent a decade ago to 12 percent in 1993, one year before NAFTA went into effect. For years, U.S. exports to Latin America have increased twice as rapidly as exports to any other region of the world. Intra-regional trade between Latin American countries and trade with Asia also are growing rapidly. For example, intra-Mercosur trade doubled in four years to $15.8 billion and today accounts for 22 percent of the group's total world trade, up from 14.3 percent in 1992.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some World Bank economists believe that Latin America can achieve annual growth rates of 6 to 6.5 percent within a decade if governments in the region raise exports significantly by avoiding overvalued exchange rates; increasing investments for infrastructure such as roads, ports, and telecommunications; and attracting larger amounts of foreign direct investment.<sup>18</sup> However, while democracy, hemispheric economic integration, and trade expansion are progressing rapidly, Latin American and Caribbean countries are still struggling to resolve a host of structural impediments to faster growth and greater stability and economic prosperity. Economic reforms have not advanced sufficiently anywhere in the region, including Chile, which is routinely hailed as Latin America's star performer. The widespread absence of economic freedom is reflected in the region's high levels of poverty, illiteracy, and illegal immigration. Judicial systems are generally weak, politicized, and corrupt. Effective legal protection for individual property rights does not exist. Moreover, drug traffickers have emerged in the 1990s as major threats to the stability of countries such as Colombia and Mexico. Organized violence by subversive guerrilla organizations is increasing in Colombia, Peru, and Mexico.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The difficulties confronting Latin America and the Caribbean today defy easy or quick solutions. They represent both a daunting challenge to the region's expectations for a brighter economic future and a threat to U.S. economic and national security interests. The Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, NAFTA, and Free Trade Area of the Americas were proposed by the U.S. as the foundations of a hemispheric partnership and a new American Century based on democracy, free trade, and the economic integration of the U.S. and Latin America. This vision has not been realized. Nine days after the FTAA was launched at the Summit of the Americas in Miami, the Mexican peso collapsed and the U.S. retreated from NAFTA's enlargement.
<p>
<b>TEN INITIATIVES FOR RESTORING U.S. LEADERSHIP TO THE FREE TRADE AREA OF THE AMERICAS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The failure to enlarge NAFTA to involve Chile and the Caribbean countries during 1995 was a major setback for U.S. economic and security interests in Latin America and the Caribbean. The momentum and direction of the FTAA process have changed significantly since the Mexican peso crisis. Brazil has filled the vacuum in the FTAA process created by America's retreat from free trade, and has won regional support for an alternative trade agenda that sidelines a NAFTA/WTO-plus process to create the FTAA in favor of a more limited regional approach based on the expansion of Mercosur to create a South American Free Trade Area (SAFTA) centered on Brazil. Brazil also favors negotiating a trade pact with the European Union before engaging the U.S. in talks to establish a framework for the future merger of Mercosur and NAFTA into an FTAA.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although Mercosur has its share of internal problems that could slow its expansion, the process is well underway. Chile has become an associate of Mercosur, and Bolivia, Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador expect to join before the end of 1996. Mexico is negotiating an agreement with Mercosur while simultaneously blocking U.S. and Canadian efforts to launch early talks between NAFTA and Mercosur. The proposed enlargement of Mercosur and creation of a SAFTA appeals to many Latin American politicians, intellectuals, and business leaders who support higher levels of protectionism and the notion of a united Latin American front capable of maintaining its economic and political independence from U.S. pressure and interference. Latin American integration is one of the oldest dreams in the region, and it is closer to being achieved today than ever before. Meanwhile, as the free trade express in Latin America picks up speed, the U.S. lags behind even the caboose.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The new U.S. partnership with Latin America celebrated by President Clinton at the Summit of the Americas has developed serious cracks. For example, entities such as the Rio Group and the Organization of American States (OAS) have condemned the U.S. for enacting the Helms-Burton Act against Cuba and for decertifying Colombia in the war on drugs. U.S. policy against Cuba also has raised tensions significantly with NAFTA partners Mexico and Canada. Mexico has attacked recent changes in U.S. immigration policy. A pattern of mutual recrimination has emerged. The U.S. criticizes Latin America's coddling of Fidel Castro's regime and punishes countries like Colombia and Mexico for not doing enough to control drug trafficking and illegal immigration. Latin American governments criticize what they perceive as the return of U.S. "big stick" unilateralism and feel betrayed by Washington's bipartisan stampede away from NAFTA's expansion and the FTAA process.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Leading by Example.</b> If the U.S. expects Latin America and the Caribbean to cooperate on policy issues viewed as important to U.S. economic and security interests, it must assert its leadership and set the example. Abandoning trade commitments like adding Chile to NAFTA is the antithesis of leadership, and it sets a bad example. Instead of building a bridge to the 21st century that would unite the U.S. and the democracies of the Western Hemisphere, the U.S. retreat from NAFTA's expansion and the U.S. government's managed trade policies have dug a moat between Washington and the rest of the Americas.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To restore American leadership to the FTAA process and repair the recent damage to U.S. relations with Latin America and the Caribbean, the U.S. Administration should carry out the following ten initiatives:
<p><blockquote>
<b>1. Approve a new fast-track negotiating authority.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Without fast-track in hand, the Administration cannot enter into serious trade negotiations with Chile or any other country. Chile has claimed that it will not negotiate its entry into NAFTA until fast-track is renewed. Suggestions that fast-track is not necessary to enter into trade negotiations are mistaken. No country will invest the time or the human and financial resources in negotiating with the U.S. if American negotiators cannot guarantee that any agreement reached will not be mutilated beyond recognition by the U.S. Congress.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Without fast-track, U.S. participation in and influence at the third post-Summit of the Americas Trade Ministerial during the second quarter of 1997 in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte will be marginal at best; moreover, U.S. proposals are more likely to be rejected. Symbolically, making renewal of fast-track one of the first actions of a new Administration and Congress would constitute a strong reaffirmation of America's commitment to free trade and would send Latin America a powerful message that the U.S. has re-engaged in the FTAA process. The dynamics of the Belo Horizonte trade ministerial could be altered completely if the U.S. delegation arrives with fast-track negotiating authority. Without fast-track, however, the U.S. risks being left behind again as Brazil's vision of turning Mercosur into a SAFTA stokes the enthusiasm of other Latin American governments.
<p>
<b>2. Expand NAFTA during 1997 to include Chile.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of the greatest mistakes made recently by the U.S. in Latin America was postponing the inclusion of Chile in NAFTA until after the 1996 elections. The failure to add Chile to NAFTA weakened American leadership and influence in the FTAA process.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is no reason to delay the admission of Chile to NAFTA. Chile's total gross national product is equivalent to about 1 percent of the American economy. Chile has enjoyed positive economic growth for 14 consecutive years. Growth during the past six years under a democratic civilian government has averaged 7.5 percent annually. Chile has pre-paid a large chunk of its external public sector debt, has no balance-of-payments problems, and has enjoyed single-digit inflation since 1994. Its investment and savings rates are approaching those of the Asian Tigers. The inclusion of Chile in NAFTA would confirm America's commitment to leading the FTAA process, open a new gateway for U.S. exports to markets in South America and APEC, and provide America with valuable strategic leverage for future convergence talks with Mercosur.
<P>
<b>3. Include the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries in NAFTA.</b><sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
H.R. 553, stalled in Congress since 1995, is intended to correct an imbalance created by NAFTA that directly affects the interests of U.S. producers, importers, retailers, and consumers. The bill was developed to assure "parity" for producers in CBI countries with the market access provided to Mexican producers under the NAFTA. Such parity is badly needed. The Bush and Clinton Administrations mistakenly assumed that NAFTA would not divert trade and investment from the CBI countries. Since the implementation of NAFTA on January 1, 1994, U.S. imports of certain products (such as apparel) produced in the CBI countries by American firms have been affected adversely. The trade advantages created by NAFTA have enhanced the attractiveness of Mexico as a site for investing in manufacturing operations for export to the U.S. As a result, the rate of growth for apparel imports from CBI countries into the U.S. fell from 25 percent during 1995 to about 8 percent for the first five months of 1996, while apparel imports from Mexico during the same five-month period grew by 41 percent.<sup>20</sup>
<p>
<b>4. Launch a dialogue to integrate NAFTA and Mercosur.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The dynamics of the FTAA process have changed. The U.S. has squandered a two-year window of opportunity to influence the timetable and pathway for creating an FTAA, and Mercosur has emerged as a viable alternative pathway to an FTAA that many Latin American countries find appealing. Therefore, NAFTA and Mercosur should engage quickly in a formal dialogue with the goal of deepening and harmonizing trade disciplines as both groups take on new members. The ultimate objective should be to merge the two regional blocs into one hemispheric FTAA by 2005.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since 1995, the Clinton Administration has been trying without success to establish a formal dialogue between NAFTA and Mercosur. The problem is a series of disagreements among the U.S., Mexico, and Canada.<sup>21</sup>  Mexico opposes a NAFTA-Mercosur dialogue, arguing that it is not needed to achieve an FTAA by 2005 and that NAFTA should focus instead on granting real negotiating powers to the 11 technical work groups involved in the FTAA process.<sup>22</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Canada supports the U.S. proposal for a NAFTA-Mercosur dialogue but is reluctant to proceed without Mexico. The Canadians also oppose creating an FTAA as a pathway to NAFTA-Mercosur convergence by 2005. Instead, the Canadians favor replacing NAFTA and Mercosur with a new agreement negotiated simultaneously by all 34 democracies in the Western Hemisphere. Further complicating matters, enactment of the Helms-Burton Act has divided NAFTA, as Mexico and Canada are bitterly opposed to its implementation. As a result, the U.S. and Brazil announced in late August that an overdue report on the status of their ongoing bilateral trade review would be delayed. Several rounds of technical talks failed to achieve any breakthroughs on bilateral issues, such as improving the implementation of anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws in both countries. In addition, the July 1996 deadline for holding the first formal meeting between NAFTA and Mercosur was missed.
<P>
<b>5. Define a pathway and timetable for creating the FTAA.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The U.S. should urge Western Hemispheric nations to decide quickly whether the FTAA should include commitments that go beyond those already made in NAFTA and the WTO or should be abandoned in favor of merely removing tariffs on goods traded within the region.<sup>23</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Defining the timetable and pathway for the FTAA would advance the regional trade process in three ways: 1) It would focus the efforts of the 11 FTAA working groups set up to prepare for future negotiations; 2) it would help establish priorities for the FTAA agenda; and 3) it would help set a better stage for the difficult negotiations of the details of an FTAA agreement. The U.S., Canada, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and Costa Rica at various times have supported an FTAA based on WTO-plus disciplines in which, by 2005 when the FTAA is scheduled to go into effect, all of the commitments and trading disciplines established under the WTO would be implemented. However, Brazil has forcefully opposed proposals for an FTAA that goes beyond the WTO.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A fast-track negotiating authority in hand before the third post-Summit of the Americas trade ministerial next year in Brazil would improve the prospects for faster trade liberalization based on NAFTA/WTO-plus trading disciplines. Without fast-track, U.S. hopes of accelerating and enriching the FTAA process may be stillborn at the Belo Horizonte trade ministerial in 1997.
<p>
<b>6. Implement reforms that do not require formal negotiations.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are many unilateral actions that governments in the Western Hemisphere could take without engaging in formal state-to-state negotiations. Moreover, these reforms could yield swift benefits for both the U.S. and Latin America, since they would improve market access by injecting more transparency into the government rulemaking process and by dismantling tariff and non-tariff barriers to the faster and more efficient movement of goods, services, and capital throughout the region. For example, governments could simplify and harmonize rules and regulations relating to customs practices, sanitary standards, and technical barriers to trade. They also could pledge to avoid imposing new tariff and non-tariff barriers or raising existing barriers to the flow of goods, services, and investment within the region.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A third area in which governments should move quickly is revision of national investment laws to guarantee the right of establishment and national treatment of foreign investors, no restrictions on repatriation of profits and capital and access to convertible currency for all such transactions, protection against expropriation and compensation at fair market value in the event expropriation occurs, and phaseout of all performance requirements. Yet another area in which swift reforms are possible is the enactment of laws and policies that provide world-class protection for patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. Moreover, barriers to trade in services should be removed quickly, particularly in the areas of finance, telecommunications, and transportation. In addition, governments in Latin America should eliminate requirements and preferences in their purchase of goods and services, reduce market-distorting subsidies, and strengthen national competition laws.<sup>24</sup>  These reforms would accelerate the momentum of the FTAA process and yield tangible benefits in the form of faster trade growth and increased foreign direct investment flows in the Western Hemisphere.
<p>
<b>7. Establish separate negotiations on issues unrelated to free trade.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Both the expansion of NAFTA and U.S. leadership in the FTAA process have been undermined by the Clinton Administration's insistence on linking trade agreements to issues unrelated to free trade, such as labor standards and the environment. The Administration has threatened to impose trade sanctions against Colombia because President Ernesto Samper financed his 1994 election campaign in part with $6 million contributed by the Cali drug cartel. It also has delayed the implementation of a NAFTA obligation to allow Mexican trucks to circulate freely in the American Southwest, alleging concern about drug trafficking and U.S. national security.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
However, while hemispheric negotiations may be required to find common solutions to problems such as drug trafficking, illegal immigration, the environment, and labor standards, such pressure tactics work against U.S. interests in the region. Trade sanctions generally are not effective. Moreover, Latin American governments are unwilling to accommodate the Clinton Administration's demands for labor and environmental linkages to trade agreements; as a result, they will likely seek alternatives to NAFTA, such as Mercosur, SAFTA, the European Union, and Asian countries like Japan and Korea.
<p>
<b>8. Negotiate FTAs with New Zealand, Singapore, and Australia.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Many free traders believe that the pathways followed in creating the FTAA do not matter as long as a hemispheric free trade area is up and running by 2005. However, the recent breakup of the FTAA process into smaller regional trade agreements such as NAFTA and Mercosur is not a positive development. Smaller regional trade agreements may encourage increased trade and investment among the respective members of each group, but higher external tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade with countries that are not members of these groups hinder the efficient global movement of goods, services, and capital. The U.S. should refocus on multilateral trade liberalization and use regional free trade areas such as NAFTA to spur even larger trade zones. Negotiating bilateral NAFTA/WTO-plus trade agreements with Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore could energize the FTAA process, spur faster progress in APEC, and create momentum for merging the FTAA and APEC into a single free trade area.
<p>
<b>9. Convene a second Summit of the Americas in 1997.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A second Summit of the Americas should be convened in Chile in December 1997 to put the FTAA process back on a fast track to completion by 2005. However, before the second summit is held, the U.S. should renew fast-track, Chile should be included in NAFTA, and the CBI countries should be granted trading parity with NAFTA members. At this summit, the leaders of the hemisphere's democracies should agree on three things: 1) a specific pathway and timetable for achieving an FTAA; 2) creation of an institutional entity similar to the WTO to coordinate the FTAA negotiations; and 3) empowering the 11 technical working groups to negotiate firm FTAA proposals related to their respective areas of responsibility. In addition, APEC countries should be invited to participate as observers.
<p>
<b>10. Dismantle domestic U.S. barriers to free trade.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The greatest impediments to free trade and creation of the FTAA are found in Washington. For decades, the federal government has operated a vast and complex protectionist machine that has cost American taxpayers and consumers hundreds of billions of dollars. This protectionism comes in many forms, including traditional tariffs, quotas, "voluntary" restraint agreements, orderly marketing agreements, antidumping duties, countervailing duties, tax regulations, technology controls, anti-trust laws, and many other anti-trade weapons used against foreign exporters seeking greater access to the U.S. market as well as American firms and investors trying to compete globally.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Instead of protecting American consumers, preserving jobs, strengthening American manufacturing, encouraging new technology development, and improving American competitiveness in the global economy, this protectionism weakens U.S. companies in the international marketplace, promotes investment in noncompetitive sectors, enshrines low-skilled workers, and hinders productivity growth. American consumers pay a high price for these misguided policies. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank has estimated that import-protection schemes amount to the equivalent of a 23 percent income tax surcharge for low-income American families, or 10 percent for the average family. The Federal Trade Commission has determined that it costs the U.S. economy nearly $90 for each dollar saved by protected American firms. Overall, congressionally mandated protection and managed trade policies cost American consumers at least $70 billion a year and encourage America's trading partners to retaliate in kind, especially in the areas of anti-dumping and countervailing duty legislation.<sup>25</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since 1993, the Clinton Administration has preached the gospel of free trade in international forums such as the WTO, APEC, and the FTAA. In practice, however, the Administration's "strategic trade policies" have laid the foundations for even greater U.S. government protectionism and interference in the economy. For example, the Administration's National Export Strategy<sup>26</sup> and Big Emerging Markets (BEMs) Initiative<sup>27</sup> outline the twin pillars of an industrial policy and an expanded federal government role in the international marketplace. The basic premise of these strategies is that "U.S. firms will need the U.S. government at their side to win a fair hearing" in the global marketplace.<sup>28</sup>  According to President Clinton, the BEMs Initiative "streamlines Administration resources to focus on the markets in which government involvement can truly make a difference for America's businesses and workers."<sup>29</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Where trade policy is concerned, the Clinton Administration is making big government even bigger. The Administration has targeted domestic "clusters" of high-technology industries for export to key foreign markets where the U.S. government can help American firms secure market access, obtain financing, and win contracts for major projects in which foreign governments help competing bidders or play an important decisionmaking role in awarding projects.<sup>30</sup>  In addition, the Administration has established new divisions at the International Trade Administration and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to monitor and enforce foreign compliance with U.S. trade laws and agreements.<sup>31</sup>  The Administration also wants other trading nations to adopt a core set of labor principles as part of any future trade liberalization, and continues to insist that any new fast-track negotiating authority must contain strong negotiation provisions on both labor and the environment even though Latin American governments have strenuously opposed such linkages.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The U.S. has lost its once-respected leadership role in Latin America. The Clinton Administration turned its back on Latin America when the Mexican peso tumbled in December 1994. The expansion of NAFTA has stalled, and the U.S. no longer leads the FTAA process. Although Latin America has recovered from the aftershocks of the peso crisis and trade expansion continues unabated throughout the Western Hemisphere, the Clinton Administration and many in Congress are reluctant to put the expansion of NAFTA back on a fast track. Instead, they are behaving as though the American economy ends at the Atlantic and Pacific continental shelves, with nothing beyond the continent but an economic void that threatens America.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
From 1980-1992, the Reagan and Bush Administrations forged the closest friendship with Latin America that the U.S. has ever enjoyed. However, it took the Clinton Administration less than three years to dissolve that exciting new relationship in acrimonious recriminations and unkept American promises. If the Administration does not halt its flight from free trade and the expansion of NAFTA, U.S. economic and security interests in the Americas could suffer a sustained decline.

When Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn addressed the graduates of Harvard on the eighth of June, 1978, they gathered in anticipation of an extraordinary event.  But in his remarks, which he called <I>A World Split Apart</I>, Solzhenitsyn eschewed the kind of fulsome compliments now endemic in commencement speeches.  Instead, taking advantage of the fact that Harvard's motto is "Veritas," he ventured to tell them the truth:  that "a decline in courage may be the most striking feature that an outside observer notices in the West today."  Speaking barely three years after the fall of Saigon, he observed in Americans something approaching "a lack of manhood" in acquiescing in communist aggression, a trend he found most pronounced "among the ruling and intellectual elites."
<p>
Solzhenitsyn's speech, which might have been an opening wedge into closed minds, only made some Americans stamp their feet in irritation.  It was much easier to conclude that he was wrong than to admit that we had abandoned Vietnam because of our own cowardice.  So his speech provoked a firestorm of condemnation in the media, led by First Lady Rosalynn Carter, who claimed that the Russian writer had no understanding of the United States.
<p>
Though Solzhenitsyn, who had braved the death camps of the Gulag Archipelago and the interrogations of the Soviet secret police in his quest for the truth, hardly needed to burnish his character as a brave man by speaking the truth in Harvard Yard, the speech did prove to be the turning point in his public reputation in this country.  Because of his many unfashionable conclusions, the mainstream media decided that he was a crank, so the man who had been lionized in American literary circles was thenceforth shut out, dismissed, and ignored.  A host of ignorant charges were made against him, while his message to Americans was buried and forgotten.  Harper and Row, which published the address in a little book with the Russian text on one side and the English translation on the other, allowed it to go out of print by the late 1980s.
<p>
The antipathy of the media toward Solzhenitsyn was long-lasting and still has not let up.  When he returned to Russia in 1994, they hastened to conclude that he was just as irrelevant in his own country as they had deemed him to be in ours.  As <I>A World Split Apart</I> makes clear in its lucid discussion of the media in Western countries, they are not open to unfashionable arguments.  Their reaction to the speech was predictable, and in effect Solzhenitsyn's speech predicts it, at least in broad outline.  Thus, the speech was more than a reproach, from a friendly but frank observer, of America's loss of courage:  It was a demonstration of courage by the Russian writer, whose speech was also a deed.
<p>
Solzhenitsyn's example of courage in the speech had a practical effect.  The complacency of the media was not the only opinion abroad in the land.  Among American students of foreign affairs, and also the general public, there was a widespread and justified apprehension by the late 1970s that our loss of courage had left the United States at risk.  The war in Afghanistan, pursued in sharp contrast with the former caution of the Soviet Union, was one sign of danger; another was the impudent seizure of American hostages by the Iranian revolutionaries.  The 1980 presidential election, which turned on the difference between these two opinions about America's place in the world, marked an important turn in our politics.
<p>
In the decade after Solzhenitsyn spoke, American courage played a vital part in the collapse of the Soviet Union -- the most astonishing political event in the lifetime of my generation.  The stiffening of American resolve after the humiliations of the 1970s had many manifestations, but it was personified in the presidency of Ronald Reagan, whom Solzhenitsyn publicly praised.  From the beginning of his administration, Reagan showed courage unknown to his predecessor.  His prompt decision to fire air traffic controllers engaged in an illegal strike caused Americans and foreigners alike to take notice.  Even more important was the way he acted when he was shot in the spring of 1981:  We saw courage in his jokes, and nothing made him more formidable.  His subsequent willingness to call the Soviet Union an "evil empire" instead of falling back on the usual diplomatic euphemisms, and his evident resolve to prevent that country from achieving worldwide hegemony, made a deep impression on his countrymen, on their allies, and also on the Soviets.
<p>
By the time Solzhenitsyn returned to Russia, of course, the "world split apart" that he had described in his speech had been transformed by the American victory in the Cold War, which culminated in the fall of the Soviet Union.  The tense bipolar world of two superpowers, each representing a different moral and political understanding of man, had been replaced by the uneasy -- and sometimes unacknowledged -- triumph of liberal democracy.  Russia returned to the sort of remedial aspiration for democracy that held sway before its government was hijacked by communists during the Great War, while the United States greeted its own dominance with the sort of absentminded modesty that comes over it when it is not at war.
<p>
The sudden demise of the Soviet Union, like the fall of Saigon, was only the culmination of a long series of events, many of them little noticed or understood at the time.  The Soviet Union fell after its rulers realized that communism, which always left the Russian empire at a moral and economic disadvantage, could not keep up with technological progress in the free nations of the world.  That realization, which became widespread among well-placed Russians in the 1980s, made them lose heart about continuing their long-standing war of nerves with the United States.
<p>
It is not given to human beings to know the future, so we cannot be sure that the changes in the Soviet Union are irreversible, dramatic as their effects already have been in many parts of the world.  Powerful politicians who cleave to communism and prefer the old regime now control important offices in Russia and are bidding for the presidency.  The picture also is mixed in many of the former Soviet satellites in Eastern Europe.  Cuba and North Korea remain unbending, though increasingly isolated in their backwardness.  China and Vietnam have begun to modernize their economies by taking some small steps toward a free market, but without dismantling communist tyranny.  In China's case, the transition has been accompanied by an unwelcome belligerency toward the interests and friends of the United States.  Therefore, the post-Cold War world calls for continuing resolve and prudence on our part, not relaxation or inattention.
<p>
But there is plenty of evidence in <I>A World Split Apart</I> -- and much more in Solzhenitsyn's other writings on human nature and politics -- that the Russian writer considers courage important not only as an aid to preserving a decent regime, which it has been for the United States, but also as a virtue that belongs to a properly ordered human soul.  Thus, courage is prized for its own sake as well as for its instrumental effects.  When Solzhenitsyn reproached us for losing heart, he meant to make us ashamed, not just afraid.
<p>
What is courage?  Ernest Hemingway described it as "grace under pressure."  John Milton wrote that a man who had it would "never...  submit or yield."  Solzhenitsyn's predecessor as an honorary American citizen, Winston Churchill, esteemed it "the first of human qualities" -- in fact, the one that guarantees all the others.  In his youth, he sought to win a reputation for courage.  He tells us in his autobiography <I>My Early Life</I> how, after he left the military academy at Sandhurst, he carried out a private experiment by attaching himself to a Spanish column fighting a guerrilla war in Cuba.  Before he got too far into his career as a cavalry officer, he wanted to find out if he had courage enough.  On his 21st birthday, he came under fire for the first time and was relieved to discover that not everyone gets killed, or even hurt.  The young Churchill escaped unscathed, thanks to a well-fed Spanish officer who was asleep in a hammock between him and the enemy guns.  He did not begrudge the fat man his meals.  Keeping the example of his unofficial trial of courage in Cuba in mind, we can discern a few capital facts about it.
<p>
Courage has to do with braving dangers nobly.  It means surmounting the fear of wounds or death.  In his autobiography, Churchill tells us how he gave up a piece of skin from his forearm to seal the wound of a brother officer.  A brave man can endure the prospect of bodily pain or violent death, or even the reality of it, without flinching.  But the danger that he knows how to face has to have something of nobility in it:  Courage is shown in surmounting your fear of being hurt or killed not through illness or a car accident, but through war.  Therefore, courage is seen more in Churchill's being under fire than in his willingness to be flayed by the doctor to help his wounded friend, though as a brave man he faced both kinds of pains well.  This endurance, which is really just doggedness, is an important part of courage and distinguishes someone who has the virtue from someone who does not have it.
<p>
It was Aristotle who invented the distinction between intellectual virtue and moral or ethical virtue, arguing that courage was one of the moral virtues, along with moderation, magnanimity, justice, veracity, and others.  He showed us that, like other moral virtues, courage is a habit, not an opinion or a frame of mind.  It is not enough simply to praise courage, or even to understand it.  To develop a habit like courage, you need chances to practice it.  Hence Churchill's eagerness to put himself in harm's way:  You can't act courageously without having dangers to face, and you can't cultivate a habit of courage without acting courageously.
<p>
Aristotle argued that, again like other moral virtues, courage is found in a mean, in between an excess and a defect.  The courageous man is not too afraid of dangers, like a coward, nor is he too unafraid of them, like a rash man.  Of the two extremes, the ordinary human bent is toward cowardice, because people have a natural disinclination to suffer pain or death -- a disinclination that is perfectly reasonable.  But rashness is a vice as well, because the rash man lacks the steadiness and the prudence of the courageous man.  Churchill acted rashly when he jumped off a bridge just after his 18th birthday to avoid being captured by his brother and a cousin, who were chasing him.  He fell 29 feet to the ground, ruptured his kidney among other organs, and for a year afterward "looked at life round a corner."  But rashness can be turned toward courage by age and experience more easily than cowardice can.
<p>
If wanting to avoid pain or death is perfectly reasonable, then courage, which puts you in harm's way, seems to have something in common with stupidity.  Churchill admits as much when he says of his trip to Cuba, "You might call it tomfoolery.  To travel thousands of miles with money one can ill afford, and get up at four o'clock in the morning in the hope of getting into a scrape in the company of perfect strangers, is hardly a rational proceeding."  Being virtuous is supposed to be pleasant, yet courage requires you to stand your ground tenaciously even when the consequence may be pain or death.  A brave man will sometimes charge into the enemy line, but a horse never will.  A horse is smart enough to shy away, and men often shy away too.  Hence Hobbes's notorious description of a battle as a running away on one side -- or both.
<p>
Nonetheless, Churchill knew "there were very few subalterns in the British Army who would not have given a month's pay" to share his adventure.  A courageous man does not just run away from battle.  He is willing to risk danger because, for him, avoiding pain and staying alive are not the most important things.  Everyone prefers to stay alive, of course; but the courageous man gives even his own life the proper weight:  not too little and not too much.  He isn't willing to pay any price just to stay alive, because he isn't willing to live just any kind of life.  He knows that everyone dies in the end, so what matters is the kind of life you live.  The price you pay to stay alive is too high if it means your life is not fully human; and a life of comfortable self-preservation is not a fully human life, because it lacks risk and adventure.  In addition to the endurance or tenacity -- the doggedness -- that I mentioned earlier, courage involves daring.  The courageous man dares, and dares greatly, like Churchill, who as a young man took risks over and over again to get to the battlefield, and then took risks on the battlefield to win a name for valor.
<p>
Here is a clue as to why he ranked courage first among the virtues.  For human beings, living means taking risks, because we are neither omniscient or omnipotent.  If we knew everything that was going to happen to us ahead of time, we could foresee and forestall injury and perhaps even death, but then life would be dull and not worth living.  Or, if we had the power to master everything, we could overcome even dangers that we could not foresee, which again would give us the conceit of absolute assurance and a very humdrum life.  Churchill explores these possibilities in his essay "A Second Choice," published in <I>Thoughts and Adventures</I>.
<p>
This idea of becoming omniscient or omnipotent is the real aspiration of modern science -- mastering nature, overcoming chance, learning to control our surroundings, taking the risk out of life by making it entirely predictable.  For Churchill, this aspiration is misbegotten, as he suggests in some of the other essays in <I>Thoughts and Adventures</I>.  Insofar as science succeeds in mastering nature -- and Churchill is impressed with the success of modern technology -- it adds to our power, but without making us better or happier.  As fast as we embrace the fruits of modern science, we find that the guarantee of a good life is still somewhere around the next corner.  And when men reach the limits of their ability to control the world -- for Churchill concludes that there are limits to our science and power, particularly when it comes to reshaping human nature -- then they may realize ruefully that what nature gives us is not so bad after all, compared to what we make for ourselves.  Indeed, that realization may prove a relief.
<p>
We do not have the kind of comprehensive knowledge that would allow us to avoid every wrong turn, but we can have a human wisdom that allows us to see a little way ahead, if we are prudent.  And we do not have the kind of absolute power that would allow us to overcome every obstacle and accomplish every wish, but we do have the human strength to make a better life for ourselves, if we act wisely.  Discernment is needed to guide our actions; that is the intellectual side.  But courage is the moral equipment we need to live in an uncertain world without letting ourselves be either reduced to malleable material directed from without (a cowardly surrender of our humanity) or seduced by the idea that human beings can control everything (a rash attempt to play God).
<p>
Modern science leads men into both mistakes by considering us at once as material beings undifferentiated from the rest of nature and as rational beings radically distinct from the rest of nature.  A more suitable and courageous posture is suggested by Aristotle, who found no mean part for men with the moral virtues (and no one who has read Aristotle will fault me for any originality in my treatment of courage, unless I have made any mistakes).  Winston Churchill's discoveries about courage are remarkably similar to Aristotle's treatment of that virtue in the <I>Nicomachean Ethics</I>.  Churchill was aware of this similarity, but he did not consider it a coincidence.  When someone recommended Aristotle's book to him and then asked Churchill what he thought after he had read it, the answer he got was that Aristotle's views on ethics were very sensible, but not very different from those that Churchill had formed on his own.
<p>
Courage is always a popular virtue, but especially in wartime, when it seems so obviously needed.  A coward is no use to others in case of danger, whereas everyone hopes to find a brave man fighting shoulder to shoulder at his side.  But courage is not useful only on the battlefield:  It also is a good sign that a person is worth befriending.  One who prizes his own comfort and life above everything else is too selfish to be a friend to anyone else.  Churchill mentions that, in his youth, men who had been in battle had an aura about them that was recognized by the girls they courted.  In this, the girls showed a nice understanding of what was good for them, since a coward is too selfish to give much consideration to anyone else -- even his own wife or family.
<p>
But a courageous man is not courageous simply because he seeks the esteem of others.  While that aspiration is a healthy spur to a young man learning to be courageous, it cannot be the motive of a man who has courage.  A courageous man does not sacrifice his own pleasure as he does courageous deeds, though he may sacrifice his own comfort; he takes pleasure in acting courageously, even if he has to endure pain.  The pain, or the risk of death, is a reminder that human beings are not all souls, that we live in bodies and are vulnerable through them.  It is also the reason that courage, as the first of the virtues, is on a lower level than others, like friendliness and wittiness, that do not require us to suffer pain.
<p>
Aristotle reserves courage, and the rest of the virtues as well, for gentlemen who have been properly raised.  But Churchill, though he does not turn up his nose at gentlemanliness, seems to encourage young men of spirit wherever he finds them.  He calls his autobiography <I>My Early Life</I> "a tale of youthful endeavour," dedicates it "to a new generation," and in it exhorts young men "all over the world" to take their places "in life's fighting line."  He tells them that they should never "take No for an answer" and "Never submit to failure."
<p>
Churchill's autobiography, which is still in print, is an adventure story that rivals for color, incident, and vivid description the best stories of Mark Twain, whom he admired.  Churchill would approve of the study of his own life as a spur to ambition, a guide to political judgment, and a model of courage, just as he studied and learned from the examples of his father Lord Randolph Churchill and his great forebear John Churchill, the first duke of Marlborough.
<p>
But Churchill is not the only one who can teach us courage.  Solzhenitsyn's books hold lessons for us too, especially his most impressive book, the three-volume <I>Gulag Archipelago</I>, which opens a whole new moral universe to the unsuspecting Western reader.  Beginning with <I>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</I>, the only one of his books that was published in communist Russia, Solzhenitsyn explored the question of what gives a human being strength to live a virtuous life under the most unpromising conditions.  <I>The Gulag Archipelago</I> affords a lengthier description of the men who discovered their souls under the bleak and distant sun of the Soviet death camps.  One of the merits of Solzhenitsyn's account is to show how that courage cannot quite stand alone as a moral virtue, that it needs to be paired with prudence.  Aristotle had come to the same conclusion.
<p>
And if we are looking for American heroes, some of the same discoveries may be made from reading the memoir written by our highest-ranking Vietnam POW, Admiral Jim Stockdale, and the woman who staunchly waited and worked for his return, Sybil Stockdale.  Stockdale is a man of remarkable thoughtfulness, a careful student of philosophers like Plato and Epictetus.  He had plenty of time to think as he endured privation and torture in the Hanoi Hilton.  The book he wrote with his wife, <I>In Love and War</I>, tells the story of his captivity from both sides.  Both endurance and daring, and the way these two elements of courage have to be guided by practical wisdom, can be learned from the Stockdales' book.
<p>
At first blush, Solzhenitsyn's warning that Americans might lack courage to prevail over the Soviets now seems too pessimistic.  The United States is the only remaining superpower:  The Soviet Union lies in the dust.  American steadiness won the Cold War, though my generation has never experienced a hot war worldwide.  Still, we have only to go back to the Gulf War to remember how the United States formed ranks against a nasty aggressor.  Though few Americans were called on to make sacrifices in that war, our experience in Korea, or in the two world wars, suggests our countrymen will not shrink from fighting to defend liberty.  In retrospect, Vietnam looks like an exception -- not that our soldiers, sailors, and airmen were loath to put themselves in harm's way, or the American people (with some sorry exceptions) to support them; but our political leaders lacked steady resolve to guide them and to explain the war to their fellow citizens.
<p>
Up to this point, I have emphasized courage in battle or in other situations of mortal danger.  That is a necessary corrective to the penchant today to prefer so-called moral courage, or the courage of your convictions, to real courage.  People who have the courage of their convictions, which means sincerity and a certain determination, have the strength of soul required for all the virtues, but not necessarily the particular moral habit of courage.  Voltaire is famous for saying that though he might disagree with what you said, he would defend to his death your right to say it.  For this sort of remark, he is widely praised for having moral courage.  But as Harvey Mansfield points out, that is not courage at all, but only cheap talk.  Voltaire never defended to the death anyone's right to say anything, much less something with which he disagreed; and it is doubtful that anyone ever has.
<p>
Since the decision to end the draft for American citizens, most of our young people have no experience of military service or the possibility of risking their lives for their country.  This deprives them of the usual way of learning about courage in practice.  But I do not mean to suggest that if you have no chance to go into battle, you cannot have courage.  That virtue belongs not only on the battlefield, but also in the peaceable lives of citizens and statesmen.  There is reason to be apprehensive about the courage of Americans today, from the man in the street right up to the White House.  Students are more likely to know about George Washington's false teeth than his courage as a general and statesman, and shoppers do not even remember whose birthday "Presidents' Day" once celebrated.  Public schools aim to make students fit in or to give them a specious self-esteem rather than teach them examples of the virtues, and courage is one of the most neglected.
<p>
Stigmatized as aggressive behavior by people who are hostile to anything noble, courage is treated with suspicion if it ever comes up; but mostly, the politically correct curriculum simply avoids mentioning it.  The kind of challenging, competitive, or warlike occasions that call forth courage are neither studied nor experienced in the classroom.  By giving up any effort to instruct students in moral virtues like courage, public schools discourage them.  The student who has faced exacting expectations from a teacher is a rare bird, easily recognizable by the unusual demands of his self-respect; but mostly, little is asked and little is learned.  Unambitious, unaccomplished, unenterprising students make half-hearted scholars, but they also are ill-prepared for life and make an easy mark for the engrossing distractions of alcohol, drugs, and television stupor.
<p>
Yet when you neglect the spirited part of students' souls, they do not just atrophy.  High aspirations remain, and students learn courage, if they do, in their increasingly risky unofficial dealings with each other and the world.  Too many of them are punished for their courage if they stand up to gang violence; others learn to act courageously in the bosom of a gang on behalf of a bad cause.  Public schools and the media maintain a conspiratorial silence about the prevalence of gang violence.  Parents do not want to believe it and too often are oblivious to the problem, but students know all about it.
<p>
Students today seem starved for good examples, for some relief from the public school professionalism that chills their ardent curiosity about the right way to live and denies them the kind of rousing adventures that appealed to young Winston Churchill.  Teachers who love their subjects and hold students to high standards, academic contests with winners and losers, conversations in class that give students a chance to explore their own questions with the help of classic writings -- these traditional methods could bring some excitement back into the classroom.  Students would be as encouraged to see dumbed-down, mealy-mouthed textbooks replaced with real books as to see dumbed-down, mealy-mouthed facilitators replaced with real teachers.
<p>
The long-run effects of neglecting courage go beyond our schools to civil society, where a parallel professionalism makes courts ineffective at maintaining civil order.  In our political leaders, lack of courage manifests itself, as Churchill observed, in living "in the temperamental atmosphere of a Gallup Poll -- always feeling one's pulse and taking one's temperature."  The politics of meeting the demands of your constituents, of pleasing an often uninstructed public, of changing your stance to get re-elected -- in short, what you might call the politics of valetudinarianism -- is rampant today (not that cautious compromise is always wrong, or a shift in position always the sign of a craven politician).
<p>
But Churchill warns that that sort of politician is increasingly common in our democratic age.  As usual, he reflects on this subject in his writings.  As he writes in "Fifty Years Hence," an essay published in <I>Thoughts and Adventures</I>, "Democratic governments drift along the line of least resistance, taking short views, paying their way with sops and doles and smoothing their path with pleasant-sounding platitudes."  That's a good description of presidential politics today.  Few of our politicians understand Churchill's remark that "politics is almost as exciting as war and quite as dangerous" because "in war you can only be killed once, but in politics many times."  Most of them are too timid to risk being killed politically even once.
<p>
In his essay on "Consistency in Politics" in <I>Thoughts and Adventures</I>, Churchill explores his view of political courage.  He deprecates the small-souled kind of consistency that means unbending adherence to a certain position, no matter what the circumstances; circumstances change, so positions have to change too.  A larger consistency means that a man has "the same dominating purpose," as he writes, even if circumstances force him to throw his weight now on one side, now on the other of a durable political controversy.  For instance, it is impossible to say in principle whether defense spending should be higher or lower; it is only possible to make a practical judgment about what the current situation requires, which may change from one year to the next.
<p>
But, as his countrymen would discover in the 1930s when he began his brave but lonely campaign to warn them of the Nazi menace, Churchill had no time for the kind of politician who simply swims with the current.  Such a timid policy neglects a statesman's responsibility as custodian of his nation's abiding interests.  Representative government requires a certain courage in its statesmen:  the courage to show constituents their true interests instead of just reflecting their wishes.  Americans citizens need that kind of instruction as much as their political leaders need the political courage and discernment to offer it.
<p>
When Solzhenitsyn explored the reason for resistance to Soviet tyranny in the third volume of <I>The Gulag Archipelago</I>, he found it in the courage of some human beings who had, as he said, "a nobler conception of life."  Courage is the virtue that defends our liberty; it is also the first virtue of a man who is truly free.  Therefore, it belongs, in the company of the other moral virtues, with what Russell Kirk finely described as "the permanent things."

<h3>Eve Without Adam: What Genesis Has to Tell America About Natural Law</h3>
By David F. Forte<br>
Professor of Law, Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, Cleveland State University
<p>
Heritage Lecture No. 570<br>
A <a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklect.html">Russell Kirk Memorial Lecture</a><br>
Delivered May 1, 1996<br>
<p>

In the spring of 1992, I was ensconced here on the fifth floor of the Heritage Foundation. There I was, ferreting out the historical basis of the Supreme Court's right to strike down legislation, when, from a few blocks away, the Justices graced my work with the following statement:
	<p>
<blockquote>At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. (<I>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey</I>, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 2807 [1992].)
</blockquote>
<p>
All that was mine?  I thought. You mean, I -- on the fifth floor of the Heritage Foundation -- could define "existence," "the mystery of human life," and the "universe" too?  Yes, said the Court. All I need do, the Justices said, was accept the right of the Court to "speak before all others" on constitutional ideals and to follow its lead no matter what qualms of conscience I might have. The Court made that statement, of course, to support the right of a woman to terminate the life of the developing human fetus within her. But somehow, the Court's declaration had a more ancient ring to it.
<p>
Normally when I speak at the Heritage Foundation, I talk about law. But I am not going to talk about law today, even though the Supreme Court has inspired this reflection. Instead, I want to talk to you about a cultural moment, a moment Russell Kirk worked for and, I am sure, prayed for all his life. We are at a time when faith and reason, which moderns regard as antagonists, are resuming a partnership long overdue. Faith and reason are, in fact, two pillars of Western civilization, and their reintegration comes at a time when the hallmarks of that civilization are disintegrating around us.
<p>
I need not chronicle the statistics of our decline. You are familiar enough with them. <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a>, Gary Bauer, Marvin Olasky, and so many others have described a society where each person has become disconnected with his fellows, where we create zones of privacy to find ourselves and lose everyone else in the bargain. We are a citizenry where to a large extent, metaphorically speaking, Eve exists without Adam, Adam without Eve, where neither truth nor permanence are seen as real and relationships of all sorts are fitful, episodic, and transient.
<P>
This may be an America where there are a thousand points of light, but each one illuminates only itself. Faith is an outlaw in the public square, and philosophy deconstructs reason itself.
<p>
It was not always this way. It certainly was not this way at the founding of the country. For, as the Founders knew so well, Western civilization was built upon both reason and faith: the faith of the Judeo-Christian revelation and the reason that discovered and applied the natural law.
<p>
Today, I wish to make but three points. First, I want to discuss something of the history of the alliance between faith and reason in Western intellectual history and their estrangement. Second, by referring to some of the elements in the Book of Genesis, I would like to affirm the basic compatibility between the principles of the natural law and the values of our religious heritage. Finally, I raise a caution regarding religious doctrine and liberty that any effective and principled alliance between faith and reason must deal with.
<p>
<b>Faith and Reason</b>
<p>
	The Greeks, who gave us so much, gave us the natural law school of thought, particularly in the writings of Aristotle. Natural law was subsequently universalized by the Stoics, incorporated into the law by the Romans, allied with Christianity, and finally raised to its highest exposition by St. Thomas Aquinas in his Scholastic philosophy. The school of natural law championed man's reason, his being, his capacity for sociability, and his virtue. The values espoused by that school dominated Western thought through the end of the 18th century and were included in the principles of the American Founding.
<p>
The Judeo-Christian revelation provided the other, complementary notion of the nature of man: created by God, fallen, covenanted, and graced with a divinely inspired mission.
<P>
In the high Middle Ages, the traditions of faith and reason reached their greatest level of integration in the natural law philosophy of Thomas Aquinas. Scholasticism constituted the most fully developed version of natural law, while of the faith of the Church unified Europe. Then came the Renaissance, the Protestant Reformation, and the age of scientific inquiry. The link between faith and reason was weakened, and eventually broken. The age of Reformation and Rationalism was launched. Faith sought to undo the shackles of reason, while reason tried to free itself of the shackles of religion.
<P>
Important Protestant theologians found the good solely through the will of God as revealed in His Word, while rationalists forsook natural law thinking as being too close to religion. The Reformation disparaged the Scholasticism of the high Middle Ages. God's law was divine positive law, and no natural law could independently find the good.
<p>
Not that natural law was extinguished at the end of the high Middle Ages. On the contrary, the cultural force that the alliance of faith and reason had created lasted for centuries. Even though Protestant theology rejected Scholasticism, Biblical values paralleled the norms of natural law. Magnanimity was charity, courage was fortitude, fidelity was faithfulness, community was congregation. On the other hand, although few philosophers "did" natural law from the 14th century on, most traded on its fundamental norms. Sir Edward Coke found natural justice to be "right reason," which was the basis of the common law. John Locke presumed those norms to be in the law of nature, which both limited and gave legitimacy to individual liberty. When international politics degenerated into self-interested discord, Grotius, Pufendorf, and Vattel sought to revive a modified natural law to restore some moral order to the relations between states.
<P>
The Founders fully understood that a civil society could not be maintained without recourse to the intellectual values of the natural law and the parallel spiritual values of revelation. Washington knew how crucial that bond was. As he said in his farewell address:
<P><blockquote>
	Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, Religion and Morality are indispensable supports.... In Vain would man claim the tribute of Patriotism, who should labour to avert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties of Men and Citizens. The mere Politician, equally with the pious man ought to respect and to cherish them.... And let us with caution indulge the supposition, that morality can be maintained without religion.
</blockquote><p>
By the 19th century, however, the connection between the mind and the spirit was finally severed. When religion and revelation could no longer restrain reason and positivism, the power of the state and the power of the unconstrained individual came to the fore. It is not much of an exaggeration that the problems of politics since the 19th century in the world lie in the contest between the supposedly self-sufficient power of the state on the one hand and the supposedly self-sufficient power of the individual on the other. The higher law that tames both is absent.
<p>
In the 19th century, natural law had retreated to being a Catholic intellectual discipline. It was disdained in the academy. A character in Stendahl declares, "There's no such thing as natural law. This expression is nothing but old nonsense."  A lot of "old nonsense" was done away with in Fichte, Hegel, and Marx, in Austin, Bentham, and Holmes.
<p>
It was not until the aftermath of World War II, in confronting the Holocaust, that natural law stirred again in the conscience of the philosopher and the judge. If the Holocaust was evil, pure and simple, then there must be a good, pure and simple. If we shrink from thinking that the Final Solution can ever have been a valid human law because its purpose was so utterly perverse, there must be a purposive standard by which we can know what laws are indeed legitimate or not.
<P>
And so the revival began, kindling in different places: Jacques Maritain in France, Russell Kirk in the United States, the Hart/Fuller debate. By the 1980s, natural law had once again become an independent philosophical discipline. Dozens of books and hundreds of articles poured out. Natural law as a vibrant school of philosophy has returned. It is something we have not seen for six centuries.
<p>
Today, in the face of the dissolution wrought by positivism, there is a renewed alliance between faith and reason. Natural law thought is flourishing, pursued by Catholics, Jews, and Protestants, while a reawakening to faith stirs throughout the country. Pope John Paul II calls a return to natural law values essential to saving Western civilization itself, while Protestant ministers and political activists from the late Martin Luther King, Jr., to Ralph Reed find in the natural law those essential human values that are confirmed by revelation. The "law written on men's hearts," as St. Paul puts it, is once again recognized by Protestant Christianity.

<p>
<b>Genesis and the Natural Law</b>
<p>
The renewed alliance between faith and reason makes eminent sense, for the fundamental view of nature and of humanity articulated in the natural law school parallels the divine definition of creation and man taught by revelation. The example I use today is Genesis, though there are myriad other instances. I do not do so as a Biblical exegete. I am not qualified for that. But I do know something about the natural law and find that its insights are confirmed in many parts of the saga of creation in the Book of Genesis, at least according to many common interpretations of that text.
<p>
Every culture's creation stories reveal its basic concept of what is human, what is nature, and what is divine. In Genesis, we have a compilation of creation stories. Taken together, they tell us in mythic language what reason has brought us to apprehend in natural law. In its own terms, Genesis tells us what natural law tells us. It speaks to us of natural man and created man, of conjoined man and disunited man. It affirms man's reason, his goodness, his unity, and his ego. 	 Let me discuss just three parts of Genesis in relation to the natural law: the creation of the material world, the creation of man, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
<p>
Now, I am not going to talk about the creationism, or sin, or sex. If you want to talk about evolution, let's discuss it over coffee. If you want to talk about sin, perhaps we can do that over a beer. If you want to talk about sex, sorry, I'm a married man.
<p>
Let us start with the account of creation in the first chapter:
<p><blockquote>
	In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless waste, and darkness covered the abyss, and the mighty wind [the spirit of God] swept over the waters. (Genesis 1:1-2.)
</blockquote><p>
In that one majestic verse, God's creation astonishes us in two simultaneous ways. First, He creates everything ("the heavens and the earth") out of nothing. Second, He brings order out of chaos. In the image of the ancient Hebrews, the stuff of the cosmos was water, and water symbolized chaos -- which God orders. Think for a moment of the difference between farmers and fishermen: A farmer subdues the land and makes it his servant, but an experienced fisherman knows he is always a stranger on the sea and is never home till he reaches shore.
<p>
In Genesis, God's mighty spirit moves across the water, pushing it where He wills. He orders chaos itself. Recall in the New Testament, when Jesus awakens in the boat to still the storm that was threatening to overwhelm the disciples. "Who can this be," they ask in awe, "that the wind and the sea obey him?"  (Mark 4:41.) The disciples understood that this was no ordinary wonder-worker. In Genesis, God pushes the water out of the world by creating a domed firmament and separates the remaining water in the world into seas while permitting some of the remaining cosmic waters to sluice in as rain through holes in the dome, or bubble up from below through springs (oases perhaps) or rivers.
<p>
The point of creation is that without order, there would not be nothingness, but utter chaos. Let us reflect on that. People will give up their lives for order. They will die for their country, their faith, their family, or their friends. But a life without meaning leads to despair. Chaos, not death, holds the real terror for man. In the most primeval sense, a terrorist does the devil's work.
<p>
Notice also in this first chapter, that as soon as God controls chaos, pushing a mighty wind over the seas, He creates light. (Genesis 1:3.) Light is the greatest of the elements. Light is good. It illuminates the order he is creating. It is understanding. Throughout scripture, the notion of light is always seen as illuminating an understanding of the inner reality of things.
<p>
Finally, God proceeds, in a measured and deliberative manner, to create the remainder of material reality. Even with their pre-scientific notions, the Hebrews understood that everything created was logically and organically interrelated, and that reality was created in a purposeful manner from the most basic to the more refined. There is a purpose and a point to creation. It leads to man. And in finishing the work of creation, God said that it was good. (Genesis 1:31.)
<p>
In this most fundamental description of reality, natural law concurs. In natural law, reality is objective and ordered, and man is organically part of it. Socrates taught that man's reason could apprehend and illuminate this reality. He spent his life battling the Sophists, who saw only chaos underlying everything. Plato sought to discover the good that was the ultimate reality. Aristotle found that the world was the result not of chance, but of intelligent intention. He taught that change was not chaotic, but purposeful, wherein each thing moves to fulfill its own nature, and that being -- existence itself -- was in its very nature, good. All these elements were synthesized in Aquinas.
<P>
Similar parallels are in the account of man.
<p>
In the first chapter of Genesis, God creates man and woman equally in his image; that is, unlike the animals, men and women are to reflect the divine. In the second story of creation, God creates man (adam = universal humanity) and finds that "it is not good for man to be alone, I will make a suitable partner for him."  (Genesis 2:18.) God's creation is incomplete. It is not yet "good."  In natural law, too, things are good only when their nature is fulfilled, when their potentialities are brought to completion.
<p>
In Genesis, for man (that is, mankind in its individualization) to be complete, he needs a helpmeet. Likewise, in the natural law tradition, Aristotle insists that man cannot truly flourish as a human unless he is associated together in the polity. From Aristotle on, the natural law tradition emphasizes the fundamental good of friendship, defined as seeking the good of the other. In Genesis, there is a special complementarity in the friendship of a man and a woman, which becomes the fundamental experience of the good of sociability of each individual.
<p>
In natural law, sociability (which I think is natural law's unique contribution to understanding contemporary problems) is something without which man cannot flourish as a human person. It has its most intense fulfillment in the relations between a man and a woman in the family. That ordering of human relations is a fundamental good attached to human nature itself.
<p>
We can see already how radically similar the views of revelation and natural law are on the nature of reality and of man. Order, reason, community, purposeful action, the goodness of being, sociability, sexual complementarity are essential to both.
<p>
Now we come to the part of the story that everybody knows best: the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Adam and Eve, you recall, could eat of all the fruit of the trees in the Garden except one. But the serpent was a persuasive advocate:
<p><blockquote>
	The serpent asked the woman, "Did God really tell you not to eat from any of the trees in the garden?"  The woman answered the serpent: "We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden; it is only about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden that God said, `You shall not eat it or even touch it, lest you die.'"  But the serpent said to the woman: "You certainly will not die!  No. God knows well that the moment you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods who know what is good and what is bad."  The woman saw that the tree was good for food, pleasing to the eyes, and desirable for gaining wisdom. So she took some of the fruit and ate it; and she also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized that they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves. (Genesis 2:1-7.)
</blockquote><p>
The serpent said three things about this tree. Fruit is sweet tasting. Knowledge is a delight. And you can be like God. Now, I love caramel sundaes, but I can turn down a sweet. I revel in the life of the mind, but I don't really have to know everything. But to be like a God -- that's a dizzying prospect. The exegetes tell us that the temptation to Eve and to Adam was to define for oneself what the scheme of good and evil is instead of apprehending what is objectively good for man. If I can define for myself for my own world, if I can determine what is good and evil, then for that little world of my making, I am a god. The serpent did say something else. He said Eve would not die. In the end, the promise to be a god, as enticing as it may be, is always a false promise.
<p>
By eating the fruit, Eve names good and evil for herself. Remember that earlier in this chapter of Genesis, God had given Adam the right to name the animals, to distinguish them, to find their inner scientific order. But the naming of good and evil, God retains to himself. Man was given reason to apprehend good and evil, but he does not, in his nature, possess the capacity for creating it.
<p>
Aristotle teaches that a just man is one who practices virtue, and he defines virtue as the habit of acting rightly. When one acts rightly, one reflects or participates in the objective moral order (the image of God in the words of Genesis). But when one defines the moral order for himself, he images nothing but his own will. By definition, under the natural law, one cannot act virtuously if one is knowingly acting outside of the objective moral order.
<p>
Having asserted one's own will as defining good and evil, the results ineluctably follow. For, as the story of creation predicted, without order there is not nothingness, but the terror and distress of chaos.
<p>
There is first the disorder of the soul, in the form of shame. Second, social cohesion is shattered. God strolls through the Garden of Eden and accuses Adam of eating of the forbidden tree. And Adam dissembles: "The woman whom you put here with me -- she gave me fruit from the tree, and so I ate it."  (Genesis 2:12.) Even in the garden of Eden, the man abandons the woman. They are no longer friends. The bonds of sociability are broken. As soon as we take unto ourselves the right to define good and evil, we jettison the interconnectedness between one another that our natures call us to have. Trust vanishes.
<p>
Lest you think that such insights come only from a religious tradition, let me read to you Cicero:
<blockquote><P>
	True law is right reason in agreement with nature; it is of universal application, unchanging and everlasting; it summons to duty by its commands, and averts wrongdoing by its prohibitions.... It is a sin to try to alter this law, nor is it allowable to attempt to repeal any part of it, and it is impossible to abolish it entirely. We cannot be freed from its obligations by senate or people, and we need not look outside ourselves for an expounder or interpreter of it. And there will not be different laws at Rome and at Athens, or different laws now and in the future, but one eternal and unchangeable law will be valid for all nations and all times, and there will be one master and ruler, that is, God, over us all, for he is the author of this law, its promulgator, and its enforcing judge. Whoever is disobedient is fleeing from himself and denying his human nature, and by reason of this very fact he will suffer the worst penalties, even if he escapes what is commonly considered punishment. (<I>De Republica</I> 3:21.)
</blockquote><p>
Cicero never read Genesis.
<p>
The Supreme Court's definition of human nature in <I>Casey</I> has given us Eve without Adam, and Adam without Eve. We are solitary autonomous beings, unconnected, without responsibility for each other. The Court empowers us to define ourselves, to create our own universe, to be, as Genesis predicted, "like God."  In the same way in which the Supreme Court makes law without a constitutional standard, it has declared that there is no rule of law against which we must measure our own actions. We make the rule of law for ourselves, each one a different rule of law. So, for example, we often hear the familiar non sequitur, "I believe abortion is the taking of human life, but I would never want to impose my values on you."  It denies us the fundamental natural law standard of an objective basis of morality, and equally denies us the opportunity to strive to that perfection to which we are constituted.
<p>
That is our world today, and it comes from the disdaining of religion and of reason. The world of deconstructed philosophy, of private moralities, of God that cannot be mentioned in the public square leaves Eve without Adam, unborn children without their mothers, born children without their fathers, and the dying without hope. The homeless are not just those we see on the streets. Such a world leaves us all homeless. That is the Faustian bargain that the Supreme Court offers us in <I>Casey</I>.
<p>
Thus, there is little wonder that the philosophers of the school of natural law and the followers of revealed religion find themselves in a political, intellectual, and moral alliance today.

<p>
<b>Religious Doctrine and Human Liberty</b>
<p>
For the alliance of reason and faith to be effective, it must contend with issues of doctrine and with issues of liberty. The beauty of the natural law philosophy is that it is universal. It calls upon all persons to consider and freely to order their lives by an objective moral standard. Whether or not creationism can be justified scientifically, the rest of our society perceives it solely as a religious doctrine. Whether or not contraception is contrary to the natural law, the rest of our society perceives it as a Catholic doctrine. A simple rule of prudence requires that those values not be imposed. This is not to say, however, that the scientific shortcomings of evolutionary theory cannot be discussed. They should be. Nor that contraceptives should be distributed in the schools. We know the objective harm that brings and the invasion of the family it constitutes. But that is different from imposing those values as doctrines. Abortion, obviously, is qualitatively different because it is a universal question of how a moral society treats dependent life.
<p>
The other issue is liberty. Two points should be made here. First, we sometimes forget that under the plan of God, mankind was utterly free, except for eating of the tree of good and evil. As Pope John Paul II emphasizes, freedom and virtue depend upon there being an objective order, which we can accept or not. Without an objective moral order, there is no true freedom, for it has nothing to measure itself against. Second, modern natural law theory must acknowledge the great advances in the justification for liberty that 18th century natural rights theory made. Modern natural law theory, in its mature form, finds the freedom of the human individual rooted in the good, and holds that political authority is contingent upon that human freedom.
<p>
But what natural law offers in addition is that the free, flourishing individual prospers in his social relations, most especially in the family. What Adam Smith and John Locke presumed in their vaguely perceived notions of natural law and in the social experience of the Enlightenment was that these social relations would flourish of themselves. For the most part they were right. But we have learned in the two centuries past, and especially in this country, that those relations, the family, are much more fragile than we imagined and that for true liberty to be enjoyed, such relations need to be fostered and nurtured. For natural law not only judges what human laws ought not to be passed, but also illuminates the benign face of the law: It looks to those laws that ought to be enacted to assist human persons in the flourishing of their free individual personalities. Natural law is not only imperative; it is aspirational.
<P>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
When a philosophy -- even one like natural law -- is in the ascendancy, intellectual fatigue, as well as impatience with the imperfections any human system has, slowly brings on criticism and perhaps even rejection. But when order threatens to break down altogether, when chaos looms, then the mind reaches back to the stability of principle. Man cannot abide error for too long, for error produces a disintegration, a disorder of the soul, and a disorder of society. We can live a complex life; we can live a life of contradictions; but we cannot live an absurd life. That is our nature.
<p>
Whenever subjective relativism and objective truth have come into contest, whenever the choice is one or the other, man will ultimately opt for the truth, no matter how discomfiting it may be. Just look at whom we choose for heroes:
<p>
Is it Antigone or Creon?
<p>
Socrates or Alcibiades?
<p>
Is it Ruth, who embraces the One God despite the humiliation it brings, or her sister-in-law Orpah, who remains comfortable with the pagans?
<p>
Is it Lincoln or Douglas?
<p>
Solzhenitsyn or Brezhnev?
<p>
Jesus or Pilate?
<P>
Only when faith and reason are rejoined in mutually respecting friendship and are cognizant of liberty can the bonds of civil society, of civilization itself, be renewed. That moment may be upon us once again. May it come soon.

<title>The Chemical Weapons Convention: Unverifiable, Unenforceable, and a Burden to Business - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION:
UNVERIFIABLE, UNENFORCEABLE, AND A BURDEN TO BUSINESS</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>
<br>
Executive Memorandum No. 460<br>
September 12, 1996 <br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Later this week, the United States Senate will vote on ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).  The CWC is a multilateral treaty that would bar the production and stockpiling of chemical weapons by the countries that ratify it.  Given its sweeping provisions, the ratification of the CWC carries important implications for U.S. policies on  arms control, non-proliferation, defense, regulation, and above all, national security.  As a result, Senators need to consider the CWC carefully and not assume that it deserves support merely because it professes to outlaw chemical weapons.  In fact, the CWC will fail to achieve its stated goal of a global ban on chemical weapons.  Moreover, the CWC will make America more vulnerable to chemical weapon attack in the future while imposing an unwarranted and costly burden on American business. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	If ratified, the Chemical Weapons Convention would:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Increase the risk of chemical weapons being used.</b>  By undermining the U.S. chemical deterrent, the CWC may increase the likelihood that chemical weapons would be used.  The experience of World War II shows that an aggressor possessing chemical weapons will hesitate to use them to attack a country that also possesses such weapons. If the U.S. bans all of its chemical weapons, as required by the CWC, outlaw states that retain them will have a military advantage over the U.S. and other countries that have banned them. This military advantage increases the likelihood that chemical weapons could be used against the U.S.
 <p>
 <li><b> Be unverifiable.</b> Despite elaborate and burdensome verification provisions, compliance with the CWC cannot be adequately verified.  At a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, then-Director of Central Intelligence James Woolsey warned that "the chemical weapons problem is so difficult from an intelligence perspective that I cannot state that we have high confidence in our ability to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale."
 <p>
 <li><b> Be unenforceable.</b>  Violations of the CWC are likely to go unpunished. If a violation were to occur, the United Nations Security Council would have to impose penalties severe enough to change the behavior of an outlaw state.  But the five permanent members of the Security Council can veto any enforcement resolution lodged against them or their friends.  China and Russia, for example, can simply veto resolutions imposing sanctions on them if they disagree with other Security Council members.
 <p>
 <li><b> Impose a heavy regulatory burden on U.S. businesses.</b>  There are over 7,700 production facilities in the U.S. that may be subject to CWC-related reporting and inspection requirements.  The direct cost to business could be as high as $200 million annually, while indirect costs could run into billions of dollars a year.
 <p>
<li><b> Increase the risk of proliferation of chemical weapons.</b>  Article XI of the CWC requires cooperation among nations in the peaceful uses of chemicals.  In many respects, this provision resembles the 1950s Atoms for Peace arrangement to foster the peaceful uses of nuclear power.  This is the approach to arms control and trade that has been used to justify Russia's sale of nuclear reactors to Iran. The last thing the world needs is a "Poison for Peace" program that helps spread chemical weapons around the world, as the Atoms for Peace did for nuclear reactors to Iran and North Korea.
<p>
 The chief lobbying group for the chemical industry, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA), supports ratification of the CWC, and the prospect for increased sales of dangerous chemicals to countries like Iran may be the reason why. CMA member companies that produce and export chemicals would be subject to stricter limits on exports if the U.S. does not ratify the CWC. It would be sad indeed if the CMA were putting its own economic interest ahead of the nation's security in supporting ratification.
 <p>
<li><b> Not enhance U.S. security.</b>  By making arms control an end in itself, the CWC will not protect U.S. national security.  Arms control is only one of several means for achieving the goal of national security. America needs the additional tools of deterrence, defenses, and even offensive military operations. It makes no sense for America to give up its chemical weapons if other nations still possess them.
<p>
<li><b> Be inconsistent with America's global responsibilities.</b> The CWC, by treating all nations alike, fails to acknowledge America's special role in global security. Superpower status imposes important global responsibilities which the U.S. can fulfill only by maintaining armed forces capable of projecting overwhelming force around the globe. Because America has these special responsibilities, it is treated as an exceptional case under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty regarding the possession of nuclear weapons.  The same principle should apply to America's chemical weapons arsenal.
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Advising and consenting to the ratification of treaties is one of the Senate's most solemn constitutional responsibilities.  This is particularly so when the treaty under consideration has profound implications for the security of the nation.  Given all that is stake with the CWC, Senators should scrutinize carefully all the provisions and implications of the treaty before they vote.  This will lead to an inescapable conclusion: Ratifying the CWC would leave America less secure and would pose unreasonable costs on American businesses.

<title>Government's Hidden Tax: Time to Account for the Cost of Regulation - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>GOVERNMENT'S HIDDEN TAX: TIME TO ACCOUNT FOR THE COST OF REGULATION</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/antonel.htm">Angela Antonelli</a><br>
Deputy Director for Economic Policy Studies<sup>1</sup><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 459<br>
September 10, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Senate is expected soon to consider <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/z?cp104:hr660.104:">H.R. 3756</a>, the Treasury and postal appropriations bill, which includes funding for the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB). On July 23, the Senate Appropriations Committee adopted an amendment -- Section 645, offered by Senator Ted Stevens (R-AK) -- requiring OMB to prepare an accounting statement that estimates the cumulative costs and benefits of federal regulatory programs. OMB already is responsible for reviewing regulatory actions to ensure that they are consistent with the Administration's regulatory principles and agenda.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While there is much debate about federal taxes, spending, and the need to balance the budget, considerably less is known and understood about the benefits and burdens of regulation. Unlike federal tax and spending programs, no comprehensive cost accounting system exists for regulation. But regulatory costs -- $677 billion in 1996 -- are nearly one-half the cost of direct taxation. And the economic impact is significant; according to one estimate, federal regulations cause $1.3 trillion in U.S. economic activity to be lost each year. Just as the annual federal budget allows policymakers and the public to debate and decide what programs to support and which ones to scale back and eliminate, information on regulatory costs and benefits would help them to determine what regulations do the most good for the money spent, set regulatory priorities accordingly, and minimize the burden on the economy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>A Good First Step.</b> Under the Stevens proposal, OMB would be required to submit to Congress by September 30, 1997, a report on the cumulative costs and benefits of federal regulatory programs. OMB also must report on the effect of federal rules, both on the private sector and on the federal government, and provide estimates of the costs and benefits of rules costing more than $100 million annually. The public would have an opportunity to comment on the OMB report before it is submitted to Congress. OMB also would have to offer recommendations to Congress and the President about how to reform regulatory programs that are not a "sound use of national resources."  This is a sensible first step toward improving oversight and promoting greater efficiency throughout the federal regulatory system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This proposal will be criticized by federal regulators and politicians. Regulation is one of the most politically convenient ways to carry out public policy because it typically does not require substantial, direct taxation or government spending. This is particularly appealing in an era of federal budgetary restraint. The Clinton Administration has put at least 10,000 new pages of federal rules on the books since 1993. But how much has this cost, and what did the American people get for their money?  Because regulators gain power by regulating as much as possible, with little to stop them from regulating as if it cost nothing, opponents will use the same misleading rhetoric against this proposal that they used to defeat a far more comprehensive regulatory reform bill in 1995. The following three myths are typical:
<p>
<b>MYTH #1: It is doubtful that reliable estimates of costs and benefits can be developed.
<p>
<ul>REALITY:</b> There is no dearth of methodological tools available for estimating the costs and benefits of federal regulations. The Department of Commerce regularly surveys business establishments to collect information on expenditures caused by particular regulatory programs. Since 1981, every President has required federal agencies to consider costs and benefits in their regulatory decisionmaking. To assist them, OMB developed guidelines for such analysis. Even though federal agencies try to avoid any effort to measure the costs and benefits of their actions, dozens of these analyses have been done over the last 15 years. Between 1990 and 1995, for example, EPA did at least 70 rule-specific cost-benefit analyses. Ironically, in 1993, the Clinton Administration removed hundreds of rules from OMB review, de-emphasizing the need for cost-benefit analysis.
</ul><p>
<b>MYTH #2: Any attempt to measure the costs and benefits of regulations will consume a significant amount of new resources.
<p>
<ul>REALITY:</b> With more than 130,000 federal regulators spending more than $14 billion annually to develop and enforce regulations, how can more be needed?  The Clinton Administration itself recognizes that federal agencies -- which have been required to consider costs and benefits of regulatory actions since 1981 -- "are the repositories of significant substantive expertise and experience...."  In addition, OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which reviews rules before they are issued, has a fiscal 1996 budget of more than $5 million and a staff of about 30 analysts and economists with years of experience reviewing and evaluating agency cost-benefit analyses. During the Bush Administration, OMB reported on the aggregate costs of regulations in a publication that later was stopped by the Clinton Administration; no such information has been published since then.<sup>2</sup>  OMB already is in an excellent position to work with other agencies to prepare this statement, but Congress must demand that it be done and that it be made available to the public.
</ul><p>
<b>MYTH #3: This is just the first step in an effort to justify a "roll back" of important public health, safety, and environmental protections.
<p>
<ul>REALITY:</b> The opposite would be true. Strengthening the use of cost-benefit analysis in regulatory decisionmaking would mean higher levels of protection. A recent Harvard study estimated that current regulation of health risks is so inefficient that for the same investment of resources, we could save an additional 636,000 years of life--60,200 premature deaths every year-- simply by changing our priorities.
<p></ul>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration and its allies in Congress already are on record as supporting regulatory cost accounting as part of more comprehensive regulatory reform legislation in 1995. In addition, President Clinton's Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review requires federal agencies to "assess the costs and benefits" of regulations. The Stevens amendment simply suggests that the numbers should be added up so the American people can have some idea of the kinds of regulatory decisions their government is making and how good a job federal regulators are doing.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is a good first step, and Congress must go further and implement a regulatory budget like the one proposed in <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3277:">H.R. 3277</a> by Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX). A regulatory budget would force federal regulators to operate within limits, much as an agency's fiscal budget does. Both Congress and the President would be accountable to the public for making sure that economic resources are allocated in a manner that produces the greatest benefit to society.

<title>OPIC-ing the Taxpayer's Pocket - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><font size="+2">OPIC</font>-ING THE TAXPAYER'S POCKET</h3>
By Brett D. Schaefer<br>
Research Assistant<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 458<br>
September 3, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

When it returns from its August recess, the House of Representatives is expected to consider H.R. 3759, the Exports, Jobs, and Growth Act of 1996, which authorizes appropriations for the Trade and Development Agency (TDA) and export programs of the International Trade Administration (ITA) for fiscal years 1997 and 1998. But the heart of the Act extends the authority of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) to engage in new commitments through 2001 and doubles the statutory limits on OPIC's insurance and financing activities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

OPIC insures overseas investments by U.S. businesses against loss to expropriation, political instability, and unforeseen contingencies, such as currency inconvertibility. It also issues investment guarantees and direct loans to U.S. businesses for international investments. The agency was created by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to complement the federal government's trade policy and development activities. Specifically, OPIC is charged with increasing U.S. exports and assisting American private capital in the development of less developed countries (LDCs) and countries in transition from non-market to market economies.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Strangely, no one seems to notice the irony of using a government-run program to encourage other countries to end government interference in their economies. Congress should not expand OPIC's funding and authority. OPIC is another form of corporate welfare and accomplishes nothing that cannot be performed better in the private sector, without risk to U.S. taxpayers.
<p><ul>
<li><b>OPIC could cost U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars.</b> Proponents insist that OPIC makes a profit and actually decreases the deficit. But while OPIC did make $167 million in profits last year, largely from revenues of U.S. treasury bonds, this figure does not take into account the amount that U.S. taxpayers are obligated to pay as underwriters of OPIC-insured investments. In 1995 alone, OPIC issued policies covering $8.6 billion of investment. The accumulated value of insured investments is many times this amount. American taxpayers typically are liable for 90 percent of the insured investment in the event the policy must be paid.
<p>
Additionally, beginning in 1987, OPIC began dabbling in venture capital, one of the riskiest areas of the financial industry. Starting with the Africa Growth Fund, OPIC began creating numerous funds to encourage investment in less developed countries. These funds have several things in common: They are involved in the world's riskiest markets, are subject to little control or oversight by OPIC, and rarely turn a profit. These funds also have been growing precipitously, from $70 million at the beginning of the Clinton Administration to over $814 million last spring.
<p>
<li><b>OPIC "socializes" risk while privatizing profits. </b>Foreign investment is an important avenue for development in LDCs. U.S. foreign direct investment totaled $612 billion in 1994, with nearly one-third invested in the developing world, a total far exceeding the U.S. foreign aid budget. OPIC insured a very modest portion of this investment; the rest was insured by private businesses. Yet business and political advocates continue to argue that developing nations would not receive foreign direct investment without OPIC. The truth is that OPIC has become a corporate welfare program that subsidizes investment insurance and loans for private businesses. <i>Fortune</i> 500 companies realize large profits while the taxpayer buys the insurance to offset their investment risk in less developed countries.
<p>
<li><b>OPIC's development agenda has been ignored.</b> H.R. 3759 uses export promotion to justify increasing OPIC's insurance and lending authority, but discussion of OPIC's second mission -- its development agenda -- is curiously absent. This is because OPIC actually works against the best interests of LDCs. Representative Sonny Callahan (R-AL) claims that "as long as these countries, such as India, do not have a track record of adherence to free market principles, OPIC is needed."  In fact, however, OPIC is not needed. It encourages countries to maintain harmful economic policies, such as refusing to guarantee property rights, engaging in harmful regulatory policies, demanding oversight of investments, and insisting on government ownership of whole sectors of the economy. It simply is not wise to engage in business in such an environment. To attract foreign investment, countries need to enact free-market economic policies. Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Chile, and the Czech Republic have done so with marvelous success. However, OPIC continues to encourage investment in less developed countries regardless of their economic climate.
<p>
<li><b>OPIC does not promote exports effectively.</b> Not one country receiving OPIC insurance policies or loans is among the top 10 destinations of U.S. exports, despite the fact that four of the top ten (Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore) are developing nations. OPIC focuses on countries that cannot attract foreign investment on their own because of their poor economic policies and dangerous instability. Instead of letting these countries reap what they sow, OPIC rewards them with investments underwritten by American taxpayers.
<p>
Additionally, OPIC employs many restrictions on its lending and insuring practices that have nothing to do with the viability of the investment. For example, many countries that fit the normal criteria for OPIC political insurance and loans are ineligible because they do not meet U.S. standards in such areas as human rights, environmental concerns, and workers' rights. Countries that are excluded from OPIC lending for these reasons include South Korea, China, Hong Kong, and Mexico. In other words, political correctness is more important than maximizing the return on taxpayers' money.
<p>
<li><b>OPIC competes with the private sector.</b> One of the justifications for OPIC is that there supposedly are no alternatives in the private sector. But numerous private-sector businesses specialize in political risk insurance, including American International Group (AIG), EXEL Ltd., and Mid Ocean Ltd. OPIC competes directly with these private-sector institutions and offers advantages beyond the resources of privately held companies. OPIC political risk insurance is backed by the U.S. government, whose resources far exceed those of a private insurer. OPIC offers subsidized insurance premiums at rates far below market rates. OPIC policies extend for 20 years, while the private sector in most instances cannot issue policies for longer than three or seven years for reasons of risk. OPIC continues to compete unfairly with the private sector, despite the fact that its authorizing language instructs it specifically to promote the development of private-sector political risk insurers.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

At the very least, OPIC should be required to limit its activities to those which complement rather than undermine the activities of private-sector political risk insurers. OPIC, for example, could supplement private political risk insurance by issuing policies for the time window beyond that typically offered by the private sector. Ideally, however, OPIC should be eliminated and its commitments privatized.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Proponents claim that OPIC cannot easily be privatized. To bolster this claim, they cite an independent study which estimated that privatization would cost American taxpayers between $500 million and $700 million. This is a large sum, but it pales in comparison to the potential cost to U.S. taxpayers if major economic or political upheavals occur in areas of the world with OPIC-insured projects. The potential liability to the U.S. is in the billions -- in effect, a global version of the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s, for which the American taxpayer is still paying.

The U.S. government should not intrude in areas where the private sector is willing and able to do the job, can do it more efficiently, and can do it without forcing American taxpayers to underwrite risky ventures. Encouraging foreign investment is an admirable goal, but it should not come in the form of government subsidies to private U.S. firms -- subsidies that discourage economic reform in the target countries and put the American taxpayer at risk.

School choice for poor children is likely to be an issue this year in many state and congressional races. The idea that low-income parents should be able to select the schools -- public or private -- they think best for their children strikes at the very heart of America's educational <i>status quo</i>. Lawmakers and parents therefore need to pay close attention to the quality of academic evaluations of school choice programs, including the samples used and methodologies employed. Evaluations of the Milwaukee, Wisconsin, school choice experiment are a case in point.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1990, Milwaukee instituted the nation's first publicly funded school choice program, giving low-income parents vouchers to send their children to private schools. In February 1996, data from the Milwaukee school choice experiment were made available. Professors Jay P. Greene of the University of Houston Center for Public Policy and Paul E. Peterson of Harvard University's Program in Education Policy and Governance have conducted a detailed assessment of this information.<sup>1</sup>  Their study, released at a conference this summer, reveals that:
<p><ul>
<li> The reading scores of choice students in their third and fourth years were, on average, from 3 to 5 percentile points higher, respectively, than those of comparable low-income public school students.
<p>
<li> Math scores, on average, were 5 and 12 percentile points higher for the third and fourth years, respectively.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The implications of these findings are extremely significant. As Greene and Peterson note, "If similar success could be achieved for all minority students nationwide, it could close the gap separating white and minority test scores by somewhere between one-third and more than one-half."<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Before the release of the Greene and Peterson study, the Milwaukee school choice program had been evaluated each year by the man who designed it: political science professor John Witte of the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Witte had concluded that "This school experiment [has] not yet led to more effective schools.... Choice creates enormous enthusiasm among parents... but student achievement fails to rise."<sup>3</sup>  Because Witte and his fellow researchers did not release their data for secondary analysis by other members of the academic community until this year, their evaluation was the sole source of information on the test performance of Milwaukee school choice students. Many academic specialists, foundations, and policymakers therefore had concluded that while school choice clearly satisfied parents, it was not effective in improving the education of low-income central-city students.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Based on their own examination of the data, however, Greene and Peterson found that the statistical model used by Witte and his colleagues failed to replicate the "character" of the MSCP experiment. The most significant flaw was that Witte's group compared choice school students with a much less disadvantaged cross-section of Milwaukee public school students. Witte had compared the choice students to a general sample of public school students, a group which was significantly different in several ways. For example, the choice students were more likely to come from households headed by poor, minority, single mothers, making any comparison between them and the public school sample misleading.<sup>4</sup>  Correcting for these errors, Greene, Peterson, and their colleagues at the University of Houston and Harvard designed their own study -- a study which confirms a growing collection of evidence showing that private school vouchers are the key to educational success for students who are financially trapped in failing inner-city public school systems.
<p>
<b>HOW THE HOUSTON-HARVARD STUDY WAS DONE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Greene and Peterson designed an analysis that would correct for the methodological errors of the Witte study. The difference between their conclusions and Witte's is the result of a scientific methodology made more rigorous in several ways. Among them:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Random assignment of students to the test and control groups.</b>
<p>
The Houston-Harvard analysis compared the choice students with students who applied to the choice program but were not admitted. The mandate imposed on the Milwaukee voucher program by the Wisconsin state legislature required Milwaukee's choice schools, if oversubscribed, to admit applicants at random; the result was two randomly selected groups of students: those who were chosen to participate in the program and those who were not. The system thus set up a unique opportunity for researchers to compare students in the choice program with public school students from otherwise eligible families whose parents had made an effort to seek an education for them at a private school. This improved "control" for the extent to which families value education and desire to participate in the program meant that any differences in outcome could reasonably be attributed to the experimental condition of choice. 
<p>
<li><b> Controlling for grade, year, and school.</b>
<p>
Students seeking to participate in the Milwaukee choice program applied each year for a place in a particular grade in a particular school (with spots, as indicated above, to be assigned randomly if the program was oversubscribed). The evaluation data allowed the Houston-Harvard researchers to control for both the grade to which a student applied and the year of application. Although the specific schools to which students applied were not included in the data, researchers were able to control for that variable by taking into account the ethnicity of applicants. Over 80 percent of the choice students attended one of three schools; and virtually all of the students who applied to one of these schools were Hispanic, while virtually all who applied to the other two were African American.<sup>5</sup>  The Witte study had failed to take into account that the selection of students was random only by grade, school, and year.
<p>
<li><b> Measuring academic effects as cumulative.</b>
<p>
Rather than merely measure the changes in test scores from year to year as Witte did, the Houston-Harvard researchers measured the cumulative effect of the choice program on test scores for each child for the entire time the child was in the program. Controlling for gender, the test scores of choice students were compared with those of "non-selected" students who had applied the same year for the same grade and were of the same ethnicity. The effects of choice schools on test performance were small during the first and second years; during the third and fourth, however, choice students made substantial gains. According to statistical tests, positive results of this magnitude would not appear had Milwaukee choice schools had no effect on academic performance. One of the most egregious errors of the Witte study was that it controlled for a student's test score in the prior year, in effect controlling for the outcomes of the choice program and incorrectly assuming that students learn at uniform rates.
<p>
<li><b>Testing for possible errors due to limited data.</b>
<p>
As Professor Witte states, "In terms of demographic characteristics, non-selected... students [and choice students] came from very similar homes....  They were also similar in terms of prior achievement scores and parental involvement."<sup>6</sup>  However, the data available to the Houston-Harvard researchers covered only 76.2 percent of the selected students and 58.7 percent of the non-selected students. To ensure that these two percentages accurately represented the selected and non-selected groups overall, the Houston-Harvard researchers made several additional analyses:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Family background.</b> Controlling for family background was difficult. Both test and background questionnaire data were available for only 36.7 percent of the families of selected students and 21.8 percent of the families of non-selected students. Even among those parents who did return a questionnaire, many did not respond to all of the items. Trying to balance between controlling for additional factors and preserving the size of the sample, the Houston-Harvard team controlled for family income and the mother's education. Those factors were chosen for two reasons: 1) Past academic research shows that these factors strongly affect a child's educational performance, and 2) most parents who returned questionnaires responded to those particular questions. Adding these two variables to the analysis decreased the sample size but changed the results very little. This confirmed that there were no significant differences in family background between those for whom complete background data were available and those for whom they were not.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Prior test scores.</b> Two groups randomly assigned to two categories, as was the case in this study, can be assumed to be similar. Thus, the Houston-Harvard study did not control for test scores prior to the Milwaukee program. Because of missing data, however, the researchers checked and found that at the time these two groups applied to the Milwaukee choice schools, the available data showed that they had essentially the same test scores. In fact, those who were not selected scored one percentile point higher in both reading and math. Although the sample size for this analysis was reduced by the fact that test scores at the time of application were available only for a limited number of applicants, a statistical analysis was run on the figures that were available. With only one exception -- the fourth year reading scores, which had to be based on only 26 observations -- the results controlling for prior test scores were not substantially different from those found in the main analysis. This confirmed that there were no significant academic differences between those students whose prior test scores were reported and those whose scores were not reported.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Potential "selection effects."</b>  The Houston-Harvard study's main analysis clearly revealed statistically significant effects in the third and fourth years of a student's program. This presents two possibilities: 1) Either students benefit in measurable ways from the choice experience only after participating in the program for three or more years, or 2) students remain in the program for three to four years only if they are benefiting from it. To determine which was the case, the Houston-Harvard researchers analyzed the first and second year scores of students for whom test results were also available in years three and four. The effects of the first two years were no different from the effects for all first and second year students. This would imply that the positive effects of school choice accumulate over time and are not due to different student retention rates.
</ul>
<p>
<b>OTHER RELEVANT STUDIES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Houston-Harvard analysis is more methodologically sound than previous studies of the Milwaukee school choice program. More important, its basic conclusions are supported by a growing body of research on the value of private schools among urban poor and minority children.
In 1990, the Rand Corporation of Santa Monica, California, examined the academic performance of children in New York City's public and Catholic school systems. The results were startling: Some 95 percent of Catholic high school students graduated, for example, while only 25 percent made it out of the public schools. Similarly, 75 percent of Catholic students took the Scholastic Aptitude Test, but only 16 percent took it in the public schools.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A 1982 study headed by education scholar James Coleman of the University of Chicago found that students in Catholic schools were one grade level ahead of their public school counterparts in mathematics, reading, and vocabulary.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1993, the New York State Department of Education found that Catholic schools with 81 percent to 100 percent minority composition outscored New York City public schools with the same percentage of minority enrollment in Grade 3 reading (+17 percent), Grade 3 mathematics (+10 percent), Grade 5 writing (+6 percent), Grade 6 reading (+10 percent), and Grade 6 mathematics (+11 per cent).<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although the 1993 New York State Department of Education study also found that Catholic and public schools have similar percentages of students from troubled families with low incomes, Anthony Bryk from the University of Chicago reports that Catholic schools expel far fewer children.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Derek Neal, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, in a study conducted for the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts, found that among urban blacks and Hispanics nationwide, the probability of high school graduation rises from 62 percent to 88 percent when a student is moved from a public to a Catholic high school. The probability of college graduation for these children rises from 11 percent to 27 percent. In addition, when compared with their public school counterparts, minority students in urban Catholic schools can expect roughly 8 percent higher wages in the future simply because they are more likely to complete high school and college.<sup>11</sup>

<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
School choice is becoming increasingly popular, and polls show it is most popular among urban African Americans --  the very group served by a program like Milwaukee's. Because black parents are less satisfied with public schools, they want an alternative. A recent study by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington-based think tank that specializes in research on African Americans, found that only 5.7 percent of African Americans rated their local public schools "excellent," compared with 19.9 percent of the general population. Conversely, 16.5 percent of the black sample rated their schools "poor," compared with only 7.4 percent of the general population.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Contrary to the claims of the education establishment, choice does not leave children of poor families in failing schools. Rather, it is their ticket out. Schools of choice have proven their ability -- and their desire -- to improve the academic outcomes of poor children. Recently, Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York offered to take the lowest performing 5 percent of students in New York City's public schools into New York's Catholic schools, where they can succeed. This also would be a huge financial advantage for taxpayers. New York's Catholic schools educate students at about a third of the cost of public schools. A 5 percent transfer would save New York City over $250 million a year.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The academic success of Milwaukee choice students, as well as other students who have been fortunate enough to escape failing urban schools, is now a matter of record. It is time for state legislators and Members of Congress to give other lower-income children the same opportunity.

<title>Tougher U.S. Action Needed to Punish Saddam Hussein - Heritage</title>

<h3>TOUGHER U.S. ACTION NEEDED TO PUNISH SADDAM HUSSEIN</h3>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration's cruise missile strikes against Iraq this week in retaliation for Saddam Hussein's military offensive against the Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq are too little too late. The U.S. needs to take firm, consistent, and systematic action if it is to rebuff Saddam's latest aggression, undermine his brutal regime, and undercut his ability to threaten his neighbors and repress his own people. In responding to the immediate crisis, the U.S. needs to keep sight of its long-term goals -- forcing Saddam's downfall and diminishing Iraq's threats to regional stability and the flow of oil.
<p>

<b>WHAT IS AT STAKE?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Saddam's invasion of the Kurdish enclave is not just a blow aimed at Kurdish and other Iraqi opposition forces; it is a clear test of the U.S.-led coalition's determination to contain Iraq. Saddam knows that the Kurdish cause is unpopular in Turkey, which is fighting its own Kurdish separatists, and among America's Arab allies, who wish to preserve Iraq as a counterweight to Iran. Saddam hopes to drive a wedge between the U.S. and other members of the anti-Iraq coalition by portraying his aggression as a defensive move against Iranian-supported Kurdish separatists.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Iraq's latest provocation also is an inevitable consequence of an aggressive dictator's perception of U.S. weakness. For three-and-a-half years, the Clinton Administration has conveyed an image of weakness and indecision in defense and foreign policy, particularly regarding Iraq. Clinton came into office severely underestimating the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. One week before his inauguration, Clinton offered Saddam the chance to let bygones be bygones in a <i>New York Times</i> interview: "I'm a Baptist; I believe in deathbed conversions."  Clinton proclaimed that he was "not obsessed with Iraq," as if bilateral tensions were a product of George Bush's personal pique toward Saddam. The Clinton Administration softened U.S. policy toward Iraq and dropped the Bush Administration's insistence that Saddam be ousted before the U.S. would agree to lift the United Nations embargo on trade with Iraq.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When Iraq launched a failed attempt to assassinate former President Bush in Kuwait in April 1993, the Administration equivocated before launching cruise missile attacks against the Baghdad headquarters of Iraq's foreign intelligence agency on June 27, 1993. This attack was a mere slap on the wrist for such a brazen terrorist plot against a former American President. The limited size and symbolic nature of the U.S. reprisal -- 24 cruise  missiles fired at an empty building in the middle of the night -- probably did little to strengthen U.S. deterrence against Saddam's aggression.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More recently, the Clinton Administration has failed to respond to other Iraqi provocations. Since April, Baghdad repeatedly has blocked the efforts of U.N. arms inspectors to monitor compliance with Iraq's obligations to dismantle its nuclear, chemical, biological, and long-range missile programs. Yet the Administration has done little except to pass the problem off to a listless U.N. Security Council. In May, Iraqi opposition leaders reportedly warned U.S. officials that the situation in Iraqi Kurdistan was deteriorating and required urgent American attention. But the Administration was asleep at the switch and failed to resolve diplomatically the growing tensions between Kurdish factions that erupted in open warfare last month. One faction, the Kurdish Democratic Party, then went so far as to ally itself with Saddam, who has ordered the deaths of thousands of Kurds, in despair over its failure to receive significant material or diplomatic support from Washington.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Saddam has probed aggressively for U.S. weakness, again and again. What is at stake in the current crisis is not just the future of Iraq's Kurds, but the ability of the U.S. and its allies to deter future Iraqi aggression.
<p>
<b>THE U.S. RESPONSE: WHAT NEXT?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration has responded correctly with military force, the only language Saddam Hussein seems to understand. But the limited cruise missile strikes launched so far make sense only as the opening phase of a robust and systematic air campaign to punish Saddam's aggression, weaken his military threat to his neighbors, and deter future Iraqi aggression. Incremental pinprick reprisals are unlikely to make Saddam blink. Such attacks more likely will encourage him to escalate the crisis even further.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To drive home to Saddam the heavy price that he must pay for aggression, the Clinton Administration should hit the Iraqi dictator where he will feel it most. The U.S. should launch cruise missile and air strikes against the security forces that prop up Saddam's dictatorship -- the Republican Guard and secret police -- as well as against Iraq's military assets and military industries. The U.S. goal should be to punish Saddam and his closest supporters while undermining his ability to maintain himself in power, repress the opposition, and threaten Iraq's neighbors. The Administration also should seize the opportunity to destroy suspected Iraqi weapons manufacturing and storage facilities that were barred to U.N. arms inspectors. This will make the Iraqis think twice before illegally interfering with such inspections in the future.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Administration's decision to expand the southern "no fly" zone from the 32nd parallel to the 33rd is wise because it tightens the constraints on Iraq's air force and diminishes Iraq's military threat to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Moreover, it drives home to Saddam and the Iraqi military that the U.S. has the will to impose significant costs for aggression on a broad range of fronts, including imposing humiliating restrictions on Iraq's military operations. This will increase the incentives for a military coup against Saddam by disgruntled army officers concerned with rebuilding Iraq's military strength, especially if U.S. air attacks weaken the Republican Guard, which is an elite military force that is loyal to Saddam.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Washington must insist on the immediate and total withdrawal of Iraqi troops from the Kurdish areas. But the U.S. should not focus exclusively on compelling an Iraqi withdrawal. Saddam could pull back his troops a few miles and still use his feared secret police to maintain control of the areas he has occupied. He also could easily move his troops back into the area in the future. Moreover, focusing primarily on the Kurdish issue will only help Saddam split the already weakened anti-Iraq coalition. The issue for the U.S. is not so much protecting the Kurds from Iraqi aggression as diminishing Saddam's ability to engage in <i>any</i> act of military aggression with impunity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If Saddam continues his aggression in Kurdistan or engages in new provocations elsewhere, the Clinton Administration should mount a methodical and sustained air campaign against military, military industry, and secret police targets throughout Iraq as long as Saddam's troops remain in the Kurdish enclave. The Administration also should mount a high-priority diplomatic offensive to end the factional fighting between the rival Kurdish groups. But the U.S. should avoid basing its policy exclusively on the narrow issues of protecting the Kurds or enforcing U.N. resolutions. This would only play into Saddam's hands by allowing him to retain the initiative. U.S. policy should be focused on punishing Saddam, deterring future aggression, and destroying his ability to threaten more important U.S. interests in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.

<title>What the 104th Congress Did to Combat Crime -- Heritage</title>

<h3>WHAT THE 104TH CONGRESS DID TO COMBAT CRIME</h3>




By <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert E. Moffit</a><br>
Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies<sup>1</sup><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 117<br>
August 19, 1996<br>

</center>



<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The 104th Congress has delivered on its promise to enact specific measures to improve federal crime-fighting efforts and help state and local officials combat violent crime. Most of these anti-crime measures were initiated by conservative Members of the House of Representatives, based on promises made to the taxpayers in the Contract With America, and later incorporated into bills passed by the Senate. They include a solid program of truth in sentencing for violent criminals, effective death penalty provisions, restrictions on the power of federal judges to put criminals back on the streets, a reordering of federal funding from social programs to law enforcement efforts (including prison construction and police funding), and victim restitution.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two major vehicles for enactment of most of these measures were the comprehensive Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (S. 735), sponsored by former Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS), and the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019). While more can be done at the federal level, more also needs to be done by state and local officials who bear the primary responsibility for fighting violent street crime.<sup>2</sup>  Nonetheless, the legislative record of the 104th Congress in combating crime is impressive and far-reaching.<p><b>KEEPING THE BAD GUYS OFF THE STREETS</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first duty of government is to protect the people. As a short-term measure, the most effective way to do this is to put more violent criminals in prison and keep them there. In fulfilling this duty, Congress enacted the following measures into law:
<p>
<b>Violent Criminal Incarceration Act of 1995 (H.R. 667).</b> A major failure of the criminal justice system has been the inability or unwillingness to identify, target, and incarcerate violent criminals for long periods of time. Violent criminals typically serve only one-third of their sentences.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under this new law, states will receive Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grants for the construction of prisons on condition that they keep violent criminals locked up for at least 85 percent of their sentences. Already, more than 20 states have adopted such truth-in-sentencing laws,<sup>3</sup> and it is likely that many more will adopt such measures to keep violent criminals behind bars and off the streets.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The bill passed the House of Representatives on February 10, 1995; was incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019); and was signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995.</b> During the past three decades, federal judges have seized control of state and even local prisons, dictating conditions of confinement, promoting more comfortable living conditions for convicts, and releasing inmates as a way to ease overcrowding. Federal judges have been releasing inmates without finding a violation of a specific federal or constitutional right. Over 500 municipalities and 1,200 state prisons have been operating under judicial orders or consent decrees. Under Section 3626 of the 1994 federal crime bill, Congress attempted to stop lenient federal judges from imposing caps on the number of prisoners that can be incarcerated at a particular prison,<sup>4</sup> a judicial practice that has resulted in the release of violent criminals before their terms have been served.<sup>5</sup>  Liberal lawyers and judges quickly found ways to get around this provision.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Prison Litigation Reform Act, originally sponsored by Representative Bill McCollum (R-FL), closes existing loopholes by imposing tighter restrictions on federal court-ordered prison population caps. It requires a three-judge panel to find that prison crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a prisoner's legal or constitutional rights. Moreover, it requires judges to find that there is no other remedy available before they impose a prison cap. State or local officials responsible for the prosecution or custody of criminals who could be released because of judicially imposed prison caps are granted standing to sue. The Prison Litigation Reform Act also specifies that court-ordered relief from incarceration is to be based on specific violations of a prisoner's constitutional rights and that federal judges must give substantial weight in their decisions to any adverse impact of such relief on public safety or on the operation of the criminal justice system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure also reduces the burden of frivolous prisoner lawsuits, which include a wide range of often strange and bizarre complaints. Inmate lawsuits are estimated to comprise 25 percent of all civil suits filed in federal courts, and state officials are burdened with responding to them. Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon has compiled a "top ten" list of the most frivolous of these lawsuits, including complaints against officials who do not provide salad bars and brunches on weekends and holidays, officials who do not pay food allowances of $26 a day to inmates traveling from prison to the courthouse, and officials who do not permit male inmates to wear such female apparel as bras, panties, lipstick, and artificial fingernails.<sup>6</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under the new law, federal courts are authorized to dismiss frivolous or malicious suits "without hearing."  Moreover, all administrative solutions within the corrections system must be exhausted before a lawsuit can be filed in federal court. The measure also limits the lawyers' fees awarded to successful inmate plaintiffs. In the past, trial lawyers have received as much as $300 per hour for representing prisoners.<sup>7</sup>  Under this Act, fees will be based on an hourly rate no higher than that for other court-appointed counsel, and any monetary damages awarded to a prisoner in a successful suit against state prison authorities must be applied to outstanding restitution owed to the victims of his crimes.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Prison Litigation Reform Act was incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019) and signed into law as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>To disapprove certain sentencing guideline amendments (H.R. 2259/S. 1254).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI), requires the U.S. Sentencing Commission to submit new guidelines imposing higher penalties for crack cocaine than powder cocaine, and higher sentences for "high level" as opposed to "low level" drug trafficking. It rejects previous guidelines that would have lowered penalties for crack cocaine to those for powder cocaine. The law stipulates that new guidelines also should include stiffer penalties for drug traffickers who use a dangerous weapon, possess a firearm, or involve or injure children or other vulnerable individuals when committing an offense.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This bill passed the Senate on September 29, 1995; passed the House of Representatives on October 18, 1995; and was signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-38.
<p>


<b>MAKING PUNISHMENT SWIFT AND SURE</b><p>
<b>The Alien Deportation Improvement Act of 1995 (H.R. 668).</b> Originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, this law would expedite deportation procedures for non-resident aliens convicted of serious felonies, as well as bribery, counterfeiting, trafficking in stolen vehicles, perjury or subornation of perjury. It also would permit deportation of a permanent resident alien who has been sentenced to five or more years for an aggravated felony.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure, originally titled the Criminal Alien Deportation Improvements Act of 1995, was passed by the House of Representatives on February 10, 1995, and later incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-132).
<p>
<b>Effective Death Penalty Act of 1995 (H.R. 779).</b> While there is considerable debate over the ethics or wisdom of imposing the death penalty, the empirical evidence indicates that the death penalty in the United States is used sparingly. In 1995, there were 2,976 criminals on death row, but the states have executed 263 criminals since 1973. The abuse of <i>habeas corpus</i>, enabling those on death row to file petition after petition seeking to overturn their sentences or convictions, has been a major weakness of the American criminal justice system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure reduces delays in carrying out capital sentences while preserving the right of those convicted of capital crimes to present valid claims in federal court. It also imposes time limits for the filing and judicial consideration of petitions; ends the practice of filing multiple petitions except in the rarest instances; requires that state prisoners seeking <i>habeas corpus</I> relief must exhaust all state remedies before bringing action in federal court; and specifies that if a state gives reasonable consideration to the petitioner's claim, the federal judge must deny that claim.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Effective Death Penalty Act of 1995 was passed by the House of Representatives on February 8, 1995; incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 by the Senate; and signed into law by President Clinton as part of Public Law 104-132.
<p>


<b>HELPING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The central congressional approach to law enforcement assistance is the block grant, which allows local law enforcement officials to secure more funds, hire more police personnel, and have even more flexibility in using these monies to combat crime at the local level.
<p>
<b>Local Government Law Enforcement Block Grants Act of 1995 (H.R. 728).</b> This measure authorizes federal grants for local law enforcement officers while giving them the flexibility they need to fight crime in ways they deem most appropriate for their communities. Unlike the police funding in the 1994 crime bill, these funds are targeted to communities with high crime rates. $503 million has been appropriated for FY 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This bill was passed by the House of Representatives on February 14, 1995; incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act by the Senate; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>Anti-Car Theft Improvements Act (H.R. 2803).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, advances the investigation of car theft by setting up the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS). This system, to be managed by the Department of Justice and maintained by the states, is intended to serve as a reliable and accessible body of information on motor vehicle titling for law enforcement officials.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This law was passed by the House of Representatives on June 18, 1996; passed by the Senate on June 20, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public law 104-152.
<p>

<b>JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS</b><p>

<b>Victim Restitution Act of 1995 (H.R. 665).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, requires judges in federal felony cases to order restitution to victims in cases involving violent crimes, offenses against property, or tampering with consumer products, as well as crimes in which an identifiable victim has suffered a physical injury or pecuniary loss. The law also authorizes the federal courts to make restitution a condition of probation or parole.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This Act was passed by the House of Representatives on February 7, 1995; passed by the Senate on December 22, 1995, and incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-132.
<p>
<b>Sexual Crimes Against Children Prevention Act of 1995 (H.R. 1240).</b> Sponsored by Representative McCollum, this law imposes strong sentencing guidelines for criminals convicted of creating or trafficking in child pornography and the interstate transportation of children with the intent to use them in such criminal activity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
H.R. 1240 was passed by the House on April 4, 1995; passed by the Senate on April 6, 1995; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-71.
<p>
<b>Megan's Law (H.R. 2137).</b> Sexually violent criminals often are repeat offenders, and their presence in local communities is an obvious concern for families with children. Under this law, sponsored by Representative Richard Zimmer (R-NJ), criminals convicted of these crimes must register their addresses with state law enforcement officials, and communities will be informed when these offenders move into their neighborhoods.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bill was passed by the House of Representatives on May 7, 1996; passed by the Senate on May 9, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-145.
<p>
<b>Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996 (H.R. 3525).</b> This new law, sponsored by Representative Henry Hyde (R-IL), makes it a federal crime to damage religious property or obstruct any person's free exercise of religion where the offense is in, or affects, interstate commerce.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
H.R. 3525 was passed by the House of Representatives on June 18, 1996; passed by the Senate on June 26, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-155.

<p>
<b>PENDING ANTI-CRIME LEGISLATION</b>
<p><b>Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997 (H.R. 3814).</b> This bill provides $680 million for prisons and $571 million for block grants to local law enforcement. It passed the House on July 24, 1996, and currently is before a conference of the House and Senate.
<p>
<b>Interstate Stalking Punishment and Prevention Act of 1996 (H.R. 2980/S. 1729).</b> H.R. 2980 makes it a felony to cross a state line to stalk someone or to cross a state line in violation of a restraining order. The House of Representatives passed this bill on May 7, 1996. S. 1729, an identical bill sponsored by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), was passed by the Senate.
<p>
<b>Exclusionary Rule Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 666).</b> This bill, sponsored by Representative McCollum, would establish an exception to the exclusionary rule, which bars the use at trial of any evidence gathered by police officers in violation of the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure. The narrow qualification created by this legislation would allow the admission of evidence obtained by police officers who, while they technically violated proper procedure, acted in the "reasonably objective belief" that their actions under the circumstances complied with Fourth Amendment protections. The bill classifies any information obtained pursuant to, or within the scope of, a warrant as evidence obtained in good faith.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The House of Representatives passed this bill on February 8, 1995. It has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
<p>
<b>Violent Youth Predator Act of 1996 (H.R. 3565).</b> This bill, also sponsored by Representative McCollum, would allow federal prosecutors to try violent juvenile offenders as adults. It also includes tough, mandatory sentences for juvenile criminals who use firearms in the commission of a federal violent crime or drug trafficking offense, and authorizes additional funding for juvenile justice programs and grants to states, allowing them greater flexibility in combating the growth of violent juvenile crime. The bill was marked up by the House Judiciary Committee on July 16 and 17, 1996, and referred to the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth, and Families, which approved sections under its jurisdiction.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the United States Senate, John Ashcroft (R-MO) introduced S. 1245, a similar bill. The Subcommittee on Youth Violence of the Senate Judiciary Committee has held hearings on the Ashcroft bill.
<p>
<b>Sexual Offender Tracking and Identification Act of 1996 (S. 1675/H.R. 3456).</b> This bill would enhance the federal effort to track convicted sex offenders. Cosponsored by Senators Phil Gramm (R-TX) and Joseph Biden (D-DE), the legislation would establish a federal tracking system, accessible to the public, to document the location of sex offenders, making it more difficult for these criminals to hide their records when applying for jobs, housing, or youth service programs. A version of the bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Zimmer. Hearings on the bill have been held before the Subcommittee on Crime of the House Judiciary Committee.

<title>High Layoffs and Long-Term Unemployment Cloud Jobs Picture - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h3> HIGH LAYOFFS AND LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT CLOUD JOBS PICTURE </h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/wilson.htm">Mark Wilson</a>, Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy <br>
<p>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 115<br>
August 5, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c1.gif">Chart 1:</a> Announced Layoffs for the First Six Months of 1996 Continue at Rapid Pace<br>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c2.gif">Chart 2:</a> Compared with Previous Economic Expansions, Long-Term Unemployment Remains High<br>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c3.gif">Chart 3:</a> Manufacturing Employment Has Declined for the Last Year and Remains 6.2 Percent Below 1989<br>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Since the end of the last recession in March 1991, the total number of payroll jobs has grown by 11.4 million to a total of 119.7 million, and the unemployment rate has declined from 6.8 to 5.4 percent. Despite this good news, many workers continue to be apprehensive about their economic future. In fact, one of every five Americans believes jobs are hard to get, and well over one of every ten believes there will be fewer jobs in the future.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A look at the data behind the total number of jobs created and overall unemployment rates reveals why Americans are concerned.<ul>

<p><li>Announced job layoffs continue at a rapid pace, with layoffs at near record levels for the 1990s. Displaced workers who did find new jobs did so at an average of 8.2 percent lower wages.

<p><li>Long-term unemployment remains stubbornly high. The percentage of long-term unemployed is at record levels for this stage of an economic expansion.

<p><li>Overall real earnings growth is stagnating, and men's real earnings continue to decline.

<p><li>The number of high-paying manufacturing jobs continues to decline -- down 282,000 since March 1995 -- and weak economic growth is limiting job opportunities for many Americans.
Focusing on just the total number of new jobs and the low overall unemployment rate without taking these sobering facts into account paints a misleading picture of economic growth and job opportunities.<sup>2</sup>  The economy is still failing to perform as well as similar expansions.


</ul><p>
<b>ANNOUNCED LAYOFFS CONTINUE AT RAPID PACE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
After a flurry of press attention last winter, the continued pace of corporate downsizing has gone largely unnoticed. Despite this, many workers remain concerned about their job security. One-half of all Americans believe that jobs are not very plentiful,<sup>3</sup> and 46 percent believe the economy is getting worse.<sup>4</sup>  New jobs may be available, but they usually pay substantially less and may not have the same benefits.<ul>

<p><li>Announced job layoffs for the first six months of 1996 were the second-highest this decade (see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c1.gif">Chart 1</a>).<sup>5</sup>  Layoffs were 28 percent higher than the first half of 1995 and 6.0 percent ahead of 1993, the largest downsizing year of the decade.

<p><li>So far this year, the telecommunications industry has announced layoffs totaling almost 43,000; the food industry, over 25,000; the computer industry, over 22,000; the retail industry, over 21,000; and the automobile industry, almost 18,000.

<p><li>The median weekly earnings of displaced workers who found new jobs were 8.2 percent less than for their old jobs.<sup>6</sup>  They were over 14 percent less for workers 45 to 55 years old. One of every five displaced workers who found new jobs was no longer covered by group health insurance.
</ul>

<p>
<b>LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT REMAINS HIGH</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How long Americans are unemployed (duration) is just as important as the level of unemployment. An unemployment rate of 7.5 percent with most workers out of work for only a week as they change jobs or are recalled from layoff is significantly better than an unemployment rate of 5.5 percent with many workers still struggling to find work six months after losing their last job. Because of weak economic growth, long-term joblessness has not declined as rapidly as it normally does after recessions.<sup>7</sup>
<ul>
<p><li>Long-term unemployment remains stubbornly high.<sup>8</sup>  <a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c2.gif">Chart 2</a> shows that the proportion of Americans unemployed for at least six months remains unusually high after five years of modest economic growth. Since the end of the last recession, the proportion of unemployed who have been out of work for six or more months has not dropped significantly for youths (ages 16 to 24), black Americans, and service workers.

<p><li>After six months of looking for work, almost one of every five unemployed managers and professionals still has not found a job.<sup>9</sup>

<p><li>The overall unemployment rate also does not reveal significant problems facing workers in various age groups, industries, or occupations. While the total unemployment rate was 5.4 percent in July 1996, the rate for all teenagers was 16.4 percent, and the rate for black teenagers was 33.1 percent.
</ul>

<p><b>EARNINGS GROWTH STAGNATES, MEN'S EARNINGS STILL DECLINE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Over the past five years of modest economic recovery and expansion, the real median usual weekly earnings for all full-time wage and salary workers has stagnated.<sup>10</sup>  For men, real median weekly earnings have declined 5.1 percent. For black and Hispanic Americans, the decline has been even worse: 5.4 percent and 8.2 percent, respectively.
<ul>
<p><li>After increasing 2.5 percent from the first quarter of 1991 to the first quarter of 1993, the index of real hourly compensation has not increased.

<p><li>Over the past five years, only workers in the finance, insurance, and real estate industries have seen their real average hourly earnings improve substantially.
</ul><p><b>

WEAK ECONOMIC GROWTH LIMITS JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMERICANS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although total employment and unemployment numbers are significant, they often do not convey important information about problems various age groups, industries, or occupations may be having. There actually are fewer manufacturing jobs now than when the economic recovery began five years ago, and the dismal pace of economic growth has meant no substantial improvement in job opportunities for men and minorities. Workers in some occupations have not yet regained the ground they lost in the last recession. For example:
<ul>
<p><li>Since March 1991, the percentage of the population employed has increased 1.4 percentage points to 63.2 percent.<sup>11</sup>  The percentage of men employed, however, has increased only 0.5 percentage points and still remains well below its 1989 peak of 72.8 percent.

<p><li>The employment-population ratio for white teenagers has increased 0.7 percentage points to 48.0 percent since March 1991 but remains well below the rate of 53.4 percent reached in August 1989.<sup>12</sup>  Likewise, the employment-population ratio for black teenagers has increased 2.0 percentage points to a disappointing 25.8 percent since March 1991 but remains well below the pre-recession rate of 32.4 percent reached in July 1989.

<p><li>The number of manufacturing jobs has declined 282,000 to 18.3 million since March 1995, and is down almost 1.2 million since its peak in 1989 (see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c3.gif">Chart 3</a>).<sup>13</sup>  Durable goods manufacturing employment has increased only 55,000 over the past five years and remains below its 1989 peak by 794,000 jobs. Manufacturing workers have regained only 1 of every 5 jobs lost between 1989 and 1993.

<p><li>The number of Americans working in high-skilled technician and related occupations has declined 478,000 since July 1992, and the number of workers in administrative support and clerical occupations has declined by 298,000.<sup>14</sup>

<p><li>The number of Americans working in precision production, craft, and repair occupations has declined 13,000 to 13.4 million from March 1991 to July 1996 and remains 519,000 below the peak of 14.0 million reached in March 1990.
</ul><p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite the creation of 11.4 million additional jobs since the end of the last recession, workers continue to be concerned about their economic future. The average annual growth rate of the past seven years has been the worst economic performance since the end of World War II.<sup>15</sup>  Layoff announcements for the first half of this year were the second-highest this decade, long-term unemployment remains high, and real earnings growth has stagnated for the past five years. Focusing only on total job growth and the low unemployment rate without taking these facts into account paints a misleading picture of economic growth and job opportunities.

<a href="fyi114c2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Trend and Quarterly Real GDP Growth 1976-1996
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On August 1, the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is scheduled to release its preliminary or "advance" gross domestic product (GDP) growth estimate for the second quarter of 1996. This number, good or bad, inevitably will make front-page news and may have a significant impact on the presidential campaign. Just as inevitably, this preliminary number most likely will turn out to be wrong, for quarterly GDP data historically have been subject to substantial later revisions, sometimes so significant that the original estimate tells nothing about the course of the economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

A single quarter estimate of the growth in GDP usually is a poor signal of the long-term direction of economic growth. Consider the following examples:<ul>

<p><li>The GDP growth estimate for the first quarter of 1996 has been revised downward by 21 percent (from 2.8 percent to 2.2 percent).

<p><li>During the last year of the Bush Administration, the first quarter 1992 advance estimate of GDP suggested an annualized growth rate of 2.0 percent. The subsequent revision of the GDP for that quarter showed that growth in the quarter actually was at an annualized rate of 4.7 percent. This is a 135 percent revision between the preliminary and final estimates.

<p><li>As it turns out, the BEA underestimated the growth rate during the Reagan Administration in 63 percent of its advance estimates. During the Clinton Administration, the BEA so far has overestimated the growth rate on over 69 percent of the occasions on which it published advance estimates.

<p><li>The BEA concedes that in 12 percent of the quarters between 1978 and 1991, the advance GDP growth estimate failed even to indicate correctly whether growth was positive or negative.

<p><li>The average divergence between the advance estimate of GDP growth and the final GDP growth rate between 1976 and 1996 was equivalent to 50 percent of the value of the final GDP growth rate.
</ul>

<p>
<b>WHY DOES QUARTERLY GDP FLUCTUATE SO MUCH?</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Measuring GDP changes is a very complex task, made all the more difficult by the fact that quarterly GDP figures are very volatile.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Gross domestic product (GDP) represents the total value of goods and services sold for final consumption by U.S. firms and individuals. It consists of four major components: personal consumption; investment (including business inventories and both residential and nonresidential fixed investment); net exports; and government purchases of goods and services. Fluctuations in any of these individual components of GDP in a given quarter can cause large changes in the quarterly growth rate. The components which typically have the largest and most common fluctuations are changes in business inventories and in government purchases.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

A glance at the quarterly GDP growth figures for the last quarter of 1995 illustrates this point. Despite an annualized growth rate in personal consumption expenditures of 1.2 percent and a respectable annualized increase in nonresidential fixed investment of 3.1 percent, overall annualized growth in this quarter was at a recession-like low of 0.5 percent. The reason: An annualized fall in government purchases of over 12 percent during the winter shutdown of 1995-1996 drove down GDP during this quarter.<sup>2</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

 Similarly, a number of one-shot factors probably will drive a significant increase in GDP for the second quarter of 1996. One leading econometric consulting firm, the St. Louis-based Macroeconomic Advisers,<sup>3</sup> for example, cite a number of factors to support their prediction of a 3.7 percent annualized growth rate for this quarter. These factors include the complete recovery of government purchases following the winter shutdown, the end of the UAW strike at General Motors, an increase in the number of home mortgage refinancings stimulated by lower interest rates (which put extra cash into the hands of consumers), and the economy's recovery after the harsh winter weather.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The extent to which these short-term factors can influence quarterly growth figures can be gauged by looking more closely at what is happening to business inventories. Due to the GM strike and the harsh winter, business inventories fell substantially in the first quarter of 1996 as production experienced a slowdown. Macroeconomic Advisers predicts that over 38 percent of their projected growth in GDP (1.4 percent from a total annualized growth rate of 3.7 percent) in the second quarter of 1996 will come solely from firms restocking their inventories as production gets fully back on line.
<p>


<b>WHY ADVANCE ESTIMATES OF GDP GROWTH TEND TO BE WRONG</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Measuring GDP is a massive and complicated undertaking that involves attempting to record the total sales of all goods for final consumption for the entire United States. The BEA produces its estimates based on sample sales data from a number of individuals and firms, collected during every month. Prices for thousands of individual items are estimated using sample data. Taken together, these comprise virtually millions of data points.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The problem is that when the advance estimate is published only 30 days after the close of the quarter, not all of these data have been examined -- or are even available. In 1984, for example, top BEA official Robert Parker noted that for sales of all consumer goods, other than autos and trucks, only data from the first two months of the quarter were available when advance estimates of national income were being made.<sup>4</sup>  To estimate the GDP growth in such a case, with data either missing or unexamined, BEA economists must rely on a combination of extrapolation and guesswork. But given the turbulent nature of quarterly GDP changes, this guesswork often is very inaccurate. These factors mean that large revisions need to be made as the complete dataset becomes available and is examined in full by the BEA.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The revisions also tend to be large because the GDP growth rate is a rate of change. Thus, errors of a small magnitude in total GDP can lead to large errors in the growth rate. For example, if the actual GDP growth rate is 2 percent, even a small error in total GDP could translate into a large error in the actual growth rate, perhaps even 50 percent. In this context, it is not surprising that advance GDP growth estimates often vary substantially from the real figures.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Unfortunately, despite the fact that advance GDP growth estimates are subject to frequent and large revisions, they are quickly seized upon by politicians of both parties either to support their own records or to attack those of their opponents. And unlike the publication of advance estimates, revisions of these quarterly data by the BEA hardly make the news. This process of correcting and finalizing GDP estimates can last for months -- even years -- following that initial release and can result in huge revisions which tell a completely different story about how well the economy performed.<sup>5</sup>  <a href="fyi114c1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows the difference between the initial "advance" estimates of the real annualized growth rate of GDP and the most up-to-date revisions of these figures for the period since 1976.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<a href="fyi114c1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows the difference or "error" between the advance and the most up-to-date revised estimate of the GDP growth rate. The "magnitude of the initial error" refers to the amount by which the advance GDP growth rate was later revised. Thus, if the advance estimate was a 3 percent annualized growth rate and the revised rate was 2 percent, the absolute error was 1 percentage point, which represents a revision of 33 percent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In most cases, the error is substantial; on a number of occasions, it exceeds the real growth rate itself. Among recent examples of large errors is the first quarter of 1992, when the BEA's advance estimate of GDP growth underestimated the real annualized growth rate by a factor of 135 percent (the advance annualized real growth estimate was 2.0 percent; real annualized growth in that quarter was actually 4.7 percent, according to the latest revision). The BEA also has revised downward its estimate of the growth rate for the first quarter of 1996 by a factor of almost one-third.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

An analysis of the revisions contained in the BEA's monthly <I>Survey of Current Business</I> over the 20-year period from 1976-1996 shows that these recent examples fit a general pattern over many years. In the 80 quarters between the first quarter of 1976 and the first quarter of 1996, the average magnitude of the total revision in annualized real GDP growth amounted to 1.4 percent of GDP. The average quarterly annualized growth rate in GDP over this period was 2.8 percent. This means that the average divergence of the advance estimate of GDP growth from the actual revised figure was equivalent to 50 percent of the value of the actual revised growth rate. According to BEA economist Allan Young, "advance" GDP growth figures failed even to show correctly whether GDP growth was negative or positive in 12 percent of all quarters over the period 1978-1991.<sup>6</sup>  Taking the Reagan years as an example, the BEA's advance figures underestimated the growth rate in roughly two-thirds (63 percent) of all quarters. Likewise, during the Clinton era, the BEA so far has overestimated the rate of growth in about 70 percent of all of its advance estimates.
<p>

<b>WHY IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO LOOK AT TRENDS IN GDP</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Because of the poor accuracy of advance estimates of GDP and the extreme volatility of quarterly GDP growth rates, a far better picture of the economy emerges from looking at the underlying trends. <a href="fyi114c2.gif">Chart 2</a> shows the trend<sup>7</sup> in economic growth compared with the <I>revised</I> quarterly GDP growth rates between the first quarter of 1976 and the second quarter of 1996.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The data in <a href="fyi114c2.gif">Chart 2</a> show two major patterns in the rate of economic growth in recent years: an acceleration in growth rates between the first quarter of 1992 and the final quarter of 1994 and a deceleration in the growth rate beginning after the peak in 1994 and continuing through to the current period. Both the expansion and the slowdown in the economy, however, have been punctuated by misleading "spikes," or individual quarters when the GDP growth rate diverged from the trend. For example, during the first quarter of 1993, in the middle of an expansion, the growth rate of GDP fell to zero. More recently, the economy showed strong above-trend growth in the third quarter of 1995.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

As can be seen from <a href="fyi114c2.gif">Chart 2</a>, individual quarterly GDP numbers are a rough and often misleading signal of the long-term and medium-term strength of the economy. Quarterly GDP figures can fluctuate widely because of factors that are unique to that quarter and which pose no long-term implications for economic prosperity.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Americans should not be lulled into a false sense of either economic prosperity or impending economic decline by estimates of the economy's performance during a single quarter. The advance estimates that are scheduled to be released on August 1 are likely to be revised considerably in the weeks and months to come. And even if these quarterly snapshots actually were accurate, quarterly GDP numbers fluctuate considerably for reasons unconnected with the long-term economic growth rate. Americans should not allow themselves to be deceived by these numbers and the political posturing surrounding them; rather, they should pay attention to the longer term patterns in the economy.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives too often approach environmental issues without a clear framework within which to explain to the public how the objectives of environmental protection and economic growth can both be achieved. This failure has allowed many conservatives to be characterized falsely as "anti-environmental."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is little understanding among Americans either of the need to reform environmental laws to maintain -- or improve -- protection for health, safety, and the environment, or of the fact that this can be done while simultaneously making them less burdensome to the economy. Until conservatives can explain more clearly why protecting the environment is not synonymous with adopting the "environmentalist agenda," they will be unable to build public support for badly needed reforms.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although current environmental laws have not worked well, conservatives have not developed a cohesive vision to help Americans understand how these laws should be reformed. Moreover, when criticized by liberals, they have failed to challenge liberals to respond with proposals to reform these programs. It is important to show that the good intentions of current law often are accompanied by oppressive, senseless regulations. But it is imperative that conservatives also show why their policies would do a better job of protecting the environment.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Specifically, conservatives should stress the following themes:
<P>
<b>THEME #1: The Failure of Liberal Policies.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives need to explain that existing statutes have had many severe side effects. Among them:
<ul>
<li><b> Exorbitant costs with little return.</b> Conservatives need to explain that while costs have continued to skyrocket, the benefits being purchased have plummeted. Indeed, many of these increasingly expensive regulations now do more environmental harm than good.
<p>
<li><b>Property confiscation and loss of economic freedom.</b> Conservatives need to explain that private property is being taken from Americans through unfair regulation, and that many government "solutions" to environmental problems conflict with basic property rights.
<p>
<li><b>Lost opportunities cost lives.</b> Conservatives need to explain that the policies of the environmental agenda save few lives while squandering scarce economic resources that could be used to save more lives if dedicated to more serious risks. In effect, today's badly designed policies can kill.
</ul><p>
<b>THEME #2: A Positive Vision.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives need to articulate more clearly a positive approach to the environment that emphasizes:
<p><ul>
<li><b>An ethic of conservation.</b> Conservatives need to explain that the need to conserve  natural resources-- or use them efficiently --  is not in dispute. The debate is over how best to do that -- through markets or through government controls. For instance, a market-based approach would greatly reduce air pollution, and at far less cost.
<p>
<li><b>Property-based solutions.</b> Conservatives need to explain that the best way to achieve many environmental objectives is to create incentives associated with property ownership, not to issue thousands of pages of rules. For instance, property rights can be used to protect threatened species more effectively.
<p>
<li><b>Priority setting saves lives.</b> Conservatives must explain that not all things are equally important or urgent, and that regulating all risks equally means fewer lives saved for the dollars spent than would be the case if priorities were set. Conservative policies can save more lives. For instance, reforming Superfund would save more lives by focusing efforts on eliminating the highest risks more quickly.
<p>
<li><b>States do a better job than the federal government.</b> Conservatives need to explain that states are in a better position to deal with environmental matters within their borders than is the federal government. For instance, with the safety of drinking water supplies determined by states, the states would likely no longer squander resources obeying federal mandates that, until the Safe Drinking Water Act was recently reformed, required them to test for chemicals not even found in unsafe levels. Instead, they might focus on the far more mundane but persistent, serious, and largely ignored problem of bacterial contamination.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives have erred in putting too much political stock in the significance of horror stories -- absurd or onerous cases of environmental regulation. Public dismay at these stories does not signify broad-based support for deregulation. Americans understandably fear that if the "regulatory safety net" were dismantled, the country would return to the days of smokestacks billowing black smoke and burning rivers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That is why the message of balancing environmental protection and a strong economy has fallen on deaf ears. The public is easily convinced that the argument for deregulation is just shorthand for rolling back environmental protections. And many conservatives fan this fear by adopting decidedly anti-environment rhetoric. For conservatives to be successful in convincing the public to support more reasonable environmental policies, they must explain them far more clearly.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A track record must be developed by which the public's hopes are met and their fears quelled. Most people want more freedom, a stronger economy, and a cleaner environment. The challenge is to show Americans how to obtain more of each.
<p>
<b>CRAFTING A SUBSTANTIVE MESSAGE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most Americans want both a strong economy and a clean, healthy environment. The problem is that environmental regulations can be enormously expensive, and can cost jobs and stifle economic opportunity. On the other hand, without environmental protections, robust economic activity, particularly manufacturing, often led to a deteriorating and unhealthy environment.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A generation ago, as people perceived that their quality of life was beginning to deteriorate, they began to support aggressive policies to reduce pollution levels. These policies frequently failed in their aims and became increasingly and unnecessarily expensive, but the environment did begin to improve. Today, many Americans are becoming aware that many of these policies are unreasonable and that, even when they work, they seem to bring only small improvements in the environment at a heavy cost in jobs and freedom. Moreover, many Americans are beginning to recognize that there often is no sound scientific basis for assertions of environmental harm or risk to the public. As families and businesses have begun to feel the economic effects and loss of liberty caused by these policies, the pendulum has begun to swing the other way.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Like most other people, conservatives have no wish to return to the days of black smoke billowing out of smokestacks.<sup>1</sup>  But they do want common sense brought to bear in dealing with the environment; they want reasonable environmental protection without having to sacrifice their freedom. At the same time, however, Americans generally want to be assured that reform will not lead to environmental deterioration. In other words, they trust conservatives to create jobs but question their environmental track record. If conservatives want to win the environmental debate, therefore, they must build that record and convince Americans that they hold the same values.
<p>
<b>HOW LIBERAL POLICIES FAIL</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While pollution levels have dropped dramatically since 1970, most of these reductions were achieved early in that period and at relatively low cost. From 1970 to 1990, total emission levels fell by about 34 percent. Over the same period, lead levels in the air fell 97 percent, and carbon monoxide levels in the air fell 41 percent.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As late as 1986, the annual cost of environmental protection was an estimated $87 billion. Since then, it has doubled to $174 billion.<sup>3</sup>  Meanwhile, environmental gains, which initially were very great, have slowed to a trickle as the federal government has run out of easy fixes and then attempted to eke out minuscule improvements in the environment at huge extra costs. These costs now represent about 3 percent of America's gross domestic product (GDP), or almost $1,800 per household per year.<sup>4</sup>
<TABLE  align=right width=50% border=1 cellpadding=15 hspace=15 vspace=15>
<TR><TD bgcolor=#eeeeff> Larry Mason's family sawmill employed 40 workers in Beaver, Washington. Says Mason, "in 1990, the spotted owl injunctions closed our mill, made my equipment worthless, and my expertise obsolete."<sup>1</sup>
<p>Bill Stamp's family in Exeter, Rhode Island, has been blocked from farming or developing its 70 acres of land for 11 years, yet has been assessed taxes at rates determined by the land's industrial value. As a result, this fifth-generation farm family may lose their farm.
<p>Environmental regulations to "protect" people can cause death. The best example is the set of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, intended to conserve energy and keep oil prices down. The only way auto makers can meet the CAFE standards is by building lighter autos. Unfortunately for drivers and passengers, lighter autos are less able to withstand the impact of crashes. This substantially raises the number of highway deaths; the expected number for 1989 model year cars alone is 2,500.

</TABLE><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Environmental regulations also have caused immense hardships for businesses and small property owners alike. In the name of protecting the environment, powerless individuals have been forgotten as their businesses flounder because of expensive "command and control" regulations that tell them what to do and how to do it. The cost to individuals often is not a factor in the design of rules. Likewise, and without compensation, property owners often are required to forfeit the right to use their land for its intended purpose because regulators want to use it for wetland preservation or endangered species habitat. This can ruin them financially.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ironically, despite the skyrocketing costs and increasing hardship for ordinary Americans, the current system does not guarantee that the environment will continue to improve, or that Americans' lives will become any safer and their quality of life any better. In fact, there is much evidence to suggest the opposite. For instance, instead of working to protect species, the current implementation of the Endangered Species Act has become the main impediment to recovery of species.
<p>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why is this?  Consider that not a single species has recovered as a direct result of the Act.<sup>5</sup>  The few taken off the list so far were recovered for unrelated reasons (for example, the Bald Eagle, which benefited from a separate law protecting it) or because they were listed improperly in the first place even though always numerous (for example, the tumamoc globe berry). But when a listed species is discovered on a person's property,  the government  may restrict the landowner's right to use his property productively in order to preserve the habitat. The result: Landowners threatened with losing their livelihoods and property have little incentive to help maintain habitat. Indeed, the opposite is true. They are encouraged to eliminate habitat, perhaps through clear cutting, before restrictions are imposed in order to escape the devastating financial consequences. Thus, instead of encouraging landowners to protect endangered species, the Act often encourages them to destroy them.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, some environmental regulations may be an indirect cause of deaths among Americans. A seminal Harvard University study found that 60,000 lives are lost unnecessarily each year because of the current regulatory regime. Dr. Tammy Tengs, now at the University of California at Irvine and the author of the study, summarizes this phenomenon: "[W]hen we spend resources on interventions that save lives at a high cost, we forego the opportunity to spend those same resources on interventions that save lives at low cost.... At our current level of resource consumption, we could double the survival benefits of our expenditures. Alternatively, we could retain our present level of risk reduction and, in addition, save billions of dollars."<sup>6</sup>
<P>
<TABLE  align=center border=1 cellpadding=15 hspace=15 vspace=15>
<TR><TD bgcolor=#eeeeff><ul>
<li>Spending $178 million may avert one death under the diethyl stilbestrol (DES) Cattlefeed Ban. But 24 other lives are lost due to lower living standards. The reason -- lower living standards cause increased mortality rates.
<p><li>Spending $111 million may avert one death under the Asbestos Ban. But 15 other lives are lost.
<p><li>Spending $72 million may avert one death under the Uranium Mill Tailings Cover Rule. But 10 other lives are lost.<sup>1</sup>

</TABLE>


<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Viewing the problem from a different perspective, the regulations themselves can be fatal. Statistical analyses have shown that for every $7.5 million in costs the government imposes on the economy, overall worker living standards are lowered enough to cause one additional statistical death.<sup>7</sup>  When this formula is used to compare the number of lives "saved" by a particular environmental regulation with the number of lives lost through lower living standards, it turns out that many regulations actually increase the death toll.
<p>
<b>HELPING THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH COMMONSENSE SOLUTIONS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is important for conservatives to approach the issue in a commonsense way that people can understand. Given the general skepticism, they must stress that the environment is something they want to maintain and improve -- and show that they mean it, not just with environment-friendly rhetoric, but with substantive policies that benefit the environment. Only by building a positive environmental agenda and track record can conservatives show that their reforms would create jobs and economic growth while also helping the environment. People need to be told that, while environmental protection need not come at the expense of jobs, it will cost jobs unless the model of centralized control of environmental protection is rejected. A better approach would be based on:
<p><ul>
<li> A conservation ethic (freedom with responsibility);
<p>
<li> Property rights;
<p>
<li>Priority setting; and
<p>
<li> A strong state role.
</ul>
<p>
<b>The Need for a Sensible Conservation Ethic</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives traditionally have stressed economic growth while ignoring the importance of environmental problems. Thus, they have fought environmentalists step by step -- and have lost step by step. The reason is not complicated: Environmentalists have occupied the moral high ground, even though they typically have not provided the most beneficial solutions. In short, conservatives have been on the wrong side of an emotional issue.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are two lessons to bear in mind:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>First,</b> what leftists and the public at large understand is that publicly owned goods free of constraints on use will be depleted over time.<sup>9</sup>  Garrett Hardin, Professor Emeritus of Human Ecology at the University of California, in his seminal 1968 work <i>The Tragedy of the Commons</i> showed that when a good is publicly owned (or "owned" in common), no one has an incentive to conserve or manage it. In fact, there is a perverse incentive to use the good inefficiently (to deplete it) as each user tries to reap the benefits for himself. This fact is at the heart of most environmental problems such as air and water pollution and species extinction.
<TABLE  align=left width=50% border=1 cellpadding=15 hspace=15 vspace=15>
<TR><TD bgcolor=#eeeeff>
Ten percent of the cars and trucks on the road cause over half of the pollution emitted by autos  and 20 percent of the autos cause more than 88 percent of the pollution. Yet the liberal approach has been to tighten standards for newer, cleaner cars rather than to attack the heart of the problem  -- older cars and untuned cars, and especially older untuned cars, which pollute heavily. Rather than making more regulations that add hundreds of dollars to the cost of millions of new automobiles to reduce their already low pollutant emissions by a few percent -- and aggregate auto pollution levels by even less -- it makes more sense to cut pollution levels by making the real culprits shoulder their share of the burden. Requiring heavily polluting cars to pay locally set fees or penalties based on the levels of pollution they emit as measured by remote sensing (similar in concept to a radar gun) could reduce car pollution levels dramatically, and at a fraction of today's onerous and illogical regulatory approach. Indeed, a pilot program by the state of Utah showed car pollution could be cut dramatically and cheaply simply by giving free tune-ups to the worst polluters. Moreover, by driving up the cost of new cars, regulations cause older polluting cars that are less expensive to be kept on the road longer, which works against the goal of lowering pollution.

</TABLE>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Second,</b> if there are incentives to conserve resources, people will conserve out of self-interest. Thus, giving people a vested interest in providing environmental benefits (for example, through property ownership and other positive incentives) encourages them to provide such benefits voluntarily.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When it comes to certain resources like the air and water, conservatives have tended to ignore the first lesson, and consequently have lost the opportunity to implement the second.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"Freedom with responsibility for one's actions" should be the conservative message. Responsibility restrains wasteful behavior. The old environmentalist slogan "Make the polluter pay" actually is consistent with this message. But when they say this, conservatives and liberals mean different things. As Al Cobb, then Director of Environment and Energy at the National Policy Forum, says, "What the environmental lobby means by that phrase is that corporate polluters should be punished severely for any pollution whatsoever. What conservatives mean, however, is that polluters should bear the full cost of environmental degradation, but no more."<sup>10</sup>  Put another way, individuals and corporations should be given the incentive of reaping rewards for conservation and environmentally sound practices.
<p>
<b>HOW PROPERTY RIGHTS ENCOURAGE CONSERVATION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The free market actually encompasses the conservation ethic better than command-and-control regulation from Washington. A free market can occur, however, only if private citizens can engage in trade, and people can trade only what they own: some form of property. Thus, property is the cornerstone of a free market. If property rights are insecure or publicly owned, a market cannot function effectively. Some critics call this "market failure," but it really is a failure to use markets and their main engine: property rights. As a result, both environmental protection and personal liberty suffer. Resources that are not owned will be depleted or will deteriorate because neither protection of nor damage to those resources is part of the decision-making process. Others nevertheless are subjected involuntarily to the consequences of those decisions.
<TABLE  align=right width=50% border=1 cellpadding=15 hspace=15 vspace=15>

<ul>
<li>In the decade 1979 -- 1989, East and Central African elephant herd populations dropped from more than 1 million to less than half that. Yet in Zimbabwe, elephant herds have increased dramatically. The difference is that in Zimbabwe, hunting is permitted as a property right. Small villages that own the land on which elephants live and graze charge safari operators to conduct hunts. Since the villages profit directly, they have an incentive to promote herd growth to increase their income. In surrounding African countries, government bureaucrats seem unable to curb incessant poaching. But in Zimbabwe, villagers are constantly on the lookout for poachers because they cost the village income. Zimbabwe and a few other countries reward the conservation of elephants by allowing the conservationists themselves to profit from their protective behavior. In each country where this approach is practiced, elephant herd sizes are increasing.
<p><li>In Scotland and England, the popularity of fishing has burgeoned in recent decades. In these countries, property rights to fishing sites have developed which formed the building block for markets to provide access to prime fishing spots. As a result, many private, voluntary associations have formed to purchase fishing rights access.<sup>1</sup> In Scotland, "virtually every inch of every major river and most minor ones is privately owned or leased . . . . "<sup>2</sup> Owners of fishing rights on various stretches of the rivers charge others for the right to fish. These rivers are not overfished because it is not in the owner's best interest to allow the fish population to be depleted. The owner wants to continue charging fishermen for the foreseeable future, so he conserves his fish stock, allowing them to reproduce, and prevents pollution from entering his stretch of the river. If a municipality pollutes the water upstream, the owner of the fishing rights can stop it by suing for an injunction. Everyone wins, including fisherman desirous of quality fishing with some privacy.
<p><li>
One group's approach to wetland protection has shown the power of property rights to achieve environmental goals. Ducks Unlimited (DU), a group consisting of hunters and non-hunters alike, is dedicated to enhancing populations of ducks. To do this, it has purchased property or conservation easements with privately raised funds. Unlike other groups that started as hunting/outdoorsmen organizations but have largely lost their original focus, Ducks Unlimited has kept its focus on the protection of duck habitat.3 In the last 58 years, it has raised and invested $750 million to conserve 17 million acres of habitat in Canada alone, which benefits other wildlife as well as ducks. In 1994, it restored or created about 50,000 acres of wetlands. Since DU pays market prices for the habitat it protects, this group in many ways embodies the essence of the conservative message, which is to allow the market to determine the best and highest use of a good or resource -- in this case, duck habitat.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives should concentrate on explaining the innovative ways property rights can be used to protect the environment. The most efficient method -- and the one that best protects individual rights and freedoms -- is to enlist self-interest in the service of environmental protection.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Unfortunately, property rights are under attack in the U.S. from the environmental lobby. The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution states, "nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation," but this has been interpreted to give absolute protection only against physical takings or complete devaluation of property. Most property-rights infringements, however, involve federal bureaucratic decrees that owners may not use their property as they see fit (for example, by continuing to farm it). Since the courts have been unclear as to the degree of protection these property owners should have from such intrusions, legislative protection is needed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Protecting and using property rights, either in a stand-alone Act or as part of Endangered Species Act reform, would work to protect species in America. The Act does not work. Indeed, as many species are delisted because they become extinct as are recovered. The Fish and Wildlife Service now virtually ensures that threatened plants and animals will suffer because of the disincentives thrust upon landowners who understand that the value of their land and their economic security will be wiped out when federal agents tell them they no longer can make use of their property. Merely taking away this fear by promising compensation would be a large step in ensuring peaceful coexistence between species and owners of the property on which the species live. Moreover, property rights automatically will work to help species whenever there is an economic incentive to do so, such as protecting valuable fishing streams. But property also can be put to work to benefit species. If property owners were given financial rewards whenever threatened species bred on their lands, the species would not be threatened for long. It is no accident that cows, pigs, and chickens are plentiful in this country; people have an incentive to breed them. It is time this lesson was applied to other species.
<p>
<b>WHY PRIORITY SETTING IS IMPORTANT</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Ask the average American how much a human life is worth, and you probably will be told that "no amount is too much."  This is the answer that Congress and federal agencies use to justify imposing sometimes staggering costs on businesses to reduce the risk of death by infinitesimal amounts. While this allows policymakers to posture as saviors of life, these policymakers also generally fail to understand that wasting resources in this way means not using them in other ways that could produce better results and save more lives.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The economy has a limited ability to absorb environmental regulations. Simply put, the country cannot afford to eliminate every risk. There is an inherent trade-off: Attempting to regulate one risk out of existence may mean having to tolerate others. Thus, it is critical that regulators recognize the opportunity costs of their actions. Spending enormous amounts of money to eradicate small or even hypothetical risks means not being able to use those dollars in productive ways -- publicly or privately -- that would benefit the nation more.


<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It makes no sense to impose burdensome costs on consumers by, for example, regulating chemicals that are much less dangerous than everyday risks which average Americans, understanding that the danger is minimal, willingly accept. Yet that is exactly what the government does. For instance, the government routinely bans or regulates chemicals -- sometimes at the cost of billions of dollars -- whenever they pose a one-in-a-million chance of cancer, while simultaneously ignoring non-chemical risks hundreds of times greater that would be far less costly to regulate.
<p>
<TABLE  align=left width=50% border=1 cellpadding=15 hspace=15 vspace=15>
<TR><TD bgcolor=#eeeeff>
Priority setting will save lives and improve people's lives. The cleanup of old industrial wastes, embodied in Superfund, is a good example. The biggest problem with the law today is that cleanups are progressing at an incredibly slow pace, partly because money is being spent on lawyers to fight cleanups instead of on the cleanups themselves. Moreover, the law has stymied attempts to revitalize poor inner cities; few industries are willing to locate on sites there because of the risk of liability for cleaning up some former businesses' wastes. Also, it has been shown that fully one-third of sites pose no risk whatsoever to human health and safety unless residential housing is built -- and children eat the dirt. Thus, the standards often are inapplicable to inner-city industrial zones. The law should be reformed to speed cleanups by eliminating the barriers created by the current liability scheme, setting standards according to the real risks posed by the sites, and vigorously attacking wastes posing serious risks. Money should go to cleanup, not lawyers' pockets. This not only would protect poor people better and sooner, but also would allow inner cities to prosper again.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<p>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If lawmakers were seriously to consider which environmental policies actually save the most lives, they would scrap many costly rules and use the freed-up resources in other ways that save more lives. This commonsense approach would lead to levels and types of regulation that are very different from those which burden America today. In many cases, if the private resources used to comply with federal mandates were to be left in the industries concerned, or used in other ways in the local economy, Americans actually would benefit more, and far more lives could be saved, as the following <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/tp16c1.gif">chart</a> illustrates:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is why it is essential for policymakers to develop a priority list of environmental problems, based on the extent of the possible harm each appears to pose and the cost of reducing that harm to acceptable levels. Such a list would enable policymakers to know just how much risk protection is being bought for every dollar spent, and Americans to receive the maximum environmental "bang for the buck."  Conversely, the federal government could achieve environmental objectives at the lowest cost, and thus with the fewest "pink slips" for American workers.
<p>
<b>STATES ARE BEST EQUIPPED TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In thinking of the environment, conservatives should adopt the environmentalists' slogan: "Think globally, act locally."  There is no clearer statement of the need for greater local involvement in protecting the public safety and managing natural resources. While the federal government may serve a valuable role as technical advisor, especially to less populated or less sophisticated states, the states themselves are in the best position to know the needs of their citizens.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Localities form the front line in protecting public safety and should be given greater deference in prioritizing what public-sector actions will best protect the public. Communities then could redirect their attention to the most important problems, thereby protecting public safety and the environment more effectively.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Liberals like to argue that the states, if unsupervised, would ignore the health and welfare of their citizens. Nothing could be further from the truth. Experience has shown that those lawmakers and government officials closest to the people are the most responsive to the people. Conservatives should point out that federal regulators in Washington, D.C., because they are removed from the consequences of their decisions, respond more to national political pressures than to the needs and concerns of those who should count -- individuals and businesses facing the environmental and financial consequences of regulatory decisions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives also must make it clear that in a time of budget constraints and the growing imperative to balance the budget, it simply makes no sense to spend federal money to combat exclusively local problems. States should begin to shoulder their share of the burden. Quite simply, there is no reason for taxpayers in California to pay for environmental problems in Montana, or vice versa. For instance, since hazardous waste sites by their nature are confined to very small areas, it makes sense for states to finance cleanups of "orphan" sites within their borders where no responsible party can be found.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives must begin to rethink environmental issues. They have lost the debate for decades because they have ignored the simple lesson that conservation is a conservative ethic. This ethic -- which at its core is simply freedom with responsibility -- is pursued by conservatives in economic policy and should be pursued in environmental policy as well. If conservatives are to win the debate on this issue, they must acknowledge that all Americans want an environment that is clean and healthy. It is something to which all Americans are entitled. But they are equally entitled to jobs and a high standard of living. In short, they are entitled to a higher overall quality of life. Environmental protection is not the enemy of economic freedom or of a strong and thriving economy. The issue is how best to realize as much of all three as possible.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives must tell the American people the truth about the failure of current environmental policy. There are numerous "horror stories" to illustrate how our policies are destroying lives and squandering scarce labor and natural resources on nonsensical or counterproductive mandates. But conservatives must be careful to articulate the positive message as well. Only this message will lead to both public trust and the needed mandate for change.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives also must explain how their policies can better protect the environment and lives. Whenever possible, they should explain that by refusing to prioritize risks when regulating, federal agencies systematically condemn thousands of Americans to death each year. In an era of limited fiscal resources, refusing either to get the "biggest environmental bang for the buck" or to save as many lives as possible for the money being spent is irresponsible and reckless.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The market is the best conservation tool available. By tapping into the powerful forces and positive incentives of the market and property ownership -- incentives that reward responsible behavior -- Americans can protect the environment more effectively while simultaneously increasing economic freedom and growth. Once the public understands that a conservative also can be an environmentalist, the debate will be won.

<h3> HOW TO TALK ABOUT PROPERTY RIGHTS:<br>
WHY PROTECTING PROPERTY RIGHTS BENEFITS ALL AMERICANS </h3>
By John Shanahan<br>
Policy Analyst
<p>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Talking Points No. 15<br>
June 19, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The federal government increasingly passes the costs of its policies on to private property owners. To protect species under the Endangered Species Act, to preserve wetlands under the Clean Water Act,<sup>1</sup> or to effect some other such goal, the government typically prohibits or constrains property owners from using their property as they wish-- for example, by forbidding them to build on their land. And when the government wants to build a new federal facility, the property owner can be forced to surrender title through eminent domain. To be sure, when the government wants to take privately held property for its own purposes, it has the power under the Constitution to force a sale of the property. But in these cases, it at least has to pay the owners just compensation for their property. The problem is that when government regulates how private owners may use their land, it typically does so without any recognition of, or compensation for, the costs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This  <I>de facto</I> taking of property-- the practice of restricting a person's right to use his property without compensating him for losses caused by the restriction -- is now being questioned. Under this type of regulatory taking, property owners can face heavy financial burdens or even have their entire life savings wiped out.<sup>2</sup>  For example:<ul>

<p><li>John Sabanovich, an elderly man from Reading, California, saw his net worth plummet from $900,000 to $3,000 after being successfully sued in March 1996 for the purchase price of land he had sold: land that subsequently had been designated a wetland.<sup>3</sup>

<p><li>Bob and Mary McMackin of Arrowhead Lakes, Pennsylvania, built their retirement home and planted trees and shrubbery on dry land in 1989 after obtaining all necessary permits. But the couple were threatened by the Army Corps of Engineers four years later with $50,000 daily fines unless they quickly dug up their entire yard and created a wetland surrounding the house --just five feet away from the structure  --thus threatening the house's structural integrity. They were instructed to do this to restore the site to wetland status, and also to create another wetland off-site two times the size of the house to mitigate the lost wetland area on which the house sat. No one, including the government authorities who issued the various permits, had informed the McMackins that a wetland permit might be necessary for dry land.</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the belief of most Americans that seizing people's property by regulation without compensating them is inherently unfair and somehow un-American, few people -- including policymakers -- understand why protecting property rights is so essential.<sup>4</sup>  This is why Congress has yet to complete serious action to stop federal regulators from forcing individuals to surrender their property rights without compensation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Numerous bills have been introduced in the 104th Congress to address this problem, but none has become law. In March 1995, the House passed H.R. 925, the Private Property Protection Act of 1995. Introduced by Representative Charles Canady (R-FL), and part of the Contract with America, the bill as passed would require compensation by the regulating federal agency whenever regulatory restriction of property rights under the Endangered Species Act and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act exceeds 20 percent of the value of the regulated parcel. It also would allow the owner the option of requiring the federal government to purchase the entire parcel whenever governmental restrictions cause more than a 50 percent reduction in the value of the land -- in short, when the government's interest in the property exceeds the owner's -- and would establish procedures for resolving disputes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Senate has not acted on H.R. 925, but is considering the Omnibus Property Rights Act of 1995 (S. 605), also introduced in March 1995 by then-Senator Robert Dole (R-KS).<sup>5</sup>  S. 605 would require compensation by federal regulating agencies whenever the taking of some "portion" of property diminishes the value by 33 percent. The Senate bill also would establish voluntary alternative dispute resolution, would require a takings impact analysis, and would establish certain administrative rights for property owners under the Endangered Species Act and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Majority Leader Trent Lott's (R-MS) office has indicated plans to bring the bill to the floor for a vote this legislative session.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While lower percentage thresholds are preferable because more property owners will be provided relief, the difference in devaluation levels before compensation is required is not the most significant distinction between the House and Senate bills. More significant is that the Senate bill is more expansive in holding regulators accountable for their actions -- for example, by requiring that they assess the monetary impact to property owners of regulatory takings. Moreover, it uses a more expansive definition of property, including protection of contract rights, than the House version. The scope and focus of the Senate bill would be clarified if this definition were narrowed -- perhaps to real property, fixtures, and water rights.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite Senator Dole's departure, property rights legislation should not be shelved in the Senate this year. Property owners deserve protection from federal bureaucrats who increasingly resort to these regulations to take control of private property without regard to the burden imposed on American citizens and families.<sup>6</sup>
<p>

<b>THE IMPERATIVE OF PROPERTY PROTECTION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are important constitutional, economic, and fairness reasons for protecting private property rights. To understand why legislative protection is necessary, one must understand why property rights exist.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>The U.S. Constitution recognizes the importance of property rights.</b><sup>7</sup> The Fifth Amendment implicitly recognizes that the federal government may take property for public use. In fact, the implicit power of government to take property -- known as eminent domain -- was recognized by the Supreme Court as early as 1795 in <I>Vanhorne's Lessee v. Dorrance,</I> in which the Court found that "the despotic power, as it has been aptly called by some writers, of taking private property, when state necessity requires it, exists in every government.... [G]overnment could not subsist without it."<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Fifth Amendment, however, explicitly mandates that government must pay the property owner for the land confiscated. Although the government may take private property for public use, the clause "nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation," ensures that the cost is borne by those who benefit -- the public -- and not by the citizen unfortunate enough to own the land the government requires. The Constitution does not balance the importance of such governmental action against the importance of compensating individuals. The right to compensation is absolute. Thus, balance is built into the system: The government is permitted to take property unilaterally for public use, but at the same time is required to pay for it and protect private owners from having to bear the financial burden of pursuing that new use. In its most basic sense, compensation is a fairness issue. Why should one American bear the entire burden of the government's pursuit of a national good?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Just compensation for regulatory takings preserves individual civil rights.</b> Having seen the detrimental effects of King George's policies, the founders understood that property rights are essential to preventing the usurpation of other rights under the Constitution. It is this relationship to which Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart was referring in <I>Lynch v. Household Finance Co. Inc.</I> when he stated that there is a "fundamental interdependence... between the personal right to liberty and the personal right to property."<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Practically speaking, governments can control a wide range of individual activity if they can control whether individuals remain financially secure or surrender their property. Thus, the majority truly can tyrannize a disfavored minority. As James Madison wrote in Federalist 10, "[pure] democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been incompatible with personal security or the rights of property."  It was the desire to restrict just such tyranny over individuals that motivated the framers to put severe limits -- like the requirement of just compensation -- on the unchecked will of the majority.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Property protection reduces the incentive for the federal government to confiscate property.</b> If property is to be put to its best and most highly valued use, it must be owned by individuals who appreciate its fair market value. The nation's founders well understood the positive economic consequences of protecting owners' investments in their property.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If government had a free hand to take property without payment, the incentive to confiscate property that conferred only a small public benefit would be overwhelming. In fact, that is exactly what has happened. The federal government now owns 30 percent of America's land, with even higher percentages in the West (for instance, 61 percent of Idaho), and is using regulatory takings with increasing frequency to enhance its effective control over even more extensive tracts. The rationale: The cost to the government of compensating owners of the land would be too high. The problem with this approach is that the potential for relatively small public benefits through regulatory takings can lead to ruinous costs to private owners, who must shoulder costs the government deems too steep for itself.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In reality, federal enforcement officials have found that they can use regulations to gain control of property while circumventing the just compensation requirements of the Constitution. Federal property rights legislation thus is needed to provide a standard that will force federal regulators to consider the costs and benefits of taking private property. When the government decides it is in the public interest to constrain the use of private property for the public good, compensating the property owner at least ensures that the cost of providing the public good is spread fairly across all taxpayers and not just a few unfortunate individuals.
<p>

<b>THE NEED FOR LEGISLATIVE PROTECTION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Supreme Court has been clear in requiring federal, state, and local governments to pay just compensation whenever they take or occupy land or real estate.<sup>10</sup>  Essentially, the Court has held that, even if just a square foot of land is taken and less than one percent of the value is lost, a taking has occurred and just compensation is required.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, the Court's decisions regarding regulatory takings have been less clear and consistent, leaving executive branch agencies with wide latitude in decisions regarding the enforcement and interpretation of laws. Thus, the federal government can take property through regulations in most cases without payment. Legislative protection is therefore necessary, both as a philosophical and as a practical matter. Only then can property owners be secure in the knowledge their rights will be respected, and able to invest their savings accordingly.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although the United States was founded on the principle that government should not be allowed unfettered power to impose its will on law-abiding citizens or seize their property, federal agencies have found a loophole that allows them to usurp property through regulation. These regulatory takings can strip any American of the right to use his land as he wishes. In some cases, they even can almost wipe out the value of that land -- and with it, the life savings of individual citizens.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In light of the ambiguous and limited nature of existing protections against uncompensated regulatory takings, compounded by the increasing tendency of bureaucrats to use this ill-considered and unwise approach, legislative action is necessary to ensure that private property rights are fully protected.

<hr width=50%></center>
<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	On January 20, 1993, Bill Clinton raised his right hand and took an oath before God and the American people that he would "preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States." Now, as the next presidential election approaches, the American people are entitled to know whether he has kept his vow. Specifically, they are entitled to know something about the records being compiled in office by the men and women to whom President Clinton has granted lifetime appointments on the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts. Are Bill Clinton's judges mostly effective defenders of the Constitution, or are they legal realists who feel free to rewrite the Constitution? Are they moderate New Democrats committed to enforcing the law, or are they left-wing "political hangers-on" with a radical and unpopular agenda for social change?	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To ask these questions is <i>not</i> to challenge judicial independence nor even the fundamental decency, on a personal level, of many of the Clinton judicial appointees. The decision that faces the American people is not whether Bill Clinton's judges should be impeached, or whether he should call on some of them to resign, or whether they should have been confirmed in the first place, or whether they are nice people or smart lawyers. The question is, "Given the president's record so far, can we expect a federal judiciary shaped by Bill Clinton to respect the Constitution and honor its role as the interpreter, and not the maker, of our laws?"<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There are two major problems with Bill Clinton's judges. First, they have been unwilling to follow the Constitution in a number of very important cases. And, second, when they choose not to follow the Constitution, they have all too often replaced it with radical and unpopular left-wing social policy. In area after area, Bill Clinton's justices and judges are compiling a public "policy" record that is far to the left of the president's own public statements on similar issues. Bill Clinton may present himself to the public as a mainstream moderate, but his likable justices and judges are working quietly to impose a radical McGovernite legislative agenda on the country.

<hr width=75% size=3>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Bill Clinton's judicial appointments have had their biggest impact to date on the U.S. Supreme Court. With only two appointees, he has succeeded in transforming a moderately conservative Court into one that is (at best) one vote away from being an engine of radical left-wing social change. His justices are the political heirs of William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, and they have gotten the better of the lightweight Republican justices imposed on Presidents Reagan and Bush by a Democratic Senate (and by liberal Republicans) after the 1987 nomination of Judge Robert H. Bork was viciously defeated. Many conservatives don't realize just how liberal Bill Clinton's two affable Ivy League justices really are. In part, this is because Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer are exceptionally bright and likable people. Nevertheless, in case after case they have voted for Big Government, against federalism, for a radical secular humanism that hates religion, against traditional social values, for the "rights" of pornographers and drug dealers, against private property, for racial quotas and preferences, and against the creation of a truly colorblind America.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The two Clinton justices depart from the William J. Brennan model of liberal judicial activism in only two significant ways: first, they write (or join) opinions that are more cagey and politically astute than blunderbuss opinions such as <i>Roe v. Wade</i>. As a result, the public is unaware of the extent to which radical left-wing policy ideas are seeping into our court opinions. Second, they do not oppose the death penalty across the board, although to some extent they resist its implementation. In every other important respect, the two Clinton justices are the children of the Warren Court, far-left ACLU judicial activists intent on writing their own radical and elite prejudices into the Constitution.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Many of Bill Clinton's lower-court judges (though not all) are equally or even more left-wing, but they have been unable so far to have much of an impact, both because they remain outnumbered and because the Reagan-Bush judges on the lower courts have turned out better in most parts of the country than have their brethren on the Supreme Court. If Bill Clinton wins a second term, however, this will change. In less than four years, he has filled about 25 percent of the seats on the federal judiciary. If re-elected to another term, he will have a chance to replace hundreds more retiring judges, and many of the federal courts of appeals will flip from Reagan-Bush to Clinton-Carter majorities. And depending on how lucky he gets, he will almost certainly name another one to three left-wing Supreme Court justices. This means that the few 5 to 4 wins that conservatives have managed recently will all become losses.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Let's look at what Bill Clinton's America will then be like, and contrast it with the America he claims to want. A good way to do this is to compare the specific policies Bill Clinton says he favors with the left-wing social policies that his judges are legislating from the bench. In doing this, we should remember that not all the Reagan-Bush appointments have turned out well, nor have all of Bill Clinton's judges turned out badly. Nonetheless, the overall pattern is quite clear.<p><b>Limited Government</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<i>	"The era of big government is over" (January 23, 1996).</i></blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Or so Bill Clinton said in his last State of the Union address. Unfortunately, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer certainly have not yet been let in on the secret. Both have voted in favor of every single claim of national governmental power yet to come before them. Only a year ago, in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-1456.ZO.filt"><i>U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton</i></a>, both Clinton justices were members of a 5 to 4 majority on the Court that struck down state-imposed term limits on Members of the U.S. Congress. As a result, the term-limit laws of 22 states, 21 of which had been adopted by the voters directly in initiatives or referenda, were declared invalid. The Clinton Justice Department filed an unusual "friend of the Court" brief to encourage this result. The fact of the matter is that Bill Clinton's Supreme Court justices killed the term-limits movement: had <i>either</i> of the two Clinton justices joined Justice Clarence Thomas's elegant and brilliant dissent, we would have term limits in most of the United States today.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	These votes were not anomalies. In <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-1260.ZO.filt"><i>United States v. Lopez</i></a>, both Clinton justices again voted for the position that the national government has unlimited power to regulate <i>all</i> aspects of the nation's economic, social, and cultural life. Justice Breyer wrote the main dissent for four of the nine justices and was joined by Justice Ginsburg. He paid only lip service to the idea that the U.S. Constitution limits the power of the national government in any way whatsoever. Under Justice Breyer's interpretation of the Commerce Clause, the federal government could nationalize education curricula, local law enforcement, family law, and everything else under the sun, so long as Congress could rationally think that doing so would in some attenuated way be connected to interstate commerce. Justices Breyer and Ginsburg clearly believe that the Big Government of the Great Society and the New Deal can do anything it wants to, so long as it does not violate the Bill of Rights or its "emanations and penumbras."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This past March, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer were again on the wrong side of an important federalism case. In <i>Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida</i>, they joined a strident dissent written by Justice David Souter that argued for overturning a 200-year-old understanding that state governments are protected from lawsuits in federal court by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Casting aside years of settled understanding, Justice Souter argued that Congress should be able to authorize citizens to sue state governments without their consent -- a theory that reduces the states from a position of co-sovereignty to one of abject subordination. Chief Justice William Rehnquist won the 5 to 4 vote in <i>Seminole Tribe</i> with no margin to spare, and the dissenters promised in their opinions to try to overrule the case at the first opportunity.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Big Government activism of the Clinton justices also manifests itself in "separation of powers" cases since that doctrine, like the doctrine of federalism, is for them an inconvenient restraint on the unlimited power of the national government. Justice Ginsburg was one of only two dissenters in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-1121.ZO.filt"><i>Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc.</i></a>, an important case that limited Congress's power to retroactively command the federal courts to reopen final judgments in private civil actions already decided. Justice Breyer weighed in with a tepid separate concurrence in the case rather than join Justice Antonin Scalia's forceful majority opinion.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Clinton justices are completely unwilling to enforce the Framers' written Constitution of limited powers, federalism, and checks and balances. Their idea of constitutional law begins and largely ends with a judicially dictated jurisprudence of unenumerated rights. Even the constitutionally enumerated right that protects private property from being taken without just compensation is given short shrift: Justice Ginsburg, for example, joined three other justices in dissenting from Chief Justice Rehnquist's important opinion in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-518.ZO.filt"><i>Dolan v. City of Tigard</i></a>, which protected private property from confiscation by regulation. In that case, a municipal government was ultimately rebuffed in its attempt to force a shop owner to set aside 15 percent of her land as a public easement as a condition of receiving a building permit. Justices Ginsburg and Breyer also dissented in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-1823.ZO.filt"><i>Missouri v. Jenkins</i></a>, the Kansas City school-desegregation case. In that case, they joined an opinion that took the extraordinary position that federal judges can require local governments to raise taxes in order to fund remedial education and magnet schools.<p><b>Religious Freedoms</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<i>	"[The First Amendment] does not convert our schools into religion-free zones. . . . I am deeply troubled that so many Americans feel that their faith is threatened. . . . When the First Amendment is invoked as an obstacle to private expression of religion, it is being misused. . . . Religion has a proper place in private and a proper place in public, because the public square belongs to all Americans" (July 12, 1995).</i></blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Or so said Bill Clinton in a widely reported speech at a suburban Washington, D.C.-area high school. It went unremarked at the time, however, that his two Supreme Court appointees had recently voted in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-329.ZO.filt"><i>Rosenberger v. University of Virginia</i></a> to maintain our schools as religion-free zones. The issue in <i>Rosenberger</i> was whether a student activities fund, which was used to support various publications by student groups, could also be used to pay for the printing costs of <i>Wide Awake</i>, a Christian student newspaper. By a vote of 5 to 4, the Court said yes, over the dissenting votes of Justices Breyer and Ginsburg.
<p>
<center><hr width=85% size=3>
<font size="+2"><EM>Justices Breyer and Ginsburg joined a militantly secular <br>tirade against any role for religion in any public institution</EM></font>
<hr width=85% size=3></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The opinion that they joined was a militantly secular tirade against any role for religion in any public institution. It reasoned that not a penny of public money can ever be spent on anything religious, even though public money is routinely spent in huge quantities on educational programs hostile to religion or to religiously inspired moral values. Under the ahistorical rhetoric of the dissenters in <i>Rosenberger</i>, it is hard to see how the courts could ever uphold government chaplains, Thanksgiving Day holidays, mottoes on our currency, school vouchers, or even tax deductions for religious organizations. The <i>Rosenberger</i> dissent theorizes that no government aid can ever go to any religious organization, even if the aid is equally available to comparable secular organizations.<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<i>	"I personally did not believe that it was coercive to have a prayer at an outdoor sporting event or at a graduation event because I don't believe that it is coercive to people who don't participate in it" (November 14, 1994).</i></blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A nice sentiment, but one that is unfortunately not shared by Judges Theodore McKee and H. Lee Sarokin, Bill Clinton's two appointees to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In fact, Judge McKee wrote the <i>en banc</i> opinion for the Third Circuit in <i>ACLU and Edward Ross v. Black Horse Pike Regional Board of Education</i>, a decision that banned student-led graduation prayers throughout Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. Judge McKee's radical opinion went further than the U.S. Supreme Court has ever gone in this area by outlawing student-led graduation prayers as well as prayers organized directly by a school principal. In order to do this, Judge McKee had to reject a directly "on point" holding of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which had upheld student-led graduation prayers in <i>Jones v. Clear Creek Independent School District</i>. Four Reagan-Bush judges dissented from Judge McKee's opinion, while every Democratic appointee on the Third Circuit joined it. Judge McKee's pro-ACLU advocacy was so effective with his colleagues that he even brought a number of the feebler Reagan-Bush appointees along with him. Bill Clinton's hopes that we could have graduation prayer were dashed by his own appointee. Now, to determine what our national policy will be on this issue, an increasingly anti-religious Supreme Court will soon be obliged to hear and resolve the conflict that Judge McKee has created between the Third and Fifth Circuits on this issue.<p><b>Racial Quotas and Preferences</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<i>"I say to you, I'm against quotas. I'm against discrimination" (September 21, 1995). "Today, I am directing all our agencies to comply with the Supreme Court's Adarand decision, and also to apply the four standards of fairness to all our affirmative-action programs that I have already articulated--no quotas in theory or practice; no illegal discrimination of any kind, including reverse discrimination; no preference for people who are not qualified for any job or opportunity; and as soon as a program has succeeded, it must be retired. Any program that doesn't meet these four principles must be eliminated or reformed to meet them" (July 19, 1995).</i></blockquote><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Great rhetoric but, unfortunately, there are two Clinton appointees who will not be complying with the Supreme Court's 5 to 4 decision in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-1841.ZO.filt"><i>Adarand</i></a> outlawing quotas in federal programs. Yes, that's right -- Justices Breyer and Ginsburg both dissented in that case, and Justice Ginsburg actually wrote one of the dissenting opinions. She tried to put a pro-racial-preference spin on Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's plurality opinion, and said she saw "today's opinion as one that allows our precedent to evolve, still to be informed by and responsive to changing conditions." Translated into everyday English, Justice Ginsburg hopes to distinguish or overrule <i>Adarand</i> at the first opportunity.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And what, you may wonder, ws the "moderate" federal affirmative-action program in <i>Adarand</i> that Justices Ginsburg and Breyer were so eager to uphold? It was an explicit racial-preference program for government highway subcontractors, a preference so blatant that even many who support affirmative-action recruitment efforts in universities have condemned programs like this one. Justice Ginsburg was so enthusiastic about this particular program that she not only authored a dissenting opinion herself but also joined <i>two</i> other dissenting opinions: one by Justice Souter and another, even more radical, opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens. Justice Ginsburg was the only other member of the Court to join Justice Stevens's opinion, which would appear to uphold all federal racial-preference programs of any kind that are, in his opinion, well motivated.
<p>
<center>
<hr width=80% size=3>
<font size="+2"><EM>Justices Breyer and Ginsburg have voted to uphold every <br>racial preference or quota that has come before them</EM></font><hr width=80% size=3></center>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Justices Ginsburg and Breyer's votes on the racial preference/quota issue in <i>Adarand</i> were not at all idiosyncratic. Rather, they form part of a pattern in which both justices have voted to uphold every racial preference or quota that has ever come before them. In particular, they have dissented in every voting-rights case involving challenges to political redistricting, decisions in which race played the predominant role. This past year, they joined the minority in the 5 to 4 decisions in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-923.ZO.filt"><i>Shaw v. Hunt</i></a> and <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-805.ZO.filt"><i>Bush v. Vera</i></a>, in which the Court threw out racially gerrymandered congressional districts in North Carolina and Texas. Last year, Justice Ginsburg wrote the dissent for four justices (including Justice Breyer) in the companion cases of <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-631.ZO.filt"><i>Miller v. Johnson</i></a> and <i>United States v. Hayes</i>, in which the Court invalidated racial gerrymanders in Louisiana and Georgia.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The issue in these cases is whether it is unconstitutional to create wildly odd-shaped legislative districts for the purpose of maximizing the proportion of voters of a particular race, when such districts violate traditional districting standards of compactness and affinity of community interests. The purpose of this whole enterprise is to use federal voting-rights law to allocate congressional seats by race, so that every racial and ethnic group in the nation is proportionately represented according to their numbers in the population at large. While greater minority representation in public life is to be desired, this particular quota regime is in fact a stealthy imposition of the system of proportional representation used in places like Israel, Japan, Russia, and Germany (under the Weimar Republic). Everyone familiar with the unstable politics of those countries knows that this kind of rigid proportional representation is disastrous for social peace, because it rewards extremists and penalizes consensus building. For this reason, many have long thought that the Anglo-American tradition of allocating electoral districts geographically is better than the Continental European tradition of proportional representation. <p>
<center><hr width=80% size=3>
<font size="+2"><EM>The Ginsburg-Breyer view of racial gerrymandering<br> would
authorize a racial quota system for Congress</EM></font>
<hr width=80% size=3></center>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Ginsburg-Breyer view of racial gerrymandering would authorize nothing less than a racial quota system for Congress. By enshrining a system of racial and ethnic proportional representation, it would also codify a political system of racial spoils and push us toward the unstable electoral system that has been the bane of Continental European democracies. 

<p><b>Crime</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <i>	"The United States cannot tolerate the rates of crime and violence which have come to be almost commonplace in the last several years. We have to intensify our efforts to reduce crime" (July 28, 1996).</i></blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Few issues are of greater concern to most Americans than the fight against violent street crime and illegal drugs, and, as is well-known, Bill Clinton loves to boast that his administration has been tough on crime and on punishing criminals. Once again, however, his judicial appointees often seem to be seriously "off message" when criminal-law cases are before the courts. In its most recent term, the Supreme Court decided <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-1511.ZO.filt"><i>Lewis v. Casey</i></a>, a major case bearing on the right of prisoners to enjoy free prison libraries and legal assistance. The case involved how broadly to read an activist opinion from the 1970s by the late Justice Thurgood Marshall, which requires state taxpayers to subsidize frivolous prison litigation by providing free legal help and library facilities. In this particular case, a federal court in Arizona issued sweeping orders to state prison officials to address the complaints of state prisoners about the quality of their legal research materials.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Justice Scalia, writing for five Reagan-Bush justices, seized on the case as a chance to cut back on Thurgood Marshall's requirement that state governments subsidize prisoner lawsuits. Scalia argued that the federal courts had no business trying to run state prisons, and he set some common-sense limits on the bad precedent by making it inapplicable when prisoners' claims were frivolous or when prisoners were trying to bring legal action irrelevant to sentences and terms of confinement. Justice Thomas, in a brilliant concurrence, even called on the Court to overrule its offensive and nonsensical precedent. Justices Ginsburg and Breyer, however, chose to dissent from most of Justice Scalia's opinion. They joined a handwringing, meandering dissent that complained that Scalia was going too far and too fast in protecting state prison authorities and taxpayers from the desire of prisoners for good libraries.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This same term, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer also joined a sweeping opinion by Justice Stevens in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/95-266.ZO.filt"><i>Jaffee v. Redmond</i></a> that recognized a disturbing new rule that could keep vital evidence of wrong behavior from being used in federal court for either civil or criminal trials. In that case, the Court held that conversations between a patient and her psychiatrist <i>or social worker</i> are protected from compelled disclosure during the course of a federal criminal or civil trial. The Court's decision to exclude a sweeping new category of evidence in this case is disturbingly reminiscent of the Warren Court's great exclusionary-rule blunders in the 1960s. Every time evidence is excluded from the courtroom, the task of proving the guilt (or innocence) of the culpable becomes more difficult. To impose this burden upon prosecutors in order to protect communications not only with psychiatrists but also with social workers is sheer folly. As Justice Scalia noted in his dissent, we don't allow a testimonial privilege in federal court for conversations with parents, siblings, children, or bartenders. Why on earth would we carve out such a privilege for social workers? Sadly, the case was lost by a vote of 7 to 2.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Justice Breyer cast two other noteworthy votes in criminal cases this term. First, he joined two separate opinions in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/95-8836.ZO.filt"><i>Felker v. Turpin</i></a> that sought to water down the new federal law for expediting the application of the death penalty. Second, he joined the dissent in an important 5 to 4 decision on whether police can apply a property seizure law designed to discourage prostitution. Had the dissenters' view prevailed, the customers of prostitutes would have been able to protect their cars from confiscation by co-registering them with the very wives they were betraying.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There are countless lower-court criminal-law opinions by Clinton appointees that are deeply disturbing. To mention just one example, consider <i>United States v. Hamrick</i>, decided by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, where Clinton appointee M. Blane Michael joined a dissent that would have exonerated a defendant who had mailed a bomb to the U.S. Attorney who had prosecuted him. Judge Michael was of the view that the bomb was not a "deadly weapon" within the meaning of the federal criminal law, because it was badly made and didn't cause too much damage when it exploded!<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As these examples illustrate, this administration is appointing some disturbingly fuzzy minds to the federal bench. Once again Bill Clinton's tough talk on crime is revealed to be nothing more than talk. His judges are rapidly bringing us back to the bad old days of 1960s Warren Court liberalism.<p><b>Mainstream Values</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>
	"When I sought the presidency, I said that I wanted . . . to put mainstream values back at the heart of social policy. . . . [W]e're moving in the right direction to reassert and reinsert into American life mainstream values. And, I believe the initiatives of our Administration have played a role in that" (October 13, 1995). "I know not everybody's going to be in a stable, traditional family like you see in one of those 1950s sitcoms, but we'd be better off if more people were" (September 9, 1994).</i></blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Mainstream values? Stable traditional families? So far, Bill Clinton's justices and judges have voted to: strike down his own liberalized policy on "gays in the military" as unconstitutional; require that gays be given special rights under certain state and local civil rights laws, thus forcing private landlords, elementary-school boards, and employers to associate with militant gays even if they don't want to; oppose an important Utah statute that regulates abortions <i>after 20 weeks</i>; and, incorporate a particularly strident and unreasonable version of the failed Equal Rights Amendment into the federal Constitution. And, they have managed to do all of this in just the last two years!<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Let's take these "mainstream values" judicial opinions one at a time. As is well known, Bill Clinton shot himself in the foot shortly after he was elected by attempting to change the U.S. military's long-standing policy of refusing to allow homosexuals to serve in the military. After an enormous public uproar, he was forced to back down by moderate liberals like Senator Sam Nunn and Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In November 1993, he signed a statute creating a new "don't ask, don't tell" compromise policy; it was designed to quell public outrage by keeping outspoken gay individuals out of the armed forces, while making clear that the military should not pursue the expulsion of gays who did not commit homosexual acts and who did not discuss their private sexual activities and inclinations.<p>
<p>
<center><hr width=90% size=3>
<font size="+2"><EM>A constitutional right for homosexuals to marry, adopt <br>children, or teach in grade school may be just around the corner</EM></font><hr width=90% size=3></center> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Since then two federal courts of appeal have heard cases on this issue. In <i>Stefan v. Perry</i>, the D.C. Circuit voted 6 to 4 that the long-standing pre-1993 policy of excluding homosexuals from the military did not violate the Constitution. Bill Clinton's sole appointee, Judge Judith Rogers, voted to invalidate the policy, as did all the Carter appointees. All of the Reagan-Bush appointees voted to uphold the policy. On April 5, 1996, the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit voted 9 to 4 to uphold the constitutionality of Bill Clinton's own "don't ask, don't tell" policy. Amazingly, <i>both</i> of Bill Clinton's appointees to that Court, Judges M. Blane Michael and Diana Motz, voted to strike down his own quite liberal policy as unconstitutional.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But Judges Rogers, Michael, and Motz are by no means out of step for the Clinton judiciary on these matters. Last May, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer joined a 6 to 3 majority in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-1039.ZO.filt"><i>Romer v. Evans</i></a>. In that case, gay-rights groups had challenged a ballot initiative passed by Colorado voters that overrode all attempts by Colorado towns to enact special civil-rights protections for gays. Had the two Clinton justices joined the three dissenters in that case, Colorado's policy of legalizing homosexuality but not granting it preferential status would still be good law.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Some conservatives have been tempted to read the Court's confused opinion in <i>Romer</i>, which Justices Breyer and Ginsburg joined without comment, quite narrowly. This is almost certainly a mistake. The opinion contains opaque references to the illegality of "status discrimination" -- a key issue in the "don't ask, don't tell" cases heard so far by the D.C. Circuit and the Fourth Circuit. If the Court pursues this idea of outlawing "status discrimination," and if it continues to view any failure to treat homosexuals like heterosexuals as being evidence only of "irrational animus," then there is no reason to think that a constitutional right for homosexuals to marry, adopt children, and teach in grade schools is not right around the corner. The Court's meandering opinion and the silence of the five justices who joined it offer no assurance whatsoever that <i>any</i> differential treatment of homosexuality is still allowed. Those conservatives who took comfort in the Court's refusal to say it was applying "strict scrutiny" (the highest level of judicial scrutiny) to classifications based on sexual orientation are being misled. The Court is applying strict scrutiny in this case, without acknowledging candidly that it is doing so.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The "mainstream values" of the Clinton judges don't end with issues bearing on homosexuality. In <i>Leavitt v. Jane L.</i>, the Court voted 5 to 4 to summarily reverse a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit that invalidated those portions of a Utah state law that prohibited abortions after 20 weeks, except where the mother's life or medical health will be seriously threatened or where the child will be born with "grave defects." The case arose because under <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/91-744.ZO.filt"><i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey</i></a> (1992), the Utah statute was unconstitutional insofar as it prohibited abortions before the fetus is "viable" outside the womb.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Utah law, however, clearly provided for the "severability" of its other provisions in the event that one part of the law was ruled unconstitutional. The Tenth Circuit had willfully refused to sever the statute so that abortions after 20 weeks could be regulated. Five Justices joined a rare, short <i>per curiam</i> opinion summarily reversing this as blatant error. This short opinion reflected nothing more than the long-settled idea that even after <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, the states can still regulate third-trimester, "post-viability" abortions so long as no "undue burden" is placed upon the mother's right to protect her own life or health. Justices Ginsburg and Breyer, however, dissented. They claimed variously that the Court should defer here to the Tenth Circuit, that summary reversal should be used rarely, and (implicitly) that the issue was not important enough to merit a grant of <i>certiorari</i> and a summary reversal. Do they intend in a Clinton second term to try to extend the near-total right to abortion in Roe to third-trimester abortions or to infanticide? Why would anyone with "mainstream values" join an angry four-justice dissent in an easy severability case like this?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Then, of course, there is the Court's "mainstream" opinion by Justice Ginsburg in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-1941.ZO.filt"><i>United States v. Virginia</i></a> where the Court held that the Virginia Military Institute, an all-male military academy funded by the state of Virginia, could not constitutionally exclude women. This case is remarkable less for its invalidation of the all-male program at VMI than for its writing into the Constitution a particularly extreme version of the Equal Rights Amendment -- which had failed to win popular support and passage through legitimate channels in the 1970s and early 1980s. 
<p><center>
<hr width=85% size=3><font size="+2"><em>Single-sex combat units, draft registration, football<br>
teams, and private schools may now be unconstitutional</em></font>
<hr width=85% size=3></center>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Justice Ginsburg wielded the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection clause to create a new standard of strict scrutiny for gender classifications, while using a milder label that minimizes the political fallout for liberals in the White House and in Congress. Henceforth, says Justice Ginsburg, gender classifications require "an exceedingly persuasive justification" and are subject to "skeptical scrutiny." They may not be used to do anything that <i>in the view of the justices</i> "creates or perpetuates the legal, social, or economic inferiority of women" nor may they rely on anything that <i>in the view of the justices</i> involves an "overbroad generalization about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of men and women." Thus if American society thinks that single-sex draft registration or combat rules are desirable, it is going to have to say something "exceedingly persuasive" to a "skeptical" Justice Ginsburg. If American society wants single-sex sports teams at its state schools, it must have something "exceedingly persuasive" to say to a "skeptical" Justice Ginsburg. If American society wants to offer charitable tax-exempt status to a private women's college or to a Roman Catholic Church priesthood, it is going to have to say something "exceedingly persuasive" to a "skeptical" Justice Ginsburg.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As Chief Justice Rehnquist (in his concurrence) and Justice Scalia (in his dissent) both pointed out, this anti-democratic, elitist nonsense has nothing at all to do with the very important subject of the equal rights of women. Justice Ginsburg made no effort in her opinion to explain why she thought VMI was unconstitutional while single-sex combat units or football teams were O.K. That is because she is not interested in equal rights for women in the sense that most Americans would understand that term. What Justice Ginsburg wanted to do all along, and did do, in the VMI case was to lay the doctrinal groundwork for a final assault on <i>all</i> remaining classifications and social practices, both public and private, wherein any distinction between men and women is made according to gender. She does not identify a single gender classification or social practice, either public or private, that she is definitively willing to approve. The door is being flung open to a massive judicial assault on our sexist military services, football teams, private single-sex schools, and religious organizations.<p><b>The V-Chip</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>
	"I call on Congress to pass the requirement for a V-chip in TV sets so that parents can screen out programs they believe are inappropriate for their children. When parents control what their children see, that is not censorship. That is enabling parents to assume more personal responsibility for their children's upbringing" (January 23, 1996)</i>.</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Bill Clinton likes to leave voters with the impression that he is concerned about inappropriate television programs aimed at children. Unfortunately, Justice Ginsburg did not agree in the Supreme Court's recent <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/95-124.ZO.filt"><i>Denver Cable</i></a> case. In that case, the law in question sought to modify the public-access policy governing local cable networks that required them to broadcast indecent programming without restrictions. Astonishingly, Justice Ginsburg was one of only two justices on the Court who voted to hold unconstitutional <i>every single restriction</i> before the court that was aimed at suppressing indecent programming available to children watching TV. Justice Breyer's more moderate opinion would uphold a restriction like the V-chip, but not a reasonable requirement that people who want to subscribe to indecent programming must do so by taking some affirmative step to sign up for it. Evidently Justice Breyer is more concerned about the privacy rights of adults who watch indecent programming than about the rights of children who may accidentally see such programming on cable TV.<p>
<center><hr width=65% size=3><font size="+2"><em>The last two years have seen a large number<br> of opinions that are contemptuous of the <br>
values and prerogatives of the American people</em></font>
<hr width=65% size=3></center>  

	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Justices Ginsburg and Breyer's extreme solicitude for the consumers of pornography is shared by both of Bill Clinton's two appointees to the D.C. Circuit. Judges Judith Rogers and David Tatel were on the dissenting side of a 7 to 4 <i>en banc</i> decision that upheld a federal law restricting the broadcast of indecent material to the hours of 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. All seven judges in the majority were Reagan-Bush appointees, while all four of the dissenters were appointed by Presidents Clinton or Carter. It is by no means clear to me that this law would survive review on the Supreme Court today, given Justices Ginsburg and Breyer's views on indecency, the First Amendment, and the rights of children.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As I hope I have made clear, the U.S. Supreme Court is now dangerously adrift. The last two years have seen an increasingly large number of opinions that are contemptuous of the beliefs, values, and prerogatives of the American people as well as of the democratic process itself. The Clinton justices have almost always been on the wrong side of these cases, and in many instances they have joined minorities of four in support of propositions that are ludicrous and offensive. Although Justices Souter, Kennedy, and O'Connor deserve some of the blame, the other three Reagan-Bush justices have been stellar. Justices O'Connor and Kennedy have joined those three to produce some very important 5 to 4 victories in fighting off racial quotas, allowing religious speech, curbing Big Government, protecting private property, and fighting crime. If Bill Clinton is re-elected and replaces any of those five justices with another "moderate" like Justices Ginsburg and Breyer, then every single conservative victory of the last 28 years will be at great risk of being overturned. The Warren Court ended when Richard Nixon won the presidential election of 1968; the presidential election of 1996 will determine whether the era that Nixon inaugurated is now to be replaced by a new burst of radical left-wing judging.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But what are we to make of Bill Clinton's role in all of this? Is it remotely plausible to think that he doesn't realize how far to the left his own justices and judges are of his own public statements on issue after issue? No, it is not plausible. Bill Clinton is a former professor of constitutional law, a Rhodes Scholar, and a graduate of Yale Law School. He knows perfectly well the views of the justices and judges he is nominating.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Obviously, these are very difficult times for anyone who believes in a restrained, law-abiding federal judiciary. There is, however, one consoling thought. If Bill Clinton is re-elected, he will have a mandate from the American people to rein in Big Government, protect religious speech, oppose racial preferences, preserve mainstream values, fight indecent television programming aimed at children, and fight crime and drugs. Which jurist could Bill Clinton possibly name to the Supreme Court whom he could count on to do all of the things that he says he wants done? The answer is obvious: renominate Judge Robert H. Bork.<p>

F.Y.I. No. 103<br>
May 21, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%>

Very soon, both the House of Representatives and the Senate will debate identical versions of the <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:h.r.03144:">Defend America Act of 1996</a>. The Defend America Act commits the nation to deployment of a national missile defense system by 2003. It is similar to the provision in the FY 1996 defense authorization bill vetoed by President Bill Clinton on December 28, 1995. How Members of Congress vote on this bill will rest primarily on their understanding of the immediacy of the missile threat. Members who see the threat as present and growing will likely vote in favor of the bill; those who see the threat as remote are likely to vote against it.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In November 1995, the U.S. intelligence community issued an intelligence assessment describing the ballistic missile threat to the United States.<sup>1</sup>  Among other things, it concluded that there is little threat of a missile attack on the U.S. during the next 15 years. President Clinton and congressional opponents of the Defend America Act use this assessment to justify their opposition to deploying a national missile defense as soon as possible. Since this assessment is crucial to the coming debate on missile defense, and since the vote on this legislation may well determine the future of U.S. security against missile threats, the assessment deserves thorough analysis.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Normally, it is impossible for the public to pass judgment on the content of intelligence assessments because they are classified. In the case of the intelligence assessment on the missile threat, however, the same summary version that was provided to President Clinton has been published.<sup>2</sup>  Thus, the public has an opportunity to decide whether the assessment is credible.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
An evaluation of this intelligence assessment reveals that it is not credible. In fact, it contains a number of flaws. The authors of the assessment:
<P><ul>
<li><b>Inexplicably discount the threat posed today by long-range missiles in China and  Russia.</b> The intelligence community concluded that the U.S. will not face a missile threat for the next 15 years. But this inexplicably discounts the already existing threat posed by Russia and China. The assumption is that because these countries already have long-range missiles, nothing new will happen in the next 15 years to change the level of the threat. But things can change, and very quickly. This is particularly true regarding the emergence of hostile intent toward the U.S.
<p>
The immediacy of Chinese hostility was revealed earlier this year when Chinese officials were quoted as saying that China could take military action against Taiwan without the U.S. intervening because U.S. leaders "care more about Los Angeles than they do about Taiwan."<sup>3</sup>  This was nothing less than a thinly veiled threat to attack the U.S. with long-range nuclear missiles if it intervened on behalf of Taiwan.
<p>
Another potential nuclear threat is posed by Russia -- as Clinton's Pentagon already has admitted. In fact, the intelligence report's findings on Russia blatantly contradict a fundamental conclusion of the Clinton Administration's own 1994 Nuclear Posture Review, its official statement of nuclear arms policy. This statement recognizes the volatility of the U.S. relationship with Russia.<sup>4</sup>  It even includes an option for "hedging" against a reversal in U.S.-Russian relations by arguing that America may have to exceed limits imposed by arms control agreements with the Russians if Moscow again becomes hostile. Russia is a strategic wild card -- a fact which the authors of this intelligence report blithely ignore. In short, the report's "findings" are fundamentally at odds with the Clinton Administration's own nuclear policy.
<p>
<li><b>Write off Alaska and Hawaii as territory to defend against missile attack.</b> The finding that the U.S. will not face a missile threat for 15 years is based on examining the missile threat to "the contiguous 48 states and Canada."  Alaska and Hawaii are not considered. Why this is done becomes clear when it is revealed that North Korea is developing a missile, the <I>Taepo Dong</I> 2, that could reach Alaska and Hawaii. North Korea could deploy this missile in three to five years. It is truly remarkable that the Clinton Administration appears to believe that the people of Alaska and Hawaii are strategic second-class citizens who deserve less protection than New Yorkers or Californians. It is even more remarkable that the President appears to believe that Canadians deserve more protection than Alaskans and Hawaiians.
<p>
<li><b>Are overly optimistic about how long it will take rogue states to develop long-range missiles.</b> The intelligence estimate states: "We [of the intelligence community] are likely to detect any indigenous long-range missile program many years before deployment."  But the intelligence community has a poor track record in detecting illicit weapons programs. It failed, for example, to detect major portions of Iraq's nuclear weapons program. International inspections of Iraq's nuclear program following the Persian Gulf War revealed that it was far larger and far more advanced than the U.S. intelligence community had predicted before the inspections.<sup>5</sup>  Saddam Hussein was only months away from deploying an explosive nuclear bomb, not years away as the intelligence community had predicted.
<p>
<li><b>Unwisely downplay the potential impact of foreign assistance on the missile threat to America.</b> They conclude that foreign assistance is a "wild card" that could be used by developing countries to accelerate their missile programs. Chinese assistance, for example, reportedly helped Iraq extend the range of their Soviet Scud-B missiles.<sup>6</sup>  The post-Gulf War inspections in Iraq revealed that the Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission relied on a wide variety of foreign sources to accelerate its nuclear weapons program. The foreign sources include corporations in the U.S. and Germany. This is one reason why the U.S. was surprised by the scope and advanced state of the Iraqi program. United Nations inspector David Kay commented on October 17, 1991, that "there is no region of the world that you will find that did not contribute to [the Iraqi nuclear weapons] program."<sup>7</sup>
<P>
<li><b>Underestimate the impact of space launch vehicle development on missile proliferation.</b> The intelligence estimate states that "if a country were to purchase an SLV [space launch vehicle], converting it to an ICBM [intercontinental ballistic missile] would involve technological obstacles roughly as challenging as those involved in an indigenous ICBM program."  This statement is surprising since space launch vehicle and missile components are very similar. Of the eight essential components of a ballistic missile, all but one -- the warhead -- are found in somewhat modified forms in space launch vehicles.<sup>8</sup>  Thus, the transfer of space launch vehicle components is virtually certain to assist countries in developing missiles.
<p>
Downplaying the potential impact of widely available space launch vehicle technology on missile development programs reflects the intelligence community's historic tendency to underestimate the pace of technological advancement in foreign weapons programs. Fifty years ago, U.S. intelligence failed to predict Soviet acquisition of atomic bomb technology. The Soviet Union tested its first atomic weapon in August 1949, years earlier than was predicted. America was shocked for a second time in 1957 when the Soviet Union launched its <I>Sputnik</I> satellite. Predicting that a missile threat to America is 15 years away indicates the same sort of complacency that resulted in surprise at the Soviet atomic test in 1949 and <I>Sputnik</I> launch in 1957.
<p>
<lI><b>Are completely unrealistic about the potential sale of long-range missiles and space launch vehicles.</b> The intelligence assessment concludes: "We expect countries that currently have ICBMs will not sell them."  This finding is contradicted by historical experience. China sold intermediate-range missiles to Saudi Arabia in 1988 and Pakistan in 1993. Why the intelligence community is so certain that China would not sell long-range missiles is a complete mystery. Moreover, even the Clinton Administration recognizes that Russia will be marketing its ballistic missiles as space launch vehicles. On September 28, 1995, the Clinton Administration agreed to modify the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) to lift restrictions on converting missiles to space launch vehicles.<sup>9</sup>  It did this to satisfy the Russians, who want to sell modified SS-25 <I>Sickle</I> long-range ballistic missiles as space launch vehicles. In short, the Administration agreed to modify an existing arms control treaty precisely to permit the kind of proliferation which is dismissed so easily in the intelligence estimate, and which it supposedly opposes so vehemently in its declared anti-proliferation policy. Apparently the Russians are beginning to implement this policy. Press reports on a classified Pentagon study reveal that Russia is selling SS-18 <I>Satan</I> ICBM components to the Chinese as space launch vehicle technology.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Inexplicably dismiss the threat of accidental or unauthorized missile launches against the U.S.</b> The intelligence assessment states: "We conclude that the current threat to North America from unauthorized or accidental launch of Russian or Chinese strategic missiles remains remote and has not changed significantly from that of the past decade."  Yet Russia and China are undergoing great political turmoil. Any fracturing of either country's political leadership cannot help but cause a break in the chain of command governing nuclear weapons. This is precisely what happened when an attempted <I>coup d'etat</I> against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev took place in 1991. Nobody knew who had control of the Soviet nuclear arsenal during that time. Such political crises occur frequently, with little or no warning. It is all but impossible to understand why the intelligence community is so confident that the threat of accidental or unauthorized missile launches is so remote.
</ul><p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The intelligence assessment of the missile threat to the United States contains so many flaws, contradictions, and ambiguities that critics naturally wonder about its objectivity. There are deep suspicions in Congress and the expert community that political leaders in the Clinton Administration intervened in the intelligence process to get the answer they wanted. Indeed, the Clinton Administration made a decision in 1993 to cut the national missile defense budget by some 80 percent. The Administration may have felt pressured to justify this decision by encouraging an intelligence assessment that minimized the threat of a missile attack on the U.S. The U.S. General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, is trying to determine whether the Clinton Administration did in fact intervene. If it is found that the Administration "cooked" this assessment, then President Clinton's veto of the FY 1996 defense authorization bill will appear to be not merely an act of willful ignorance, but the <I>coup de grace</I> in a shameless plan of deception.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Whether the intelligence assessment is objective or not is now a matter for Congress to decide. However, for purposes of the debate on the Defend America Act, it is enough to know that the possibility exists that this assessment was "cooked," that it is fatally flawed, and that it is therefore a poor guide to policy.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress should not rely on this assessment as an excuse for deferring the decision to deploy a national missile defense system. Further delay in deployment could result in a surprise missile attack against which the U.S. would have no defense, and which could cost many American lives. If this were to occur, Members of Congress would not be able to hide their responsibility. The time for Congress to live up to this responsibility is now, before it is too late.

<h3>RUSSIAN HARDLINERS' MILITARY DOCTRINE: IN THEIR OWN WORDS</h3>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some Western leaders and policymakers are remarkably unconcerned about the prospects of a victory by Communist Party candidate Gennady Zyuganov in the Russian presidential elections on June 16. Thinking that a communist return to power in Russia will be no different than it was in Poland or Slovakia, these Westerners appear to believe that a communist victory in Russia will not disrupt the burgeoning "partnership" between Russia and the West.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
However, the report translated here paints a different picture. Written by hard-line members of a nationalist-communist coalition that supports Zyuganov for president but maintains close ties with such nationalists as Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the document contains advice for Russian military planners that is profoundly disturbing for the United States and the West. No amount of "mirror imaging" in the U.S. or Western democracies can obscure the meaning of Russian hardliners as rendered in their own words.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Among the report's main points:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Russia should be moving aggressively to adopt a nuclear deterrence posture for perceived non-nuclear threats. Strategic nuclear forces should be the highest priority.
<p>
<li>Russia should be able to fight at least one full-scale regional war, one smaller-scale conflict, and at least three "peacemaking" operations outside its borders.
<p>
<li>The U.S. and NATO remain Russia's enemies. Other foes include Turkey and countries of the former Soviet Union such as the Baltic States.
<p>
<li>Russia's armed forces should be drastically reorganized on the basis of smaller, highly mobile units.
<p>
<li>Russia should be prepared to undertake military operations to reconquer the New Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union. These operations would include seizing command-and-control sites, "eliminating" the political-military leadership, and deporting "some categories" of the hostile population, presumably to the Russian hinterland.
</ul> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The authors of these positions are analysts who advise the president and the Russian General Staff on military and security matters. One author is Lieutenant General Valeriy Dementyev, who was once Deputy Chief of Armaments in the USSR Ministry of defense, and today is an analyst with the Institute for Defense Research (known by its Russian acronym INOBIS, <I>Institut oboronnykh issledovanii</I>) in the town of Kaliningrad near Moscow. The other author is Anton Surikov, a defense analyst formerly associated with the USA-Canada Institute and also an analyst at the Institute for Defense Research. The secretive INOBIS is financed by the Russian General Staff, military-industrial enterprises, and the Atomic Energy Ministry, and conducts classified research. It was founded by senior figures from the KGB and the Russian military-industrial complex. Also instrumental in its founding was Yuri Maslyukov, Zyuganov's chief economic policy maker and the former head of the USSR's Central Planning Authority (the all-powerful GosPlan). INOBIS reportedly enjoys an attentive audience at the Ministry of Defense.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
People like Surikov and Dementyev advise Communist Party leader Zyuganov, radical nationalist Zhirinovsky, and President Boris Yeltsin's Atomic Energy Minister, Viktor Mikhailov. Even if Zyuganov loses the presidential elections, the views expressed in this report will influence Russian military and security policy. Many in the Russian armed forces and security services support a more aggressive stance for Russia -- a viewpoint clearly expressed in this document.

<center><h3>ARMY REFORM AND SECURITY:<br>
Conceptual Theses of the Strategy of Reforming The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation</h3>

by Valeriy Dementyev, Lieutenant General (Ret.) and Doctor of Technical Sciences, and Anton Surikov, Doctor of Technical Sciences
</center><P>

<b>Deterrence and Defense</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The defensive character of the policy of the Russian Federation (RF) in the military area and the absence in Russia of aggressive intentions was proclaimed in the <I>Basic Provisions of the Military Doctrine of the RF</I>, unveiled in 1993.<sup>1</sup>  This thesis, however, is in need of clarification in terms of the precise tasks that the Armed Forces face. Among them, first of all, three basic tasks should be singled out:
<P><ul>
<li>The Armed Forces must have the capability to deter effectively the threat of nuclear attack on Russia and on the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which have signed the agreement on collective security. In this, the talk is exclusively about deterrence, because national military thought acknowledges the impossibility of victory in a global nuclear conflict on the strategic level.
<p>
<li>The Armed Forces should be aimed both at deterring a large-scale military attack on Russia and the CIS by foreign governments or a coalition thereof using conventional armaments, and deterring and repelling military aggression from the outside that has more limited goals. Deterrence of such threats can be nuclear.
<p>
<li>The Armed Forces must have the capability to conduct local wars and carry out peacemaking operations, primarily within the bounds of the former USSR, taking into account that the former Soviet Union is a zone of Russian vital interests and home to 25 million ethnic Russians. Currently, the Russian Federation is conducting two local wars on the territory of the former USSR -- in Chechnya and Tajikistan. Besides that, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are fulfilling peacemaking functions that are in fact deterring Georgia and Moldova from commencing aggression towards Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Trans-Dniester.<sup>2</sup>  Taking into account the practices of 1990-1996, the demand must be put forward, in part, for the capability to wage local wars within the bounds of the former USSR. The Armed Forces should be able to take part simultaneously in at least one local war of high intensity, at least one "slow" local war, and at least three "frozen" local conflicts and peacemaking operations.
</ul><P>
<b>Russia's Enemies</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The thesis of the <I>Basic Provisions</I> is that Russia has no outside enemies. Experience has demonstrated the falseness of this thesis. Because of Russia's weak government and the progressive degradation of its military and economic potential, outside enemies are making themselves known in a bolder and more open fashion.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Currently, Russia's basic probable enemies remain the United States and the NATO countries. The United States has a vast nuclear missile potential which, if used, can destroy Russia as a state. It was created with the goal of nuclear blackmail of the USSR and was oriented mainly at carrying out a first nuclear strike. At present, in spite of ongoing reductions within the framework of START 1, orientation toward a first strike not only has not disappeared, but actually has been increased. This is due primarily to the policy of the [American] authorities, particularly the U.S. Congress, toward revision of the ABM Treaty of 1972 and creates the prerequisites for development and subsequent deployment of a strategic ABM system by the year 2003.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In contrast to the Warsaw Pact Treaty Organization, not only has NATO, led by the USA, not been dissolved, but the decision already has been made to enlarge it. NATO's infrastructure, despite the reduction of personnel and armaments taking place under the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, is still oriented toward actions in an eastern direction. The preservation of its basic military infrastructure gives it an opportunity to build up its troops quickly should such a decision be made. Although, as of today, the potential of NATO conventional forces is not sufficient to conduct a large-scale offensive operation against the Russian Federation similar to Hitler's invasion of 1941, over time these forces can be augmented and advanced to the borders of the Russian Federation. In this light, the plans for NATO eastern expansion look clearly aggressive. Moreover, in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary measures are now being taken to adapt the infrastructure, airport network, communications, etc., for NATO use. One Hungarian airport, without prior permission, has been turned into an American military base.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It should be noted that the experience of the U.S. and NATO in the Persian Gulf in 1991, and in the former Yugoslavia in 1995-1996, demonstrates that the [Western] bloc today has sufficient potential to carry out military operations with limited goals on the periphery of post-Soviet territory. In this scenario, the greatest danger is presented by aggression from three possible directions: first, because of Norway's recent decision to expand NATO military activity in the north of the country, from the north against the Russian Federation's Northern Fleet on the Kola peninsula; second, in connection with the discussion about creating a 60,000-strong Baltic Corps from German, Danish, and Polish detachments, from the northwest in the form of military intervention by NATO in case of a conflict between Russia and the Baltic countries; and third, in light of the calls being heard to grant the countries of the Caspian basin NATO security guarantees similar to those given to the countries of the Persian Gulf, from the south, where the key role is assigned to a member of NATO -- Turkey.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Turkey possesses an army of 600,000. Its navy is already bigger than the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Turkey has unilaterally altered the status of the Black Sea straits, threatening Russia's interests. It has voiced numerous military threats toward Russia's ally Armenia with regard to the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. Turkey is attempting to attract into its sphere of influence the Turkish-speaking and Muslim regions of the former USSR. It has been proven that Turkish officials supported [President] Dudaev's illegal military detachments in Chechnya. They also assisted the "Gray Wolves" organization in Azerbaijan and a number of other nationalistic military detachments throughout the CIS.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Japan, which is an ally of the United States and has territorial claims against the Russian Federation, might also be considered a potential enemy of Russia. Today, Japan does not have sufficient military power to start an aggressive military operation against Russia in order to take the islands of the Southern Kurils by force, but it does have the necessary potential to expand its Armed Forces quickly.
<p>
<b>China and Iran Are Not Enemies</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Obviously, the fact that Russia and China are neighbors must not be ignored when planning the development of the Armed Forces. At the same time, the military policy of the Russian Federation should be formed with extreme caution with respect to China. The U.S., seeing China as a potential enemy, is interested in creating a military confrontation between Russia and China.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Similarly, the U.S. has a clear interest in the confrontation between the Russian Federation and Iran, another American enemy. The "Islamic threat" to the CIS is used as an argument to promote a similar confrontation. After a close examination of this problem, however, it becomes clear that the extremist movements in the CIS that operate under pseudo-Islamic slogans are relying as a rule not on Iran, but on pro-Western regimes in the Muslim world: Turkey, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In light of the above, it is not practical to view Iran and China as probable enemies of Russia, at least in the near future, because there are no objective causes for confrontation between the Russian Federation and those countries.
<p>
<b>Recreating the Empire</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Within the territory of post-Soviet Russia, the main enemies are the forces of aggressive nationalism that operate with support from outside and have armed forces of their own: armies, police, and other militarized detachments of the Baltic states; Dudayev's illegal armed forces; Tajik opposition illegal armed forces; and others. The main causes of conflict involving the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation within the territory of the former USSR are the following:
<ul><p>
<li>Ethnic discord and genocide of national minorities. Examples of such conflicts where Russian Federation (USSR) Armed Forces were used, directly or indirectly, would be Trans-Dniester in 1992, the Prigorodniy region in Northern Ossetia at the end of 1992, Southern Ossetia in 1991-1992, and Abkhazia in 1992-1993.
<p>
In the near future, ethnic conflicts probably will have two major causes. First, as a result of the events of 1991, Russians are a divided people. Therefore, their objective tendency to reunite will become stronger as time goes on. Second, in all former USSR countries, except for Belorussia and perhaps Ukraine, ethnic minorities are subjected to discrimination.<sup>3</sup>  This is most clearly evident in the Baltic countries where, with the encouragement of Western institutions, human rights violations based on ethnic origin are part of official policy. The Baltic countries seem to be the most potentially explosive in terms of the possibility of new areas of conflict that could involve the Russian Federation's Armed Forces.
<p>
<li>Attempts by nationalist forces to seize power by armed force or to hold power in some republic of the former USSR. Examples include Tajikistan in 1992-1996, Lithuania in January 1991, Georgia during the winter of 1991-1992 and at the end of 1993, and Azerbaijan in January 1990 and the summer of 1993.
<p>
<li>Territorial claims against the Russian Federation and illegal attempts to seize sea and inland water resources that belong to Russia. Up to now, direct Russian participation in such armed conflicts has been avoided. But it is not out of the question, particularly because of the Baku government's policy of annexing part of the Caspian Sea, an inland body of water the rights to which should be shared equally by all countries bordering the region. Another potential source of conflict is the part of the Baltic Sea area that belongs to Russia but is claimed by Lithuania. It also is known that the ethnocratic regimes of Tallin and Riga are claiming a part of the Russian Federation's Northwestern territory.
<p>
<li>The desire of certain forces in the former USSR, primarily in the Baltic countries, to become a part of the NATO alliance. In such cases, one cannot exclude preemptive use of force by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation to stop decisively any practical steps that might be taken by armed nationalist detachments to implement their provocative plans.
</ul><p>
<b>Budget Priorities</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Obviously, in the near term, reform of the Russian Federation's Armed Forces will be conducted under conditions of deep economic crisis. Thus, the decisive factor in choosing among possible reforms will be that the budget for the Armed Forces and military-industrial complex is limited. One of the main requirements will be to minimize the country's budget for defense. This, in turn, means that the established practice of allocating funds equally among the existing branches of the Armed Forces will have to be abandoned.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is necessary to determine which programs are crucial to sustaining the Armed Forces' ability to accomplish their main objectives and guarantee their financing. At the same time, it is unavoidable that programs which do not have a high priority will have to be financed from the "leftovers" of the military budget. Despite the importance of the transition to a professional army in the near future, it will be impossible to avoid using the draft to raise manpower. The Armed Forces will have to be reduced to 1.2 million servicemen.
<p>
<b>The Main Deterrent: Strategic Nuclear Forces</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In resolving the task of nuclear deterrence on the strategic level, the basic role should be played by strategic nuclear forces and systems supporting their combat functioning. Without strategic nuclear forces, Russia cannot exist as an independent, unified state. The task of sustaining them should be given the highest priority and should be fully financed. As of today, [Russia's] strategic nuclear forces face three major problems:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Degradation of strategic nuclear forces.</b> This concerns primarily the naval component of the strategic nuclear forces, in which the scheduled maintenance of weapon systems is constantly being violated and the operational strength of strategic nuclear submarines has gone down drastically. Since 1990, not a single new strategic nuclear submarine has been launched; considering the life cycle of submarines in the naval strategic nuclear forces, this means they could disappear within 15 years. It is most important to finish the scientific research and test construction work needed to create strategic nuclear submarines of a new generation which will carry new ballistic missiles by the years 2000-2003, as well as to ensure that these strategic nuclear submarines are brought into service at the rate of 2-3 submarines every two years.
<p>
<li><b>Absence of clarity regarding the quantitative framework within which it is planned to develop strategic nuclear forces.</b> In 1994, START I was implemented. START II was signed but is not yet ratified. With regard to the naval and aviation components of the strategic nuclear forces, the existence of uncertainty concerning the fate of the treaty does not affect seriously their future development. According to START II, the naval strategic nuclear forces can be armed with 1,750 warheads after 2003. Roughly the same quantity was to be allowed under START I. Aviation strategic nuclear forces, which historically have played a very insignificant role in the national nuclear triad, will have 93 heavy bombers with approximately 500 cruise missiles, including 19 Tu-95 heavy bombers and several dozen heavy bombers acquired in Ukraine by agreement. The production of additional heavy bombers is very costly and thus is hardly advisable.
<p>
A more complex situation exists in units of the Strategic Rocket Forces (SRF). According to START II, which requires the liquidation of ICBMs with MIRV warheads, the SRF by the year 2003 can rely on approximately 1,000 single-warhead ICBMs. At present, there are 350 mobile SS-25s with single warheads, which are to be replaced in the next few years, as their useful life expires, by "Topol-M" ICBMs. According to the agreement, Russia will have 105 MIRVed ICBMs, which are to be "unloaded" until only one warhead each remains, and 90 single SS-18 ICBMs placed into refitted silos. To support the START II quota for the number of warheads, Russia will have to form more than 10 additional divisions of mobile ICBMs with approximately 500 "Topol-M" ICBMs by the year 2003 -- in other words, practically double the number of mobile, single-warhead ICBMs. Another possible option is to build new silos for new ICBMs. Even with priority financing, it is very difficult for the SRF to do this within such a limited time frame.
<p>
In general, the START II treaty is rather paradoxical. It calls for quick liquidation of more than 200 MIRVed Russian ICBMs, part of which could still be used for another 4-5 years. At the same time, in order to maintain quantitative parity with the U.S., several hundred single-warhead ICBMs should be deployed, and possibly placed into newly built silos, even as some of the old silos are to be destroyed under START II. Note that the United States plans to go from START I to START II in a different fashion. It will eliminate only 50 "MX" missiles, 4 "Ohio" strategic nuclear submarines, and 28 heavy bombers with cruise missiles. The main cuts are to be accomplished by "unloading" the missiles and storing the warheads in special storage facilities. At any moment, this stockpile, which the United States emphatically refuses to destroy, might be put back into operation on U.S. missiles. As a result, taking into account the potential for "quick loading" of these missiles, the U.S. will surpass Russia by 1,000-1,500 warheads.
<P>
Russia's refusal to follow START II will bring onto the agenda the issue of supporting MIRVed ICBMs. Analysis proves that this problem can be solved in principle. Different options are available. For instance, additional SS-18s can be purchased from Ukraine. Also, purely Russian MIRVed ICBMs can be designed; a 120-ton liquid fueled missile with 10 warheads could be created in 3-5 years after the appropriate decision. In the next 5-7 years, 300 such missiles can be placed into existing silos. Given these facts, in spite of widespread misconceptions, spending for this project could be quite moderate. At the stage of scientific research and test construction work, the amount would be several percent less per year than the amount allocated to "rebuild" Chechnya in 1996. At the development stage, given that the warheads would be available, production and installation of 300 of such missiles would be three times cheaper than the cost of constructing in the same period 500 "Topol-M" ICBMs in their mobile version or in new silos, as discussed above in relation to START II.
<p>
<li><b>Flaws in the command and control structure of the strategic nuclear forces.</b> It is proposed, within the framework of measures for development of the strategic nuclear forces, to design in an organized manner a single, self-contained operational command and control system for all groupings of strategic nuclear forces, including support systems, based on the administrative structure developed in the Strategic Rocket Forces. Practical implementation of this proposal could be achieved within a year after the appropriate decision is made. The main reasons such a step is necessary are the increased demands for combat readiness in the strategic nuclear forces, economy of means, and elimination of parallel structures. It would be advisable to transfer the Military Space Forces to the Strategic Rocket Forces to bring under their functional control the Missile Attack Warning System, the Space Control System, the Moscow ABM System, and corresponding testing sites. The naval and aviation strategic nuclear forces (functionally left in the Navy and Air Forces, respectively) also should be transferred to the single operational command and control of the strategic nuclear forces.
<p>
At the present time, several hundred thousand servicemen, a third of them officers, are performing their military service in groupings of the strategic nuclear forces. In the Strategic Rocket Forces, for all practical purposes, combat crews of officers carry out in practice 100 percent of the direct functional duties connected with exploitation of the weapons. As for the draftees, they primarily carry out functions as guards and perform auxiliary tasks in supporting combat readiness, technical support, etc. A similar situation, as a whole, characterizes the other components of the strategic nuclear forces and their support systems. It is proposed that the ratio between professionals and conscripts be maintained in the future as well.
<p>
Since the U.S. and NATO possess conventional forces and armaments potentially sufficient to conduct military operations with limited goals on the periphery of post-Soviet territory, it is necessary to provide for deterrence of such actions by the probable enemy. Currently, functions for deterring aggression from the most probable directions are given:
<ul><p>
<li>In the north (the naval bases on the Kola peninsula), to forces of the Leningrad Military District (MD) and Northern Fleet (NF).
<p>
<li>In the northwest, (the Baltic region), to forces of the Leningrad MD, Kaliningrad special region, and forces of the Baltic Fleet.
<p>
<li>In the south (the Caucasus-Caspian region), to forces of the North Caucasus Military district; subunits of the Russian Armed Forces on bases in Gyumri and Yerevan (Armenia), Tbilisi and Ahalkalaki (Georgia), Batumi (Adjaria), and Gudauta (Abkhazia); forces of the Caspian Flotilla; and the Black Sea fleet.
</ul><p>
Analysis shows that the existing deterrence potential of the Russian Federation Armed Forces in these directions might be insufficient to deter aggressive action by the probable enemy. Strengthening these forces by carrying out a long-term buildup in the number of troops and armaments in regions of probable conflict could be hard to achieve economically. In light of this, as a priority task facing the Armed Forces, it is proposed to create, within a year after a decision is made, Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces numbering about 10,000 servicemen. Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces could operate as a reserve of the Supreme High Command and, on a long-term basis, could assume the function of deterring the probable enemy from conducting military operations with local goals.
<p>
For this proposal to be implemented at the initial stage, it is suggested to supply the Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces with 10-12 missile and aviation complexes equipped with conventional precision weapons from the Rocket Forces, Ground Forces, and Air Forces. These missile and aviation complexes, while remaining functionally a part of the Rocket Forces, Ground Forces, and Air Forces, and based deep within Russian territory during peacetime, would be subordinated operationally, through a Main Directorate of the General Staff specially created for these purposes, to the Supreme High Command of the Russian Armed Forces. During a threatening period, Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces, by decision of the Supreme High Command, could be redeployed to the region of possible conflict and aimed on especially important targets deep in the probable enemy's territory.
<p>
In the event plans for the eastern expansion of NATO are realized or new directions of possible aggression appear (for instance, the Southern Kuril Island), it would be expedient to increase the number of the Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces' missile and aviation complexes to 30-50 units. At the same time, units of missile artillery and aviation complexes could be armed with nuclear weapons. To demonstrate persuasively to a probable enemy the RF's determination to impede any NATO advancement into the territory of the former USSR, some Operational-Tactical Deterrent Force units also could be moved up to the borders, particularly the Russian-Norwegian border; to Russian military bases in Armenia, Georgia, Adzharia, and Abkhazia; to the Kaliningrad special region; and into Belorussia, to which President A. G. Lukashenko has agreed in principle.
</ul><P>
<b>The Mobile Forces: Mainstay of the Russian Army</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is advisable when waging local wars within the former USSR to give the main functions to special elite units: Mobile Forces of the Russian Federation Armed Forces, which also must have priority designation. Not intended for participation in extended military conflicts, these units could be used on a short-term basis in holding actions and to repel aggression from abroad against Russia and the CIS using conventional weapons. They also could be designated for peacekeeping operations under the aegis of CIS, as well as the UN and other international organizations. It is advisable to form Mobile Forces, up to 90,000 strong, based on Airborne troops and using some units of naval infantry, over a year after a corresponding decision is made. Functionally, naval infantry would stay under Navy command and would be transferred to operational Mobile Forces command only for the conduct of special operations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For five years after forming these Mobile Forces, it is suggested that recruitment be exclusively on a contract basis. After the process of turning them into a professional force is complete, Mobile Forces should be fully staffed and given all kinds of heavy armaments and equipment. Moreover, the number of naval infantry should be increased with the assistance of the Baltic Fleet, Black Sea Fleet, and Caspian Flotilla, which are located in potential conflict areas of the Caucasus and Baltic countries. Special attention should be paid to the creation of naval infantry in the Caspian region because of the extremely high probability of conflict arising from the unresolved problem of the status of the Caspian shelf.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is important to equip Mobile Forces with military transport aviation (MTA), which will belong functionally to the Air Forces and be operationally subordinate to the Commander in Chief of the Air Forces but required to carry out orders of the Mobile Forces. The need for MTA aircraft designated to move personnel and military equipment, including heavy military equipment, is estimated at 100 aircraft. Most of the aircraft in MTA available today are not functioning. Therefore, about 30-40 additional aircraft should be brought into service because of the extreme importance of the tasks performed by the Mobile Forces.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A typical special operation involving Mobile Forces and aimed at liberating a large area of the former USSR from nationalists should be based on the following principles. The commander of the operation is appointed and should receive a legally valid order. The date and time of the operation then are set. A rigid system of unified command is established so that operational command over all utilized forces, regardless of departmental subordination and affiliation, is concentrated in the hands of a single person.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the first stage, aviation, special military intelligence (GRU) forces, and special Federal Security Services (FSB) and Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) groups carry out strikes for the purpose of destroying or seizing the most important enemy targets and eliminating the enemy's military and political leadership. Then Mobile Forces, with the support of army and frontline aviation and naval forces, crush and eliminate enemy forces and take over their territory. After that, subunits of Ground Forces and Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, RF, preferably with some combat experience, move in. They establish control of the most crucial locations and carry out "cleansing" of the territory. Then, with the help of militia formed out of the pro-Russian part of the local population, they establish control over the territory and ensure the elimination of nationalists and deportation of some categories of citizens from certain locations. It should be emphasized that until the end of the special operation, local authorities are needed only insofar as they are useful in supporting military control over the territory.
<P>
<b>Winners and Losers</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Military intelligence plays a most important role in achieving the main goals of the Armed Forces. Making the GRU (Main Intelligence Directorate) and its subunits and structures more effective should be given the highest priority.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To implement these proposals, half the personnel of the Armed Forces would have to go to the four most important components of the Armed Forces named above, which also should be given priority in financing. Because the economic situation in the country is difficult, the other half of the Armed Forces would have to exist under tight financial limitations.
<ul><p>
<li><b>The Navy is the most expensive of the Armed Forces.</b> A differentiated approach is needed here. Naval strategic nuclear forces cannot be underfinanced. The situation is more complex with respect to providing for the combat stability of naval strategic nuclear forces. The system exists and should be preserved, but this does not require building large ships. Aircraft carriers are an exception, since two carriers each are needed in the Pacific Fleet and Northern Fleet to meet military goals. There are only two at present, and the country's economic situation does not allow for two more.
<p>
To provide for anti-submarine warfare in oceanic theaters of military operations (TVD), there are in service submarines and ships equipped with special arms. This equipment should be maintained and ships and submarines currently under construction should be finished, but no new ones should be built for the time being.
<p>

With respect to combating enemy aircraft carriers, there are no battle groups now in place. Our recommendation is to maintain the status quo and concentrate on retaining existing levels.
<p>
With reference to landing support for naval infantry, the appropriate infrastructure was built by the USSR. It is important not only to stop its destruction, but also to continue its development, since costs will not be high but will allow it to perform tasks of the Mobile Forces with great effectiveness.
<p>
In protecting sea communications, special attention should be paid to protecting lines of communication with the Kaliningrad Special Region. At the same time, activities in the remote oceanic regions should be limited.
<p>
The existing system for the coastal defense of the Russian Federation should be supported and developed, since no big investments are needed here. Finally, it is necessary to abandon the tasks of combating transatlantic shipments of U.S. forces and combating the enemy's surface ships and submarines armed with cruise missiles.
<p>
<li><b>There are two large groups in the Ground Forces today. </b>One was deployed in the Far East Military District and Trans-Baikal Military District during the time of tense relations with China. In subsequent years, it was degraded less than other groups. Another large group was developed for obvious reasons in the North Caucasus Military District. It is reasonable to continue to support these groups. For the North Caucasus Military District, this means confirming the exception of District units from the treaty on Conventional Forces Reductions in Europe at the May conference of participants. It is unacceptable that the issue of the North Caucasus Military District be linked with the proposal made by a number of countries that the numbers of Russian forces in the Kaliningrad Special Region be cut; in light of Poland's and the Baltic countries' plans to join NATO, the very fact that the issue of the Kaliningrad Special Region has come up seems both ambiguous and a provocation. A limited number of Ground Forces are located in the strategically important Leningrad and Moscow Military Districts. From the west, Moscow is covered by only two army divisions. As there is no danger of a large-scale invasion of Russia similar to the invasion of 1941, the development of forces to the west of Moscow should not be hurried. But in the event the Eastern European countries join NATO and the infrastructure for an invasion force appears, Russia will be forced to respond accordingly. One possible response might be to recreate the Belorussian Military District and deploy Ground Forces and frontal aviation of the Air Forces there.
<p>
Also, since it currently is difficult for Russia to maintain parity with NATO in conventional weapons, the primary emphasis should be assigned to tactical nuclear deterrence of the threat of non-nuclear attack by NATO forces. This approach will require arming the Rocket Forces, Ground Forces, and frontal aviation of the Air Forces with nuclear weapons and will be much less expensive than providing a non-nuclear deterrent force for a non-nuclear invasion. In general, the present weakness of Russia dictates reliance on nuclear weapons, including tactical weapons. Today, the only possible way to deter NATO is through nuclear deterrence. At the same time, should the relationship between Russia and China change, the same approach can be used in Central Asia and the Far East.
<p>
An important problem in the Ground Forces is revision of the list of units in military districts and the discovery of units which can be cut. It is advisable to limit the number of divisions to 30-35, of which 15-20 could be manned with conscripts and work on combat readiness while the other 15, evenly spread around the country, would be cadre and would serve as a base in preparing the mobilization reserve. At the same time, preparation of the mobilization reserve should be conducted within the Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) and Border Guards.
<p>
<li><b>In units of the Air Forces, special attention should be concentrated on maintaining military transport, frontal aviation, and aviation of the strategic nuclear forces, which could be used by the Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces and Mobile Forces, at the required level.</b> A major task is preserving qualifications of flying personnel. The Air Defense of military districts should be given to the Air Forces from the Troops of Air Defense, disbanding the latter units but retaining their combat readiness requirements. The missile attack warning system, space control system, and Moscow ABM System, as well as their corresponding testing grounds, would be transferred to the Strategic Rocket Forces. The Air Defense system that is maintaining CIS perimeter defense also would be transferred to the Air Force. Another possible solution is to give it to the Federal Border Guard Service. This would be logical, because they are not now able to defend against a massive air attack from the probable enemy. The circle of tasks resolved by them, in fact, is limited to early warning of an unsanctioned intrusion of CIS airspace and interception of individual targets. This is more a function of the Border Guard, not the Armed Forces. Moreover, the Federal Border Guard Service looks after the ground and marine border. It would be logical to close the loop by giving them the air component as well.
<p></ul>
<b>Legislative Priorities</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is proposed that in the immediate future, it is necessary to prepare and confirm in the Federal Assembly (parliament) a national security doctrine and a military doctrine for the Russian Federation. Based on these doctrines, a five-year plan of reform for the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation should be developed and adopted.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This current document can be used both to prepare the national security and military doctrines and to prepare the plan of reform for the Armed Forces.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b><BR>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
On May 20, President Bill Clinton announced his intention to extend unconditionally China's most-favored-nation trade status for another year. At the end of this month, Congress will vote on a resolution to revoke MFN trade status for the People's Republic of China. Legislation also may be proposed to make MFN status contingent on improvements in China's human rights conditions or its implementation of international commercial and security agreements.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

As Congress considers extending or revoking MFN status for China, it is important to focus on what MFN is and is not. A fundamental principle of the Bretton Woods trading system created at the end of World War II,<sup>1</sup> MFN was intended to protect the U.S. from protectionism. It is not a special privilege for any country, including China. Rather, it is the norm for trade between countries. Thus, revoking MFN for any country is the equivalent of imposing enormous punitive sanctions. But trade sanctions are not an effective tool for achieving such non-trade objectives as ending human rights abuses.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The Administration's decision to extend MFN treatment is the right decision, but it should be only one element of a comprehensive strategy for dealing with China. This strategy should consist of a series of policies that directly protect or promote long-run U.S. interests in Asia, such as free access to markets or peace and stability. As important as having the right strategy is creating a constructive environment within which policies can operate. This environment has not been created by the Clinton Administration. The zig-zags in its China policy have undermined the credibility of its strategy and raised serious questions in the minds of friend and foe alike as to America's future role in Asia.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

To protect its interests in peace and stability, freedom of the seas, and access to markets in Asia, the U.S. must create an environment that encourages China to integrate into the international system as a responsible member. Given its size and rate of growth, China is certain to have an enormous impact on the international system and American interests in Asia. For China to become a full participant in the international system and uphold international rules and norms, Chinese leaders must see that doing so will best serve China's interests. This can be accomplished only if Americans interact with, rather than isolate, China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 


To advance American interests in Asia, the President and Congress should:<ul>
<p><li>Renew China's MFN status. This is the right decision and should be supported by the Congress.

<p><li><b>Invite China's President Jiang Zemin to the White House for a full state visit.</b> This gesture could help avoid future misunderstandings by directly communicating America's fundamental Asian interests and concerns at the highest level.

<p><li><b>Follow a more broad-based strategy toward Asia.</b> Rather than confront China directly, the U.S. should seek to expand investment and trade with India and Indonesia. Knowing that the U.S. has credible alternatives to the China market, China's leaders will no longer be able to take American involvement in China for granted.

<p><li><b>Use policy tools better suited to the problem.</b> When China violates a U.S. law or international agreement, the U.S. should apply the penalty prescribed in that law or agreement. In other words, if China violates the Missile Control Technology Regime, the U.S. should coordinate its response with other MCTR members and apply the sanctions outlined in the law that ratified U.S. membership in that regime. The U.S. should not revoke MFN or impose sanctions that are not relevant to the specific broken law or agreement.

<p><li><b>Repeal or amend the Jackson-Vanik Amendment.</b> This amendment to the 1974 Trade Act is outdated. Its primary target no longer exists, and its freedom of emigration requirements are inappropriate for China. </ul><p>


<b>AMERICA'S STRATEGIC INTERESTS AND MFN</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Over the past two centuries, the U.S. has sought consistently to protect three fundamental interests in Asia: 1) regional peace and stability, 2) freedom of navigation on the high seas, and 3) free access to the region's markets. These interests provide a firm foundation for a healthy and growing American economy. They also help promote a stable and secure world in which political and economic freedom, human rights, and democratic institutions can flourish. These interests allow the U.S. to maintain a system of healthy, cooperative, and politically vigorous relations with allies and friendly nations.<sup>2</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

MFN plays a fundamental role in advancing these enduring American interests in Asia. Most-favored-nation treatment is the normal tariff treatment that the United States provides to all but a handful of its trading partners.<sup>3</sup>  It is a principle which undergirds the open international trading system that the U.S. has labored for decades to expand, not merely a bargaining chip in the U.S.-China relationship that holds America's trade and economic interests around the globe hostage to the ups and downs of its political relationship with China. MFN has been, in fact, a key ingredient of America's global strategy since World War II. The purpose of this strategy has been to build a cooperative free-trade environment within which America's businesses and economy can prosper. It also has been to protect the United States and the world from reliving the tragic consequences of the isolationism and protectionism that plagued the 1930s.
<P>

<b>HISTORICAL ROOTS OF MFN STATUS FOR CHINA</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	The U.S. first introduced the notion of most-favored-nation trade status into the U.S.-China relationship in the 19th century to ensure the survival of American commercial interests in Asia. After the Opium Wars of the mid-19th century, several foreign powers won concessions from China and sought to establish exclusive areas of influence along China's coast. American leaders considered these actions a threat to the U.S. interest in free access to the markets of Asia. In order to keep Britain, Germany, Japan, or China from excluding the U.S. from the Chinese market, the U.S. induced China to agree to an MFN provision in its treaty obligations with the U.S.<sup>4</sup>  This provision required that any future concession that the Chinese government granted to a third power would be extended simultaneously and automatically to the U.S. as well. MFN was not considered a tool by which America would realize the full potential of the enormous Chinese market. Rather, it was one means by which the U.S. could guarantee itself equal access to that market.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The United States extended MFN status to all of its trading partners as a matter of statutory policy in 1934. The scope of this policy narrowed as the Cold War intensified. Section 5 of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951 required President Truman to suspend the MFN status of the Soviet Union and all countries under the control of international communism. In accordance with this act, the President suspended China's most-favored-nation status on September 1, 1951, approximately two years after the establishment of the People's Republic of China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The Trade Act of 1974 set forth new conditions for the restoration of MFN to "nonmarket economy" countries such as China.<sup>5</sup>  According to Title IV, in order to grant MFN status to China, the President must satisfy two conditions:
<ul> 

<p><li>Condition #1: A trade agreement that includes MFN for the U.S. Under Section 405 in Title IV of the 1974 Trade Act, in order to conclude a trade agreement with China, the President must first determine that any reductions in U.S. trade barriers are reciprocated by China. In other words, as the U.S. lowers tariffs on imports from China, China simultaneously will reduce tariffs on U.S. exports to China.

<p><li>Condition #2: Freedom of emigration. This second requirement is much more contentious. Section 402 of the 1974 Trade Act, known as the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, was intended to pressure the Soviet Union to allow Jews to emigrate.<sup>6</sup>  Over time, this provision has become, albeit inadvertently, the legal basis for the current annual debate over renewal of China's MFN status. The Amendment calls on the President to deny MFN treatment to any nonmarket economy country which the President determines denies, seriously restricts, or burdens its citizens' right to emigrate. This freedom of emigration requirement can be waived annually, and it is around this annual waiver that the current debate over China's MFN status revolves.</ul>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

In the process of normalizing relations with the PRC, President Jimmy Carter in 1979 used presidential authority to conclude a three-year bilateral trade agreement with China in which China granted MFN status to the U.S. This satisfied the first requirement for granting MFN to a nonmarket economy country. The U.S. trade agreement with China, which entered into force on February 1, 1980, provides for automatic three-year extensions. Since China is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 405 of the 1974 Trade Act, however, these "automatic" extensions require the President to certify that China reciprocates reductions in U.S. trade barriers. Thus far, the trade agreement has been renewed five times.<sup>7</sup>
<P>


<b>MFN Procedures and China</b><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The  problem is that President Carter did not completely resolve the second requirement for extending MFN status to China. To grant MFN to China, the President must determine that China permits free and unrestricted emigration of its citizens or waive for 12 months the requirements for full compliance with Jackson-Vanik. President Carter in 1980 waived the Jackson-Vanik requirements for 12 months rather than certify China's full compliance with its freedom of emigration strictures. This has been done by every President since then. In every June since 1980, the President has had to decide whether or not to waive for another 12 months the freedom of emigration requirements in the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. Moreover, each year after the President's decision has been made, Congress has had an opportunity to review the President's decision and to decide whether to vote on a resolution to discontinue MFN.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

According to the procedures outlined in Section 402 of the 1974 Trade Act, once the President has waived the Jackson-Vanik requirements, he must submit to Congress a recommendation for a 12-month extension of the waiver authority. This recommendation, along with the President's reasons for granting it, must be submitted to Congress during the final 30 days of the current waiver. The President's recommendation traditionally has been sent by June 3 of each year. Extension of the waiver authority is automatic unless a joint resolution of disapproval is enacted into law within 60 days after the expiration of the previous waiver authority, which typically is by the end of August. Although resolutions of disapproval have been considered by Congress, MFN treatment for China has continued uninterrupted since 1980 under annual renewal of the waiver.
<p>

<b>ISSUES ENTANGLED IN MFN DEBATE</b><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	Automatic extension of the three-year U.S. trade agreement with China and the annual presidential waiver of Jackson-Vanik requirements went smoothly throughout the 1980s, as China embarked on massive and largely successful economic reforms. Market capitalism was introduced incrementally into the Chinese economy to improve efficiency and to hasten modernization. Many in China readily admitted the failures of socialism and looked to the West for new methods to improve living standards. President Ronald Reagan visited China in 1984 and declared the dawning of a new era of freedom for the Chinese people.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

But this honeymoon in Sino-American relations came to an abrupt halt on June 4, 1989, when the People's Liberation Army used deadly force against the students and workers who had gathered in protest at Tiananmen Square. In response, President George Bush invoked a series of sanctions against China. These included restrictions on arms and munitions sales, military exchanges, transfer of dual-use technologies, and U.S. government financing for projects in China. The objective was to punish the government of China without unnecessarily injuring the people of China. This same rationale was advanced to explain the continuation of MFN status for China. Revoking MFN would have injured a wide range of people in China that the U.S. wanted to help, including economic reformers and entrepreneurs.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

A majority in Congress, however, did not agree with the President's decision. Each year, from 1990-1992, Congress voted to disapprove extension of MFN status to China. President Bush repeatedly used his veto authority to defeat these congressional resolutions. Members of Congress argued that the U.S. should make China's leaders pay for their brutality and that it was immoral for Americans to seek profit under such circumstances. Every year, this "automatic" procedure has provided a forum for a well-orchestrated recitation of all the ills for which China's government is held responsible.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Four years ago, candidate Bill Clinton scolded President Bush for "coddling tyrants" and vowed to make the "butchers of Beijing" pay by attaching requirements for improved human rights conditions to the continuation of MFN for China. This was his intention when on May 28, 1993, President Clinton issued an executive order which continued China's unconditional MFN status for another year but attached new conditions to China's renewal in subsequent years.<sup>8</sup>  The executive order required China to halt exports of prison labor products to the U.S. and mandated that the Secretary of State determine whether China had made "significant progress" on human rights.<sup>9</sup>  After a year of strained diplomatic relations, President Clinton, despite his campaign threats, renewed China's MFN status on May 26, 1994. He did so without declaring that China had made significant progress in human rights protection, effectively de-linking human rights from trade issues.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Although human rights has been the most prominent rallying cry for those who wish to discontinue MFN for China, there are a number of other issues that give Americans cause for concern: China's military adventurism, proliferation of missiles and nuclear technology, piracy of intellectual property, and unbalanced trade. These concerns are legitimate and are being addressed in varying degrees through diplomacy. The danger in the political debate over China is that the U.S. will try to use MFN, one of the fundamental principles of international trade, as a policy tool to advance unrelated economic, political, and security interests.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Revoking China's MFN status clearly is not an effective way to advance these interests. Certainly, China's bullying of Taiwan with missile tests interfered with international air and sea lanes and had the potential to draw the U.S. into military conflict with the PRC.<sup>10</sup>  It also put at risk peace and stability in Asia as well as freedom of navigation -- two of the three historical U.S. interests in Asia. However, revoking MFN would do nothing to stop these provocative acts. Nor would it improve the prospects for peace and stability or freedom of navigation generally. But it would violate the U.S. interest in free access to markets and free trade. Thus, while revoking MFN will affect neither China's position on human rights nor its intimidation of Taiwan, it certainly will violate a vital U.S. economic interest.
<p>

<b>Policy Solutions That Fit Policy Problems</b>

<p><b>Human Rights.</b> Rather than revoke MFN, the U.S. should craft a policy that deals as directly as possible with the source of the problem. On human rights, for example, the U.S. has been following a pattern of publicly demonizing China's leaders and then trying to negotiate quietly with these leaders for release of high-profile political prisoners and changes in PRC law. The problem with this approach is that by threatening and demonizing the PRC government, the U.S. cuts off access to those whom Americans seek to help. This tactic does not leave Chinese leaders in the mood to find consensus on these issues, and by focusing attention on a few high-profile dissidents, the U.S. risks being viewed by the Chinese people as caring only for a few superstars while ignoring the interests of the many ordinary people.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

There is a more effective way to address human rights concerns in China. The U.S. should create a positive public relationship with China's leaders while vigorously raising these legitimate moral concerns in private. To reach the people Americans seek to help, the U.S. could send more volunteers and supplies to provide direct assistance to China's orphans and poor. The U.S. also should seek to increase as much as possible people-to-people contact between the two countries, whether through business or education, to increase cross-fertilization of cultural values and understanding.

<p><b>Weapons Proliferation.</b> The U.S. intelligence community has reported Chinese sales of nuclear technology to Pakistan and nuclear capable missiles to Pakistan and Iran. The Administration is required to confirm these reports and to determine whether such transactions violate U.S. law and international agreements such as the Missile Technology Control Regime and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.<sup>11</sup>  If violations of U.S. law and international agreements are confirmed, the U.S. is obliged to invoke sanctions against China. While the Clinton Administration has threatened to impose sanctions, it has yet to determine officially whether actual violations have occurred. In addition, the threatened sanctions would only take funding away from American-run projects and would have little effect on China, as European and Japanese competitors would immediately fill the void.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The more effective approach to curbing China's proliferation problems is to work through the multilateral dispute resolution mechanisms within the Missile Technology Control Regime and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Unilateral enforcement of U.S. law, while justified if violations are confirmed, may not have the intended effect on China's behavior. Non-proliferation is an area in which cooperation with treaty partners and allies is not only critical, but also possible. A security threat is much more likely to produce international cooperation than is an economic or trade issue. Without the support of Europe and Japan, any sanction will quickly be undercut and rendered ineffective. Thus, to maximize the likelihood of success, it is important for the U.S. to have its allies' support in dealing with China, working as much as possible through the mechanisms built into international non-proliferation treaties and regimes. 

<p><b>Selling Pirated Goods.</b> With regard to intellectual property rights, officials in the U.S. software, motion picture, and computer industries have accused dozens of factories in China's southern Guangdong Province of illegally copying U.S. products and selling the pirated goods abroad. These officials estimate the damage to their industries in lost sales at $2.3 billion. In 1992, in 1995, and again in 1996, China signed agreements with the U.S. Trade Representative promising to crack down on these pirates. In May 1996, in an effort to motivate Chinese enforcement of its agreements, the U.S. Trade Representative threatened to impose sanctions totaling $2 billion on Chinese textile exports from Guangdong Province.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Indirect sanctions on textile manufacturers in Guangdong Province, while consistent with the spirit of enforcing the rule of law, do not address the source of the problem. Many of these illegal compact disk producers are operated solely or jointly by Taiwan and Hong Kong businessmen, and some have ties to organized crime. Thus, the U.S. cannot hope to press China alone to deal effectively with this problem. Only a carefully planned, well organized cooperative effort by the PRC, ROC, Hong Kong, and U.S. governments can possibly be successful.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

There is a more effective way for the U.S. to address the piracy problem. If American companies can locate these illegal manufacturers, they should also be able to identify the shipping container in which the pirated goods are packaged for export. With the consent of PRC and Hong Kong officials, once the container is identified, port authorities in Hong Kong can locate and seize the pirated goods that are targeted for export markets. Seizing the goods would affect the perpetrators but very few others, unlike indirect sanctions which, like a swinging axe, harm many in the hope of punishing the guilty few. In addition, international markets serviced by Hong Kong's exporters are the appropriate target. China's own consumers lack sufficient computer and audio hardware to generate the sustained demand necessary to make these pirates profitable.

<b>EIGHT REASONS TO CONTINUE MFN FOR CHINA</b>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Since MFN is so fundamental to U.S. global commercial strategy, there are several reasons why the U.S. should continue to extend it to China. Revoking MFN for China would:<ul>

<p><li><b>Harm American workers.</b> In 1995, the U.S. exported over $12 billion in goods and services to China. American trade with China supports over 200,000 high-wage American jobs, as well as tens of thousands of additional American jobs in U.S. ports, retail establishments, and consumer goods companies. The loss of exports from the inevitable Chinese retaliation against MFN revocation would seriously threaten the employment of these Americans.

<p><li><b>Threaten U.S. business and investment.</b> The International Monetary Fund estimates that China is now the world's third-largest economy after the United States and Japan, and could emerge as the world's largest economy in the 21st century. The World Bank has calculated China that will require nearly $750 billion in new industrial infrastructure over the next decade. China needs new aircraft, power generators, telecommunications, computers, and other high-skill, high-wage technologies that must be supplied from overseas. American companies are poised to get the contracts to build these projects. Continued American leadership in these key technology sectors is vital to sustaining long-term U.S. economic growth and creating high-wage, high-skill American jobs. If MFN is revoked, China's needs will be filled by Japanese and European business and investment, with American jobs lost to overseas competitors.

<p><li><b>Jeopardize economic reform in China.</b> The last 15 years of economic reform in China have increased economic freedom and improved the livelihood of 25 percent of the world's population. American companies operating in China have contributed to a significant expansion of economic freedom and choice for the Chinese people. The U.S. must build on this foundation to open China's economy and society even more. MFN will not guarantee the rise of democracy in China, but does it keep China open to influences and pressures from the outside world. It fosters the development of a middle class and a civil society that in the future will have the means and the will to demand more responsiveness from its government.

<p><li><b>Damage the economies of Taiwan and Hong Kong.</b> The prosperity of both Taiwan and Hong Kong depends to a significant degree on investment and export production in China. The revocation of MFN would cut Hong Kong's economic growth in half. Although this point is rarely discussed, billions of dollars in Taiwanese investment and labor-intensive industries have moved to the mainland, unabated by the recent tensions. Many of the light industrial goods on which Taiwan's economic miracle depends are now produced on the mainland and exported through Hong Kong to the United States and other markets. Threats of across-the-board tariff increases, MFN revocation, and boycotting of Chinese goods ignore the fact that many of the goods marked "Made in China" actually are produced by companies based in Hong Kong and Taiwan, both friends of the U.S.

<p><li><b>Not improve human rights conditions in China.</b> History shows that China oppresses its people far more during periods of isolation. This clearly was the case in the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s. Human rights improvement is a long-term process that requires U.S. attention, but also U.S. patience. It is a process that does not lend itself to annual review. Nevertheless, Taiwan's success in improving the economic and political well-being of its citizens demonstrates that this transition is both possible and desirable in a Chinese society.

<p><li><b>Not encourage China to adhere to international limitations on transfers of nuclear technology or weapons of mass destruction.</b> China should answer the charges that it is supplying Pakistan with key nuclear and missile components in violation of its commitments to the Missile Technology Control Regime and the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Administration must investigate these allegations and, if such sales have taken place, apply sanctions as required by U.S. law. The law, however, needs to be changed. These sanctions, if not waived by the President, should be targeted specifically on the responsible Chinese enterprise rather than indiscriminately on all U.S.-financed projects in China as the law requires. Revoking MFN would go even further than the sanctions called for under current law, adversely affecting all U.S. commercial interaction with China. In the past, China has shown its displeasure with America's overtures to Taiwan or criticism of China's human rights record by selling dangerous technology to unstable regimes. Revoking MFN could generate another series of sales. In the area of non-proliferation, MFN is the wrong tool.

<p><li><b>Unnecessarily set the U.S. on the road to prolonged confrontation with China.</b> Abandoning MFN for China would make it less likely that China would integrate into the international system in a way that is favorable to U.S. interests. For the United States to realize its policy objectives most effectively, Beijing should not be an enemy. If U.S. policymakers wish to see China behave in a way that is consistent with international norms and agreements, they should work for multilateral cooperation with allies rather than engage in ineffective bilateral browbeating. How best to promote China's integration into the international commercial and security system will be among the most important challenges for American foreign policy in the foreseeable future. It warrants more deliberation and care from the President, his administration, and Congress.

<p><li><b>Violate a U.S. interest in free trade and a more open China.</b> The term "MFN" is misleading and should be changed. "General trading status" (GTS) would be a good alternative. Together with national treatment, MFN is a fundamental principle by which the World Trade Organization operates. It is normal trade status granted to all but a handful of countries -- North Korea, Cuba, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam -- none of which has any substantial global trade. It is the foundation of basic international commercial relations, and in the absence of the Cold War strategic framework, commercial relations are now the foundation of U.S.-China relations. Revoking MFN means seriously undercutting America's relationship with China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

For more than a century, U.S. policy has aimed at free access to the markets of Asia. For over half a century, the U.S. has labored to build and strengthen the current liberal international system of trade. In addition to being consistent with these long-term U.S. interests, MFN trade status for China demonstrates American goodwill to the people of China, if not to the government, by extending the U.S. system of free enterprise to raise their living standards and increase their economic freedoms and choices.</ul>
<p>

<b>THE CLINTON RECORD ON CHINA</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	The President should never have threatened revocation of MFN over human rights concerns when neither he nor the country was prepared to pay the cost of such action. The Secretary of State, ignoring congressional and public interest, should not have assured Foreign Minister Qian Qichen that Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui would not be granted entry into the United States only days before the visa was granted. Similarly, Administration officials should not have equivocated, delayed, and apologized for action taken in support of U.S. interests in Taiwan. Each of these blunders severely damaged U.S. credibility in dealing with China and created a negative bilateral environment that renders the correct policies ineffective.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The Administration says one thing but does another. It has managed the relationship with China badly. The Chinese are told that the Administration is following a policy of engagement. Engagement, however, is not a policy; it is simply another word for diplomacy. The U.S. needs engagement -- and diplomacy -- with a purpose. The Clinton Administration now lacks such a purpose. The purpose of U.S. policy toward China should be to communicate to Chinese leaders that China's interests will be served best by integrating into the international system, observing its norms and standards, and pursuing peace and stability in Asia in ways that are commensurate with the interests of the U.S. and China's Asian neighbors.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

To deliver this message, President Clinton needs to meet personally with Chinese leaders. The President received Gerry Adams and Yasser Arafat in the White House, but forced the PRC head of state to meet instead in New York without the fanfare of a full state visit. This message is not lost on the Chinese leadership, and the mere promise of frequent high-level summits to take place in a second Clinton Administration, as proposed by Secretary of State Warren Christopher this May in New York, is little consolation. Frequent face-to-face interaction between the leaders of the United States and China at the highest levels is critical for the protection of American interests in Asia. This interaction should take place in both capitals and in a formal setting that reflects the importance the U.S. attaches to achieving these American interests through cooperation.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

This strategy is the best way to make progress on areas of concern to the United States. Americans frustrated with the lack of progress in China on human rights, missile proliferation, or intellectual property rights, instead of more promises, need a clear, consistent, and predictable China policy to avoid miscalculation in the Taiwan Strait and to make progress on these issues.

<p>
<b>TOWARD A CHINA POLICY THAT WORKS</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	There is much that can be done to work more effectively toward American goals in Asia. China's cooperation in areas which do not conflict with its own interests will make U.S. efforts easier and less costly. There is little chance of charting a policy course that follows common interests without regular and consistent communication, at the highest levels, of what each county's objectives and vital interests are in bilateral and regional relations. To create an environment more conducive to an effective policy toward China, the U.S. should:<ul>

<p><li><b>Renew China's MFN status.</b> This is the right decision and should be supported by the Congress. MFN promotes the U.S. interest in free access to Asian markets and provides Americans with greater opportunity to act as an influence for good within China.
<p><li><b>Invite China's President Jiang Zemin to the White House for a full state visit.</b> There is little reason to think that China is fated to become an enemy of the United States. It could happen, but the chances are reduced by dealing directly with China and by maintaining American strength. This is a gesture that could demonstrate that the U.S. is truly "engaged" with a purpose.

<p><li><b>Follow a more broad-based strategy toward Asia</b> The U.S. should avoid putting too many eggs in the China market basket. Rather than confronting China directly, the U.S. should seek to expand investment and trade with India and Indonesia. Both countries are very populous, and both are seeking foreign investment to improve their infrastructure and sustain a high rate of economic growth. Knowing that the U.S. has credible alternatives to the China market, China's leaders will no longer be able to take American involvement as a given.

<p><li><b>Use policy tools better suited to the problem.</b> China must obey the rules of the road in international commerce and security. It is right for the U.S. to seek the enforcement of U.S. law and international agreements, but it should use the dispute resolution mechanisms built into the relevant international regime or apply the recourse outlined in the bilateral agreement or U.S. law that has been violated. The remedy should target as specifically as possible the source of the problem and not cut too broadly across the spectrum of competing American interests in China, Asia, or the world.

<p><li><b>Repeal or amend the Jackson-Vanik Amendment.</b> The Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the 1974 Trade Act is outdated. The Soviet Union, Jackson-Vanik's primary target, exists no more, and China is no longer dominated by international communism. It is even becoming difficult to say that China's is a nonmarket economy. In addition, the amendment's freedom of emigration requirements are inappropriate for China. If China were to permit or encourage free emigration, what countries would be prepared or willing to accept tens or hundreds of millions of Chinese migrants?  Certainly the U.S. would not be willing to accept them. The already strained U.S. immigration and welfare system would be overwhelmed by the vast numbers of Chinese people seeking greater opportunity in America.</ul>
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The question of whether to continue China's MFN status is once again before the Congress. As Members take this opportunity to assess U.S.-China relations, they should replace the mixed signals sent by the Clinton Administration with a consistent strategy for promoting America's long-term interests in Asia. Because of its size and rate of growth, China will have an enormous impact for good or for ill on U.S. interests. Therefore, it is prudent to improve the management of this critical relationship and to seek China's cooperation before forcing the American and Chinese people to pay the enormous security and economic costs of revoking MFN.

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The MFN debate unfortunately is caught up in two mistaken beliefs: 1) that MFN is privileged treatment and 2) that revoking MFN would be an effective way to force a favorable change in China's behavior. These beliefs have no basis in reality. Conditioning or revoking MFN under current circumstances would eliminate any possibility of cooperation from Beijing, rendering the U.S. less effective in its efforts to limit transfers of nuclear technology and weapons of mass destruction, correct unfair trade practices, and foster development of the rule of law in Asia. Moreover, discontinuing MFN would not improve social and commercial conditions in China but would come at great cost to Americans and their friends in Hong Kong and Taiwan. For the U.S., revoking or conditioning MFN gains too little and risks too much. For these and many other reasons, most-favored-nation trade status for China should be renewed unconditionally.

<h3>CHINA: FRIEND OR ENEMY?</h3>

<b>By The Honorable Barbara Hackman Franklin</b>
<P>Barbara Hackman Franklin is the former U.S. Secretary of Commerce, and spoke at <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>, on June 20, 1996.
<p>
	China has always held a special fascination for Westerners. This vast, populous country is thought by many to have the oldest culture on Earth. Certainly it was the center of Eastern civilization. China was already a sophisticated society when Marco Polo traveled there in the 14th century, bringing back such treasures as silk, tea, spices, noodles, fireworks, exquisite porcelain, jade, and wood block printing.
<p>	But our captivation with China has not translated into a smooth and predictable relationship over the past few centuries. To us, China has been alternately open, then closed, and then reopened again. The result is that we Americans do not understand China very well--its ancient roots, its history, its people, its way of life, political structure, or place in today's world. Nor do the Chinese understand us. To them, the West has seemed imperialistic and exploitive, caught up with colonial designs on their territory and disrespectful of China as a great nation.
<p>	But it is imperative--even urgent--that we learn to understand each other better. I believe the U.S.-China relationship is one of the most important--perhaps the most important--of all the bilateral strategic relationships in the world today and that we have reached a defining moment in that relationship.
<p>
<b>China's Place in the World Today</b>
<p>	Today, China is a country in transition. Much change is occurring, and it is occurring at a phenomenal pace.
	<p>This was brought home to me forcefully when President Bush sent me to China in December of 1992 to normalize commercial relations that had been disrupted with the imposition of sanctions on China after the crackdown at Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989. I was the first Cabinet Secretary to visit the country officially since that sad day, and my mission removed one of the sanctions--the one prohibiting ministerial contacts between our two governments. Together, my then counterpart, Minister of Foreign Economics and Trade Li Lanqing (now Vice Premier), and I reconvened the nearly moribund Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade. In addition, $1 billion worth of new contracts for U.S. companies were signed, and much additional business followed.
<p>	During this trip, I saw firsthand the hunger of the Chinese for prosperity, their intense desire to move quickly into the ranks of the world's strongest economies, and the fervor with which they were applying themselves to achieving this goal. Since that trip in December of 1992, I have been back to China regularly. Each time, I am struck again by the rapid progress the Chinese are making toward this objective.
<p>	Of course, the path of dramatic change is never smooth; semi-controlled chaos might be one way to describe it. Nor is such change always clearly discernible to those outside the country. But the outcome in China has tremendous significance for us in the United States, for the whole of Asia, and indeed for the rest of the world. There are many reasons why.<ul>
	<p><li>China is an emerging great power. It is the world's most populous country--1.2 billion people.
	<p><li>It is strategically positioned as the geographic center of Asia. China shares a border with 14 different countries. It has more common borders than any other country in the world.
	<p><li>China has the world's largest standing army, and it holds one of the seven permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council. This means that China has a voice in-- and a veto over--the decisions made by this organization.
	<p><li>Finally--and most importantly, given my view of the world today that economic concerns are primary drivers of global politics--we now have China's growing economic clout. China's economy is the fastest-growing large economy in the world. The World Bank already ranks China as the third-largest economy in the world behind the United States and Japan. Predictions are that China's economy will grow somewhere between 8 and 10 percent this year, and economists expect China's economy to continue growing at least 6 to 8 percent annually for the foreseeable future. That means China is well on the way to becoming the world's largest economy within the next 15 years.
	<p><li>China is the largest market in the world for aircraft, for telephones, for construction equipment, for agricultural products, and increasingly for consumer goods. The country needs virtually everything we produce and sell. And demand is growing rapidly. In cities like Shenzhen in the south of China, the first of the Special Economic Zones created by Deng Xiaoping's reform drive, one can stand on the street corner and feel the dynamism and the energy as the Chinese people build another Hong Kong. The same can be said for Shanghai, reportedly sporting nearly 25 percent of the world's cranes, or Tianjin or Zhuhai. The whirlwind pace of growth and change is awe-inspiring.</ul><p>
	Now for the flip side.<p>
	Despite the dynamic economic growth, GDP per capita in China is only about $300. Some parts of China, especially in the north and the west, have not yet been touched by the freedom of the Special Economic Zones and are still very poor. In contrast, GDP per capita is much greater--probably far higher than $300--for people living along the coast and in the south of China, where the change has been the greatest.
<p>
<b>China--A Place of Contradictions</b><p>
	China today is, in some ways, hard to describe. Contradictions abound, starting with the government's self-description of the country as a "socialist market economy." Such contradictions pop up constantly as the leadership tries to put a Communist rationale and a Chinese face on activities that would make Karl Marx turn over in his grave.
	<p>China today is not a police state like Stalin's Russia; nor is there the indiscriminate violence and intolerance of the Cultural Revolution. But neither is it a democracy. There is a ruling elite in Beijing, but the central government is no longer as powerful as it once was. The provinces are flexing their muscles, and some officials are candid about wanting "Beijing off our backs." Besides the greater economic freedoms in China today, there is greater mobility, the beginnings of better job opportunities, greater tolerance for and interest in education, and greater freedom of discussion.
<p>	China is governed by a collective leadership in Beijing. Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader, is still alive but not active in governing. His hand-picked successor, President and General Secretary Jiang Zemin, seems to have consolidated his power for the near term. But his word is not law; he must gain consensus among the others in the collective leadership. That is sometimes difficult and makes for erratic reactions, arrogant posturing, slow decisions, or no decisions on occasion.
<p>	Some people seem to believe that when Deng finally passes away there will be a great skirmish for power. I think not. I think the post-Deng era has already begun and that the collective leadership will stay in place at least for awhile.
<p>	One indicator of the course China may take in the near future will come within the next year to 18 months. Premier Li Peng is due to move out of the premiership, according to Party rules, and the Party Congress will choose his replacement. Who the Congress chooses could be an important signal. Much jockeying is going on now behind the scenes. From the U.S. perspective, the best choice would be someone committed to reform and familiar with the United States to replace the more nationalistic Li Peng.
<p>	Longer term, the real questions are: Will the Communist Party continue to enjoy legitimacy among the populace? Will it continue to satisfy the growing appetite for prosperity? Will there be another paramount leader, such as Deng and Mao? Or will China have opened up too much for one person to be able to command so much respect and power? And if there is no paramount leader, will a collective leadership survive? If not, what form will the leadership structure take, and how will the leadership be chosen? Or will China regress? Will there be a leadership change by force? What role might the military play?
<p>	History is little help to us here. Despite the tendency of China to have "paramount leaders" throughout its long civilization, the paradigm has changed significantly, thanks to the new economic freedoms, the march of technology, instantaneous communication globally, and a more closely integrated world.
<p>	Within China, the central government and the provinces are attempting to deal with myriad problems and issues. They are working now with the Ninth Five Year Plan. This one stresses a number of goals, including strengthening China's agriculture and bringing prosperity to the rural economy; creating infrastructure and building basic industries to address such needs as water conservation, greater energy production, and reliable communications; promoting science and technology; reforming state enterprises; expanding education; and moving toward a rule of law.
<p>	A big concern is the migration of people from rural areas to the cities in search of prosperity with the attendant possibility of social unrest. There are potential shortages of water and of oil. There is corruption. There is pollution. And these are just a few of the challenges and obstacles confronting China's leadership today.
<p>	What happens in China will bear close watching. I believe the drive to free the economy may well be irreversible. The Chinese people want prosperity and material things. They want to get rich. Political freedom and democracy seem not to be at the top of most people's agendas--prosperity is. Perhaps as material needs are better met, the Chinese people's desires will change. We will just have to see.
	<p>However, I believe that the U.S. posture toward China and the tone of the U.S.-China governmental relationship can have an influence on which way things go. It will also help determine whether China is an ally, a belligerent friend, or an enemy.
<p>
<b>The U.S.-China Relationship</b><p>
	Our relationship with China is anchored on three communiques, signed between 1972 and 1982, and the Taiwan Relations Act that was passed in 1979. The 1972 communique--the Shanghai Communique--was agreed to by President Richard Nixon and Chairman Mao Zedong. This was when the "one China" policy was first articulated. It has been the bedrock of the United States' diplomatic posture toward China ever since.
<p>	Currently, the relationship between our two governments is at the lowest point it has been in many years. It is characterized by distrust and misunderstanding on both sides. Let's just review what has happened since the Clinton Administration took over management of this critical relationship.
<p>	After charging President Bush with "coddling dictators" during the 1992 campaign, candidate Clinton changed his tune once he became President. Following an entertaining spectacle of dithering and public hand-wringing of the sort that has characterized this Administration, President Clinton adopted the very same "engagement" policy espoused by President Bush. Funny how one's perspective changes after one becomes the leader of the free world, isn't it?
<p>	The problem with President Clinton's change of heart and new policy began when the Administration didn't follow it. Three years later, the policy has become so muddled by ad hoc decisions and inconsistent actions that it is hard to ascertain what it is. And because of the mixed signals sent by Clinton and his Cabinet, many Chinese now have come to believe that our policy is the "containment" of China--an idea they deeply resent.
	<p>The big turnaround on President Clinton's part occurred during the 1994 annual battle over renewing most-favored-nation (MFN) status for China. The President announced that he would certify MFN renewal without the conditions regarding human rights that he had attached the preceding year. His decision was correct on the merits; trade and human rights should not be linked. Punishing trade does nothing to correct human rights abuses. But because the Administration made this decision unilaterally, without first gaining concessions on other trade issues from the Chinese, the policy change actually created confusion and caused the Chinese to think they had "won," that the Clinton Administration had backed down in the face of business pressure, and that they did not have to do anything else to satisfy the U.S. on trade. In fact, the Administration did give China a big victory--and got nothing in return.
<p>	Currently, from the Chinese perspective, the greatest obstacle to improving relations between our two countries probably is the question of Taiwan. One of the biggest flaps over this issue was sparked by something that to many here seemed rather unimportant--the granting of a visa to Lee Teng-hui, the President of Taiwan, in June of last year so that he could attend a reunion at Cornell University.
<p>	Again, this situation was badly handled. After promises had been made to China that such a visa would not be issued, President Clinton apparently changed his mind (what a surprise). He reversed this decision, thus pulling the rug out from under his own Secretary of State, who had made assurances to his counterpart, China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, that the visa would not be granted. Needless to say, Beijing reacted angrily and promptly recalled its ambassador. The decision to allow President Lee to visit the U.S. was interpreted by the Chinese as a violation of the spirit of the "one China" policy, and therefore an infringement on Chinese sovereignty. Sovereignty is a gut issue with the Chinese and has been ever since the "one China" policy was first articulated.
<p>	Another strain on the relationship was added earlier this year. Our country was incensed at the saber-rattling missile exercises and military maneuvers the Chinese  government carried out in the Taiwan Straits prior to the Taiwan elections. In response, the U.S. sent aircraft carriers to the region. Now, in the aftermath of the Taiwan election, tensions have been lowered, but some here in the United States are still distrustful of China's intentions toward Taiwan.
<p>Countless other examples could be cited to illustrate the inconsistency of U.S. policy, the mixed signals, and the escalating tensions which have characterized the Clinton Administration approach toward China. And although the two presidents have met on more than one occasion, they have not established anything that resembles a personal or a working relationship.
<p>
<b>Renewal of Most-Favored-Nation Trading Status-Again</b>
<p>	And now here we are again, debating the subject of most-favored-nation (MFN) renewal for China one more time. The annual discussion is under the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Act of 1974. The amendment denies MFN to any "non-market" economy which restricts free emigration unless the President makes the determination to waive the restrictions. This amendment was aimed originally at the USSR during the Cold War era. But in recent years, since Tiananmen Square, the annual MFN debate has become the vehicle through which a variety of discontents with China have been raised. This year is no different, except that the number of issues with China has increased.
<p>	The President has certified to Congress his desire to renew MFN without conditions. Senator Dole, the presumed Republican presidential nominee, has stated his strong pro-MFN position. The Republican leadership in Congress agrees. Now the action is with Congress, which has 60 days to debate and vote. Congress should concur with renewing MFN for China. Denying it or attaching unrelated conditions makes no sense.<ul>
	<p><li>First, the economic consequences would be profound. Denial of MFN would impede trade, raise tariffs, and make it more costly to do business in China. At least 170,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs were directly dependent on U.S. exports to China last year, and thousands of others in such areas as transportation and finance are indirectly linked. Denying MFN would slow China's reform progress as well.
	<p><li>Second, such action would send a negative message to the Asia-Pacific region, a place where some countries already are concerned that the United States is planning to withdraw despite the fact that our presence is viewed as critical to ensuring stability in that part of the world.
	<p><li>Third, denial of MFN to China would harm the economies of Hong Kong and Taiwan, the two largest investors in the mainland--and both places in which we have a considerable stake.
	<p><li>Finally, denial of MFN will not correct or erase any of the concerns we have with China, whether they be human rights, nuclear proliferation, anti-Taiwan saber-rattling, or something else. Seeking to punish China through this vehicle simply does not serve our national interest.</ul><p>
	Furthermore, I think the time has come, before MFN renewal comes up again next year, to make MFN for China permanent. After all, we accord permanent MFN status to most other countries, including some considered rogue states, such as Iraq and Libya. Our strategic and economic relationship with the world's most populous country is too important to continue engaging in an annual mud-wrestling event around this issue. Doing this means changing or repealing the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, an action that should be high on the agenda of the President and Congress next year.
<p>
<b>Challenges</b><p>
	There are challenges to getting this done. Many people have serious and very real concerns about China.<ul>
	<p><li>First, the issue of human rights, which has cropped up every year since the crackdown at Tiananmen Square, raises everyone's sympathy and creates outrage among all of us who value personal liberty and freedom. All of us flinch at the reports about the detention of some dissidents, Chinese methods of population control, and allegedly poor treatment of children at orphanages. Needless to say, we disagree with the way in which China deals with many of these matters, but using trade as a weapon to try to force the Chinese into adopting more respect for human rights is not the way to make progress.
	<p><li>Second, nuclear proliferation looms as a major worry. Intelligence reports over the past few years--some apparently substantiated, some not--indicate that China has shipped missile technology and parts to Pakistan and Iran. Most recently, allegations that China shipped ring magnets to Pakistan caused some people to claim that China had violated the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1994. This act calls for mandatory sanctions once a finding of violation has been made. Specifically, this means that the U.S. Export-Import Bank could not make or guarantee any loans for projects in China. The Administration recently declined to make such a finding, in exchange for China's assurance that it would strictly observe its obligations under the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
	<p>Once again, using trade as a weapon to address these concerns will not eliminate the problems. In addition, we have to question whether this sort of law punishes U.S. exports, and therefore U.S. jobs and well-being, more than it punishes the offending nation. This is a law which ought to be revised in the next Congress as well.
	<p><li>Third is the issue of intellectual property rights. A trade war was just averted on Monday by an 11th-hour finding by acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky that China had made substantial progress in complying with a 1995 agreement to protect intellectual property rights. The Administration had threatened sanctions if the Chinese did not take concrete steps to enforce the agreement; the Chinese had threatened to retaliate. So the good news is that we found that China had closed 15 factories that had been producing 30 to 50 million pirated CDs and videos yearly, shuttered six distribution centers, and instituted a ban on the importation of equipment needed to produce these products. The bad news is that this action does not solve the problem. It is a step in the right direction, but it is just a step and an incremental one at that. We are going to have to keep consistent pressure on the Chinese to continue making progress on the matter of safeguarding intellectual property rights until the rule of law is firmly established in China.
	<p><li>Fourth is another commercial dispute--our mounting trade deficit with China. The deficit, growing at nearly 20 percent annually in recent years, could reach nearly $40 billion this year. The worry is that China's market is still too closed and that U.S. jobs are disappearing to places around the world, like China, where labor is much cheaper.
	<p><li>Fifth is the question of Taiwan. Some Taiwan advocates want to punish China for the recent saber-rattling and for other things. Despite this--maybe even because of it--President Lee Teng-hui won handily, making Taiwan a shining example of economic freedom leading to political freedom. The United States does indeed have commitments to Taiwan, and we should honor them. But we need to be careful not to overstep and involve ourselves in the Beijing-Taipei debate when we have no reason to be there. It should be noted that the Independence Party candidate garnered barely 20 percent of the vote in the March election.
	<p><li>Then there is Hong Kong, which reverts to China on June 30 next year. How Beijing handles this situation will be viewed by many as a precursor to the way in which reunification with Taiwan, if it is to occur, would be handled. Already Beijing is making many people uneasy with such actions as announcing its intention to close down the Hong Kong Legislative Council and replace it with another body and issuing confusing statements about its intentions to respect freedom of the press in Hong Kong.
	<p><li>Finally, another strategic concern is the intentions of China's military. Some people also worry that U.S. products now sold in China could be diverted for military uses.</ul><p>
	Finding ways to deal with all of these very tough issues in a constructive manner is the challenge before us today.
	<p>One interesting obstacle to getting this done is posed by the fact that the majority of the American people are viewing China through an old stereotype. They either envision a Stalinist-type police state or think of peasants and water buffalo in rice paddies. Part of the challenge for those in China--and I believe there are many--who want to have a better relationship with the United States is to make Americans understand how China is changing and what the Chinese people want in their future.
<p>
<b>The Future</b><p>
	So where do we want our relationship with China to go from here? <p>
	Currently, the U.S. policy--or, more accurately, non-policy--is fraught with inconsistencies. This has led to confusion on the part of the Chinese about what we really mean. They, in turn, often behave in ways that we have difficulty understanding, and seem sometimes to be both arrogant and paranoid.
<p>	The business relationships, however, between the two countries are much more cordial and productive. That is good and it is hopeful.
<p>	However, the tension in the governmental relationship can and does negatively affect some commercial activity. Every time tensions increase, there are large projects which are held up. Some contracts U.S. firms hope to get go to other countries. The approval of licenses and branches, particularly in the financial services area, has slowed. All of this creates a climate of uncertainty and heightens the risk for American businesses.
<p>	There is one clear example of where Administration policy, which some think politically motivated in this election year, has hurt U.S. business prospects: the enormous Three Gorges Dam project, which the Chinese have been talking about for 50 years. Administration objections to this project on environmental grounds have caused the Export-Import Bank to announce that it will not help finance U.S. companies bidding on the project.
	<p>None of this helps our overall relationship with China. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the Administration to get its act together and make every effort to improve the bilateral relationship. The President and the executive branch must do it. Congress has a say, but Congress is not empowered or equipped to manage foreign relations day to day.
<p>	Engagement with China is the right policy. But the policy must be more than just words. Consistent actions speak far louder than words.
<p>	What we urgently need is a strategic framework for our relationship. This does not mean that we are going to be soft on China. It does mean that we have to define a clear set of goals, objectives, and expectations for our relationship and clearly articulate this to the Chinese. And they must have the opportunity to do the same. This is what has been missing from our relationship for the past three-and-a-half years. We must have a meaningful dialogue at the highest levels in order to push for what we want to achieve.
<p>	In putting this framework in place, we should concentrate first on areas where we have common interests and some agreement. The commercial sector is a good place to start.
	<p>Currently, thousands of U.S. companies are doing business in China. That number has increased significantly between my mission in 1992 and now. U.S. companies have about $26 billion invested in China, making the United States the third-largest investor after Hong Kong and Taiwan. Eighty percent of this investment was made since 1992. And, of course, the U.S. has considerable investment in Hong Kong as well--$12 billion at last count. In fact, the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong is the largest AmCham in the world.
<p>	The U.S. needs to work with the Chinese to bring about increased market access; to enforce intellectual property rights--a crucial issue for us; to reduce the overemphasis the Chinese government currently places on technology transfer and exporting by investor companies; and to help bring about a consistent rule of law.
<p>	The U.S. also needs to work with China to bring that country into the World Trade Organization (WTO) on reasonable terms. We need to help find a way around the current impasse: that China claims to be a developing country while we maintain she is not because of the clout associated with her sheer size. It is in our interest to have China join the WTO, on acceptable terms; that way, we could pursue our trade agenda multilaterally and would have added support for getting China to conform to the rules governing world trade.
<p>	Let me digress a moment and comment further on that. I think the Clinton Administration generally has been too unilateral in its approach to trade and often has been too knee-jerk confrontational in its style--a style which has not achieved results commensurate with its bluster. I suggest that we change our approach to trade negotiating. We should concentrate on a desired objective and then decide which tools and which negotiating style will best achieve the results we want. Talking tough to win political points at home is hardly a rational trade policy.
<p>	I also believe that the Chinese want a peaceful, stable world. Their primary objective right now is to industrialize and spread prosperity throughout their land. Wars and conflicts divert resources from this objective. Here is another area where I believe there is room for us to work with the Chinese, on non-proliferation concerns as well as on other strategic issues.
<p>	For other matters about which we have had disagreements in the past, we could look for items where we have a common interest and where we could agree. In those places where we cannot agree, we should still maintain a dialogue and make every effort to manage these problems.
<p>	Some predict the U.S. and China will become enemies over time. This is, of course, possible. But if it occurs, and I hope it does not, let us hope our policies--or lack thereof--do not contribute to such an outcome. Instead, our vision of the U.S.-China relationship ought to be rooted in making allies and friends of the Chinese. Withdrawing or doing nothing is simply not an option. An American presence is critical to maintaining a balance in Asia. Thus, the United States must remain engaged, both militarily and economically, in that part of the world.
<p>	We must keep in mind, too, that many in China are concerned about the deteriorating relationship with the U.S. Despite what we might think some days, the Chinese people admire America. They covet our products and much about our way of life. This is underscored by the fact that so many of them want to come here and send their children here to school.
<p>	Much work needs to be done to repair the U.S.-China relationship. The best way to promote progress is to stay engaged, to encourage China's economic reform and integration into the world community. To do this, we need to exercise the best diplomatic judgment and skills, to disagree with the Chinese when we must, be tough-minded when necessary, but do so in the context of fostering an important friendship. We need to encourage, cajole, and coax the Chinese forward instead of blustering, threatening, and shouting at them in public as the Clinton Administration has been doing. Above all, we need to treat our Chinese friends as we would any other friends: with dignity and fairness.
<p>	The road will not be easy. The Chinese, caught up in the process of great change, at times will be difficult. They will do things we do not agree with. We need to handle these matters in the context of our broader objective.
<p>	China has made astonishing progress in the past 17 years. If that progress toward economic reforms, prosperity, and a general opening up of the country continues for the next 17 years, China will indeed be perceived as a great power. The American people need to learn this. They must become better educated and more aware of what is going on in China today.
<p>	We cannot turn our back on the possibility of helping free markets and democracy along in China. If we are short-sighted and fail to adopt a long-term vision about our relationship, if we continue our current schizophrenic approach to China policy, who knows what direction change could take? The U.S. and the world cannot afford to take this risk.

<h3> ENTERING THE PACIFIC CENTURY</h3></p>
<p><b>By Senator Jesse Helms</b></p>
<p>
The Second Annual B.C. Lee Lecture, given March 26, 1996<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are many great self-declared institutions in Washington. Some profess to have decided impacts on America's foreign policy. Then there are others truly making significant contributions; these are substantially fewer. <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Ed Feulner</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/allen.htm">Richard Allen</a> are among the most significant players behind these few institutions -- but more about them in a moment.
<p>
<table border=0><tr><td><img src="lect562.gif" align=left width=277 height=196></td></tr><tr><td><font size="-1"><b>Heritage President Ed Feulner, center, introduces<br>
 Sen. Helms to Jay Lee, grandson of the late <br>
B.C. Lee, founder of the Samsung Group</td></tr></table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage Foundation was in its infancy in the early 1970s during my first years in the Senate. But it had by then already become "self-evident," as one of our greatest documents puts it, that Heritage was moving rapidly in its remarkable leadership with its advocacy of, and its support for, great principles that deserve to survive.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
History will appropriately record the enormously important role that Ed Feulner has played in restoring and preserving the meaning and the miracle of America. And Richard V. Allen, who is so highly respected in this city and far beyond, has made the difference on countless occasions and in countless matters when America's future was hanging in the balance. Richard Allen and Ed Feulner together founded the Asian Studies Center in 1983, and Mr. Allen has served as its chairman ever since.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I mention all of this in paying my respects to these two patriots, and to thank them, and you, for the honor of having been chosen to offer my remarks at this second annual B.C. Lee lecture for the Heritage Foundation. And let me also take just a moment to recognize in this distinguished company my good friend and colleague, Representative Benjamin Gilman, the Chairman of the House International Relations Committee.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The year 1983 didn't appear to have the rosy glow foretelling the dawn of the Pacific Century. Leonid Brezhnev had just died, the Soviet Union was in turmoil, and the United States was fighting the final battles of the Cold War. The Heritage Foundation was preoccupied with those and other pressing issues of the day, but it was also looking forward. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In 1983, as I have indicated, Heritage founded its Asian Studies Center, a reflection of its understanding of the vital role Asia was to play in the post-Cold War future. That forward-looking vision is the reason Heritage is today one of America's preeminent think tanks, a policy center on which I and many other Members of Congress rely.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In identifying the 21st century as the Pacific Century, I am merely stating the obvious: During the past decade, the world's center of gravity has shifted. And it will continue to move eastward away from Europe, toward Asia, because as the nations of Eastern Europe and the states of the former Soviet Union were struggling to break free of communism, Pacific Rim nations were busily taking care of business at home.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Their hard work has paid off. The Asia-Pacific region currently accounts for more than 40 percent of the world's trade and U.S.-Pacific Rim trade has out paced trade across the Atlantic. Thankfully for the United States -- though the political and economic center of gravity may have shifted West to East, Europe to Asia -- we remain uniquely positioned, not only geographically, but strategically, politically, and economically at the center. The United States thus remains the world's anchor.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
And that is where we must stay. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The fall of the Berlin Wall forced the United States to reexamine its role in the world. There were some who believed that the end of the Cold War was the time to turn inward, to spend a little time with our own problems. Others argued that the U.S. is the only country in the world with the moral, economic, and strategic strength to bring the rest of the world along. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I am convinced that we cannot be the best nation in the world unless we are willing to lead the world. We cannot lead by being the world's policeman, nor the world's babysitter, but by being what we have been for most of the 20th century -- the standard-bearer of moral, political, and military might and right, an example towards which all others aspire.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In Congress, U.S. alliances in the Pacific enjoy bipartisan support. Some of us focus on political alliances, others on economic, others on strategic, and still others on moral alliances. But all of us recognize that those alliances need strengthening. The question is how to prioritize our objectives.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But, first, what are our priorities?  Clearly, one reason the United States has seemed to be flailing around in the world, rushing from disaster to disaster, is because the Clinton Administration has failed to set priorities. Everything, from Burundi to Bosnia, is equally important -- and, therefore, equally unimportant. Our old allies in Europe are watching us and wondering with amazement where the United States is headed. And you can bet that our new allies in Asia are scratching their heads, too.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In just a few short years, the Clinton Administration has managed to warp U.S.-Asia policy so badly that, at any one time, the United States is at odds with China, Japan, and the Korean peninsula. Right now, many Asian nations fear that we are propelling ourselves down the road to irrelevance. And we're not just strolling either.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In China, the United States has neither a strategy, nor resolve, for dealing with areas of key interests to the United States On the Korean peninsula, this Administration has given lip service to our allies in South Korea while dealing directly with the North Koreans on issues ranging from their nuclear program to the delivery of humanitarian food aid. Food aid, for heaven's sakes, that North Korea demanded, while South Korea -- our friend and ally -- was insisting the North did not need.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If this State Department, this National Security Council, and this White House, are determined to continue their experiments in foreign policy, let us pray that they will not make the devastating mistake of delegating decision-making to our enemies of forty years, the North Koreans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States simply cannot afford to abdicate its role in the dominant region of the 21st century. We must have priorities, and we must stand up for them. And, yes, if and when necessary, fight for them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Setting our priorities is no easy business. Asia presents daunting challenges. Consider the following:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Communist China considers itself prepared to step into the role of a dominant world power, yet demonstrates time and again that it has neither the maturity nor the decency to handle the role;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
North Korea maintains its million-man army and its militant, anti-Western propaganda machine while the United States props up North Korea's failing economy through a faulty agreement;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Meanwhile Taiwan's dedication to democracy and capitalism deserves our continued support -- politically and militarily -- even in the face of severe opposition from Mainland China; 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Southeast Asians, proud of their continued economic miracles, are nervous about the Chinese military modernization and territorial claims in the South China Sea and are therefore pushing the ASEAN alliance into a strategic alliance, as well as an economic one; and
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
India and Pakistan, like two caged tigers, compete for nuclear weaponry and missile technology, all the while scratching at their wounds in Kashmir. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But China is the greatest challenge. China is still trying to figure out how to play its own role on the world stage. In the meantime, the United States cannot be hamstrung by China's confusion. The United States must not sit still in the thrall of an awakening dragon. We must define U.S. interests in Asia now, as the dragon awakes, and hope that the dragon will awaken on the right side of the bed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Just three days ago, in Taiwan, the world watched as the free Taiwanese people cast their ballots in the first democratic presidential election ever in a Chinese-speaking country. President Lee Teng-hui scored a decisive victory in a hotly contested election. All of us, of course, congratulate President Lee and applaud his vision for Taiwan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Think about it for a moment: In 1979, when the Carter Administration callously cut formal ties with our long-time ally, Taiwan, it was the Congress of the United States that compelled Mr. Carter to sign the Taiwan Relations Act -- the only law of the United States governing our relations with Taiwan. In passing the Taiwan Relations Act, Congress expressed its bipartisan support for Taiwan. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The election of President Ronald Reagan guaranteed that the Taiwan Relations Act would be properly enforced to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself against any external threat. At that time, most countries in the world ignored Taiwan. And, like some in the United States, these same people assumed it was only a matter of time before the Communists on the mainland consumed tiny Taiwan. That hasn't happened, and it will not happen as long as I am in the U.S. Senate.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the 1980s, the Reagan and Bush Administrations followed a consistent, principled policy toward Taiwan. It was not the least bit ambiguous. During this period, the people of Taiwan persisted. They accelerated the rate of growth in their free market economy, attracted high technology manufacturers, raised their own living standards, and encouraged the establishment of democracy. Even the most vigorous supporters of the Taiwanese -- myself included -- would never have thought that kind of progress possible in such a short period, especially given the fact that the Communists in Red China fought them the whole way.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So where does Taiwan go from here?  Will the Communists continue to threaten and bluster, wielding their own military machine time and again against Taiwan?  Not if the United States plays the role it should.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
First of all, Taiwan deserves to participate in international organizations. Taiwan trades with the world, freely and fairly. Taiwan has a thriving, free market economy and a sound currency. Taiwan meets the fundamental criteria for membership in the World Trade Organization and should be admitted now, regardless of Mainland China's admission timetable. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Second, the United States must continue a vigorous and faithful implementation of the Taiwan Relations Act and all of its provisions. The United States has promised, and is obligated by law, to provide Taiwan with enough military equipment to defend itself against any external threat. The recent military exercises in the Taiwan Strait orchestrated by the Chinese Communists prove this to be more important than ever. We can and should -- we must -- remove any supposed barriers to providing Taiwan with state-of-the-art defensive systems and equipment. Taiwan threatens no one; the same cannot be said of Mainland China.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Third, we must actively engage other countries in the region to encourage and assist Taiwan's peaceful democratic growth. It will be Taiwan's economic growth upon which other economies in the region will come to rely. It is those countries that should be encouraged to support Taiwan on the political front as well. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Fourth, to ensure that we do not contradict our goal of encouraging Taiwan's economic growth in conditions of democracy, the United States must be exceptionally cautious concerning the technologies we sell to Communist China. The United States does not serve its own long-term interests well by augmenting Communist China's military capability.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As for Mainland China, it has become an appalling habit in various U.S. administrations to speak to China as if to a child. We outline our expectations, and when they are not met -- and they are never met -- we make excuses. But the Chinese are not children, and we are not their parents. Respect for human life, willingness to obey international agreements -- these are U.S. priorities, not homework assignments. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Refusing to punish China when China does not live up to its commitments in the world only further encourages China's intransigence. Too often we don't follow through on sanctions because we worry that we will lose a share of the elusive Chinese market. But we are forgetting at least two things when we do that. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
First, the Chinese need us as much as, if not more than, we need them. Chinese growth and continued prosperity are dependent on a continued stream of foreign investment and trade. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Second, we forget the beloved Asian tradition of bargaining. If we explain our bottom line and then don't follow through to defend it, they'll push us to an even lower bottom line the next time around. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Twice recently, the United States has backed away from sanctioning China for its bad behavior. The United States, under the steady direction of Mickey Kantor, vowed to sanction China if it did not implement the agreement that China signed more than a year ago regarding intellectual property rights protection. Shockingly to nobody, except perhaps Mr. Kantor, the Chinese didn't live up to the terms of the agreement. But, you see, the Chinese know us too well. They dangled a $4 billion bid for Boeing planes in return for our not imposing the sanctions on intellectual property.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
More serious still than thieving brand-name sneakers are China's nefarious proliferation activities. In the face of China's transfer of strategically crucial missiles to one of the world's most destabilizing, terrorist nations, Iran, the Clinton Administration has sat on its hands. The Chinese play us well: They sign an agreement, violate it, and in return are awarded lucrative contracts with U.S. firms in which the U.S. firm is required to transfer important proprietary technology. What a deal.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
U.S. laws regarding sanctions for international trafficking in missiles and in weapons of mass destruction are clear. We disregard them at our own choosing -- and at our own peril.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The size of the Chinese market has blinded far too many to the Chinese threat. Military cadres in the Chinese leadership maintain a dominant role in the policymaking process. It is the generals, and not the apparatchiks, who enjoy a stranglehold over policy. It is they who have pushed China's drive to modernize its armed forces from a defensive, brown-water type to a blue-water force capable of forward deployment throughout Asia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By the end of the next decade, China will be capable of locking up the world's most strategic waterways. By reasserting its claims to atolls in the South China Sea and by selling billions of dollars in military hardware to the regime in Burma, while building shipping ports off the Burmese coast in the Indian Ocean, the Chinese are in a position to cut off the international right of free passage in those waters. One call from Beijing could very well cut off over 50 percent of the world's trade.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Japanese, the Koreans, the Southeast Asians, and the South Asians all see the trend and, in response, are begging the United States to maintain the 7th Fleet in the region. U.S. military presence in the region is vital. If we're willing to use U.S. armed forces to build toilets and sewers for Haitians, there is no question we should bolster U.S. forces to defend and maintain right of passage through these crucial international maritime routes. We not only would insure our own economic well-being, but also would maintain stability in markets throughout the world. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Clearly, the United States cannot shoulder the financial and logistical burden of defending Asia's waterways alone. In return for our services, the countries of the region are going to have to offer far more access and hospitality to our military.We will have to depend on our allies far more than we do now. Which brings me to the crucial role of the U.S.-Japan military alliance. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States and Japan, like it or not, share common goals and objectives for the Asia-Pacific. Our economies will come to depend upon the enormous economic growth in Asia -- a peaceful Asia, that is. The economic forces of an increasingly interdependent global economy and the strategic rise of China are hurtling the United States and Japan down the same path. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the United States is to attain its security objectives in Asia, the U.S.-Japan alliance must remain strong. However, our alliance with Japan has come under sharp scrutiny in recent months, and I am persuaded that the relationship must be reexamined -- not to determine whether it should continue, but how best it should continue.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
However, we must not fool ourselves. If the United States were to leave the Japanese to fend for themselves, I am convinced that Japan would go nuclear within ten years. It is entirely possible that within the course of the next century, the world may very well witness the development of a nuclear-armed Japan, a nuclear-armed and reunified Korean peninsula, a China with modern, forward-deployed armed forces, a still-divided and nuclear-armed South Asia and an arms race on a scale never seen before in Southeast Asia. That scenario is in nobody's best interest. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Japan must, however, do more. Japan must take responsibility in the world, not as a commercial buccaneer, but as a mature, responsible nation. We should be encouraging the Japanese to take a leadership role commensurate with Japan's economic standing. That means far more, for example, than affording Japan a seat on the U.N. Security Council to demonstrate its position in the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It means that Japan will have to start making hard choices -- choices that may mean forgoing a market opportunity in a country in return for improvement in the standard of living for a nation's people. As yet, they have shied away from putting themselves on the line on some of the toughest policy issues like human rights and proliferation. It means that Japan maintains a strong enough economy that it should begin to use its influence not just toopen markets, but to leverage its power to affect change for the better in other countries. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As Japan takes more responsibilities onto itself, I hope our trading relationship can flourish fairly. And on that note, I must tip my hat to Mickey Kantor. He has shown real gumption in pushing Japan with the threat of sanctions and retaliation in U.S. markets, all of which goes to show that not every fight needs to end in a war if the United States is willing to stand up to defend its national interests. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The South Koreans should be mindful in this regard, as well. A solid friendship underlies the U.S.-South Korean relationship. But if South Korea is to play a more significant role on the world stage, it, too, must become more considerate of, and receptive to, American goods and services. While the process of liberalization is underway, it should be accelerated.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economic front is not the only front on which Asia will challenge U.S. policymakers. All sorts of strategic alignments and realignments are occurring throughout Asia. The United States has to keep abreast of these changes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
One of the best prospects for a flashpoint in the region is the Korean peninsula. Along with 650,000 South Korean troops, 37,000 Americans face a million-man North Korean army poised along the border of North and South Korea, a little more than a marathon distance from Seoul. The results of the much-vaunted U.S.-North Korea Agreed Framework on the nuclear issue have yet to be seen, but one thing is clear: The Clinton Administration handled the North Korean regime with the same kid gloves it has heretofore used to handle all dictators from Castro to Aristide. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States has now agreed to supply hundreds of millions of dollars of oil to North Korea, enough oil to prop up the failing North Korean economy and thereby ensure that the Stalinist regime stays in power. That makes no sense. North Korea signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It violated it. It should not get paid for that violation
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Saddest, perhaps, is that the world has learned only one valuable lesson from the vile activities of the North Koreans. The world has sadly learned that the United States can be blackmailed. When the going got tough, the United States has been willing to offer up the checkbooks of the American taxpayer. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Our great bargain with North Korea gives the North modern nuclear reactor technology that still allows them to produce plutonium for a nuclear weapon. The saving grace for the Clinton Administration?  The North Koreans won't be able to produce as much plutonium for nuclear weapons. And we are supposed to be relieved?  Give me a break.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Indeed, the Agreed Framework is so discredited with our allies that the tripartite international organization established to implement it can't beg or borrow enough to carry out its mandate. And why won't our allies ante up?  Because they're not sanguine about the deal that was struck.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
One of the central tenets of our compact with Pyongyang was that the North would begin a substantive dialogue with our allies, the South Koreans. It has not happened. The Administration has tried to convince the world that by offering the carrot of a nuclear reactor to the North, the rest of the world would benefit by having coaxed the North to talk with the South. It hasn't happened yet, and there doesn't seem to be any real movement in that direction. The real path to peace on the Korean peninsula runs directly from Seoul to Pyongyang -- not from Pyongyang to Washington. Dialogue between North and South Korea is one of the only chances the world has of seeing the Korean peninsula reunified on a peaceful, democratic, and economically solvent basis. That chance is disappearing as I speak.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
And now, if I may, let me turn to one of my old hobbyhorses, Russia. I am unaccustomed to regarding Russia as an Asian power, but the time has come to recognize that fully half of Russia's territory lies in Asia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For nearly a thousand years, Russia has been torn by competing European and Asian influences. I believe they prefer to consider themselves Europeans.But frankly, I don't particularly care how Russia sees itself -- just as long as it does so within its own borders. Which is, historically, the biggest problem with Russia: It finds its borders so confining.... 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Every so often, our friends in Moscow decide that they have neglected their Asian side. Unfortunately, their interest has tended to manifest itself in the shape of wars of expansion. At the beginning of this century, the Russian and Japanese Empires collided in a great naval battle at Port Arthur. In World War II, the Soviet Union seized a group of islands from Japan that are today held by Russia -- an act which continues to poison relations between the two countries. Under the leadership of Stalin and Mao, the Soviet Union and China experienced decades of friction, including periodic border clashes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The challenge for Russia today is to overcome the legacy of military competition in the East and to build cooperative relations with its Asian neighbors. The question for us, however, is to what extent Russia chooses this course as an alternative to closer relations with the West.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Russia has indicated its interest in engaging Asia more closely -- witness President Yeltsin's widely touted trip to Beijing scheduled for early April. It is much repeated in Moscow that the "West" has not proven to be a gracious partner for Russia, and Russia therefore should look east. I will not dwell on the merit of Russia's criticism of the "West"; however, it is important that we all better understand what Russia seeks in engaging the East.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Closer ties between Russia and China are not automatically bad for U.S. interests. Those two nations share one of the longest land borders in the world. They certainly must, at a minimum, learn to coexist. However, if Russia seeks a closer relationship with the current regime in China as an alternative to the West, then Russia would defy its own interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some in Russia today advocate following the "Chinese model" of market economics without political freedom. This is pure folly. I see no chance that the people of Russia would allow themselves to be led by a government such as China's, which so callously disregards the rights of its own citizens. If Russia seeks partners in Asia, it should instead look to those nations which have found the path to economic success and political freedom. That's the best mix of East and West.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For real cooperation between Russia and China to succeed, it must be based on deeper interests than a momentary desire to unite against the West. I trust that responsible leaders in Russia know this to be true. I would not disregard the potential for the worst elements in the Russian and Chinese governments to try their very best to build such a relationship, but I doubt that they will succeed where Stalin and Mao failed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Frankly, I have less fear of a Sino-Russian partnership than I do of Russia's and China's meddling in Asia. Which brings me to a trouble spot that doesn't usually come up in discussions of the so-called Pacific Century -- that is, South Asia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Throughout the Cold War, India's own insularity allowed the United States the luxury of virtually ignoring the world's second largest nation. We no longer have that luxury for two reasons --  neither of them surprising to those of us who spend our time wrestling with the post-Cold War world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the past decade, India has become an economic power with which we all must reckon. Slowly, in its typical one step forward, ten steps backwards fashion, India is becoming an important player in the world economy. American companies are investing millions in India, and eyeing that nation's 200-plus-million middle class hungrily.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, as India becomes part of the world of fair-trading nations, India is also fighting to become a nuclear power. India exploded a nuclear device in 1974 and, until just a month or two ago, was on the verge of testing another. In addition, India has developed ballistic missiles and is moving quickly to produce them. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
India's leaders would have us believe that their drive for nuclear weapons and long-range missiles has to do with the odious Chinese threat to India's north, which is only partly true. Certainly, China has been no friend to India, and a good -- perhaps too good -- friend to Pakistan. But India's real problem is to its west, in Kashmir and in Pakistan. The vast majority of India's troops are concentrated on its Pakistani border and in Kashmir, and not on the Indo-Chinese border. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Pakistan, long a good and a true ally of the United States, is persuaded that India is bent on Pakistan's destruction. It's remedy has been to turn to the Safeway of proliferating nations -- China. Nuclear technology, missiles, arms of every kind are to be had for the asking over in Beijing. China, uniquely positioned to moderate the policies of its neighbors in South Asia, has instead used tensions in that region to profit on the deadly proliferation market. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So how, ideally, does the United States respond?  Ideally, we look to one of the sources of the problem: Kashmir. We work with a portion of the vigor we have dedicated to Middle East peacemaking to forcefully persuade India and Pakistan to move to a settlement. Ideally, we slam China for fueling the South Asia arms race and demonstrate our own seriousness in fighting proliferation. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But then there is the real world. The Clinton Administration makes excuses for China. Mind bogglingly, we are told -- again -- that China did not fully comprehend its commitments under the Nonproliferation Treaty and, therefore, probably was not in the "wrong" in transferring missile technology to Pakistan. Pakistan is threatened with sanctions for buying missiles and nuclear technology, and rightly so. But when Prime Minister Bhutto begs for help in dealing with India, the Clinton Administration is not interested.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
India, happy to absorb $100-plus-million in U.S. foreign aid every year, laughs in our faces when we demand that they work with us against proliferation. And at any hint that the United States might get serious, legions of companies are brought in to describe to us the importance of continuing to do business with India. After all, the Indians may not like China, but they sure have learned a thing or two from Beijing about how to manipulate Washington, D.C.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Well, now, I have spent much of my time talking about the 800-pound gorillas of Asia. Now let's talk a bit about the tigers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are booming. Over the past five years, they have averaged 7 percent growth, a trend that promises to continue for at least the next few decades. The ASEAN story is a genuine success story. Consider that a group of nations with disparate histories, languages, and economies joined together to ensure stability in the region. They recognized early on that they could provide commensurate counterweight to the economic and strategic forces of China, Japan, and the Korean peninsula only if they were united. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Developing strong ties with each of the members of ASEAN will be another linchpin in the U.S. approach to Asia. We must work -- and work harder -- with our close friends in ASEAN to encourage them to bring pressure for reform to bear on countries like Vietnam, Laos, and Burma --  - countries where repressive governments have still not adopted the rule of law or accepted the international norms for the treatment of human rights.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For Burma and Laos, the lure of ASEAN membership is a significant enough draw to encourage these countries actually to consider liberalization. The question will be whether the current ASEAN countries make that issue a priority. Without encouragement and even pressure from the United States, they will not do so. That would be a serious mistake -- though only one more in a series of mistakes in Asia for this administration. The United States cannot afford to let this ball drop. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Somehow the Clinton Administration approach to U.S.-Asia policy reminds me of Alice in Wonderland -- if you don't know where you're going, any road will get you there. The United States today is in the position, economically and militarily, to be the dominant friendly power in the Asia-Pacific. We can't afford to squander that position in the run-up to the Pacific Century. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There's no crystal ball telling us how the world will unfold, but I am confident of Asia's central part in that world. There is a famous Chinese proverb that says something along the lines of: "If the water is murky, just wait and let it settle. Then it will all be clear to you."  The future of the region and the U.S. position there is murky now, but we cannot sit and wait for the waters to clear before we define our policies. 

<p>U.S. policy must directly address U.S. interests in Asia. There are at least five points for us to stress:</p>

<p>(1) Maintain open and peaceful shipping waters for trade; </p>

<p>(2) Maintain a strategic balance between China, Japan, the Korean peninsula, and Southeast Asia, all the while preventing a cataclysmic arms race; </p>

<p>(3) Push for more open, less regulated markets for U.S. goods and services; </p>
<p/>
(4) Show the nations in the region that we are serious about their adherence to bilateral and multilateral agreements by punishing those who transgress; and </p>
<p>
(5) Strengthen the friendships we maintain with our true allies in the region -- Taiwan and South Korea, to name just two -- rather than coddle dictators because we fear that we might lose market share.</p>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
You have been patient with me, and I thank you most sincerely for the opportunity to share some views with you this evening. I am genuinely honored to be in the company of the high caliber of Asia and foreign policy specialists in this room tonight, and I hope I will have the benefit of your views later in the evening.
