<h2>INTRODUCTION </h2>
<P>
<FONT >The United States leads the world in the discovery
of the new drugs, biologics and medical devices that offer the
promise of longer and healthier lives for our citizens.  But the
process of actually developing these products and getting them
approved for marketing has become increasingly lengthy, expensive
and complex.  The past several decades have seen breathtaking
scientific breakthroughs in areas such as biotechnology and computing.
 But these breakthroughs have yet to be translated in a significant
way into new medical products that benefit patients.  Regulatory
demands and delays are not the only reasons for this stagnation,
but they are significant factors.  America's regulatory procedures
are among the slowest and most expensive in the developed world,
and it is now common for U.S. companies to conduct product testing
and development abroad and for new drugs and devices to be available
first in other countries.  Consider the following:</FONT>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT >The time required to bring a new drug to
market in the United States, from chemical synthesis to marketing,
has increased steadily, from slightly more than six years in the
mid-1960s to almost 15 years currently<sup><a href="foot.html">1</a></sup>.</FONT>
<LI><FONT >The percentage of drugs first available
in the United States is low.  Seventy-three percent of drugs approved
by the FDA during 1987-93 had already been approved elsewhere.
 In the area of anticancer agents, for example, the United States
once led the world and now lags behind other nations.  During
the 1960s, cancer patients in the United States had more anticancer
agents available to them than did patients in Great Britain, Germany,
France or Japan.  Now, in contrast, patients in the United States
have fewer anticancer agents available than those in any of these
countries.<sup><a href="foot.html">2</a></sup></FONT>
<LI><FONT >In the medical device area, a product that
takes four years to bring to market in Europe frequently requires
six years in the United States<sup><a href="foot.html">3</a></sup>.  As a result, medical device manufacturers
in large numbers are first introducing their products offshore,
and American patients increasingly are receiving therapies that
are a generation or more behind those available in Europe.</FONT>
</UL>

<P>
<FONT > </FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Reversing these trends will require a fundamental
change in the framework used to bring new medical products to
the market.  Many studies have been performed and expert groups
convened with the goal of reforming drug and device oversight.
 But, they have failed to yield significant improvement in the
only meaningful bottom line:  total development times and product
availability.  Those reforms that have been adopted have been
too marginal to have an appreciable overall impact on improving
the system.  (Recent evidence may suggest that marketing approvals
recently have become slightly more expeditious, but no impact
has been seen on the overall time and cost of development).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Therefore, we propose a revised framework for
approving drugs and medical devices that does not alter the basic
objectives underlying the existing system:  that medical products
are evaluated by qualified experts on the basis of adequate data;
that they meet appropriate standards, defined in terms of the
relationship between benefits and risks; and, that they perform
as claimed on the label.  The regulatory process should be designed
to block dangerous or ineffective products; but, it should also
speed salubrious ones to the clinic.  The existing review and
approval procedures have achieved some success at ensuring that
products admitted to the market are reasonably safe and effective.
 But this benefit has been achieved at great direct and indirect
cost to patients, industry and government, with the introduction
of many promising new therapies delayed or prevented entirely.
 Much of this cost is unnecessary:  safety and effectiveness do
not have to be sacrificed by the introduction of greater regulatory
efficiency.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >A NEW INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has
a statutory mandate to assure that new drugs and devices are safe
and effective.  This mandate is combined with a &quot;monopoly&quot;
on new product approvals.  It is the monopoly part of this framework
that is the principal source of current deficiencies in drug and
device oversight, because there is no institutional check on the
regulatory creep that inexorably has added time, costs, and unpredictability
to the review process.  In fact, the FDA has raised the regulatory
burden on product sponsors by continually introducing new requirements
and policies without regard for their negative impact on the delivery
of new and innovative therapies to patients.  As long as the only
route to the market is through the FDA, the adverse trends in
product availability and development times are likely to continue.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Improving the balance of incentives, therefore,
requires opening the product certification process to competitive
forces.  If one extreme of the &quot;institutional spectrum&quot;
is represented by the current FDA monopoly, the other pole is
represented by complete laissez faire, under which decisions to
market drugs and devices would be made by manufacturers without
government regulatory oversight.  In theory, manufacturers would
still be constrained, by the desire to maintain the reputation
of their products and avoid litigation.  But our proposal rejects
this alternative.  Although a laissez-faire system may have some
merits, particularly for established firms with reputations to
protect, it may also provide firms with an incentive to take unwarranted
risks.  Moreover, most American consumers want a required independent
review to ensure safety and effectiveness.  For these and other
reasons, laissez faire is not a viable option for bringing new
medical products to the market in the United States.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The plan proposal, described here, maintains
existing or equivalent government standards and oversight, as
well as the FDA stamp of approval, signifying that benefits and
risks have been evaluated and balanced appropriately.  At the
same time, the proposal relies on nongovernmental bodies for review
and certification.  In this model, <I>the FDA is primarily a certifier
of certifiers, rather than a certifier of products.</I>  The element
of competition among the nongovernmental certifying bodies for
sponsors' business is an important element of the proposal.  By
providing product sponsors with choice among certifying bodies,
but retaining high product standards, the system institutes a
review process that is responsive to the needs of patients and
product development.<BR>

<h3><FONT >DRUGS AND BIOLOGICS</FONT></h3>
<P>
<FONT >The goal of the proposal is to speed the delivery
of safe and effective new drugs and biologics to patients who
need them.  To achieve this goal requires changes in the regulatory
system that will facilitate early clinical research, increase
the efficiency of drug development and its regulatory oversight,
and reduce the overall time and cost required for a new drug to
reach the market. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There has been broad consensus for nearly three
decades that reforms of the current system are necessary.  Numerous
official panels and inquiries have proposed remedies, but they
have not been implemented expeditiously or widely.  The present
proposal embodies the most important and consistently repeated
of these recommendations:  management and structural reforms that
transfer tasks currently performed internally by FDA to outside
experts and organizations.  While FDA has at one time or another
delegated most of its review and evaluation functions to outside
experts or entities, this delegation has been piecemeal and disorganized;
partial privatization has never been integrated in a way that
could create an efficient overall system.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Other reforms recommended repeatedly by blue
ribbon panels have included a lesser role for FDA in the scrutiny
of early-phase clinical investigations and the wider use of accelerated
approvals coupled with continued post-market surveillance.  The
proposal adopts these recommendations, explicitly or implicitly.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The proposal rationalizes and enhances the
efficiency of the process for developing, reviewing and approving
new drugs and biologics by assigning principal review responsibilities
to government-certified <I>Drug Certification Bodies</I> (DCBs).
 At the same time, <I>the proposal maintains the existing legal
requirement for pre-market demonstration of safety and effectiveness</I>.
 Preserved as well are FDA's oversight, enforcement powers and
the agency's authority to issue the final sign-off approval for
product marketing.  Key elements in the process are outlined below
and in Figure 1.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >KEY PROPOSALS FOR DRUGS AND BIOLOGICS
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>

<UL>
<LI><FONT >The primary responsibility for managing
the Investigational New Drug (IND) filing, oversight of the clinical
program, and New Drug Application (NDA)/Product License Application
(PLA) review will be transferred from the FDA to nongovernmental
Drug Certification Bodies (DCBs).</FONT>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><FONT >The DCBs, which can be profit-making or
non-profit organizations, will be subject to FDA certification
and staffed -- as required by the language of the Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act -- by the necessary &quot;experts qualified by
scientific training and experience.&quot;  </FONT>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI><FONT >The sponsor will submit NDAs (or PLAs)
to the DCB, not to FDA.  After evaluating the NDA, the DCB will
submit a summary of the results of its review (if favorable) to
FDA.  The FDA Commissioner then has a designated period of time
to accept the DCB's recommendation for approval (which, legally,
is a &quot;rebuttable presumption&quot;) or to deny approval.</FONT>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI><FONT >If approval is denied, then at the discretion
of the sponsor and the DCB, a review by an independent Medical
Review Board, reporting to the Secretary of Health and Human Services,
may be undertaken.  All parties, including the FDA, are expected
to accept the decision of the Secretary.</FONT>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI><FONT >FDA will continue to administer the present
national system of pharmacovigilance, above the level of the DCB.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<IMG SRC="IMG00001.GIF"><FONT >The plan reforms will
stimulate competition to supply drug-development oversight and
review services;  that is, DCBs will compete for sponsor-clients.
 This competition will encourage DCBs to identify and solve problems
early and rapidly, perform reviews in a timely manner, and manage
the oversight and review efficiently.  The system will favor DCBs
that offer the greatest expertise, the best service and a reputation
for integrity.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The crafting of drug development and approval
strategies will benefit from competitive pressures on DCBs, because
there is much room for innovation:  the choice of factors such
as clinical endpoints, indications for approval, and regimes of
pre-clinical and clinical testing, ultimately drives the size,
time and cost of development programs; and, there is large potential
for savings in these areas.  Subject to the law's standards of
effectiveness and safety, DCBs will be free - and competitive
pressures will encourage them - to devise new and more efficient
ways of developing drugs and meeting the approval standards. 
This strategic competition and synergy between sponsors and DCBs
will transform the drug development and approval process and will
reverse the relentless spiral of rising time and costs. <BR>

<h3>MEDICAL DEVICES</h3>
<P>
<FONT >The plan for medical devices will in large
part follow the European Union's medical device regulatory system,
which is characterized by reliance on clear and objective standards
that are largely implemented by private, non-governmental organizations.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Under the EU system, all medical devices are
classified, using objective criteria, into one of four classes
(I, IIa, IIb, and III) representing increasing levels of risk
and complexity.  Devices may be marketed only if they conform
with a comprehensive series of <I>essential requirements</I>.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >As is the case in the EU, implementation of
the proposed system will involve the interaction of three groups:
 manufacturers, who bear the ultimate responsibility for their
products; private Device Certifying Bodies (DCBs), engaged by
manufacturers to provide independent certification of critical
manufacturing processes and products; and, the federal authority
(FDA), which maintains responsibility for public safety by ensuring
the competence of the DCBs, enforcing compliance with law and
maintaining a universal system of postmarketing surveillance.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Review under the new system should be expeditious
because competitive forces will only tolerate DCBs that are responsive
to the market.  The current system has been characterized by such
slow approvals that important products are not available.  Domestically,
venture capital has become scarce and manufacturers have been
forced to relocate critical operations offshore.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Because device innovation is often characterized
by many small incremental changes, a method of rapid certification
of new products is needed in order for U.S. Manufacturers not
to fall further and further behind.  For Class I devices, the
new proposal permits manufacturers to self-certify conformance
with the essential requirements.  In addition, manufacturers who
maintain a total quality assurance system may self-certify new
Class IIa and IIb products between the periodic audits by their
DCB.  Key elements of the proposal are summarized  below and in
Figures 2 and 3.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >KEY PROPOSALS FOR DEVICES<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<UL>
<LI><FONT >Manufacturers can ensure conformance with
the essential requirements by adhering to relevant internationally
agreed upon objective standards.  The manufacturer generally will
have a choice of methods, and will be able to either demonstrate
conformance of its<I> quality assurance systems</I> or conformance
of the <I>product</I> itself.  Combinations of these two routes
are permitted. </FONT>
<LI><FONT >For all classes of devices except Class
I, a DCB must audit the manufacturer periodically to confirm such
conformance.  The stringency of the audit and the number of areas
audited depend on the class.  The FDA's current auditing of manufacturers
for Good Manufacturing Practices will be replaced by the DCB's
certification of the manufacturer's quality assurance systems.
 Such certification will often exceed FDA standards as it could
include certification of design quality assurance.  It will also
be performed far more frequently than current FDA inspections.</FONT>
<LI><FONT >Class III products always require premarketing
<I>design approval</I> by a DCB.  Although not part of the EU
system, the proposal presented here also requires the FDA to be
notified 90 days prior to marketing a Class III product, to allow
time for the FDA to elect to review the appropriateness of the
certification process.</FONT>
<LI><FONT >All manufacturers will be required to have
a system for monitoring and acting upon reports of a device malfunction
after sale.  In addition, the FDA will act as a central repository
of such information when it involves a threat to patient safety,
as it is in a position to monitor the investigation of such events,
especially when they involve similar situations arising with several
manufacturers.  The FDA may, for cause, require that a device
be withdrawn from the market if the manufacturer has not ensured
that it meets the essential requirements or if the DCB has not
acted competently.  In addition, criminal charges may be brought
in the case of fraud or criminal negligence.</FONT>
</UL>

<P>
<IMG SRC="IMG00002.GIF"><IMG SRC="IMG00003.GIF">
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >THE MEDICAL REVIEW BOARD</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT > </FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Current FDA procedures do not provide an adequate
independent forum in which to appeal agency decisions.  Our proposal
remedies this deficiency by establishing an independent, standing
committee of experts within Health and Human Services - the Medical
Review Board (MRB) - to advise the HHS Secretary when FDA disagrees
with a DCB's product approval recommendation.  The MRB will have
approximately 10- to-15 members representing a wide spectrum of
scientific, medical and regulatory expertise.  It will hear appeals
of FDA decisions to overturn a DCB recommendation, and will advise
the Secretary.  All parties, including FDA, will be expected to
accept the decision of the Secretary.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >LIABILITY<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<I><B><FONT >DCB Liability</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT >The proposed system will provide the Drug and
Device Certifying Bodies with strong incentives to operate carefully
and responsibly.  DCBs will be subject to FDA oversight and the
possibility of losing their certification if they do not follow
applicable regulatory guidelines.  They also will be subject to
tort liability for negligence in carrying out their obligations.
 Finally, DCBs will be subject to lawsuits from manufacturers
for breaking contractual obligations.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The DCBs should not, however, be liable for
factors beyond their control.  It is, therefore, important to
formalize the current recognition by the courts that such certification
bodies not be subject to strict liability to third parties injured
by products.  Otherwise, particularly in the context of joint
and several liability, many responsible institutions will be reluctant
to enter the certification market for fear that their very existence
will be threatened by tort liability suits that might be completely
unrelated to the manner in which they carried out their obligations.
 <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><B><FONT >Manufacturer Liability</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT >Our plan also addresses the tort liability
status of pharmaceuticals and medical devices firms more generally.
 Liability costs have disproportionately burdened these industries,
largely because their products are intrinsically involved in life
and death situations.  In fact, major lines of litigation, such
as those involving DES and the Dalkon Shield, have come to be
almost synonymous with the liability crisis.  The potential liability
exposure faced by these industries has discouraged new product
innovation, particularly for products related to pregnancy and
childbirth.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >At the current time, there is insufficient
recognition by the courts of the extensive role played by government
regulation in ensuring efficient levels of safety for pharmaceuticals
and medical devices.  To the extent that the current FDA regulations
do achieve socially efficient control of risk, superimposing tort
liability in addition to regulation is harmful, by deterring introduction
of beneficial new products.  Therefore, the proposal includes
a regulatory compliance defense for all product liability, not
simply a defense against punitive damages.<B><sup><a href="foot.html">|</a></sup> <BR>
</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The regulatory compliance defense simply recognizes
that, by negotiating the regulatory process, the manufacturer
has fulfilled its requirements with respect to the provision of
products that provide an appropriate level of safety, and that
the government has certified this fact.  Juries should not be
second guessing decisions regarding product safety that have already
been recognized by government agencies as having achieved appropriate
levels of safety.  The plan for reforming the FDA drug and device
approval processes would not limit the applicability of this defense,
because there would continue to be a regulatory mechanism to ensure
that an appropriate level of product safety is provided to consumers.
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >OFF-LABEL USE<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >The slowness of the FDA process for approving
new uses for products already on the market deprives patients
and their doctors of critically important information for long
periods of time - long after the scientific evidence is available
that a treatment may be beneficial for a particular condition.
 The proposal will make the &quot;off-label&quot; issue less salient,
by lowering the costs and increasing the benefits for manufacturers
who obtain supplementary approvals for their products.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Currently, the FDA does not give supplementary
applications a high priority and sponsors have a limited incentive
to submit them.  Under the proposed system, DCBs will have the
incentive and the resources to process supplementals efficiently
and in a timely manner.  Supplemental approvals for devices will
particularly be facilitated, because manufacturers with the requisite
quality assurance certification will be able to self-certify label
changes (subject to the usual monitoring by the DCB).  Another
major incentive to submit applications for supplemental approvals
will be provided by the regulatory compliance tort liability defense,
which will be available only to products used in approved ways.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >INTERNATIONAL HARMONIZATION<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >A major premise of the proposal is that the
current system for bringing drugs and medical devices to market
suffers because the FDA represents the only route to market. 
Therefore, permitting alternative routes is healthy for the entire
system, and one way to do this is to encourage &quot;jurisdictional
competition&quot; from foreign approval systems.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This can most easily be done by permitting
products approved in jurisdictions whose standards are similar
to those in the United States - for example, the Great Britain
or the European Union - to have the same status as a product approved
by a DCB in the United States.  Where applicable (i.e., for drugs
and Class III devices), products with foreign approvals could
be submitted to the FDA for U.S. marketing approval under the
same procedures and with the same presumptive approvability as
a DCB-approved product.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Because it is based on standards and procedures
virtually identical to those of the European Union, adoption of
the proposed device system would, by itself,  substantially further
the goal of regulatory harmonization.  This system would make
it possible for a manufacturer to obtain both American and European
approval using the same documentation and inspections, and the
services of a single organization that could be certified both
as an American DCB and a European &quot;notified body.&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >TRANSITION<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >A transition period of at least several years
will be needed to establish procedures to accredit DCBs and to
permit drugs and devices currently under review to be approved
under the existing system, if the manufacture should so elect.
 Once DCBs are available, any sponsor with an active application
before the FDA could withdraw that application and submit it to
a DCB.  At the end of the transition period, the FDA would cease
to perform review process functions.  Because of the European
Union device experience and the fact that (European) notified
bodies with U.S. affiliates and branches are already operational,
it is likely that the transition period for devices can be shorter
than for drugs. <BR>

<h2>I. Institutional Alternatives for the Regulation of Drugs and Medical Devices</h2>
by Robert D. Tollison
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >This paper presents an economic and institutional
analysis of the various organizational alternatives which might
be adopted to reform the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
The present FDA system is described as a government monopoly over
the introduction of new drugs and devices.  While this system
has served the public well in some respects, in recent years it
has proceeded with so much excessive caution against mistakes
that it has substantially slowed downed the introduction of beneficial
new drugs and devices. Thus the issue is, how can the present
system be reformed so as to speed up the introduction of beneficial
new products, while maintaining the existing legal standards of
safety and efficacy?<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >At one extreme from the present government
monopoly is <I>laissez faire,</I> meaning allowing private decisions
to be made by drug and device manufacturers with respect to the
marketing of their products.  Although this system has some merits,
it is generally found to be wanting in several respects due to
problems related to information and incentives in such an environment.
 For example, some firms may take unwarranted risks in the marketing
of new products where there is no government oversight.  Therefore
complete reliance on the goodwill and reputational capital of
firms is ruled out on such grounds.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Various other organizational arrangements involving
degrees of FDA oversight and degrees of privatization of the certification
process are considered here.  These include:  the removal of FDA
veto power over new products, a private monopoly organization
(laboratory) to review and certify new products subject to FDA
oversight, the contracting out to private entities of many of
the functions presently performed by the FDA, and competing private
firms as suppliers of certification services under FDA oversight.
 Indeed, the example of the Underwriters Laboratory as a private
certifier and standard-setter for a large variety of products
and commodities is discussed in some detail as an example of how
a private entity might work.  Also considered are issues of competing
jurisdictions and the international linkage of drug approval processes.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >All told, the analysis concludes that competing
private bodies under FDA oversight represent the best bet for
institutional reform.  In many respects, this system derives from
the &quot;European&quot; system presently in place for medical
devices.  The general point is that such a system offers the opportunity
for the United States to achieve greater benefits from the speedier
approval of beneficial new drugs and devices, while at the same
time maintaining the important legal standards for safety and
efficacy under the aegis of the FDA.  Moreover, allowing internationally
recognized drug review bodies in other countries, such as Great
Britain, to act as private entities in competition with U.S. private
entities would further insure that safe and effective products
would reach U.S. markets at the same time that they reach the
market in other advanced, industrial countries.<BR>

<P>
<FONT >There are a variety of alternative institutional
arrangements which could be called upon to regulate and monitor
the safety and effectiveness of the nation's supply of new drugs
and medical devices. These range from the present system, which
can be classified as a government monopoly on drug and device
certification, to a free market system in which government would
have no regulatory role at all. In between these two extremes
are a number of institutional alternatives which combine more
or less government oversight with more or less private involvement.
 There are costs and benefits of each system, and it is through
a careful consideration of these costs and benefits that one can
proceed to choose a system that provides the most  net benefits
 to medical consumers. In this regard it should be acknowledged
that the present system of government monopoly, as embodied in
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and its accompanying legislation,
has undoubtedly provided substantial benefits over time to medical
consumers. This is not the issue. The point is to explore whether
the present process can be improved and strengthened so as to
continue to serve medical consumers into the next century. To
this end this paper examines the major institutional alternatives
for regulating drugs and medical devices, starting with the existing
system as presently administered by the FDA. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >Government Monopoly<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >The prevailing institutional arrangement under
which the FDA operates may be described as a government monopoly.
The oversight of new drugs, medical devices, and biologics is
centralized under FDA control. The hallmark of the FDA as a government
monopoly is the fact that producers have no alternative route
to the oversight of clinical research and the review and certification
of new drugs and devices other than through the FDA.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The existing literature on government monopoly
bureaus dates from William Niskanen's pioneering microanalytic
study of bureaucracy (Niskanen 1971). Niskanen modeled a bureau
as an agent which bargained with an oversight committee for funding.
Due to its comparative advantage in information, the bureau always
won in the bargaining process. Indeed, Niskanen postulated a theory
in which the bureau was in a position to win all-or-none bargains
with the oversight committee, thereby expanding its budgetary
base or policy mandate well beyond the &quot;optimal&quot; level
(i.e., the level required for the competitive provision of the
good or service). The primary implication of Niskanen's theory
was therefore that government agencies and budgets were overlarge,
bloated or overreaching because of the bargaining power of individual
bureaus.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The effect of the oversight process on bureau
policy choices was taken up by Weingast and Moran (1983) in their
study of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). These authors argued
that a bureau is the agent of its oversight committee when it
comes to policy choices. Indeed, they argued that bureaus are
perfect agents of the interest groups represented by oversight
committee members<sup><a href="foot.html">1</a></sup>.  Whatever the prevailing tradeoffs in policies
are (e.g., between consumers and producers, as deciphered, for
example, from the last election), the oversight committee imposes
these trade-offs on the bureau leadership. Reluctant or unreliable
bureau managers are replaced in a relentless drive to establish
the preferred political equilibrium. Weingast and Moran tested
their theory by showing how changing composition of the relevant
oversight committees led to a change in FTC behavior (i.e., case
selection). Their principal-agent approach is now the predominate
method for analyzing bureaucratic behavior in the literature.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There are two major implications from the literature
with respect to the FDA. Niskanen's work suggests that the FDA,
like other government bureaus, has more resources at its disposal
than are necessary to carry out its legislative mandate, and,
moreover, the FDA will seek to act beyond its Congressional mandate
in policy matters. Weingast and Moran's analytical framework suggests
a more subtle issue to confront, namely, that the FDA is doing
what its congressional sponsors (and the interest groups who support
them, including drug manufacturers) want it to do. If the latter
implication is, in fact, the case, this suggests that the idea
of &quot;reforming&quot; the FDA will be a difficult task indeed,
because the agency may be doing what the relevant interest groups
want it to do. Simply adopting an alternative institutional arrangement
(e.g., contracting out), while maintaining FDA veto authority
over new products, will not necessarily improve FDA behavior.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Given that the FDA is a government monopoly
that determines whether new medical products are safe and effective,
standard microeconomic theory predicts a higher FDA &quot;price&quot;
of approval and a lower quantity of approvals. And the property
rights structure of the FDA reinforces this bias. The FDA is not
the residual claimant for any additional gains realized from earlier
approval; manufacturers receive such gains. Yet if problems arise
from earlier approval, the FDA bears the costs in the form of
a public outcry or a backlash from congressional overseers.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The essential critique of FDA monopoly behavior
is that it spends inordinate resources to police unsafe drugs
and devices so that useful products are delayed in reaching patients.
The historical basis of this behavior is well documented, and
the political model that underlies it is clear. The consequences
of allowing an unsafe product on the market are obvious and politically
disastrous for the agency and its overseers. The consequences
of delaying an otherwise effective and safe drug or device (e.g.,
the lives saved as a result) are much less obvious and less politically
costly (although they may exact used higher &quot;costs&quot;
in terms of needless suffering or death.) The FDA therefore responds
to existing incentives and behaves in a predictable fashion. 
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Moreover, the personification of the consequences
of an unwise decision onto the leadership of the FDA and the relevant
members of Congress intensifies the problem. Voters may prefer
a more expeditious approval process, yet the fact that FDA administrators
face the consequences of toxicity directly implies that they will
prefer more &quot;insurance&quot; than the average voter would
&quot;buy&quot; in such a situation. Bureaucratic incentives thus
compound the problem, making the review process work more conservatively
than individuals in general would prefer. This type of argument
applies to all types of government programs whose outputs involve
risk and uncertainty (e.g., national defense). Thus, in general,
the FDA bureaucracy probably deploys more resources to the prevention
of harm from drugs and devices, at the expense of new drug and
device approval, than the average voter would prefer.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >What are the effects on the drug and medical
device industries of a politicized, risk-averse monopoly in charge
of approval? The expectation is what the empirical record reveals.
The return to innovation has fallen and become more uncertain
and research and development has moved offshore, so there is less
domestic innovation. One observes &quot;approval arbitrage,&quot;
whereby companies concentrate their R&amp;D efforts overseas where
the regulatory burden is not so onerous. More subtly perhaps,
the type of innovative activity may have changed. Owing to the
high costs and uncertain outcome of seeking government approval,
research may tend to focus on lower risk research projects which
manufacturers are confident will pass scrutiny and make money.
The high costs of approval, coupled with an imperfect capital
market, may also act to keep potential entrants out of the industry,
suggesting that the FDA has been &quot;captured&quot; by existing
manufacturers who are quite comfortable with the present system.
The increased uncertainty also raises the cost of capital for
drug and device firms, and acts to reduce the pool of capital
available for funding new research.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >One alternative to the current regime would
be to establish a clear description of  the requirements a new
drug or device must satisfy to be approved, thereby reducing some
of the arbitrariness in the approval process. This is one of the
proposals put forward by former Vice President Quayle's Council
on Competitiveness. This seemingly minor reform would have a number
of beneficial effects. Notably, it would remove much of the variance
in the returns to innovation. A more certain return would allow
firms to fund R&amp;D at lower cost of capital, perhaps spurring
innovation. Investments would no longer have to be certain winners,
and much important work that might have gone undone could be funded.
Fixed rules would also lower the cost of seeking approval by reducing
unanticipated and costly delays arising from requests for more
information. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Such reforms are not a panacea. The FDA is
a governmentally sanctioned monopoly without a profit motive,
and it will bear political costs if drugs and devices are approved
too quickly. To minimize this risk, the FDA will lobby hard to
adopt extremely stringent rules, perhaps to the point of further
reducing the number of approvals.   Even fixed rules will suffer
from &quot;mission creep,&quot; wherein annual revisions gradually
add to the total regulatory burden as the FDA seeks more and more
insurance against a drug or device failure and consumer advocacy
groups trumpet every perceived error by the agency. The FDA's
incentive will continue to revolve around security and budget.
As a government monopoly, there will be no outside competitive
verification that the rules of safe testing are the most efficient
and least costly set of rules that achieves the desired levels
of safety and effectiveness. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There are a galaxy of potential institutional
reforms that could be applied to the FDA, but there are large
problems which any meaningful reform must address. Chief among
these is the position of the FDA as a premarket monopolist. Given
the monopoly position of the FDA and its accompanying legal authority,
there is a lack of competitive structure in the U.S. drug oversight
and review process, so that service to new-drug sponsors is predictably
at levels that are extremely low and intolerable in other contexts.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The FDA, however, does not exist in a vacuum.
And here the experience of comparable agencies in other countries
may hold the key to understanding how the FDA process could be
improved. There is ample evidence from European countries such
as Great Britain and Germany and the evolving policies in the
European Union (EU) to suggest that the. United States has fallen
into an inefficient approval process. This evidence generally
suggests that European countries are able to bring new products
to the market faster than the United States, while maintaining
substantially equivalent safety and effectiveness results. This
suggests that the institutions of drug and device review and approval
in these countries have attained a better trade-off between protection
and progress than U.S. institutions have. That is, for an equivalent
amount of consumer protection they are able to bring products
to market faster. This competitive discrepancy in U.S. policy
has been apparent for decades, suggesting the need for fundamental
reform of the FDA.  Moreover, some linkage between the United
States and European systems might be in order so as to introduce
a competitive element into the U.S. system.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The present system in the United States works,
but it does not work as well as it could. This is the basic point.
The point is not to scrap the present system, but to make it at
least as effective and efficient as comparable drug and device
review systems around the world.  Recently, there has been a shift
in the preferences of oversight committees, a fact which suggests
(from the literature already reviewed) that the agency will have
to change and that the door is open to reform.  More importantly,
the example of Europe cannot be ignored or denied. These countries
have established faster and equally safe review processes at a
lower level of total expenditure. It is thus imperative that we
learn from the European experience, and explore linking U.S. policy
to European policy.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT >A Simple Model of a Monopoly FDA<sup><a href="foot.html">2</a></sup><BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<FONT >The cost of drugs or medical devices can be
characterized using a simple model (as shown in Figure 1) in which
the cost of precaution is traded-off against the cost of remedial
measures in the event of post-approval problems with a drug. Costs
of precaution are shown rising to the right as the level of precautionary
care is increased. These costs represent the effort by the FDA
to keep potentially harmful or useless products off the market.
Costs of remediation are shown declining from left to right based
on the assumption of declining marginal returns from increased
expenditures on precaution. These costs are the effort by the
FDA and manufacturers to engage in post-marketing surveillance
of problems with previously approved products and by manufacturers
to pay for damages their drugs have caused. Theoretically, the
&quot;optimum&quot; level of precautionary measures is at the
point of lowest total cost, and if all these costs are internalized,
this should be the expected level of precautionary care exercised
by manufacturers. On the surface a level of care set by the FDA
at this &quot;minimum&quot; level of total social cost should
guarantee the most efficient market for drug and device use.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >If the FDA could accurately determine the optimum
level of precaution, the government monopoly system might be efficient.
The problem is that it cannot. Regulatory standards are therefore
set according to some &quot;risk&quot; standard that satisfies
the internal requirements of the regulators. Regulators have no
incentive to choose a level of precaution less than the optimum,
so the &quot;optimum&quot; level of care becomes the lower bound
of the standard.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Current FDA standards are positioned somewhere
above the lower bound -- arguably, toward the higher end of the
scale -- resulting in an inefficiently high proportion of resources
put into prevention and a higher total cost than necessary. The
solution to this problem lies in providing better incentives for
firms to internalize the costs of precaution and remediation.
The rest of the paper explores several alternatives in this regard.

<CENTER><B><FONT >Self-Certification?<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >Self-certification of new drugs and devices
would be the functional equivalent of <I>laissez-faire</I> in
this area of public policy. Firms would be responsible for their
own testing and certification procedures for safety and effectiveness
(which could include the use of third-party certifiers), and would
stand to gain or lose in the marketplace depending upon the reliability
of their products. There are numerous layers of questions with
respect to self-certification. How would it work? How would it
work relative to alternative processes involving government oversight<sup><a href="foot.html">3</a></sup>?The
standard economic analysis of self-certification is related to
Akerlof's (1970) classic paper on &quot;lemons.&quot; He analyzed
a market situation in which sellers have perfect information about
product quality and buyers have limited (prepurchase) information.
In this case bad products come to be overvalued and good products
undervalued, and a sort of Gresham's Law prevails -- bad products
drive good products from the market. Bad products are the only
products that continue to be sold, if the market continues to
exist at all. There is thus an inefficiency in markets with asymmetric
information -- quality levels are too low, and firms have no incentive
to introduce higher quality products because they do not capture
the full benefits from their introduction. A market failure is
said to exist in such cases.<sup><a href="foot.html">4</a></sup>
<p>
This failure does not necessarily
imply that government intervention is the solution to the problem.
The market fails to provide the correct amount of quality relative
to a case where buyers have perfect information. However, since
government cannot provide perfect information either, the issue
becomes how the private sector might respond to such an issue
in conjunction with some form of government oversight.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There are a variety of ways that firms and
government might respond to the problem of asymmetric information,
some relevant to drugs and medical devices and some not. Firms
can offer guarantees and warranties, factors which would not seem
to apply in the case of drugs and devices. Firms can appeal to
third-party certification organizations such as medical laboratories
and set up a system of industry standards. This approach is directly
applicable to the case of drugs and devices, as will be discussed
below. An alternative approach, which is consistent with relying
upon a <I>laissez-faire</I> version of self-certification, consists
in relying upon firm investments in reputational capital to signal
the presence of high-quality products.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Klein and Leffler (1981) and others have shown
that under certain conditions, where firms have a comparative
advantage in producing and disseminating information about product
quality and where consumers have difficulty in deciphering product
claims before they actually consume the product, markets will
respond by making it worthwhile for firms to invest in brandname
capital (BNC). The concept is simple. Firms have incentives to
invest in BNC as a means of posting a bond with consumers. So
long as a firm produces products that are safe, reliable, and
trustworthy, consumers are willing to pay a premium for such products.
This premium constitutes a flow of payments that are capitalized
into BNC, and the premium represents a quality-assurance payment
by consumers. So long as firms deliver on promises of quality
and credibility, consumers will reward firms with premium payments
for brandnames. In equilibrium the premiums should just offset
the costs to firms of providing quality-assurance services to
consumers. If the firm makes a mistake or chooses to renege upon
its investment in BNC, it will be punished in the marketplace
as consumers will no longer pay a premium for the branded product.
And, indeed, there is ample evidence that drug firms are punished
substantially in this way (Jarrell and Peltzman 1985).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This is really a point about private contracting.
Klein and Leffler analyzed the role of implicit contracts when
explicit government-enforced contracts are incomplete or too costly
to establish. One form of an implicit enforcement mechanism is
for the potential defector to make an investment in a firm-specific,
nonsalvageable asset. This investment acts as an implicit guarantee
that the firm will not cheat the customer because cheating will
result in forfeiture of the investment. That is, the firm will
lose future business, and the investment in the nonsalvageable
asset will be lost. The purchase of a non-salvageable asset is
equivalent to posting a bond that assures non-cheating behavior.
For their part, customers pay a price premium for the product
to induce the firm not to cheat. In equilibrium the value of the
investment in the nonsalvageable asset just dissipates the &quot;protection
money&quot; offered by buyers so that the firm earns a normal
rate of return on its investment in quality-assurance and provides
a higher-quality product in exchange.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Looking at the argument more closely, one could
argue that asymmetrically distributed information frequently creates
markets. As information costs increase, the probability of informational
entrepreneurship increases, and this probability increases as
demand elasticities decrease. The price component of price elasticities
does not solely reflect the actual price charged for a good, but
the search costs consumers incur prior to paying the price as
well. To the consumer both the search costs and the price paid
for the good represent the cost of consumption. Hence, consumers
with inelastic demands will incur higher search costs, as well
as higher prices, with relatively little change in quantity-demanded.
Also, according to the Alchian and Allen theorem (Alchian and
Allen 1972), high fixed costs generate higher expenditures, (as
long as a couple must hire a baby-sitter when they go out, they
will treat themselves to a nicer dinner.)  High prices, high search
costs, and the opportunity cost of misinformation apply to the
drug and device markets, and a consumer will rationally spend
more on information collection upon incurring these costs. The
consumers' willingness to pay for information, and the high costs
of doing so on their own, create an opportunity for an informational
entrepreneur, who, by specializing in evaluating drugs and devices,
realizes scale economies due to the indivisible nature of information
(upon obtaining the information, his average cost drops as he
distributes the information). These medical products markets will
thus tend to develop informational entrepreneurs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In medical markets physicians and pharmacists
engage in informational intermediation. For instance, a Doctor's
diagnosis is informational intermediation: the patient has rationally
decided to pay for the doctor's specialization rather than invest
in the human and physical capital required to diagnose himself.
In prescribing a medicine the doctor reduces the patient's transaction
costs. The patient also invests in the additional safeguard of
a pharmacist who specializes in evaluating drugs. If a new medicine
which the pharmacist rates as more effective than as the prescribed
medicine exists, or if the patient's current medicinal regimen
conflicts with the prescription, the pharmacist consults with
the physician to change the prescription (if the applicable state
laws allow). This relationship existed prior to the advent of
the FDA, and in today's more advanced medical industry, it would
surely continue in the absence of the FDA. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >What prevents medical professionals from underinvesting
in medical information? Markets, of course, provide patients with
their first line of defense. A fly-by-night drug firm may invest
little or nothing in some placebo, rendering the credibility of
drug firms suspect. Patients, however, can quite easily inform
themselves about doctors and pharmacists. First, patients observe
the professionals' credible commitments; after years of training
the professionals have invested heavily in human capital and are
unlikely to underinvest in obtaining returns from the investment.
Moreover, doctors and pharmacists operate in a competitive market,
and their fees and volume of business will consequently reflect
their abilities. Lastly, health-care contracts, like all others,
are subject to fraud and liability law. If medical professionals
behave in an uninformed manner, they risk the assets they sunk
in their training and potential legal damages. Rationally, doctors
and pharmacists will require evidence regarding the effectiveness
and safety of a drug or device prior to prescribing or dispensing
it.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Cures for many health maladies occur within
a rather narrow band; only one basic biochemical structure may
effectively vaccinate individuals against the mumps, for instance.
The first firm to discover, patent, and market this structure
obtains a monopoly. A competitive market for medical innovation
exists in pursuit of these monopoly profits. Advocates of government
intervention often cite these factors as creating a &quot;race
for the bottom,&quot; in which firms, rushing their products to
the market, underinvest in both development and testing, leading
to a lowest common denominator market. Justice Brandeis's famous
phrase, however, is as incorrectly applied here as it was when
he coined it for the market for corporate charters. It is the
very existence and pursuit of monopoly profits which assures that
adequate research and testing would occur in the absence of government
intervention.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Without the ability to monopolize markets,
medical innovation would essentially cease. Medical research entails
investments of hundreds of millions of dollars to discover a potential
drug, and such costs are fixed. If, after incurring such massive
expenses and risks, competitive market conditions prevailed and
price was equated to marginal cost, the innovating firm would
not recover its research and development costs, but just the costs
associated with the production of the drug. Obviously, as the
probability of such an event increases, investments in discovery
will decrease. For a firm to invest in research and development
it must expect a downward-sloping demand curve.<sup><a href="foot.html">5</a></sup>
<p>
This, of course,
is a theory of the competitive provision of quality-assurance
by private firms. And it works in a general way in the economy
at large. Firms undertake investments in BNC, and markets punish
firms that renege on such investments. Informational entrepreneurship
does take place. Put another way, one does not tend to observe
pervasive &quot;lemons&quot; problems in modern economies. One
can go across the spectrum of the economy, and find firms behaving
in the manner predicted by the BNC theory. So there is little
doubt that self-certification plays a large role in providing
safe and effective products to consumers.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Would such a system work with drugs or medical
devices? Such a system is certainly an effective alternative to
the present regime of government monopoly. Nonetheless, there
are problematical aspects of a complete self-certification system.
The primary drawback would be that small, undercapitalized firms
might take risks in such an environment which would ultimately
be costly to consumers. The time required for drug development
(15 years) means that incentives might be distorted for small
firms. Such firms, which do not have enough resources to sustain
liability judgments, might very well provide less than optimal
amounts of testing so that consumer harm would result from such
a self-certification system. In other words, small firms might
simply &quot;roll the dice,&quot; hoping to come up with a winning
new product and not be able to sustain a liability judgment if
they are wrong and the product is not safe and effective and causes
harm to consumers. Such considerations dictate some type of government
oversight of drug and device testing.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Perhaps a more telling point about self-certification
is that it is analogous to refereeing your own paper as a academic
specialist. Peer review serves a valuable scientific service in
bringing to bear a more objective evaluation of the contribution
of a scientific paper or result. In addition, peer review generally
leads to an improvement in the quality of scientific papers. Government
oversight of drug and device testing may perform a similar service
for consumers that a self-certification process cannot. Peer review
processes, however, in general show the same kind of bias that
the FDA shows.  (i.e., peer review puts heavy emphasis on culling
out unusual but perhaps path-breaking papers.)<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >It is thus an open question whether self-certification
in practice would lead to an effective system of drug and device
review and testing. And keep in mind that self-certification simply
means that firms can employ any feasible means to test and review
products. Market reactions would reward those firms who provided
the most cost-effective and reliable means of testing and certification.
The problem of small, fly-by-night firms attempting to limit testing
procedures or to mislead consumers would also be disciplined by
market reactions. Nonetheless, there would seem to be some role
for government in overseeing the medical product review process.
In laying out the standards or protocols for product testing,
for example, government could effectively forestall the small,
undercapitalized firm problem. The problem with government oversight
is how to delimit such a function so that innovation and new product
introduction are not stifled as a result. As the experience in
Europe has shown, there are areas, such as low-risk medical devices,
where firms can be allowed to self-certify medical products, subject
to meeting pre-specified government standards. This is not complete
<I>laissez-faire</I>, but it is a way to allow the market to work
with minimal government oversight. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >Remove the FDA Veto Power?<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >A basic conundrum underlies the institutional
analysis of the FDA. If, in fact, the FDA is simply carrying out
the mandate of its legislative overseers, as Weingast and Moran's
(1983) analysis suggests, any institutional arrangement that maintains
the current government monopoly of oversight responsibility will
embody the same incentives as the current system, and will represent
only a marginal improvement over the status quo. This is why some
observers have advocated removing the FDA's veto power over new
drugs and devices (Kazman 1990).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This is an interesting proposal. In essence,
it represents a full-scale version of <I>laissez-faire</I> in
drug and device certification. In such a regime firms could approach
the market in any way they chose. They could self-certify, use
private third-party certifiers, or use the FDA, which would be
reconstituted as part of an overall competitive certification
process. Such a system has intriguing possibilities in that it
would undoubtedly foster innovation in the certification and testing
process, and the FDA would have to be responsive to such pressures
in this regard. And, over time, consumers would come to rely upon
those certification procedures that worked best. So if one were
to support a <I>laissez-faire</I> approach to certification, letting
the FDA compete in this process might be a good idea.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Such a system is not without problems, however.
In general, it would suffer from the same basic problem that completely
privatized certification suffers; namely, there would likely be
informational failures and asymmetries such that higher quality
products are driven from the market. For example, in a combined
public-private review process without a government veto, small,
undercapitalized firms would have the option to take excessive
risks in the form of introducing incompletely tested products
into the marketplace. In the event of subsequent problems consumer
welfare would suffer.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >So the issue of removing the FDA veto is another
version of the issue of whether <I>laissez-faire</I> will work
as a certification process. Such a system would undoubtedly be
an improvement over some alternative institutional arrangements,
but it seems apparent that some form of government oversight is
necessary to insure that the certification process works in the
interest of consumers. The key is to be able to design an oversight
mechanism that will foster the use of private, competitive testing
procedures and that will speed approval and hasten innovation
in both products and testing procedures while maintaining a core
of essential government oversight over the process. Indeed, limited
government oversight would probably work better than a system
with a vetoless FDA. The presence of a vetoless FDA alongside
alternative private certification institutions would undoubtedly
inhibit the emergence of a robust private certification process
for a variety of fairly obvious reasons, such as the problem that
private firms would have in competing against a government-subsidized
FDA. And for that matter, in the present environment of product
liability lawsuits, companies may not have any choice except to
use the FDA for product approvals.<BR>

<CENTER><B><FONT >Direct Government Involvement in
Certification: The Case of the FAA<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >This particular institutional setting involves
emphasis on self-certification by manufacturers with the direct
involvement of government in the process. In fact, in this case
one does not have to rely upon a hypothetical discussion. The
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) currently implements such
a system for airplane development.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In aviation the key approval required for a
new aircraft comes in the form of a type certification.<sup><a href="foot.html">6</a></sup>All
aircraft flown in the National Airspace System must have a current
airworthiness certificate which implies that a type certification
was granted to the original manufacturer<sup><a href="foot.html">7</a></sup>. This certification requires
that all parts and processes used in the manufacture of the airplane
and that the flying characteristics pass government requirements.
As with drug and device approvals, this certification can be expensive
to obtain.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The basic process is shown below. Manufacturers
begin the design of a new aircraft with certification requirements
in mind. Firms tend to use many existing parts and subassemblies
that have previously been certified as well as certified production
techniques. Before they begin to build the first components, most
manufacturers submit an application of the new design to the FAA.
The FAA responds by putting together a certification team. The
size of this team depends on the complexity and size of the new
aircraft. A small, single-engine aircraft for general aviation
may only involve a few people while a large commercial airliner
may involve a team of hundreds of members. The certification team
meets and reviews the new design. Based on the newness and the
degree of innovation, they inform the manufacturer of certification
requirements after obtaining the manufacturer's input.<BR>

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The FAA provides inspectors and oversight of
the new aircraft's development and production. Some of these FAA
personnel essentially work full time at the larger plants overseeing
the development and production process. They supervise the testing
of components and manufacturing procedures and verify adherence
to FAA regulations. Thus, the function of independent testing
is performed concurrently with development and production by a
team composed of FAA and company personnel.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This method provides for incremental approval
due to the continuous certification process. The theory is that
if all components are certified as safe, the full aircraft has
a higher probability of being safe. The FAA requires extensive
flight testing with special emphasis on key flight regimes. This
means that not only does the plane have to have predictable flight
characteristics for its intended functions, but the requirements
are continually updated based on past accidents and problems.
At the end of these tests the FAA awards an air worthiness certificate
that allows the sale and use of the aircraft for commercial and
private purposes. The FAA may also require additional testing
as the result of subsequent accidents, maintenance data, or general
safety concerns after the aircraft has entered service. However,
the bulk of the tests required for recertification will be done
by the manufacturer and submitted to the FAA for approval.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There are several important features of this
type of certification procedure. First, unlike the FDA procedure,
it gives the manufacturer considerable control over the time required
for certification. Firms can invest heavily in testing in order
to get a product to market more quickly. Part of this is accomplished
by careful planning and coordination with the FAA in the initial
meetings. The rest can be accomplished by investing in flight
test facilities or services. Second, firms are less under the
control of government schedules and bureaucracies. Third, the
self-certification system provides a slightly weaker liability
position for the firms. The firm has only itself and a few government
inspectors to uncover all problems. Thus, it is possible that
this shorter approval process has a higher cost in the form of
greater liability exposure.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Indeed, the element of self-certification involved
in the production of aircraft has contributed to the liability
problems of the industry, and there is still the &quot;refereeing
your own paper&quot; type of problem with self-certification systems.
And even with a great deal of government oversight, it seems unlikely
that drug firms would do their own certifying. Independent certification
provides a form of quality-assurance to consumers that self-certification
cannot. For such reasons the FAA system does not seem amenable
to the drug review process, and in some respects would probably
come to represent a bureaucratic nightmare for the industry. Nonetheless,
elements of this model are applicable to some medical devices.<sup><a href="foot.html">8</a></sup>

<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >Private Monopoly with Government
Oversight<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >This alternative consists in establishing a
single national laboratory or certified body which would conduct
the oversight and review of drug and device development programs
and applications for marketing approval under the supervision
of the FDA. The primary benefit of such a system would be that,
relative to the present system, a private body would have an incentive
to operate efficiently and to innovate in the review process to
a degree that the present system does not. This presumes, of course,
that some of the gains from innovation could be retained by the
private body. The primary disadvantage of this process is that
the continuation of government veto power would leave the present
system little changed. For example, the private monopoly right
could be revoked by the FDA if the monopolist deviated substantially
from the preferences of the bureaucracy which runs the present
system. So, at best, private monopoly with government oversight
would represent  only a modest improvement over the present system.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Moreover, such a system brings with it a host
of problems familiar to students of public utility regulation.
How would the private monopoly be chartered? How would it set
prices for its services?  If simply left to its own devices, the
private monopoly laboratory would charge monopoly prices for its
services where &quot;price&quot; is construed to be some combination
of money cost and waiting time for certification services.  Such
monopolistic behavior would retard the review process relative
to a more competitive arrangement for the provision of testing
services.  Any attempt to regulate the private monopoly would
rest upon issues similar to those raised in public utility regulation.
Would the monopoly right be rebid, say, every ten years? Would
there be extensive and detailed price regulation? What regulatory
biases and gamesmanship would result? <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This morass of regulatory issues can be avoided
by having more than one certified body to which firms can turn
for services. And unless some sort of economic justification,
such as economies of scale, can be found, there is no compelling
reason to have a single monopoly laboratory with government oversight.
Such a system would be cumbersome, and while perhaps exhibiting
better behavior than the present system of government monopoly
in terms of innovation and cost control, there would not likely
be that much difference between the two in practice.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >A simple model of a monopoly laboratory is
presented in the appendix. The moral of this analysis is simply
that the regulation of a private monopoly certification service
with respect to the provision of safety services, even assuming
a benign overseer with a sole interest in consumer welfare, would
be quite complicated. And while there are examples of such systems
in the private sector (the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations),
it is not easy to see how such a scheme could be applied to the
case of medical products. Regulation of a private monopoly is
difficult and problematical in any event, so that there is no
reason to expect the case of drugs and devices to be any different.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >Government Monopoly with Contracting
Out<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >This system of institutional review would maintain
FDA pre-market approval for new drugs and devices, but contract
out the actual certification programs. This is roughly equivalent
to what has been done to date by the FDA from time to time at
every level of the system except final approval.  It is also equivalent
to other government procurement programs under which specified
products or services are purchased from qualified contractors.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Contracting out is quite different from the
system described below as government oversight with competing
private laboratories. In the case of contracting out, private
contractors would bid to the FDA for business, while in a private
competing laboratories model, product sponsors would solicit the
services of private laboratories directly. In either case, the
FDA would regulate the private contractors or the private competing
laboratories.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The distinction between the two systems is
important. Undoubtedly, there are benefits to the contracting
out system relative to the present government monopoly with in-house
certification by the FDA. Private contractors could be expected
to be more efficient and innovative than government in-house reviewers.
Such incentives could reside, for example, in the concept of a
&quot;regulatory lag.&quot; Where equally reliable testing and
review procedures can be performed at lower cost, profits on a
given contract will improve. There are thus persistent incentives
to improve the design and review of product development programs
under contracting out that do not exist under the present system.
Over time, contracting costs will fall as firms pass along the
savings in bids for future work. Contracting out would also increase
the speed of the review process (as it could be done concomitantly),
and more drugs and devices could be reviewed at any point in time,
with consequent beneficial feedback for firms' investments in
research and development.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The other side of the coin, however, is that
government contracting carries with it a host of incentive and
other problems which have been studied in detail in the literature
(see Scherer 1964; McCall 1970; and Baron, 1972). It is not always
clear, for example, that competitive bidding yields the least-cost
supplier of services. Moreover, there have been a host of problems
associated with cost overruns. Also, the bureaucracy created by
delegating to the outside, and then reintegrating the results
into a review process that has always been beyond the agency's
managerial ability to control, simply increases complexity and
plays to FDA's weaknesses. For such reasons it is more likely
that the benefits of government contracting can be obtained without
the associated costs by adoption of a system of private laboratories
which would compete directly for the business of drug and device
firms. Such a system is closely akin to certain models in the
EU and several European countries, and is discussed in more detail
in the next  two sections.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >Competing Private Firms with Government
Oversight<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >This institutional arrangement would consist
of maintaining a final governmental review over new drugs and
high-risk devices, while relying upon competing private firms
for  sponsor oversight and certification services.  These private
certification firms would do a lot more than simply issue certificates.
They could perform a range of functions, currently performed by
the FDA, that are needed in order to be able to certify.  This
procedure is seen in the present European system for medical device
certification, so that examples of how such a system would work
can be drawn from the European experience. This model is also
analogous to the way in which the Underwriter's Laboratory works
in the United States; a discussion of the Underwriter's Laboratory
is thus also in order.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The European medical device system embodies
a set of standards which devices must meet. Although only a small
fraction of devices need to be regulated as drugs are regulated
(i.e., need to have a pre-market approval), it nevertheless is
instructive to examine how European device regulation works for
the entire range of devices.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In order to meet the required standards, manufacturers
are allowed a great deal of flexibility. For some low-risk devices,
manufacturers are allowed to self-certify that their products
meet the necessary standards. This &quot;light-touch&quot; regulation
requires only that the manufacturers, in addition to meeting strict
manufacturing and quality-control standards, maintain records
as to the reliability of a device and be available for questioning
should a problem develop.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >For higher-risk products manufacturers must
seek certification from third-parties, the so-called &quot;notified
bodies.&quot; Examples of such bodies, or private laboratories,
are BSI in Great Britain, TUVs in Germany, and KEMA in the Netherlands.
 Notified bodies supply certification services to firms, based
on analyses and oversight that they do in the form of testing
products and inspecting manufacturing systems. Approval of a product
by a notified body is tantamount to government approval:  the
product can then be marketed.  The notified bodies themselves
are subject to regulation by government with respect to their
operations as certifiers. In addition, as in the United States,
there is post-introduction reporting of adverse incidents. Such
incidents must be reported by manufacturers and users, and in
cooperation with national government authorities the manufacturer
makes an appropriate decision with respect to correcting problems
or taking the product off the market.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Thus, the European system relies upon elements
of self-certification for low-risk devices, third-party certification
for higher-risk devices, and post-market surveillance of adverse
incidents. The role of government in this process is limited to
standard-setting, regulation of the third-party certifying agencies,
scrutiny of the clinical development program, and dealing with
adverse incident problems once products are in the marketplace.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The effects of this system have been salutary.
Approval times are considerably faster in Europe -- 250 days as
compared to 820 days for a PMA review in the U.S. (Wilkerson Group,
1995.)  And there is no evidence that the European system produces
less safe outcomes than the United States system. It is therefore
possible that a system based on the elements of self-certification
(subject to government standards) and third-party certification
can produce a marked improvement over the government monopoly
system presently in place in the U.S. Indeed, the FDA has proposed
a trial of the use of third-party certification for low-risk devices.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >It is not a great leap to extend the European
system from devices to drugs. The U.S. requires a cumbersome IND
filing before first human testing while the U.K., for example,
does not.  At the market-approval stage, the review authority
in the U.K. gives more responsibility to a committee of independent
medical experts who have a consulting relationship to the agency.
 Moreover, the FDA, being the only regulator in the U.S. drug
market, necessarily acts differently than regulatory agencies
in, say, the U.K. and Germany. In the case of the EC's decentralized
 registration procedures, each national authority must compete
with 11 other national regulatory agencies in the EU, each agency
being concerned with the price of medicinal products in its domestic
market due to their respective government's role in the provision
of health care services.  It is also worth emphasizing that the
European agencies are fee-based. They thus have a meaningful profit
motive which arguably drives them to provide speedier and more
efficient reviews of new drugs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT >The Underwriter's Laboratory<BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<FONT >There is a certification system in the United
States for various products and equipment which operates in a
fashion  similar to some aspects of the European system for medical
device review. This system is typified by the activities of the
Underwriter's Laboratory (UL), and is worth considering in some
detail.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The UL is a large, not-for-profit organization
that certifies over 14,000 types of products using over 650 standards
(a &quot;standard&quot; is a detailed specification for a product
class that may run to many pages).  In addition to electrical
appliances and equipment, the UL also certifies automotive and
mechanical products, fire-resistant building materials, bullet-resistant
glass, and OSHA-designated &quot;hazardous location&quot; products,
among many others.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The UL tests and certifies products which present
inherent potential hazards to life and property. Except in special
cases, the UL does not offer an effectiveness mandate, but is
only concerned with safety issues. The exceptions are life-safety
products such as fire extinguishers and smoke detectors. In these
cases performance issues are also considered. The UL has never
underwritten any risk of the products that they certify. The business
of the UL is information; they are solely a testing and certifying
body.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The UL is completely private and independent.
There is no statutory or court-ordered requirement that forces
manufacturers to seek UL approval. Such activity is a purely voluntary
act on the part of manufacturers. The UL holds no <I>de facto</I>
or <I>de jure</I> monopoly on safety certification. In the United
States there are several competing standard-setting laboratories.
Not all laboratories use the UL's standards, but there is a high
degree of similarity among the competing standards. The UL is
much larger and older than any of its competitors and holds the
dominant position in the market. The primary regulator of the
UL and its competitors is the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >As noted above, the UL publishes over 650 standards
(the guidelines under which they test and approve products). These
standards are known to manufacturers in advance and cover specific
end-products. New standards are written according to the evolution
of market demand. As the demand for UL certification increases,
the UL formulates initial guidelines outlining their testing procedure
and the criteria products will have to meet to receive certification.
This information is distributed to interested bodies, such as
councils of manufacturers, insurers, and consumers. The UL asks
for comments and criticisms from these organizations, amending
their approach as necessary. This process results in a &quot;proposed
standard&quot; which undergoes the same scrutiny as the preliminary
information. The process evolves into &quot;published standards&quot;
which are made available to manufacturers. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >UL approval is not equivalent to governmental
approval. Ultimately, the use of products is still governed by
law, frequently under the jurisdiction of local inspectors, such
as the Fairfax County Fire or Building Inspector. In theory, and
perhaps in practice, local codes can ban a UL-approved product
or order its removal. In practice, such actions are extremely
rare.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >No form of legal mandate requires a product
to display a UL approval mark. However, many retailers are reluctant
to carry products lacking UL approval, and, occasionally, insurers
may deny liability coverage for unapproved products. As in the
textbook case of an investment in a non-salvageable asset, all
concerned parties benefit from the transaction, and firms, insurers,
and the UL all have incentives to maintain high quality standards.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The certification process begins when a manufacturer
delivers a batch of product to the UL. The UL informs the firm
of the standard under which they will test the product. If the
manufacturer agrees to continue, the UL prepares a safety report
and offers a &quot;procedure&quot; to be kept by the manufacturer
at his facility. The procedure lists the specific building materials
of the sample batch, as well as the manufacturing procedure, and
so on. The firm cannot deviate from the procedure, or they will
lose UL approval. The UL has field inspectors who visit manufacturers'
facilities to insure that the procedure is being followed.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The fee that the UL charges for its services
is based on a cost-of-testing approach, and depends on the testing
required by the particular published standard that covers the
good in question. Cost is also affected by the manufacturer's
choice of materials used in the product. If it is manufactured
using mostly UL approved materials, testing is less costly than
otherwise. The UL charges a flat fee for its field inspection
service and charges for its inspectors by the hour.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Notwithstanding all the discussion of the UL's
independence and the discipline imposed on the UL by the market,
it faces a specific regulatory burden. In fact, the UL is an actual,
working example of a competing laboratory with government regulation.
The UL and its direct competitors are certified by OSHA as &quot;nationally
recognized testing laboratories&quot; (NRTL), in accordance with
specific statutory guidelines. OSHA offers certification to any
laboratory that can meet its standards. The standards are not
arbitrary, and are available from OSHA.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The UL's direct competitors are also NRTLs.
Not all NRTLs are standard-setting bodies. Many use the UL's standards
directly, and offer some compensating differential in cost or
ancillary services to attract business. Some set their own standards
and testing protocols, independent of the actions of the UL, though
there do not seem to be great differences among the competing
standards. Typically, the UL's direct competitors are smaller,
newer, and for-profit enterprises. The UL's not-for-profit status
is likely the result of its curious history and inception. Since
its beginning, the UL's stated mission has been &quot;testing
for public safety.&quot; Though the UL has received revenue to
defray the costs of testing, its activities were always deemed
to be a public service. The UL maintains this position (over the
complaints of its competitors), and this history motivated the
UL to change its status to a not-for-profit organization.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >No other country uses UL standards, but most
foreign countries have their own certifying bodies, testing laboratories,
and standards. There is no set of bilateral or unilateral reciprocal
agreements with respect to UL standards. However, there are &quot;memoranda
of understanding&quot; between the UL and many of its foreign
counterparts. Though these agreements do not call for accepting
the certification of an overseas laboratory, they are reciprocal
on many levels, and in many instances the standards are similar
across national boundaries.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The UL's relationship with Canada goes beyond
a memorandum of understanding. The UL is certified by the National
Standards Council of Canada to test products for use in Canada
under standards specifically written for Canada. All products
approved for Canadian consumption bear the UL mark. The UL's Canadian
standards are similar but not identical to the UL's U.S. standards.
The UL is currently involved in writing common standards for the
United States and Canada.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The UL has not been exposed to excessive liability
concerns. There have been few lawsuits brought against the UL,
and these have been considered to be weak. The UL is occasionally
subpoenaed in connection with a lawsuit brought against a manufacturer,
but it provides no expert witnesses or any trial support. The
fact that the UL, as an independent third party, has certified
a product does not make the UL jointly liable for that product's
performance in the field. Neither does UL certification attach
the UL to manufacturer negligence. Basically, the UL answers two
questions: one, has the manufacturer taken the appropriate safeguards;
and two, was the product batch sent to the UL for testing found
to be safe? The UL mark signifies that the sample sent for testing
was found to be safe under a published standard, and the UL expects
that further products manufactured in the same manner using similar
materials are also likely to be safe. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The UL model, of course, is not a perfect fit
for the purposes of new drug and device review and certification.
 More is involved in drug and device approval than simply testing
a batch of products according to some manufacturer's standard.
 This is obvious.  Nonetheless, given the legal right to do so,
it is possible then the UL could seek to expand its capabilities
to be able to perform these functions.  This could involve the
retention of qualified experts to make judgments according to
the necessary standards.  In other words, both the UL and the
FDA can test a product according to specifications, but neither
the UL nor the FDA can test a drug's efficacy and safety.  Rather,
they would have to evaluate the evidence  by first checking that
it was obtained correctly and that it is accurate and truthful,
 and then that it has been interpreted correctly and satisfies
the law.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Both the European system for devices and the
UL illustrate the potential gains from applying a private certification
system in the United States to new devices and drugs. When coupled
with careful regulation of the certification industry and its
incentives, the private supply of testing services can potentially
provide as much  or more safety and effectiveness as the present
system, while speeding the flow of new drugs and devices into
the medical marketplace.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > </FONT>
<P>
<FONT >These private bodies could do a great deal
more than simply certify new products.  They would perform a scientific
review function to ensure the accuracy and truthfulness and interpretation
of results such that the existing law is satisfied.  Privatizing
this function and devolving it from the FDA has many advantages,
not the least of which is to afford the opportunity to bring the
very best scientists into the process of evaluating the safety
and effectiveness of new medical products. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Moreover, as discussed earlier in the analysis
of self-certification systems, there is little basis to expect
a &quot;race for the bottom&quot; out of this system. The FDA
would have regulatory oversight over the private laboratories
and certifiers, as well as review authority over their recommendations.
Such factors, as well as market incentives to maintain reputational
capital as a competent testing organization, would insure a healthy
evolution of private certification laboratories.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >Competing Jurisdictions<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >One way to look at the problem of institutional
reform of the FDA, building upon the example of the EU, is to
suggest th
<h2>I. Istitutional Alternatives for the Regulatio
evolution of EU institutions and their faster approval times may
reflect the reality that the individual country processes for
drug and device review must compete with one another, and such
competition has beneficial effects.  In the decentralized drug
review procedure of the EU system, sponsors can choose the national
agency to which they submit first.  This has resulted in intense
competition among the national agencies.  Indeed, Great Britain's
agency has done a marketing tour of the United States touting
its fast response time and its competitive cost.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The FDA monopoly in the United States. is not
in a similar position to the European agencies. So linking the
U.S. process to those in other countries might well make the issue
of institutional reform moot. Countries could choose review institutions
as they saw fit, and jurisdictional competition would mold these
institutions over time to comply with constituent interests. Jurisdictions
and firms which were effective would receive more revenue from
drug approvals, and so on. Obviously, jurisdictional competition
involves both costs and benefits, and it is a big leap to imagine
that the United States would be willing to enter a simple international
agreement under which products approved in other countries could
be marketed in the United States But some such linkage may be
desirable to support genuine institutional reform in the United
States<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Indeed, the European model provides at least
two implications for the United States  First, Europe's national
interagency competition within the EU is a model of how competition
between private certifiers could work in the United States  Second,
Europe's governmental certifying bodies can be set up in competition
with the FDA by appropriate international recognition agreements.
 Some further analysis of this latter type of action would be
useful.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The textbook case for jurisdictional competition
is the example of corporate law in the United States Each state
has evolved an individualized chartering system for corporations,
and have competed for corporate chartering revenues for more than
100 years. Over this time Delaware has become a preferred jurisdiction
in which to incorporate, but firms can incorporate in any state.
The issues, then, are why does this system of corporate chartering
work so well and could it be extended by analogy to the process
of drug and device review?<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The definition of a corporation is simple --
it is a business entity characterized by share ownership and limited
liability. The first component simply constitutes a contract between
a firm and its equity suppliers, and how a state governs this
relationship does not affect any other state's relations with
the firm. Jurisdictional reciprocity, therefore, is contingent
upon each jurisdiction recognizing limited liability as desirable.
Consequently, reciprocity does not require agreement on any other
issues, and jurisdictions are free to experiment with various
forms of corporate governance and judge their efficiency by how
the market reacts. States subsequently become responsive to the
changing needs of business, and as long as they do not respond
with severe alterations of the limited-liability principle, they
can change virtually any other component of corporate governance
without affecting the reciprocity agreement.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Defining a corporation is possibly easier than
defining what constitutes a &quot;safe and effective&quot; drug.
In agreeing to reciprocity, jurisdictions would state that they
accept the definitions of other jurisdictions, and in the case
of drugs and devices, that they approve of the testing methods
employed. A reciprocity agreement, therefore, would inevitably
require some minimum standards for membership. These standards,
however, constrain the ability of jurisdictions to differentiate
their processes, and thereby allow the political market to signal
its preferences. While jurisdictions in the market for corporate
charters differentiate their products through the governance components,
a market in drug and device certification has no margins upon
which to operate except for an agreed-upon concept of the definition
of  safety and effectiveness and the methods for testing.  Changes
in this definition necessarily alter the nature of reciprocity.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Moreover, rather than the continuous and infinite
relationship between corporations and their domiciles, drug and
device approvals entail discrete transactions. Firms do not evaluate
where they should submit all of their products, but consider each
case individually. If a jurisdiction changes its process, firms
can submit future products to other jurisdictions. In a worst-case
scenario a race for the bottom could occur as each jurisdiction
simply rushed to approve the products manufactured within its
borders and export them to other markets. Nonetheless, this is
not what appears to have happened among European countries. To
the contrary, competition among countries has led to the evolution
of outstanding agencies for drug and device review and approval;
there has not been a race to the bottom.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >International agreements are, of course, not
easy to negotiate, and reciprocity in drug and device approval
would be no exception to this rule. Most, if not all, of the benefits
of jurisdictional competition, however, could probably be obtained
by adopting a system with competing certifiers in the United States
Indeed, a rigorous private certification industry in the United
States would likely strengthen the prospects for linkage with
the systems of other countries, as such a change in policy would
put our system on par with the structure of the emerging European
systems.</FONT><sup><a href="foot.html">9</a></sup>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >Conclusion</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >The weight of the evidence presented here suggests
that improvements are clearly possible in the drug and medical
device certification processes as they currently operate in the
United States The evidence that certain European systems perform
better than the FDA process is compelling. The model of government
oversight with private certifiers has several advantages. It would
bring state of the art scientists and scientific methods into
the process of drug and device certification. It would foster
innovation in drug and device evolution, oversight, and certification
procedures, leading to lower costs, faster approval rates, and
enhanced safety and effectiveness. It would cut down on bureaucratic
red tape and delay. It would not require any changes in the existing
legal standards applied by the FDA. For these and various other
reasons, movement to a system of competitive certification performed
by private laboratories and testing groups commends itself for
the consideration of policymakers.<BR>

<CENTER><B><FONT >Appendix: The Private Monopoly Laboratory
<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >Suppose that the monopoly laboratory has an
oversight committee. For purposes of clarity, naively assume that
the committee members are interested in maximizing consumer welfare,
and, therefore, political variables are ruled out. The monopolist
is assumed to be a standard profit-maximizer producing certifications
at a price, P. Price is a function of the number of new drugs
certified, ND, and safety, s, of the drugs. Thus, P=p(ND,s). Total
cost is a function of safety and the number of new drugs certified,
and increases with respect to safety. Thus, C=c(ND,s). <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The oversight committee is interested in maximizing
consumer welfare, W, and, therefore, would like the area under
the demand curve and above production costs to be maximized, i.e.,
it would like the monopoly to maximize:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (1) <IMG SRC="IMG00004.GIF">.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The first-order conditions are:<BR>

<FONT >where subscripts denote partial derivatives.

<P>
<FONT >The monopolist, however, is interested in maximizing
profits and therefore attempts to maximize:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (4) <IMG SRC="IMG00008.GIF"><BR>

<P>
<FONT >From (3) the oversight committee is concerned
with the impact of increased safety on all consumers (from the
integral), while from (6) the monopolist is concerned with the
impact of increased safety on the marginal consumer. Furthermore,
when <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (7) <IMG SRC="IMG00011.GIF"></FONT>
<P>
<IMG SRC="IMG00012.GIF">
<P>
<FONT >the monopolist undersupplies safety from the
oversight committee's point of view. The committee then arguably
orders the monopoly to increase the safety of its certified drugs
at the cost of reduced monopoly profits. It is important to note,
however, that it may not be possible for the oversight committee
to discern the consumer-maximizing output decision. The monopoly
may exaggerate the impact of increased safety on price, P<SUB>s</SUB>,
to the extent that the inequality in (7) becomes an equality.
In this case the oversight committee believes that the appropriate
level of safety is being provided, when in reality the level of
safety is not as high as desired. Even when the committee has
oversight on the level of profits realized, the monopoly may engage
in X-inefficiency, and thus still provide lower than desired levels
of safety.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Dorfman and Steiner (1954) modeled a monopolist
whose product demand is a function of price and advertising. Consider
this approach but, instead, focus on safety rather than advertising.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Thus, the monopolist maximizes:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (8) <IMG SRC="IMG00013.GIF"><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >where the cost function is now additive in
new drugs and safety and, as before, ND=N(p,s). Maximizing with
respect to p and s, the first-order conditions are:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (9) <IMG SRC="IMG00014.GIF"></FONT>
<P>
<FONT >and</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (10) <IMG SRC="IMG00015.GIF"><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >where, again, subscripts denote partial derivatives.
Denoting E<SUB>p</SUB> = -ND<SUB>p</SUB>[p/ND] as the elasticity
of demand with respect to price and E<SUB>s </SUB>= -ND<SUB>s</SUB>[s/ND]
as the elasticity of demand with respect to drug safety, then,
as Dorfman and Steiner showed, (9) and (10) can be rearranged
as<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (11) <IMG SRC="IMG00016.GIF"><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This is a version of the Dorfman-Steiner condition.
For a given E<SUB>s,</SUB> the greater the elasticity of demand
with respect to price, E<SUB>p</SUB>, the smaller the safety to
sales of new drugs ratio. Given that the demand for new drugs
is highly inelastic with respect to price, which in the case of
life-threatening diseases may the case, safety relative to total
sales of new drugs will be high, other thing equal.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Nonetheless, given the simplistic nature of
this analysis, the oversight committee may get less safety than
the amount desired. This is the case when the marginal valuation
of safety to the average consumer is greater than that of the
marginal consumer. In an attempt to maximize profits the monopolist
undersupplies safety, according to the oversight committee. Also,
when the price elasticity of demand for new drugs is high relative
to the safety elasticity of demand, the level of safe certifications
relative to total sales of new drugs is low. And, as stressed
above, by exaggerating the impact of safety on price, the monopoly
can still maximize profits by undersupplying certification of
safe new drugs, and even if the committee regulates its profits,
the monopoly may still undersupply safety by engaging in X-inefficiency.
The point is simply that even with a benign oversight committee
bent on maximizing consumer welfare, regulation of the monopoly
laboratory easily becomes a quagmire. And, undoubtedly, the more
realistic the model is made, the deeper the quagmire.<BR>

<h2>Therapeutic Drugs and Biologics</h2>
by Henry I. Miller and William M. Wardell<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT >EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</B></FONT></B>
<BR>
</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >The goal of this proposal is to speed the delivery
of safe and effective new drugs and biologics to patients in need.
 To achieve it, the plan proposes changes in the current regulatory
system that will facilitate early clinical research, increase
the efficiency of drug development and its regulatory oversight,
and reduce the overall time and cost required for safe new drugs
to reach the market.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >The Need For Reform</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >The existing system for regulating drugs in
the United States has been fairly successful, as narrowly defined
by an assurance that products admitted to the market are reasonably
safe and effective.  By broader measures, however, it has failed.
The development and approval of new drugs and biologics is too
slow and costly.  The present system wastes the resources of both
the pharmaceutical industry and the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA). In the name of safety and effectiveness at any cost, the
development of many promising new therapies is prevented, and
the availability of new products delayed.  An unnecessary burden
is being borne by patients, by U.S. industry, and by the national
economy -- unnecessary because safety and effectiveness do not
have to be sacrificed for innovation and the introduction of greater
efficiency. We need a wiser balance of objectives.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The total time required for drug development,
from synthesis of the molecule to marketing approval, has more
than doubled -- from 6.5 to 14.8 years -- since 1964.  The time
from an Investigational New Drug (IND) filing to a New Drug Application
(NDA) approval now averages 8 years.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >FDA has raised the regulatory burden on drug
sponsors by continually introducing new requirements and policies
without due regard for their potential to hinder the delivery
of new and innovative therapies to patients who need them.  The
drug-development system in the United States has become the most
ponderous and expensive in the world.  The cost of bringing a
drug to market now averages more than $350 million. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There has been broad consensus for nearly three
decades that reforms are necessary, but few have been implemented,
and none expeditiously or widely.  Occasional attempts by FDA
to streamline regulation are little more than window-dressing.
 The inability of the executive branch of government -- including
FDA -- to reform itself necessitates legislative action to change
the scope and procedures of oversight.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Numerous official panels and inquiries over
the past 30 years have proposed remedies for the deficiencies
of the system.  The most important and consistently repeated of
these recommendations has been the need for <I>management and
structural reforms</I> that would transfer some tasks currently
performed internally by FDA to outside experts and organizations.
 While FDA has at one time or another delegated most of its review
and evaluation functions (except final sign-off for approval)
to outside experts or entities, the delegation has been piecemeal
and disorganized; partial privatization has never been integrated
in a way that could create an efficient overall system. The plan
proposal corrects that and creates a system with these recommended
management and structural reforms at its core.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Other reforms recommended repeatedly have included
a lesser role for FDA in the scrutiny of early-phase clinical
investigations and the wider use of accelerated approvals coupled
with continued post-market surveillance.  These recommendations
are adopted, explicitly or implicitly, in the current proposal.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >The Proposal<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >While rationalizing and enhancing the efficiency
of the process for developing, reviewing, and approving new drugs
and biologics,<I> the proposal maintains the existing legal requirement
for pre-market demonstration of safety and effectiveness</I>.
 Preserved as well are FDA's enforcement powers and the agency's
authority to issue the final sign-off approval for product marketing.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The key changes are these:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >1) Primary responsibility for managing the
Investigational New Drug (IND) filing, oversight of the clinical
program, and New Drug Application (NDA)/Product License Application
(PLA) review will be transferred from FDA to Drug Certification
Bodies (DCBs).  The DCBs, which can be private- or public-sector
(university) organizations, for-profit or non-profit, will be
certified by FDA and staffed -- as required by the language of
the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act -- with &quot;experts qualified
by scientific training and experience.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >2) The sponsor will submit NDAs (or PLAs) to
the DCB, not to FDA.  After evaluating the NDA, the DCB will submit
the results of its review (if favorable) to FDA. The FDA Commissioner
will then have a finite period of time in which to accept the
DCB's recommendation for approval (which, legally, is a &quot;rebuttable
presumption&quot;) or to deny approval. If approval is denied,
at the discretion of the sponsor and the DCB, a review may be
undertaken by an independent appeals panel reporting to the Secretary
of HHS.  All parties, including the FDA, will be expected to accept
the decision of the Secretary. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >These reforms will encourage greater efficiency
and cost-effectiveness via competition among the DCBs, improvements
which will affect both the tactics and the strategy of drug development
and approval.  DCBs' competition for sponsor-clients will favor
those that perform effective problem-solving for the client, manage
the oversight and review efficiently, and perform reviews in a
timely way.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Economic pressures will encourage the DCBs
to be competent and timely, and to cultivate a reputation for
integrity -- traits that will be most highly prized by clients.
 The enormous complexity and myriad alternatives at various steps
in the drug development process provide the DCB opportunities
to add value to the client's product.  Just in the realm of clinical
trials, the choice of endpoints, indications, and trial design
strongly influences the size, time and cost of development programs;
therefore, there is significant potential for savings of time
and money.  Subject to the legal standard of safety and effectiveness,
DCBs will be encouraged to devise innovative and more efficient
ways of developing drugs and getting them approved.  This strategic
competition among DCBs and cooperation between DCBs and sponsors
will transform the drug development and approval process and redress
the current trend of increasing time and costs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >More efficient management of the oversight
and review process will reduce the time and costs required for
drug development and approval.  In this way, greater numbers of
new drugs will become available to patients in a timelier fashion.<BR>

<h3><FONT >REGULATORY REFORM:  IMPORTANCE,
HISTORY, AND GOALS</h3>
</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
<B><FONT >The Need For New Therapies</B>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >American patients and physicians need and deserve
more rapid access to greater numbers of safe and effective drugs.
 It is clearly in the public interest to encourage pharmaceutical
innovation -- the discovery, development, and marketing of new
therapies.  Over the past 35&nbsp;years however, regulations originally
designed to protect public health by preventing the sale or use
of unsafe or ineffective products have themselves become impediments
to progress in the field.  The evolution of pharmaceutical regulation
has moved inexorably in one direction: toward more stringent,
burdensome, and intrusive oversight as FDA has assumed more and
more responsibilities and power.  As the Presidents Biomedical
Panel concluded in 1976, the delays and costs that the FDA's protective
systems impose on drug development constitute a &quot;hazard to
public health&quot;<sup><a href="foot.html">1</a></sup>.  In 1973 the president's Science Advisory
Committee concluded that it may &quot;be worth adapting US regulations
so that not even a single important new entity introduced into
selected foreign countries during the previous year fails to become
available in the US.&quot;<sup><a href="foot.html">2</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This proposal seeks to restore a more appropriate
balance between regulation and innovation - but without jeopardizing
product safety - by facilitating the development and regulatory
review of pharmaceuticals.  Public health will be maintained and
even enhanced.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >Why is Innovation so Difficult and Costly?</b></FONT>
<P>
<FONT >It is a fact that the development and approval
of new drugs in the United States takes too long.  The total time
for drug development, from discovery or synthesis of the molecule
to NDA approval, has more than doubled since 1964, from an average
of 6.3 years, in the period 1963-1965 to 15.0 years, in the period
1990-1992.  The time from IND filing to NDA approval (the most
highly regulated portion) now averages 8 years in the United States
-- two years longer than in Europe.  There have been dazzling
advances in discovery, such as the cloning of receptors and the
use of transgenic animals for both toxicology testing and human
disease models. But regulatory burdens have hampered innovation,
compromised the availability of new therapeutics, and wasted the
resources of both FDA and the pharmaceutical industry.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >As the time required for drug development has
lengthened, the average &quot;effective patent life&quot; - that
is, the time remaining from NDA approval to expiration of the
main patent -- has declined correspondingly, a double disincentive
for sponsors considering drug development. Effective patent life,
nearly 14 years in 1966, declined to less than seven years in
the early 1980s.  The Waxman-Hatch Patent Restoration Act of 1984
restored, at most, half of this loss, and required other substantial,
costly concessions from the research-based drug industry, notably
earlier approval of generic drugs.  It is the effects of these
and other disincentives to research that are being seen in the
consolidation of the research-based industry today.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Analyses of innovation in the U.S. pharmaceutical
industry show that its research output, as measured by the introduction
of INDs for new chemical entities (NCEs), declined rapidly and
significantly after the 1962 law was enacted.  The decline occurred
in several phases.  There was an immediate decline (by more than
50 percent) in the early 1960s.  Then for a decade the output
was fairly constant, but in the mid-1970s it fell again by another
50 percent.  It recovered somewhat in the early 1980s.  However,
in the last decade it has declined again, although in the 1990s
the shortfall in NCEs has been compensated by &quot;new biotechnological
entities&quot; (NBEs), the corresponding biotechnology product
candidates.  (DiMasi et al, CPT 1994)<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >It would be overstating the case to argue that
all impediments to innovation derive from regulation.  The process
of innovation -- a lengthy and complex one involving discovery
and development, including clinical testing -- is formidably difficult
and expensive.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In addition to the scientific and technological
hurdles, there are new obstacles in marketing. Over the past decade
there have been fundamental changes in the nature of the market
for pharmaceuticals and in the product criteria needed to succeed
there. The days of the manufacturer selling a new drug directly
to individual physicians are rapidly vanishing.  Typically, today's
manufacturer of a new drug must convince a panel of experts who
comprise a managed-care organization's formulary committee --
a discerning and informed consumer -- of the importance of the
product.  Their evidentiary criteria can exceed those of FDA and
they may call for evidence (such as pharmacoeconomics and comparative
efficacy) that is outside the sphere of the drug-approval process.
 The utilization of new (and other) drugs is becoming more tightly
controlled, and the outcomes are being recorded and analyzed in
ways that were previously inconceivable. There is, for example,
a growing use of computerized control of patient selection, indication,
dose, and duration of therapy.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Thus, manufacturers' products and claims, and
the evidence supporting them, must meet very high standards to
be accepted in today's marketplace.  In this exacting environment,
government regulation of the product-development process should
not add burdens that are no longer necessary.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >One fundamental cause of the ever-increasing
regulatory burden in the United States is  that regulators strive
to avoid, at any cost, approving a product that might turn out
to be harmful, even if this policy causes them inevitably and
systematically to delay or neglect to approve products that promote
patients' well-being.  Consequently, FDA has continually imposed
new requirements and assumed new regulatory responsibilities that
have inexorably increased the length of the approval process and
the costs involved.  Because this phenomenon goes to the fundamental
malaise of FDA's monopoly over drug evaluation and review, it
is worth exploring further. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There exists a marked asymmetry, or imbalance,
between the two kinds of wrong decisions that a regulator can
make: (1) a decision to approve for marketing a drug or other
product that turns out to be harmful (an &quot;error of commission&quot;),
or (2) a decision to deny, delay or inhibit approval of a drug
or other product that would be beneficial (an &quot;error of omission&quot;).
 Putting this another way, it is the difference is between permitting
something bad to happen and not permitting something beneficial
to happen.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Several kinds of asymmetry exist in the two
situations.  Two classic examples of errors of commission are
the approval of the tranquilizer thalidomide by some European
regulatory agencies in the 1960's and the approval of the &quot;swine
flu&quot; vaccine by FDA.  Mistakes like these are highly visible.
 They bring down the wrath of the media, the public, and legislative
oversight bodies.  Often both the developers of the drug and the
regulators who allowed it to be marketed are criticized and punished
-- witness the modern-day pillories in Congressional oversight
hearings and the press.  A regulator's career might be damaged
irreparably by the good-faith but mistaken approval of a product.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Errors of omission, in the form of unreasonable
demands or requirements, can delay or prevent entirely the marketing
of an important new product.  But such errors of omission caused
by regulators' bad judgments, timidity or anxiety is often known
only to a few knowledgeable company and FDA insiders.  And if
the mistake precipitates a company's decision to abandon the drug,
both the regulatory misstep and the sequelae may be largely invisible.
 Moreover, there may be no direct evidence that the continuing
suffering of patients is avoidable -- or that the regulators are
culpable.  Too often FDA is allowed to &quot;err on the side of
safety,&quot; when that is merely a euphemism for committing an
error of  &quot;ommission.&quot; <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The changes in regulations proposed here are
intended, in part, to improve the balance between benefit and
risk, and between safety considered narrowly and patients' overall
welfare.  The plan will shift the balance toward encouraging product
development and permitting patients greater and timelier access
to the benefits of innovation.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >Positive Features of the U.S. System of
 Drug Development and Regulation</FONT></B>

<P>
<FONT >In proposing reform, it is important to understand
and preserve the virtues of the present system.  Industry, government,
academia, and medical practice all play a role in the scheme of
drug development, regulation, and use in this country.  This system
has substantially achieved two major goals: <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >1) protection of human subjects of clinical
research (through the IND process); and,</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >2) assurance that no product reaches the market
until proved reasonably safe and effective for its labeled use
(through the NDA process).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The major regulatory requirements governing
this process were instituted in 1962.  Over the past 35 years,
students of U.S. regulation have learned a great deal about the
nuances of the regulatory system and of FDA itself, including
which aspects work well and which need to be improved.   It should
be noted, however, that drug regulation, while important, is only
one of many important contributing factors in bringing new therapies
to patients.  Profound changes have occurred over the past three
decades in widely disparate parts of the system and in society.
Clinical research has advanced. The media has become more aggressive
and covered these subjects more fully.  Public sophistication
and awareness has grown.  Pharmaceutical marketing, tort case
law, and -- perhaps most important and powerful now and for the
foreseeable future -- the system of paying for medical treatments
have all changed dramatically.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Clinical research, for example, has many more
professional, full-time, career clinical researchers (including
MD/PhDs) than it did in 1962.  Since 1962, we have also seen the
advent of institutional safeguards, such as Institutional Review
Boards (IRBs).  Corporate operating procedures have been systematized,
as have corporate and government clinical-safety reporting and
analysis procedures. There is the new science of pharmacoepidemiology,
and innovations in patient care, such as skilled clinical research
nursing at research institutions, have provided yet another level
of expertise applied to clinical research. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In addition, various entities have become <I>de
facto</I> standard-setting organizations.  The newest ones, which
are rapidly becoming the most powerful, are managed-care organizations.
 As described above, these organizations exercise influence through
large-scale purchasing, control over their formularies, and drug
utilization review.  Formularies and drug utilization-review are
particularly powerful; physicians practicing within organizations
like HMOs are seeing their ability to prescribe increasingly constrained
or &quot;corrected&quot; by computerized &quot;governors,&quot;
in systems that perform overall integration of the medical record
for case management.  A physician might be prevented from prescribing
a drug if according to software filters it does not fit a patient's
listed diagnosis, or is excessive in dose or time of administration.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >While drug regulation has played a major role
in the elevation of standards to their present levels, these other
factors are essential and autonomous components that exist outside
FDA's  realm.  They are virtually independent, non-governmental
instruments that help to maintain research integrity, drug safety
and efficacy, and post-marketing surveillance.  Furthermore, FDA
is by no means the only world body that regulates drug approval
for safety and efficacy: a score of other countries (and now the
EU) have systems that perform reviews and achieve results that
are essentially similar to those of the United States -- and incidentally,
operate with staffs and budgets disproportionately smaller than
the FDA.  Indeed, as drugs become increasingly subject to these
various new controls before and after marketing approval, the
relative importance of FDA as a protector inevitably diminishes.
 This evolution must shape the reform of pharmaceutical regulation.
A regulatory system for the 21st century has to be different from
one crafted in 1962 when the problems were very different, and
the other elements of <I>de facto</I> regulation were almost non-existent.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >The History of Regulatory Reform<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT >FDA is responsible for regulating the testing
and marketing of all new human and veterinary drugs.  FDA's basic
authority is embodied in the 1902 Public Health Service Act; the
1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; and 1962 amendments
to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Public Health Service
Act mandates the <I>safety </I>regulation of biological drugs.
 The 1938 Act charged FDA with ensuring the <I>safety</I> of all
new drugs before they are released to the market (the NDA approval
process).  In 1962, partly in response to the thalidomide tragedy
in Europe, Congress imposed the additional requirement that a
new drug be shown to be <I>effective</I> as well as safe.  The
amendments also expanded the government's authority to regulate
clinical investigations of drugs (the IND process). Today all
preclinical and clinical research is conducted under FDA regulations
and policies.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >It is striking that for decades, debates about
regulatory reform have identified the same problems and the same
solutions have been recommended by panel after distinguished panel.
These eminent and expert panels, including the McMahon Committee,
the Lasagna Committee, the Edwards Committee, and the Council
on Competitiveness have recommended both broad changes and specific
improvements that would reduce the time, cost, complexity, and
unpredictability of the process, and thereby prevent the loss
of potential therapies.  Because the agency has been too slow
and obdurate in implementing most of these repeated recommendations,
reform must come from outside the agency, via legislative changes.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > </FONT>
<P>
<FONT >A particular advantage of our proposal (to
be described in Section II) is that delegating a portion of the
oversight responsibility to non-governmental entities introduces
two basic improvements simultaneously: (i) an element of competition
among DCBs for drug companies' business, which creates pressure
for greater creativity and efficiency; and (ii) a more appropriate
balance between risks and rewards, incentives and disincentives
than presently exists.  These basic elements derive from first
principles of management and regulation.  The proposed mechanism
also contains safeguards to assure the integrity of the process,
including high-quality reviews.<BR>

<h3>THE PROPOSED NEW SYSTEM:  REGULATION
OF DRUGS AND BIOLOGICS</h3>
<BR>
<FONT >The goal of the plan is to speed the delivery
of safe and effective products to patients who require them. 
To achieve that, changes in current federal regulation are proposed
that will facilitate early clinical research; increase the efficiency
of drug development and the constructiveness of its regulatory
oversight; and reduce the overall time and cost required for a
new drug to reach the market.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > </FONT>
<P>
<FONT >While improving the process for developing,
reviewing, and approving new drugs and biologics, this proposal
maintains existing safety and effectiveness standards by preserving
the legal requirements for pre-market demonstration of safety
and effectiveness.  Preserved as well are FDA's enforcement powers
and the agency's final sign-off authority to approve product marketing.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The salient aspects of this proposal are the
transfer of much of the responsibility for day- to-day IND oversight
and NDA review to non-governmental experts; support of the review
mechanism (DCBs) by user fees (via contractual arrangements between
sponsors and DCBs); and competition among the non-governmental
entities that will oversee the IND process and perform reviews.
 No single component of this proposal is completely new, but the
integration of these various elements into a drug oversight and
review system is accomplished in a novel way that is both logically
sound and empirically validated.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Our plan proposes changing the system of regulatory
oversight of drug development by transferring the primary oversight
responsibility (but not the final approval step) from FDA to non-governmental
entities, Drug Certification Bodies (DCBs),that are staffed by
the experts that the law requires to make judgments on effectiveness
and safety.  This transformation of the IND oversight and NDA
review process for  individual products in development will be
more comprehensive than other, similar proposals that would, for
example, delegate piecemeal various FDA functions such as review
of NDA filings.  Competition among the DCBs to provide regulatory
oversight services, combined with safeguards against conflicts
of interest and overeagerness to approve products, will create
a more efficient drug development process and promote innovation.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >The Drug Certification Bodies (DCBs)</b>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >DCBs will be certified by FDA to ensure they
have the technical, scientific, and managerial expertise necessary
to oversee and review particular specialties or categories of
products.  The DCBs' own imperatives to compete for clients, avoid
tort liability, and retain FDA certification are the fundamental
triad that will provide the impetus for high standards.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The corporate structure, geographic location,
and number of DCBs will be determined by market forces, as will
how many DCBs emerge and survive.  DCBs may choose, for example,
to be for-profit or non-profit; to be physically located in existing
centers of medical research or near centers of the pharmaceutical
or biotechnology industry; and to specialize in particular therapeutic
areas or drug types, or be  broadly qualified for a wide range.
 The regulatory process for obtaining licensure as a DCB could
be modeled on other complex health-related licensing procedures
such as the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations
(JCAHO).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >FDA will certify the DCBs to oversee most of
the drug development process (i.e., to evaluate and issue INDs),
oversee drugs in development, and review NDA applications.<sup><a href="foot.html">3</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >At the sponsor's option, the DCB may offer
advice on what is appropriate or required in a development program
to obtain NDA approval, but ultimate approval cannot (and should
not) be guaranteed. Nor should this be part of the contract. In
the end, the results of the physico-chemical, pre-clinical, and
clinical studies will provide evidence of safety and efficacy
-- and, therefore, an indication of likely approval. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Initially, DCBs will likely recruit from FDA,
industry, and contract research organizations (CROs) the scientific,
medical, and regulatory experts required for judgments on safety
and effectiveness. Experts may be needed in fields such as pharmaceutical
toxicology, pharmaceutical formulations, biopharmaceutics, drug
study design and analysis, clinical monitoring of therapeutics
and quality assurance, chemistry, and manufacturing.<B> </B> Because
these are specialized technical undertakings, the DCB will need
a broad range of scientific, medical, regulatory, and management
expertise. For this reason alone, qualifying for and retaining
FDA certification will be challenging.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >The Sponsor's Relationship with a DCB</b>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The product sponsor (usually a company) will
select a DCB from those certified for the respective product class
-- categories might include, for example, anti-hypertensive drugs,
psychotropic drugs, or vaccines.  Important factors in that choice
will include the perceived ability of the DCB to oversee a suitable
NDA program and the likelihood of a successful DCB review and
eventual FDA approval for its particular product.  Other factors
influencing the choice might include the DCB's geographic location;
reputation for service; experience with studies of comparable
size and complexity; and, fees.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Different sponsor companies will require widely
different degrees of interaction and service from DCBs, as happens
now with sponsor-FDA interactions.  Sponsor-DCB contracts will
reflect these differing needs.  The level of service required
will depend on factors such as the size and previous experience
of the sponsor (both generally and for the particular class of
drug); the intrinsic novelty of the product; the presence of difficult
issues of purity, potency, stability, or toxicity; and the size
and complexity of the clinical program.  Other issues will sometimes
be prominent; for example, in the case of important public health
products such as influenza vaccine, there could be a compelling
need for extremely rapid testing and approval. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The needs of the sponsor companies will determine
how many DCBs can ultimately be sustained by the U.S. drug development
process, and what their special features and location will be.
 <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >Role of DCB in IND Oversight and NDA Review</B>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Because the DCB will have primary supervision
over the IND, the IND submission will be made to the DCB, not
to FDA.  However, FDA will maintain its role in the national surveillance
of clinical safety of investigational drugs, as part of its responsibility
for all drug safety surveillance, as described below.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The contact between the sponsor and the DCB
will normally begin during preclinical development, well before
the expected start of clinical trials, just as sponsor-FDA interaction
often does now.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The DCB will advise on and evaluate the IND
filing and issue the IND when it is satisfied that the risk/benefit
considerations are appropriate for the commencement of  clinical
trials.  Following the granting of the IND and the IRB's (independent)
approval, the sponsor will be able to initiate the study, as at
present.  The DCB's close involvement with the sponsor will encourage
the identification and solution of problems during the pre-submission
period.  Little or no additional time -- the current 30-day waiting
period, for example -- should be needed to obtain IND approval.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The DCB will oversee the testing of the new
drug throughout its clinical research phases, concentrating on
issues of safety and efficacy.  The DCB will ensure that the sponsor
is in compliance with the currently applicable regulatory standards
(including GLPs, GCPs, and GMPs). The DCB will be responsible
for auditing the sponsor to ensure that standards have been met
in all areas and for certifying this compliance.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Once the sponsor and DCB have agreed that the
accumulated data on a product fulfill the legal requirement for
safety and efficacy, the sponsor will submit its formal New Drug
Application (NDA) to the DCB.  The DCB will be responsible for
certifying, through its regular site visits and audits of the
sponsor, that the original data are accurately recorded, analyzed,
and reported; that the data are suitably archived for future audits
if necessary; and, that the summary analyses and reports accurately
reflect the data.  The criteria for approval of the NDA will remain,
as they are now, safety and efficacy, as judged by experts (in
this case, the DCB's experts), according to the law.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Because of the DCB's continuous involvement
as the data supporting the NDA are accumulated -- a process that
has in past reform proposals been referred to as a &quot;developing&quot;
or &quot;self-reviewing&quot; NDA -- the evaluation and review
of a straightforward NDA will normally be completed rapidly after
its submission.  Also, because the DCB's report, like the NDA
itself, may be written as the NDA data are emerging, even difficult
issues to be addressed in the report -- such as marginal efficacy;
low therapeutic index; or problems with safety, stability, or
manufacturing -- will often have been identified and solved by
the DCB in the course of the IND.  Thus, a DCB's favorable recommendation
may often be issued with only a minimal additional &quot;NDA review
period.&quot;  Thus, the system will encourage a high level of
problem-solving, as the market learns to favor those DCBs that
offer competence, predictability, and a reputation for high standards.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The DCB's recommendation to the FDA for approval
of the NDA will summarize the evidence supporting a positive recommendation,
similar to (but with more detail than) the current Summary Basis
of Approval (SBA).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >Role of the FDA in IND Oversight and NDA
Evaluation</B>
</FONT><P>
<FONT >FDA will be responsible for certifying DCBs
and for overarching safety concerns.  The agency will not be involved
in individual IND programs unless there is a specific safety issue
that cannot be handled through the normal oversight of the sponsor
by a competent DCB.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >On safety matters, the DCB will oversee the
sponsor, but FDA will retain its responsibilities for national
oversight of safety matters, particularly those that involve information
outside the level of the individual drug, sponsor, or DCB, as
described in Section E, below. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >FDA will devote more attention than it does
now to clarifying, updating, and making public the criteria for
NDA approval in all therapeutic areas and indications.  As new
therapies and indications arise and as the old ones evolve, FDA
will participate in public forums with sponsors and DCBs to establish
new criteria or modify existing ones.  The goal of this important,
ongoing interaction among FDA, sponsors, and DCBs is to establish
and publicize the objective criteria for approval, and also to
foster a cooperative interaction among the parties.  The existence
of up-to-date, objective criteria will promote consistency between
DCBs for similar products.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >During the evolution of the IND and NDA evaluation
and approval, FDA will not normally be exposed to the developing
project in any detail (except for major or unexpected Adverse
Drug Events (ADEs, see below)).  However, the agency will be kept
apprised of which drugs are being studied through periodic reports
from the DCBs.  These reports also will include information needed
to monitor safety information and allow general oversight, such
as: INDs issued (name of drug and sponsor); ADEs; and milestones
(dates and numbers of patients in the clinical development phases,
for instance).  During the IND phase, FDA will not routinely have
contact with the sponsor, but may at any time inspect or audit
the sponsor, DCB, or any other component of the drug-development
apparatus.  An FDA inspection might be triggered, for example,
by a suspected problem involving safety that has been inadequately
addressed, or information that raises concerns about the integrity
of data from an investigator or institution. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Once the NDA has been sent to FDA with the
DCB's recommendation for approval, the agency has a fixed period,
for example 90 days, to review the recommendation.  During this
90-day period, the Commissioner can approve the drug or reject
the NDA for a specified cause (which, in effect, rebuts the &quot;rebuttable
presumption&quot; of the DCB's recommendation). The 90-day period
of review is not extendable and the Commissioner's failure to
act during this period is deemed to be assent to the drug's approval.
 If the NDA is rejected, the DCB or the sponsor can appeal the
decision (a process which in turn must be completed in a further
90 days). The appeal mechanism is described below.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >Clinical Drug Safety Oversight During the
IND</B></b>
<P>
<FONT >Safety oversight is largely unchanged in our
reform initiative.  We propose to keep intact the present national
system of pharmacovigilance administered by FDA, above the level
of the DCB. The current requirements and schedules for submitting
expedited and periodic safety reports will be maintained.  Under
the new system, reports will be submitted by the sponsor to the
DCB, which will transmit reportable ADEs to FDA.  FDA communications
(including any alerts based on safety data received by FDA from
U.S. or international sources) will be made to the DCB with a
copy to the sponsor.  In this way, the DCB will continue to have
primary oversight of the sponsor's handling of safety issues,
while FDA will maintain a broad purview.  In addition, FDA will
be able to obtain the safety data necessary for compliance with
international agreements on the reporting of safety data.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >To aid FDA's safety oversight, as already described,
the DCB will inform FDA periodically of the status of the INDs
it is overseeing.  The objective of these reports is primarily
to provide FDA with information necessary for its oversight of
the safety of human subjects -- not to allow the agency to create
an active or primary role for itself in the routine oversight
of clinical programs.  (A secondary objective is to permit FDA
to plan its review of DCB recommendations.)  It is expected that
most issues that arise in the course of drug development will
be resolved by sponsor-DCB interactions without involving FDA.
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<b><FONT >Status of the Regulations Implementing the
Law</b></b>
<P>
<u>Safety and Effectiveness</u> 
<FONT >Currently, a drug's sponsor must demonstrate
its safety and effectiveness through controlled clinical tests
that are themselves closely regulated by FDA.  Before a new drug
can be marketed, FDA must determine that -- based on the data
submitted -- the drug is effective and reasonably safe for use
under the drug's labeling. It is important to note that Congress
did not create exact definitions of what is meant by &quot;effectiveness&quot;
or &quot;safety,&quot; and that the law does not supply such definitions.
 Rather, the law provides for these judgments to be made by <I>experts</I>
&quot;qualified by scientific training and experience.&quot; 
Nowhere is it specified that such experts should be exclusively
FDA employees, although that is how the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act has come to be interpreted.  This interpretation is, in effect,
just a custom that the FDA has imposed and the industry has come
to accept, even though it was not the intent of Congress as expressed
in the law; in fact, this interpretation goes beyond the letter
of the statutes.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Our proposal for reform conforms more closely,
we believe, to the original intent of the existing statutes and
regulations governing safety and effectiveness.  Some proposed
changes, such as the identity and location of the &quot;experts&quot;
required by law, will prevent the statute from being distorted
or over-interpreted.  No change is proposed in the existing legal
standard for premarket approval, which requires evidence of safety
and substantial evidence of effectiveness derived from adequate
and well-controlled investigations as evaluated by experts qualified
by scientific training and experience.  The DCB experts' recommendation
that a drug should be approved will be, in legal terms, a rebuttable
presumption that the drug meets the law's safety and effectiveness
requirements.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<U><FONT >The Regulations That Implement the Law<U><P>

<FONT >We believe that the current set of regulations
that implement FDA's enabling statutes, and the agency's interpretations
of them, are in many places unnecessarily complex and extend beyond
what the law -- and scientific principles -- require.  These can
and should be simplified, to be made more consistent with the
intent of the law.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In order to provide for an orderly transition
to the new system and to maintain consistency with internationally
harmonized formats, the current regulations will initially be
retained.  However, as experience is gained with the new system
during the transition period, a standing committee with representatives
from FDA, sponsors, and DCBs will revise and simplify the regulations
in order to streamline the IND/NDA process while keeping it consistent
with the requirements of the law.  Such revised regulations could
be converted to a status in which adherence to them by a sponsor
would be sufficient, but not necessary, to meet legal requirements.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >As discussed above, there must be ready access
to up-to-date standards of evidence needed for NDA approval. 
For the proposed system to work effectively, FDA, working cooperatively
with DCBs and sponsors, will continue to produce and update the
standards that apply.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >The Appeals Process</B><P></b>
<FONT >Two major problems have systematically prevented
industry from voicing complaints about the process or content
of FDA's decisions.  First, there has been no venue of independent
appeal for a party with a valid complaint; and second, there has
been a justified fear of agency reprisals.  Although there is
an FDA ombudsman, he currently reports to the Commissioner. Some
would look to the FDA advisory committees, but they are selected
and managed by FDA and address only issues presented to them by
FDA staff. There is no independent forum.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Our proposal creates an appeal mechanism for
DCB-FDA disagreements on product approval  -- an independent,
standing advisory committee of experts, the Committee on Medicines
Oversight, at the level of the office of the Secretary of the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  It will have approximately
10-15 distinguished members representing patients, medical practice
and medical science, and the drug and device industries.  The
members of the committee will represent a wide spectrum of scientific,
medical, and regulatory expertise, and ad hoc members can be invited
as necessary.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The committee will hear appeals of FDA rejections
of a DCB recommendation, and will advise the Secretary, who will
instruct the Commissioner on the committee's decision.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >Facilitating U.S. Approval of New Drugs
Approved Abroad</FONT></B></b>
<P>
<FONT >The efforts at international harmonization
of drug-approval standards and registration packages among advanced
countries implies that, in the future, other countries' evaluations
may not need to be completely duplicated in the United States.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >We propose to allow the direct submission to
FDA of an approved registration package from Europe (the European
Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) or certain national regulatory
agencies, such as Great Britain's Medicines Control Agency). 
A foreign agency would function like a domestic DCB in that it
would submit summaries of the data on which its approval was based,
and the 90-day time period would apply for FDA to review and approve
or reject this package for the United States.  Alternatively,
the sponsor of a drug that had obtained (or was en route to) foreign
approval could contract with a U.S. DCB to review and submit its
NDA.<BR>

<h3>ACHIEVING THE GOALS OF REFORM</h3>
<P>
This
proposal outlines necessary reforms in the system of new drug
approval. It takes into account the need for high standards of
public safety and also the often-ignored need of patients to have
access to beneficial, sometimes potentially life-saving, new therapies.
It preserves some of the salient features of the present system,
and changes those that have become inefficient and unnecessarily
burdensome. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The existing system 1962 and, resistant to
reform, has become more complex and troubled over time.  Fundamental
changes have taken place in government, industry, and society
that call for a new, less antagonistic and monopolistic system
that fosters innovation, without sacrificing safety.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >At present, approximately 85 percent of New
Drug Applications are ultimately approved. However, given the
staggering costs and the length of time invested in drug development,
that 15 percent failure rate is extremely costly.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This proposal offers a constructive approach
to responsible and responsive regulation.  While retaining responsibility
for the oversight of safety, the FDA sheds its day-to-day involvement
with the development of specific new drugs, leaving that to government-certified
organizations, the DCBs.  The new role for FDA emphasizes clarifying
and developing criteria for various categories of new drugs; monitoring
the DCBs; and working with the DCBs to eliminate wasted effort
and assure that when the recommendation for approval of a drug
is made to FDA, the agency will be able to approve it.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Under the proposed system, the spur to greater
efficiency and cost-effectiveness will be competition among the
DCBs, which will affect both the tactics and the strategy of drug
development and approval.  DCBs competition for sponsor-clients
will favor those that perform effective problem-solving for the
client, manage the oversight and review efficiently, and perform
reviews in a timely way.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Economic pressures will encourage the DCBs
to be competent and timely, and to cultivate a reputation for
integrity, because these traits will be most highly prized by
clients.  The enormous complexity and myriad alternatives at various
steps in the drug development process provide the DCB opportunities
to add value to the client's product.  Putting this another way,
just in the realm of clinical trials the choice of endpoints,
indications, and trial design strongly influences the size, time
and cost of development programs; therefore, there is vast potential
here for savings of time and money.  Subject to the legal standard
of safety and effectiveness, DCBs will be free to devise innovative
and more efficient ways of developing drugs and getting them approved.
  This strategic competition among DCBs and cooperation between
DCBs and sponsors will transform the drug development and approval
process and reverse the current trend of increasing time and costs.

<h3>APPENDIX:  DRUG DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATION
-- THE CURRENT SYSTEM</FONT></h3>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>How a Drug is Developed</B>
<P>
FDA does not test drugs itself.  The development
of a new drug is undertaken by a sponsor, which -- because of
the time, complexity, and costs of the process -- is almost always
a pharmaceutical company.  (Occasionally -- in about 5 percent
of approved drugs -- a federal agency, university, hospital, or
research institution may discover compounds, obtain patents, and
start development, but such entities almost never have the resources
and specialized skills to take a drug through the full development
process to obtain NDA approval themselves.) <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Development of a new drug generally begins
with the testing of a great many chemical compounds in in-vitro
screens. (In the case of biologics, fewer substances are screened).
 Then they are screened in laboratory animals in order to determine
possible toxicity and therapeutic activity. These preclinical
investigations define the pharmacological and toxicological properties
of the agent and help to predict the initial dose range for humans.
 Many of the agents screened are eliminated from further development
at this stage, usually because they are ineffective, toxic, or
not absorbed.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
When animal studies suggest that a compound
may be therapeutically promising, the sponsor moves on to Phase
I clinical testing, which introduces the drug into humans for
the first time.  The sponsor must submit to FDA an application
called an IND (Investigational New Drug filing).  FDA has 30 days
to review the submission to ensure that the product is reasonably
safe for research in human subjects.  If FDA does not formally
object, the sponsor may begin clinical testing after the 30 days.
 Uncertainty at this stage about whether FDA will object, request
more data, or require different test procedures is highly disruptive
and has often caused U.S. companies to use more predictable locations
abroad for initial human testing.   (Currently, a significant
fraction of U.S. companies' Phase I testing is performed abroad,
mainly in Great Britain and elsewhere in Europe.  This has occurred
to such an extent that the Phase I testing industry in the United
States has collapsed; many facilities are now closed.) <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Clinical studies are loosely divided into three
phases that represent a logical progression, or scale-up, of study
size and complexity.  Phases I and IIA, together considered to
be early clinical research, involve, respectively, the first administration
of a drug to normal human subjects and the first test of efficacy
in patients.  Phase I may involve as few as 20 subjects, and Phase
II a few dozen to a few hundred.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Usually after early Phase II (Phase IIA), a
decision is made as to whether the drug offers sufficient promise
to warrant larger-scale (Phase IIB-III) clinical trials in order
to develop the product for marketing.  Only about a third of the
drugs that start in human testing survive to enter Phase III.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
In Phase III, research expands to examine the
following:  (i) the drug's effectiveness and side-effects in a
larger number and varied types of patients and, often, a wider
range of disease conditions (&quot;indications&quot;); (ii) the
types and incidence of side-effects; (iii) the potential for long-term
use and interactions with other drugs; and (iv) other information
useful for drug labeling. Phase III trials may involve from several
hundred to several thousand patients.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Although Phase III trials cost more money and
take more time than any other single component of the development
process, the earlier phases -- and the effect of ponderous regulation
of them -- are perhaps even more important in determining the
time and cost of drug development.  There are high attrition rates
(failures) of drug candidates at the early stages when little
is known about them, and there are far more products under investigation
at the early stages. These facts are often overlooked, but they
underscore the key importance of obtaining greater efficiency
and cost reductions in the earlier phases of the drug development
process.  Such improvements would facilitate early decisions to
drop compounds that will ultimately fail (that is to say, the
majority), in order to focus resources on the few that will succeed.</FONT>
<P>
 </FONT>
<P>
Although the process is described in terms
of phases, development is really a continuum of research.  In
practice, the phases of drug testing are not sharply differentiated.
 Often, studies described as Phase I may have to be done or repeated
after Phase II -- or even Phase III -- has begun. For instance,
after advanced clinical testing in adults, the sponsor might seek
a pediatric indication; new Phase I and II studies might then
be needed in children.  Often, many different types of studies
are done simultaneously for different purposes; they are not neatly
divided into phases.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The distinction between &quot;early&quot; and
&quot;later&quot; clinical research, is the junction between Phase
IIA and Phase IIB.  Through Phase IIA (sometimes called &quot;exploratory
development&quot;) researchers are looking for evidence of &quot;clinical
proof of concept,&quot; and expenditures through this point are
generally less than about $15 million per compound, most of which
fail.  After Phase IIA, drug testing enters an intense program
focused primarily on amassing evidence of efficacy for ultimate
NDA approval.  Expenditures for Phase III programs are in the
tens of millions to  hundreds of millions of dollars.  (One cardiovascular
drug reached the quarter-billion dollar mark in a multicenter
Phase III clinical trial -- and failed).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>The NDA Submission and Review Process</B>
<P>
When the pre-clinical and clinical testing
demonstrate that a drug is effective as labeled and reasonably
safe, the sponsor files a New Drug Application (or Product Licensing
Application -- PLA -- in the case of biologics) with FDA, seeking
approval to market the drug.  The NDA, which consists of many
volumes and often hundreds of thousands of pages, describes fully
the reports of all investigations and statistical analyses performed
to demonstrate the drug's safety and effectiveness.  It also includes
a description of the drug's composition, the methods, facilities,
and controls for the manufacturing, processing, and packaging
of the drug; samples of the drug and its components; and a draft
version of the proposed labeling.  NDAs are reviewed by the Office
of Drug Evaluation in FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research
(CDER), and PLAs are reviewed by the Center for Biologics Evaluation
and Research (CBER).  The reviews are performed by teams consisting
of physicians, pharmacologists, chemists, statisticians, and other
specialists.  By statute, FDA is required to approve or disapprove
an NDA within 180 days, although this rarely happens.  The 180-day
period can be extended by &quot;agreement&quot; between the sponsor
and FDA.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Ultimately, most NDA submissions (at present
85 percent; DiMasi et al., CPT 1994, 1995) are approved by FDA,
but frequently final approval comes only after considerable time
and negotiation and requires additional submissions of data. 
Also FDA may narrow the sponsor's initial request, approving fewer
indications for the drug's use and imposing more restrictive labeling
requirements. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
After passage of the 1962 Amendments, the time
required for FDA review and approval of NDAs rose from six months
in 1962 to an average of three years in 1975 and remained there
throughout the 1970s and 1980s (ranging as high as four-year averages
at times); after years of protest by the industry and efforts
by FDA and industry, the time required has now been reduced to
two years or less.  The sharpest reduction occurred recently with
the implementation of user fees (but before most of the additional
personnel approved by PDUFA -- the User Fee Act -- had been hired
by FDA, suggesting that most of the effect was due to a management
change that could have been implemented at any time during the
preceding 25 years).  Much has been made of FDA's efforts to reduce
the time of NDA review, but even substantial reductions, while
desirable, will not greatly affect the overall 15-year total time
required for drug development and review.  Provided gross excesses
in review times do not reappear, the proper focus now should be
to reduce the time and costs of the total development and approval
cycle, and this will need more strategic attention to the endpoints
required for approval, as well as to the tactical efforts needed
to achieve them.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Meanwhile the number of new INDs has continued
to rise, but the trickle of products approved for market that
emerge from the end of the pipeline has remained stagnant at 20
to 30 per year since the 1960s.  In 1994 the FDA approved only
22 new drugs (compared to 25 the previous year).   The numbers
of applications submitted to FDA for marketing approval of biologicals
has been declining.  Thus, the flow of products from the first
clinical trials through to ultimate marketing approval has slowed.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
These are some of the reasons that this proposal
seeks to make improvements throughout the period of regulated
clinical testing, rather than focusing predominantly on expediting
NDA review and approval.<BR>

<h2>III. Medical Devices</h2>
by Ralph A. Epstein<P>

<CENTER><B>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
<b>Operating Plan for a New Medical Device
Certification Process</b>
<P>
The new plan involves the interaction of three
groups: the manufacturer who bears the ultimate responsibility
for their product; a private Device Certifying Body (DCB), engaged
by the manufacturer to provide independent certification of critical
manufacturing processes and of products; and, the federal authority
(FDA), which maintains responsibility for public safety by ensuring
the competence of the DCB's, keeping the system honest by enforcing
compliance with law, and by maintaining a universal system of
postmarketing surveillance. The system is characterized by the
reliance on objectively defined law, clear standards and well-defined
responsibility. It relies, as far as possible, on private, non-governmental,
organizations. The plan follows in most details the workings of
the European Union medical device regulatory system.<BR>

<P>
<b>Basic Principles</b>
<P>
All medical devices are classified, using clear
objective criteria, into one of four classes (I, IIa, IIb, and
III). Devices presenting the highest level of risk and complexity
are placed in the higher numbered classes. Devices may be marketed
only if they conform with a comprehensive series of &quot;essential
requirements.&quot; As far as possible, such conformance will
be ensured in practice by adhering to relevant internationally
agreed upon objective standards. For all classes of devices, except
Class I, a DCB must audit the manufacturer periodically to confirm
such conformance. The number of areas audited and the stringency
of the audit depends on the class. However, in all cases, the
manufacturer has a choice of methods to demonstrate conformance.
In general, the manufacturer can either demonstrate conformance
of his quality assurance systems or conformance of the product
itself. Combinations of these two routes are permitted. In all
cases the manufacturer must have a system for monitoring and acting
upon reports of a device malfunction after sale. In addition,
the FDA acts as a central repository of such information when
it involves a serious threat to patient safety as it is in a position
to monitor the investigation of such events, especially when it
involves similar situations arising with several manufacturers.
The FDA may, for cause, require that a device be withdrawn from
the market if the manufacturer has not ensured that it meets the
essential requirements or if the DCB has not acted competently.
In addition, criminal charges may be brought in the case of fraud
or criminal negligence.<BR>

<P>
<b>Self-certification by Manufacturers</b>
<P>
Device innovation is often characterized by
many small incremental changes. A method of rapid certification
of new products facilitates this. For Class I devices, the manufacture
may self-certify conformance with the essential requirements.
Manufacturers who maintain a total quality assurance system may
self-certify new Class IIa and IIb products between the periodic
audits of their DCB. Class III products always require premarketing
design approval by a DCB. In addition, for Class III devices,
the FDA must be notified 90 days prior to marketing to allow time
for the FDA to elect to review the appropriateness of the certification
process.<BR>

<P>
<b>Good Manufacturing Practice Inspection</b>
<P>
The FDA's current auditing of manufacturers
for Good Manufacturing Practices would be replaced by the DCB's
certification of the manufacturer's quality assurance systems.
Such certification would often exceed FDA standards as it could
include certification of design quality assurance. It would also
be done far more frequently than current FDA inspections. <BR>

<P>
<b>Labeling and Off-Label Use</b>
<P>
Currently, a new application to the FDA is
needed whenever the manufacturer claims a new use for a device,
or even if the manufacture wishes to distribute reprints from
the scientific literature concerning a new use. This is often
so expensive and time consuming that the manufacture &quot;ignores&quot;
such clinical practice, resulting in widespread &quot;off-label&quot;
uses. In most cases, in the new system, the manufacture will be
able to self-certify such label changes (subject to the unusual
monitoring by the DCB).<BR>

<P>
<b>Timeliness of Approvals</b>
<P>
The current system has been characterized by
such slow approvals that venture capital has become scarce and
manufacturers have been forced to relocate critical operations
offshore. Approvals under the new system should be expeditious
as competitive forces will only tolerate DCB's capable of responding
to the market.<BR>

<P>
<b>International Harmonization</b>
<P>
Since the new system will be based on standards
and procedures virtually identical to those of the European Union,
it should be possible for a manufacturer to obtain both U.S. and
European approval using the same documentation and inspections.
In can be predicted that organizations will be certified both
as U.S. DCB's and European &quot;notified bodies.&quot; <BR>

<P>
<b>Transition</b>
<P>
A two to three year transition period is envisioned
so that devices under current review can be approved under the
existing system, if the manufacture should so elect. After a suitable
period, only products certified under the new system would be
allowed access to the market.

<h3>AN OVERVIEW OF THE MEDICAL DEVICE
INDUSTRY</h3>
<P>
<FONT >The medical device industry has been dominated
by the United States for many decades. American medical devices
are recognized world wide for quality and innovation. Of the approximately
50 billion dollars in United States production, 20 percent is
for the export market, producing a positive balance of payments.
Nevertheless, the industry's competitive position is very fragile
and our world leadership is now seriously threatened -- not from
external competition but from internal policy. Not only can this
have serious economic consequences, but the quality of our medical
care itself is now in jeopardy. A review of the unique circumstances
of the medical device industry, with an emphasis on the factors
which have fostered innovation, is useful in order to appreciate
how we have come to this state.<sup><a href="foot.html">1</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In sharp contrast with the pharmaceutical industry,
the medical device industry is composed of a very large number
of quite small companies. In 1993, 88 percent of medical device
companies had less than 100 employees.<sup><a href="foot.html">2</a></sup> Although there are a few
companies with sales exceeding a billion dollars, the typical
medical device company has sales in the 50 to 100 million dollar
range. Of the over 7,000 domestic medical device manufacturers,
approximately 1,000 are development companies with no sales at
all!<sup><a href="foot.html">3</a></sup> There are only about 150 firms with sales exceeding $100
million. The very largest medical device companies have total
sales equal to that of rather small pharmaceutical companies.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >One reason device companies are small is that
the market itself is extremely fragmented. For example, the total
U.S. market for anesthesia machines of all types is only about
3,000 units a year with a total value of barely $150 million.
 In contrast, the United States market for systemic antibiotics
or antihypertensives is five <I>billion</I> dollars per year.<sup><a href="foot.html">4</a></sup>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Medical device companies aggressively pursue
research and development. In 1993, while the median R&amp;D expenditure
as a percent of sales for all manufacturing companies was 4 percent,
it was over twice as much, 9 percent, in the medical device industry.
For companies with sales in the 5 to 20 million dollar range,
it was over 20 percent.<sup><a href="foot.html">5</a></sup> Not surprisingly, a very large proportion
of significant innovation occurs in the smallest companies with
the least sales. Venture capital is generally attracted to these
companies in the expectation that the product or the company itself
will be sold to a larger company in 5 to 7 years. While radically
new technologies attract public attention, much of the long term
improvement in medical devices comes from a myriad of small incremental
innovations which cumulatively, over time, have great clinical
relevance. The FDA is required by current law to review over 6,000
applications for such &quot;new&quot; devices a year, representing
the entire range of modern technology.<sup><a href="foot.html">6</a></sup> Much of the impetus for
such product improvements comes from physicians in the field.
Unimpeded communication between physicians (and other health care
personnel) and manufacturers is a requirement for much of this
activity. Likewise the ready availability of sites for device
testing in a clinical environment, generally in our academic health
centers,  is essential for innovation.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Finally, the relatively small size of the market
for any given medical device and the need for specialized material
for many of these devices results in device companies being critically
dependent on suppliers outside the medical device industry. Thus,
the device may be dependent on a small amount of a specialized
plastic, an esoteric metal or an electronic component. The device
company seldom has the resources to develop such materials, and,
because of the small amount needed, there is little financial
incentive for the supplier to provide them. Their availability
is a byproduct of a larger, non-medical, market.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The medical device industry is thus dependent
on multiple factors beyond its direct control, and any breakdown
of these complex relationships will threaten innovation by the
industry. Time is the biggest threat. Small companies have little
reserves and are dependent on fresh infusions of capital or on
current sales (if they exist) to finance innovation. Delays, or
the fear of delays, or even the unpredictability of delays, can
lead to financial disaster and frighten off venture capital. Such
delays can be related to the time required by the FDA to approve
clinical trials or to approve the device itself, among many other
causes. The delays interact. Thus increased FDA requirements for
human investigations, as the FDA attempts ever more to force the
device industry into a pharmaceutical regulatory model,<sup><a href="foot.html">7</a></sup> make the
system more sensitive to delays in approvals of such investigations.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There are other delays in a new product's revenue
stream, not directly related to the FDA, that are very hazardous,
particularly to small companies. Since many innovations are incremental,
it is often good medical practice to use the device for routine
patient care while it is still the subject of human investigation.
If the investigational nature of a device prevents payment for
the device by government or private payers, the financial integrity
of the company may be threatened. Furthermore, if such use threatens
payment for any associated hospital or physician care, the health
care facility and physician may find it impractical to continue
interacting with the manufacturer, destroying a relationship needed
for continued product improvement. Finally, as U.S. academic health
centers come under more financial pressure, the opportunities
for clinical investigations decrease. The result of these forces,
coupled with FDA delays in approval of clinical investigation
protocols, has become  a potent incentive for American companiesto transfer some or all of their advanced research and development
offshore.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The product liability environment further discourages
innovation. First, many companies simply will not support the
development of new products in those areas of medicine most subject
to product liability suits, such as contraception and implantables,
as well as in entire medical specialties, such as anesthesia.
Where there were once many companies competing in the anesthesia
machine field, there are now only two significant U.S. based companies,
both of which are highly dependent on the export market. If, as
is the case, companies are liable under the doctrine of strict
liability (i.e., for any harmful event) rather than for actual
negligence, many companies will avoid intrinsically high risk
areas of medicine. The problem is compounded by the prevailing
doctrine of joint and several liability. Even if a company's actions
are only slightly related to an injury, it can be held liable
for the entire cost, if others sharing the liability have inadequate
assets. For this reason, a company producing a high-tech material,
(e.g., a plastic), which is used mostly for non-medical products,
has a huge incentive to prevent medical device companies from
having access to the material. The potential profit from the sale
of a small quantity for medical use is far less than the potential
liability or even the costs of litigation.<sup><a href="foot.html">8</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Finally, third party payers are limiting the
technology for which they will pay. To survive in a managed care
environment, the industry must have the flexibility to turn its
innovative energies to developing products which, if they do not
dramatically improve health care, lower its costs.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > </FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Currently, innovation is threatened by all
these factors simultaneously. The industry is over-regulated and
preyed upon by the plaintiffs' bar. Hobbled by these forces, it
is threatened by a new payor environment which has redefined what
sort of innovation is valued. The result in the last several years,
has been a decrease in the availability of venture capital; a
decrease in new product introduction in the United States; a trend
toward moving research and development as well as some manufacturing
to Europe; a decrease in the traditional growth of employment
opportunities in the United States; and, ultimately a delay in
the availability of medical technology needed by American patients.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Current market forces seeking to rationalize
health care costs should, if anything, provide new opportunities
for innovation in all areas of medicine, including medical devices.
Innovation would simply become more related to optimizing the
relationship of benefit to cost. Innovations in medical technology
can just as easily decrease as increase costs. The current revolution
in minimally invasive surgery and the consequent decrease in hospitalization
and time for recuperation is just one example of the potential
for technology to significantly decrease costs. Such market forces
are simply part of the environment that normally modulates the
growth and direction of an industry. Government regulation has
the perverse effect of constraining industry from rapidly adapting
to this changing environment.<BR>

<h3>DEVELOPMENT OF REGULATION OF THE
MEDICAL DEVICE INDUSTRY</h3>
<P>
<FONT >Close government regulation of the medical
device industry is a relatively recent phenomenon in western democracies.
In the United States, there was little regulation before 1976
aside from laws that ensured that devices performed in accordance
with their labeling<sup><a href="foot.html">9</a></sup>. In Western Europe, regulation varied from
country to country. There was little direct governmental regulation
in some countries, such as Great Britain. Even in those European
countries with a long history of regulation, such as Germany,
regulations existed largely to ensure that manufacturers met standards
which had been approved by a consensus of the relevant manufacturers
and users.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >All this radically changed in the United States
with the passage of the 1976 Medical Device Amendments to the
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The law first provided for <I>general
controls</I> which would apply to all devices. This included control
of labeling (and, by extension, advertising and all other communication
between manufacturers and users) and manufacturing (and, by extension,
design) practices (GMP's- good manufacturing practices). Devices
whose safety could be assured by general controls alone were to
be placed in Class 1. The law envisioned that the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) would devise a process to approve many hundreds
of <I>performance standards</I>. Devices whose safety could be
assured by their also adhering to such performance standards were
to be placed in Class 2. Finally, Class 3 was reserved for those
few devices which would require a case by case prospective analysis,
as their complexity precluded assurance of safety by adherence
to performance standards and general controls alone. A manufacturer
wishing to market a Class 2 device needed only to notify the FDA
90 days in advance of its intention to sell the device and document
that it met the relevant performance standards. Marketing was
permitted if the FDA did not formally object in this time frame.
Only Class 3 devices required explicit premarket approval. The
premarket approval (PMA) application was to be acted on by the
FDA in no more than 180 days.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >All existing devices (preamendment devices)
were to be temporarily approved and placed, by category, into
one of the three classes, as determined by broadly based panels.
Section 510(k) of the law allowed the manufacturer to petition
the FDA to approve a new device that was &quot;substantially equivalent&quot;
to a device manufactured before 1976 and place it into the same
class as the predicate device. It was permitted to demonstrate
that a new device was substantially equivalent to a postamendment
device which in turn was substantially equivalent to a preamendment
device. At some future date, Class 3 preamendment devices and
new devices which were approved under section 510(k) as being
<I>substantially</I> <I>equivalent</I> to Class 3 preamendment
devices were to be subject to a PMA.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Finally, new devices which were not substantially
equivalent to a preamendment device were automatically placed
in Class 3 (thus requiring premarket approval through a PMA process).
There was provision in the law for reclassification to a lower
class if it could be shown that compliance with general controls
alone, or general controls and performance standards, could ensure
safety.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The intent of this somewhat convoluted scheme
was to exercise no more governmental control than appeared necessary
and to avoid delays in introducing useful products to the market.
In fact, in the early years of device regulation, expeditious
approval was the rule.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >However, the system contained the seeds of
its own destruction. Congress and the FDA grossly underestimated
the complexity of the very heterogeneous medical device industry.
Although the formulation and approval of performance standards
were the foundation of the classification system and thus the
heart of the regulations, the FDA approved virtually no performance
standards. The reclassification process for new devices proved
so cumbersome that the FDA essentially did not implement it. 
Although Congress had provided no guidance as to how to determine
&quot;substantial equivalence,&quot; the 510(k) process was heavily
relied upon and the FDA made every effort to stretch the law to
the breaking point and accept claims of substantial equivalence
in order to allow manufactures to bring devices to the market
quickly and predictably. The FDA apparently gave little or no
thought of ever requiring PMA's for preamendment devices. In summary,
the law was &quot;working&quot; because FDA did not implement
it as written<sup><a href="foot.html">10</a></sup>.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The dissociation between the law as written
and as applied became more and more apparent throughout the 1980's,
resulting in major investigations of the FDA by congressional
oversight committees, the General Accounting Office and the Office
of Technology Assessment<sup><a href="foot.html">11</a></sup>. With the law clearly not being implemented
literally, it was easy to reap political benefits by criticizing
the operation of the FDA. Scandals at the FDA concerning generic
drugs compounded the problem and the prestige of the agency fell.
The FDA became more cautious, approval times began to lengthen
and enforcement began to take on an arbitrary character. However,
the 1976 statute, even though it was often vague and incomplete,
precluded serious governmental abuse. By 1990, Congress was ready
to act. It appears that the possibly of deregulation was not considered.
Instead, the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990 vastly increased
the power of the FDA over the device industry.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Several aspects of the 1990 act require comment.
The FDA was granted the authority to impose large civil penalties.
The act required postmarket reporting by users, distributors,
importers and manufacturers of device failures which did or might
cause harm. This requirement for redundant reporting of even the
suspicion of device failure resulted in the FDA being inundated
by more data than it could analyze or even catalog, especially
as the fear of penalties created a great incentive to complete
reports of marginal events. More fundamentally, the 510(k) process
was significantly modified. No longer could a company, even in
principle, market a device 90 days after submitting a 510(k) &quot;notification&quot;
(unless the FDA formally objected). Now the company was forbidden
to market the device until it received explicit <I>premarket</I>
permission from the FDA, in the form of a formal &quot;order.&quot;
The act defined &quot;substantial equivalence&quot;, the basis
for a 510(k) decision,  very broadly and explicitly allowed a
device to be placed in Class 2 on the basis of &quot;substantial
equivalence&quot; even if it had different technological characteristics
from its predicate device. The lack of FDA approval of performance
standards to allow for an objective approval process was implicitly
acknowledged by simply no longer requiring  them. However, these
provisions, rather than liberalizing the process, further constrained
it as the FDA was given the unlimited power to devise any &quot;special
controls&quot; that it deemed necessary for Class 2 devices. The
combination of these changes effectively removed any difference
in principle between Class 2 and Class 3 devices as now premarket
approval based on the judgement of FDA reviewers, rather that
conformity with recognized standards, was needed for both.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Further medical device amendments followed
in 1992. They were for the most part technical corrections or
provided time extension for the FDA to complete previously required
work. They did not change the essential character of the power
of the FDA.<BR>

<h3>THE CURRENT STATE OF THE MEDICAL
DEVICE INDUSTRY</h3>
<P>
<FONT >After many years of healthy growth, the medical
device industry is approaching a crises. Although the difficulties
that some companies are having are the result of their inability
to adapt to the new market realities which require more cost effective
solutions, much is due to misdirected governmental policy. The
direct and indirect effects of inappropriate product liability
policies are very important but are beyond the scope of this paper.
We will concentrate here on the consequences of FDA regulation.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The time it takes to obtain FDA approval of
a new product and the perceived capriciousness of the process
is perhaps the greatest concern to industry. The 1976 law envisioned
that the 510(k) approval process should not take longer than a
total of 90 days.  It is actually quite difficult to interpret
FDA's own statistics concerning their review times. Their preference
for using median times masks the fact that the time is skewed
sharply toward long reviews. Often they cite time at the FDA rather
than total elapsed time, not counting the time the manufacturer
needs to provide additional data required by the reviewer. Finally,
the FDA may &quot;stop the clock&quot; and this may not be noted.
Although the FDA believes that only counting the time at the FDA
is &quot;fair,&quot; the essential point is that if the entire
process is slow there is a severe disincentive to the development
of products in the United States. By 1992 the <I>median</I> elapsed
time was 90 days. The median then increased to 164 days by 1993,
dropping back to 155 days by 1994.<sup><a href="foot.html">12</a></sup> However, by definition, half
the approvals take longer than the median. In 1994, 5% of the
510(k) applications were taking more than 613 days, or almost
2 years.<sup><a href="foot.html">13</a></sup>  The net result is an increase in R&amp;D costs and a
costly delay in the time needed to develop a positive cash flow.
During early 1995, it was apparent that the FDA, under extreme
political pressure from a wide variety of sources, had reassigned
resources, softened their policies and made a significant effort
to decrease review times and introduce more reason into the process.
It is difficult to predict how long this will last.  However,
it should be noted that there is now nothing in the statute that
requires or provides an incentive for  expeditious reviews<sup><a href="foot.html">14</a></sup>.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >&quot;New&quot; Class 3 devices require that
the FDA approve a PMA. The 1976 statue allowed for a 180 day period
for FDA review. In 1990, the mean total elapsed time for an FDA
decision was 609 days. By 1993 it had climbed to 823 days. This
represents an extraordinary delay and has been a principal reason
the number of PMA submissions dropped from 78 to 40 during that
period<sup><a href="foot.html">15</a></sup>.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Most PMA submissions and an increasing number
of 510(k) submissions require the generation of clinical data.
The law requires approval of clinical protocols by an Institutional
Review Board (IRB). For clinical studies posing potential hazards,
the FDA must also prospectively approve the details of the study.
There have been many anecdotal reports of long delays in such
approvals. As such clinical studies, by necessity, take place
before submission for device approval, these delays are additive
to the delays in the 510(k) and PMA approval process.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There have been some attempts to quantify the
costs of these delays<sup><a href="foot.html">16</a></sup>. The Western European regulatory system
has been used as a benchmark. In general, our best estimate is
that European approvals require less than half the time of American
approvals. In fact, in many circumstances, European companies
which have demonstrated compliance with design and manufacturing
quality control standards can self-approve broad categories of
devices. Similarly, there is a conducive climate for clinical
investigation in many European countries. The bottom line is that
a product that might take 6 years to bring to market in the United
States might take 4 years in Europe. With this early introduction
in Europe, there is additionally a great competitive advantage
in other international markets. This necessarily means that, even
if a new product is eventually successful, venture capital will
be required for a longer time in this country and some foreign
markets may be entirely lost. The increased costs plus the uncertainties
of the regulatory process have resulted in a predictable decrease
in the availability of venture capital in the United States.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The more favorable regulatory climate in Western
Europe has allowed many companies to establish a positive cash
flow for new products by introducing the product in Europe before
marketing in the United States. Generally such a strategy can
be expected to save approximately two years. This implies that
American patients are often cared for with products several generations
behind those used for Europeans. This phenomenon is most apparent
in fast moving fields of medicine such as imaging and cardiology.
Recently, Medtronics, one of the largest U.S. device companies,
announced that it was transferring its entire venture group to
Europe. With an increase in clinical research in Europe along
with earlier product introductions, there will be an increased
incentive also to move manufacturing jobs<sup><a href="foot.html">17</a></sup>.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >While in the past American dominance in the
medical device industry was assured, the current outlook is far
less optimistic. Many factors had led to this dominance including
a well financed health care system, strong academic health centers,
a reasonable regulatory policy and low manufacturing costs. Of
these, our efficient manufacturing still gives us a distinct advantage.
Significant regulatory reform would go a long way to reverse the
current adverse trend.<BR>

<br>
<h3>CURRENT TRENDS IN REFORM PROPOSALS</h3>
Almost everyone in the device industry now
supports regulatory reform of one sort or another and agrees that
many areas of industry are severely constrained by excessive governmental
mandates<sup><a href="foot.html">18</a></sup>. There is widespread recognition that regulatory bodies
impose large costs in terms of increased prices and loss of desirable
employment opportunities as well as decreased opportunities for
innovation. In the medical device field, many organizations have
proposed relief from particularly burdensome regulations, often
without first seriously considering the possibility of fundamental
reform. In general, trade organizations, which primarily represent
large manufacturers, tend to shy away from fundamental reform,
while representatives of the smaller manufacturers tend to be
more willing to consider basic issues. This to be expected. Large
companies can better afford the large expensive specialized staff
needed to deal with the FDA. Furthermore, in the device industry,
small companies tend to be responsible for a disproportionate
share of significant innovation and thus are most constrained
by excessive and inappropriate regulation. Finally, burdensome
regulations may, in the short run, work to the benefit of established
firms because they make it more difficult for new, and often smaller,
manufacturers to enter the market. There are, of course, many
exceptions to these generalizations.<BR>

<P>
Current popular proposals for regulatory reform
can be conveniently divided into three categories. One group of
reform proposals is directed at ensuring that the FDA acts  expeditiously.
A second seeks to break the FDA's monopoly. Finally, there is
a host of proposals narrowly aimed at very specific regulatory
abuses.<BR>

<P>
<U>More Expeditious Review</U>
<P>
The 1976 law envisioned very rapid review of
new products. In fact it can be argued that, except for the minority
of devices in FDA Class 3, there was no <I>requirement</I> for
premarket review at all. Only notification of the intention to
market was required. In fact, over the years, there have been
attempts to obfuscate the fact that the FDA has tolerated very
long review cycles. Thus, the FDA at times has reported median
review times, effectively disregarding cases where the delays
have been very long indeed; has not counted the time taken by
manufactures to respond to sometimes inappropriate FDA questions
and requests; and, has pressured manufactures to &quot;request&quot;
that the FDA &quot;stop the clock.&quot; The delays involve much
more than new product applications and include, for example, the
entire process for appropriately reclassifying totally new products
after they have been initially placed arbitrarily in Class 3.
The problem facing reformers who attempt to address the issue
of excessive delays is what to do if, as in the past, the FDA
simply does not comply with the legally established deadlines.
One suggested approach is to not require FDA notification for
less complex devices, perhaps all of Class 1 devices and certain
designated types of Class 2 devices. Such self-certifying is very
close to analogous features in the European Union system. However,
this begs the question of responsibility for the classification
itself. In the FDA system, devices are classified in Class 1 if
&quot;general controls&quot; are sufficient to ensure safety.
Such a criterion is at best subjective and contrasts markedly
with the rather explicit and objective European system. Allowing
manufacturers to self certify Class 1 devices, without reforming
the classification system itself, might break down in practice
into endless litigation.<BR>

<P>
A second difficult issue is what to do if a
manufacturer in good faith places a device in Class 1, manufactures
and markets it and later the FDA decides that the device needs
to adhere to &quot;performance standards&quot; and thus should
have been placed in Class 2. Certainly one would not want to force
such a device off the market if there were no reason to believe
that there were an actual safety problem. Again, the fundamental
need is unambiguous up-front classification.<BR>

<P>
Finally, there have been proposals to allow
marketing of devices which have been approved by the European
Union if FDA regulatory delays exceed statutory limits. It should
be noted that many U.S. products are or will be approved for marketing
in Europe. Such a proposal is an implicit recognition of the quality
of the European system, and one might question why one should
not simply recognize European certification and allow the FDA
and the European Union to engage in jurisdictional competition.
One could also envision that a system which recognized European
approvals only after the FDA failed to act expeditiously might
well exacerbate the adversarial nature of the approval system.
<BR>

<P>
Eventual approval is not sufficient to attract
venture capital needed to develop new products if the approval
process itself is subject to capricious delays due to regulatory
uncertainty. Harmonization of American and European standards,
so that there is an objective basis for mutual recognition, is
a far better answer<sup><a href="foot.html">19</a></sup>.<BR>

<P>
<U>The FDA Monopoly</U>
<P>
A number of current proposals seek to break
the FDA monopoly by privatizing some FDA functions. The inspiration
is clearly from the European Union system where <I>competing</I>
private &quot;notified bodies&quot; certify that the manufacturer
has met the explicit requirements which justify the manufacturer
applying a CE mark (of approval) to it products. Unfortunately,
many current proposals fail to recognize that the virtue of the
European system lies in the fact that the European notified bodies
are expected to exercise independent judgement and are not merely
arms of the central governmental authority. Furthermore, to the
extent possible, their evaluations and decisions are based on
detailed published international standards. Contracting out current
FDA functions to private bodies without first rationalizing these
functions simply substitutes different organizations and different
workers. While there may be some virtue using an organization
that works more efficiently than many governmental agencies, the
more basic problem is with the process itself. Those proposals
which do not foster competition between private certifying bodies
by allowing manufacturers to choose the organization from which
to purchase certifying services would appear to offer limited
advantages.<BR>

<P>
<U>Specific Regulatory Abuses</U>
<P>
Finally, there is a whole series of miscellaneous
proposals that address specific abuses and problem areas. Some
seek to streamline programs that just do not work. This includes
the simplification of the device malfunction (vigilance) program
and the device tracking program. Others seek to eliminate programs
for which there is no logical rationale. This would include the
freeing of exports to first world countries which are perfectly
able to police their own markets. Others attack very narrow issues
which, for lack of a better term, can be classified as corrections
of abuse of power and dereliction of duty. These include attempts
to improve accountability by specifying which particular officials
can make certain decisions, mandating periodic meetings at the
manufacturer's request, requiring unequivocal classification of
a product as either a drug or a device, prohibiting the FDA from
making decisions based on cost-effectiveness, limiting the authority
of the FDA to require controlled clinical studies, prohibiting
the withholding of a classification decision based on GMP violations
and many other such important but narrow issues. While it might
be desirable to achieve immediate relief by instituting some of
these reforms, they represent an attempt to micromanage the FDA.
Without fundamental reform, they, like most well meaning efforts
at micromanagement, run the risk of exchanging of one set of problems
for another. In general, the reform effort would be better spent
seeking to change the system by going back to basic principles,
determining what is actually needed to protect patients, and devising
the most direct way of achieving this goal.<BR>

<h3>THE EU SYSTEM APPROVAL OF NEW MEDICAL
DEVICES</h3>
Much can be learned from the ongoing European
Union medical device regulatory reforms. Approval of new medical
devices in the EU is characterized by:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
1:<I> Objectivity    </I></FONT>
<P>
2: <I>Flexibility  </I></FONT>
<P>
3: <I>Timeliness</I>    </FONT>
<P>
4: <I>Competitiveness<BR>
</I></FONT>
<P>
The European Union medical device regulation
law is based on a list of &quot;Essential Requirements<sup><a href="foot.html">20</a></sup>.&quot;
These are universal requirements that apply to all devices. They
cover areas such as safe design and construction, clinical efficacy,
disclosure of residual risks, protective packaging, infection
control, compatibility with other devices, calibration and stability,
radiation protection, electrical safety, labeling, and instruction
manuals. In principle it is sufficient for the manufacturer to
rely solely on these requirements to justify putting a device
on the market. However, manufactures usually rely on published,
internationally agreed upon, standards which are specific to individual
devices or processes. For many decades, professional organizations
such as AAMI and IEEE in the United States and international standards
organizations such as ISO have brought together groups of experts
from the manufacturer, user and government sectors to develop
written standards covering a wide variety of topics. These include
very technical narrowly defined standards to ensure mechanical
compatibility, such as standards for machine screw threads; performance
standards for various materials, such as those for biocompatibility;
safety standards for the internal monitoring of life support equipment;
limits on electromagnetic radiation; as well as very broad standards
defining quality assurance for production, testing and even the
design process<sup><a href="foot.html">21</a></sup>. In the European system, such standards, originating
in various sources, are ultimately accepted by the EU's central
standards organization. While a manufacturer may choose to devise
alternate methods, adherence to such standards by the manufacturer
is presumptive evidence that the manufacturer has met the Essential
Requirements. Clearly defined standards provide objective criteria
and remove much of the uncertainty and risk in seeking approval.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Using published objective criteria related
to complexity and risk, all devices are placed in one of four
classes (I, IIa, IIb, III) by the manufacturer<sup><a href="foot.html">22</a></sup>. </FONT>

Examples are shown in Table 1.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2 >*active implantable devices are technically
regulated under a separate EU </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 >regulation but from a practical standpoint
are handled like Class III devices<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
For the large number of devices in Class I,
the manufacturer self-certifies compliance with the Essential
Requirements by preparing a prescribed Declaration of Conformity,
a technical document containing the supporting data which is available
to the authorities. Certain special processes, such as sterilization
needed for a Class I device, may require additional certification
by a notified body,<I> vide infra</I>.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<U>Notified Bodies</FONT></U>
<P>
For all other devices, the manufacturer must
engage the services of an independent &quot;test house&quot; to
audit their systems or product and certify compliance with the
Essential Requirements. These test houses, termed &quot;notified
bodies&quot; in the European system and &quot;device certification
bodies,&quot; or DCB's in our proposed reform are themselves certified
(licensed), in accordance with published standards, by governmental
authorities. In Europe, the manufacturer may engage any notified
body from any country in the European Union. In practice, many
of the notified bodies come from the long tradition of test houses
which physically test production samples. They can be thought
of as being similar to analogous firms in the United States such
as Underwriter's Laboratories. Others come from the more recent
tradition of firms that certify quality assurance systems. There
are a large number of American firms that do similar work and
certify that manufacturers of all types conform to ISO 9000 quality
assurance standards. Many of the notified bodies are licensed
in specialized areas. <I>Objectivity</I> is ensured by the heavy
reliance on published, well constructed standards for both device
classification and regulatory compliance.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
In addition to being able to choose between
compliance with published standards and devising <I>ad hoc</I>
methods of compliance with the essential requirements, manufacturers
generally have the <I>flexibility</I> to choose between two fundamentally
different methods of demonstrating compliance with the Essential
Requirements. One method involves having the notified body actually
examine or test the entire production run (or statistically valid
samples of the production run) to confirm that applicable standards
have been met. The second method involves having the notified
body certify the manufacturer's quality assurance systems. These
include systems for testing the final product, producing the product
and/or designing the product. The notified body, in many instances,
can certify that the manufacturer has sufficient quality assurance
systems in place to self-certify individual products<sup><a href="foot.html">23</a></sup>. The specific
options available to the manufacturer depend on the class of the
device. In general, the higher class devices must adhere to more
stringent regulations. Examples of allowable compliance methods
are presented in Table II.<BR>

<P>
Thus, manufacturers have the <I>flexibility</I>
to choose from a wide array of methods to comply with the device
regulations so that the process of bringing devices to the market
is facilitated. Methods may be chosen that are appropriate to
the company size, strengths and market. The result is that unnecessary
delays are avoided.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I>Timeliness</FONT></I>
of approvals is critical. One of the largest sources of complaints
concerning our current system is the time required to get through
the regulatory approval process. Although the FDA has recently
attempted to expedite the process, 510(k)s and PMA's have taken
far longer that the statutory 90 and 180 days to complete the
process. The profitability associated with bringing a new device
to the market, and thus the practicality of devoting resources
to innovation, is critically dependent on the amount of time it
takes. A delay has at least three deleterious effects. First,
more venture (or internal) capital is needed to support the product
during a prolonged development phase. Second, an income stream
needed to provide an adequate return on capital is delayed. Finally,
during the delay, competitors may become established in the market
place. The European system attacks the problem of timeliness directly
by not allowing anyone to have a monopoly on approval authority.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
A basic problem in the U.S. medical device
regulatory system is that the FDA has had a legal monopoly on
approvals and, if it takes longer than what is reasonable, the
manufacturer has no alternative options. By opening up the process
to competition and allowing the manufacturer the option of choosing
which notified body to engage, the Europeans have essentially
obviated the entire problem. In addition, for many devices, especially
when certified high level quality assurance mechanisms are in
place, the manufacturer may gain additional flexibility and save
time by being allowed to self-certify that the essential requirements
have been met. This problem with timeliness of approvals probably
has been the primary reason some of our best device companies
have shifted new product development to Europe<sup><a href="foot.html">24</a></sup>. Their goal is
to obtain expeditious approval so that they can establish an early
revenue stream so as to produce a return on their large capital
investment<sup><a href="foot.html">25</a></sup>. The Wilkerson Group<sup><a href="foot.html">26</a></sup> has complied a list of 100 devices
which are currently available in other developed nations but which
are unavailable to the American patient.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The European system objective takes advantage
of <I>competitiveness</I> is two separate areas. First, the notified
bodies compete with each other on the basis of price, timeliness
and availability. Our DCB's will function in the same manner.
In addition, since a European manufacturer can engage a notified
body from another country (which was certified by that country's
authorities), there is also jurisdictional competition which acts
as a check on the government itself. If the United States and
the European Union were able to sufficiently harmonize their systems
so as to allow mutual recognition of device approvals, we would
be able to emulate that aspect of the European system.<BR>

<h3>A NEW REGULATORY REFORM PROPOSAL</h3>

<FONT >The FDA itself has publicized its efforts to
speed approvals and is investigating contracting out some of its
functions to non-governmental bodies. Devising a more reasonable
regulatory structure is made easier by the fact the European Union
has accomplished just that. Not only is their experience useful,
but bilateral trade would be facilitated if the system we adopt
is similar enough to theirs that device approval on both sides
of the Atlantic could be accomplished with minimal duplicative
effort and cost.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Alternative paths to reform which would simply
seek to curb the worst governmental abuses without fundamentally
changing the structure are inadequate. The basic 1976 law was
predicated on a device classification system based on performance
standards that were never developed. Approval of most new devices
was based on &quot;substantial equivalence&quot; to previously
approved devices. Not only was the meaning of &quot;substantial
equivalence&quot; never adequately defined, but the entire concept
of similarity with predicate devices must, by necessity, break
down over time as technology advances and the thread of similarity
with older devices becomes weaker. It is as if the space shuttle
was to be approved based on its substantial equivalence with an
ox cart. Finally, faced with the lack of objective criteria for
action, the FDA has become, at best, a cautious and ponderous
bureaucracy. This was predictable and no amount of cosmetic reform
will change the forces which have caused this bureaucratic evolution.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The new European Union medical device regulatory
system offers a more rational structure. The EU system has been
in full effect since 1992 for the most complex and risky medical
devices, active implantables; since the beginning of 1995 for
other medical devices; and is soon to be phased in for <I>in vitro</I>
diagnostic devices. U.S. manufactures have gained experience with
the EU system through two mechanisms. First, many U.S. companies
export to Europe and are thus fully subject to the EU system.
In response, the European notified bodies are well represented
in the United States. More fundamentally, over the years, American
professional organizations have been very active in publishing
standards which ultimately have become the international standards
that form the basis of the EU system. This includes both the thousands
of narrowly defined standards that guide details of design and
also more fundamental standards, such as the ISO 9000 series,
which form the basis of modern quality control systems. In fact
most major American medical device manufacturers either have obtained
or are in the process of obtaining ISO 9000 (series) certification.
Full ISO 9000 certification is significantly more comprehensive
than the GMP regulations currently administered by the FDA as
it includes a quality control system for the design process itself.
Full conformity with these standards, frequently reconfirmed,
allows medical device companies subject to the EU system the authority
to self-certify new products of moderate complexity. This then
allows a very rapid design-marketing cycle, so important to facilitate
the incremental nature of medical device innovation. Because of
the familiarity of American manufacturers with both the EU system
and the standards upon which it is based, it should be possible
for the United States to make a rapid transition to this more
rational and modern system of medical device approval. No doubt
there would have to be a transition period with both the old and
the new approval systems available, especially for devices already
in the approval process. In addition it would seem prudent, at
least until the new system is well established in this country
for the FDA to be notified of each DCB Class III device approval
sufficiently in advance of marketing (90 days) to allow confirmation
that the appropriate standards had been used.  Since the FDA is
a member of international standards organizations, this would
have the further advantage of providing information useful in
drafting new standards. Figures 1 and 2 compare our current approval
process and the proposed replacement approval process.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<IMG SRC="IMG00017.GIF"><IMG SRC="IMG00018.GIF"><FONT >Adapting
the EU system of device approvals essentially privatizes two important
functions of the FDA: device approvals and GMP (quality assurance)
inspections. There are other FDA functions that need to be considered.
In the EU system, the health authorities of each individual county
have five major functions. They have the responsibility and authority
to license the notified bodies. This is done in reference to internationally
agreed upon standards. Two, administer a post-marketing &quot;vigilance&quot;
system that monitors unexpected failures and adverse effects of
the products. Three, have the authority to remove products from
the market which prove to be out of conformity with the essential
requirements. Four, are responsible for controlling the safety
of human subjects in clinical investigations. Finally, they have
investigative authority and serve to keep the system honest. One
defining characteristic of the EU system is that the manufacturer,
not the government, is primarily responsible for the safety and
effectiveness of their product. The private notified body is a
check on the manufacturer and is in the tradition of a testing
laboratory. The government health authority polices the system.
Most importantly, although the manufacturer must demonstrate (to
the satisfaction of the notified body) that the device is as safe
as is practical according to the state of the art and that it
functions effectively as claimed on its labeling and in its instruction
manual, the final judgement as to relative clinical benefit and
risk is left to the practice of medicine and to those forces which
regulate it.<sup><a href="foot.html">27</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >With a few limitations, a reformed U.S. system
should follow this outline. The FDA's current vigilance system
for medical devices is so overwhelmed with data that it has been
of little use. Since manufacturers already are required to collect
and analyze data concerning device malfunctions and adverse effects,
it would seem reasonable for the manufacturer to have the opportunity
to do the preliminary analysis and pass onto the FDA only those
reports where there is a reasonable possibility that there was
a device problem<sup><a href="foot.html">28</a></sup>. The manufacturer would, of course, have to maintain
records of all reports and their analysis for inspection by their
DCB (and in the case of concern, by the FDA). The FDA, as the
recipient of data from all manufacturers could then perform the
important function of correlating adverse reports concerning the
same type of product produced by several different manufacturers.
It also would be able to monitor individual manufacturer's response
to reports concerning their own devices. In addition the FDA would
be in a position to exchange information with the European Union
authorities. This might facilitate the handling of adverse events
that are so rare that data from multiple countries are needed.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In the United States, Institutional Review
Boards, especially those in the academic health centers, have
generally functioned well to both protect the interests of patients
and subjects and to facilitate research. However, it would be
reasonable for the FDA to function as a repository of data concerning
all adverse events during clinical investigations, as such a national
clearing house with access to data from many sites might facilitate
the early detection of rare events.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >With these few modifications, a reformed American
medical device regulatory system would closely follow the EU model.
The FDA would become a smaller, better focused organization with
many of their functions assumed by organizations in the private
sector.<BR>

<h2>IV. Regulatory Reform and Liability for Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices</h2>
by W. Kip Viscusi<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT >EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >Tort liability for the pharmaceutical and medical
device industry has been almost synonymous with the liability
crisis.  Notwithstanding the substantial level of government regulation
in these industries, firms have been the subject of major lines
of litigation, such as those involving DES and the Dalkon Shield.
 In terms of the total number of liability cases as well as the
share of liability costs relative to industry sales, the pharmaceutical
industry has been a major focal point of the liability burden.
 These costs have been disproportionate to the overall role of
the pharmaceutical and medical device industries in the economy,
as they have suffered in large part because their products are
intrinsically involved in life and death situations.  The result
is that these liability costs have substantially discouraged new
product innovation.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The extent of this liability is also surprising
in view of the already substantial role of government intervention
affecting pharmaceuticals and medical devices.  Pharmaceutical
products must undergo an extensive FDA review both in terms of
the character of the product and the wording of the hazard warning.
 Medical devices are also subject to Federal regulation as well
as the pre-emption provisions that should presumably limit tort
liability.  At the current time, there fails to be adequate recognition
on the part of the courts of the role played by government regulation
in insuring efficient levels of safety.  In recognition of this
government activity, this paper proposes a regulatory compliance
defense for all pharmaceutical and medical device product liability,
not simply a defense against punitive damages.  This proposal
would create a more even-handed treatment of pharmaceutical products
and medical devices.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The proposals to revamp the FDA drug and device
approval process would not limit the applicability of these proposals.
 So long as an institutional mechanism insuring an efficient level
of product safety was provided to consumers, there would be no
need to second guess these administrative reviews by the courts.
 Thus, the regulatory compliance defense would simply be a recognition
that there has already been government certification and that
the company has fulfilled its requirements with respect to the
provision of products that provide an adequate level of safety.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >A different legal issue related to the proposal
is the ultimate liability of the Dug and Device Certifying Bodies
that would work in conjunction with the FDA as part of the revised
regulatory process.  Potential liability for negligence in carrying
out its obligations or for breaking contractual obligations to
manufacturers should be permitted to promote responsible operation
of these groups.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >However, it is also essential to formalize
the current recognition by the courts that such certification
bodies should not be subject to strict liability to third parties
injured by products.  Otherwise, particularly in contexts of joint
and several liability, many quite responsible institutions would
be reluctant to enter the certification market for fear that their
very existence would be threatened by tort liability suits that
might even be completely unrelated to the manner in which they
carried out their obligations.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >INTRODUCTION<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >The pharmaceutical and medical device industries
are one of the principal targets of tort liability litigation.
 Lawsuits against the firms in their industries have long been
among the most prominent liability cases.  Moreover, if we exclude
asbestos and Agent Orange, the pharmaceutical industry has been
by far the leading industry with respect to mass toxic torts.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The prominent role of the pharmaceutical industry
and medical device industries are not a reflection of corporate
irresponsibility.  Rather, the nature of the products produced
by these industries are intrinsically involved in individual health
and in the treatment of patients, many of whom will experience
adverse outcomes and even death during the course of their treatment.
 This locus of the product's use, coupled with the stringent nature
of liability standards, has led to a substantial liability burden
that many observers view as unproductive.  For example, the National
Academy of Sciences concluded that high product liability costs
were largely responsible for shutting down American research with
respect to contraceptives<sup><a href="foot.html">1</a></sup>.  These costs eliminated research not
because the research was in any sense socially undesirable, but
because firms incurred costs whenever the research led to products
linked to the hazards associated with childbirth.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The substantial tort liability burden is particularly
striking in that it has been coupled with a situation in which
the pharmaceutical industry itself is highly regulated.  The particular
products sold are subject to highly stringent regulations with
respect to their safety and efficacy.  This pre-market approval
process is much more extensive than, for example, regulations
for automobiles or other consumer products that generate considerable
risks.  Indeed, many observers have suggested that pharmaceuticals
are overregulated because of the excessive weight placed on the
potential adverse effects of these products.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The high degree of regulation of pharmaceuticals
is inconsistent with a high tort liability exposure if the objective
of tort liability is to address inadequacies in the provision
of product safety.  The purpose of this paper is to indicate how
the tort liability system should be restructured to better reflect
the obligations that pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers
have already met to through their compliance with government regulations.
 <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This paper will explore how the tort liability
system functions and the rationale for the current structure.
 There is currently only minimal recognition of a regulatory compliance
defense for prescription drugs.  In the case of medical devices,
there is a legislative pre-emption that eliminates the threat
of tort liability.  Most Federal liability reform proposals have
only suggested limited regulatory compliance defenses for prescription
drugs, particularly with respect to punitive damages.  This paper
will suggest that these defenses should in fact be much broader
and should pertain to overall liability for drugs and devices
given regulatory approval, and not simply punitive damages.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Although the current FDA regulatory program
provides the institutional reference point, the proposals suggested
here are quite general.  The principal requirements that should
accompany any regulatory compliance defense are that any revision
of the FDA drug and medical device approval process maintain the
current safety standards and continue to establish a uniform warnings
vocabulary.  Provided that these two conditions are met, the rationales
for these proposals will be quite robust with respect to different
institutional structures. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >The Importance of Pharmaceutical and Medical
Device Litigation</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT > </FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Product liability litigation against the pharmaceutical
and medical device industries has been considerable.  Notwithstanding
the rigorous regulatory review given to these products, plaintiffs
are often successful in obtaining recoveries for product-related
injuries.  Some of the biggest lines of litigation have involved
these products.  As of 1990, for example, there were 210,000 Dalkon
Shield personal injury claimants, 200,000 claimants against DES,
200,000 claimants against Bendectin, and 500 claimants involving
tampons<sup><a href="foot.html">2</a></sup>.  More recently, the breast implant litigation has led
to the establishment of a trust fund of over $4 billion to cover
potential losses.  This section will provide a brief overview
of some of the liability trends for the pharmaceutical industry<sup><a href="foot.html">3</a></sup>
and an assessment of the extent to which these litigation levels
exceed that for other industries.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >To explore these issues, this section will
focus on data for federal product liability cases developed by
the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.  This data
base makes it possible to track liability suits and awards for
cases in the Federal Courts.  Omitted from this tally will be
out of court settlements as well as cases resolved in state courts.
 This omission consequently will lead to a substantial understatement
of the overall level of product liability costs for the pharmaceutical
and medical device industry.  Moreover, to the extent that companies
are increasingly relying on out-of-court settlements to resolve
liability cost issues, as is evidenced in the establishment of
the breast implant compensation fund, there will be diminished
litigation.  This change in litigation strategies will create
a deceptive impression of the overall liability burden.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Figure 1 provides a profile of the number of
federal product liability cases for manufacturing industries<sup><a href="foot.html">4</a></sup> excluding
pharmaceuticals and for the pharmaceutical industry.  What is
striking about the case trends in Figure 1 is that the pharmaceutical
industry liability is often half or more that of the entire remaining
manufacturing sector of the economy.  In 1985 the number of pharmaceutical
industry cases in the Federal Courts was about double that of
all other manufacturing industries.  This tremendous liability
burden is dispro-portionate to the output share of pharmaceuticals.
 The remaining manufacturing sector excluding the pharmaceutical
industry had a dollar value of shipments that was much larger
than that of the pharmaceutical industry in 1989.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >To fully assess the extent of the liability
burden, one needs to know not only the number of cases filed but
also whether these cases are successful and what award was paid.
 The measure that will be used to assess the extent of pharmaceutical
industry liability will be the relative liability burden given
the scale of the industry.  In particular, Figure 2 provides a
profile of the ratio of the annual product liability awards to
the total sales both for pharmaceuticals as well as the remaining
manufacturing industry.  What is striking is that except in two
years in which the liability awards were unusually low, 1979 and
1989, the level of the relative liability burden was considerably
greater for the pharmaceutical industry than for the rest of the
manufacturing sector.  In the years of the greatest crisis in
tort liability from 1982 to 1986 the level of the liability burden
dwarfed that for the manufacturing sector.  Although the level
of liability awards in the Federal Courts declined after 1986,
even in 1987 and 1988 the relative liability burden for manufacturing
was considerably less than that for pharmaceuticals.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >When viewed in absolute terms, the extent of
the liability burden may not appear to be great.  For example,
even in the highest year of relative liability costs, 1986, the
federal product liability award percentage of sales was only 0.05
percent for pharmaceuticals.  However, the award percentage relative
to the profits of the firm is much greater.  Even more important
is that the federal product liability awards only should be used
as an index of the relative liability burden not as an indication
of the total extent of the liability costs.  Even for the Federal
suits, the out-of-pocket legal expenses and defense costs will
not be included in this tally.  An additional omission is that
cases settled out of court and all cases resolved in state courts
likewise will not be reflected in these data.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The basic message of Figures 1 and 2 is that
pharmaceutical liability has typically far outdistanced that of
other manufacturing industries, relative to its share of industrial
activity.  One hypothesis is that these products are more likely
to be defective and to cause injury than are other manufacturing
products.  However, it is noteworthy that the premarket review
and ongoing monitoring of the performance of pharmaceutical and
medical devices is much more vigorous than for any other major
product group.  The subsequent sections will explore this inconsistency
and examine the nature of the criteria applied by regulatory agencies.
 What will be particularly striking is that the same types of
criteria applied by the courts are mirrored in the regulatory
guidelines.  In effect, juries are second guessing decisions made
by the FDA on a prospective basis and are awarding substantial
verdicts to plaintiffs ex post even in instances in which the
Federal regulatory requirements were fulfilled.<BR>

<h3>The Current Regulatory Structure
and Its Implications for Tort Liability</h3>
<P>
The current role of the government with respect
to pharmaceuticals and medical devices is twofold.  First, the
government reviews these products to ensure their safety and efficacy.
 Second, the government plays an informational role in establishing
the kinds of information that can be conveyed with respect to
the characteristics of these products and the associated risks.
 The discussion below will consider the role of regulatory compliance
defense with respect to each of these aspects of government regulation.
<BR>
<P>
<b>Pre-Market Approval of Pharmaceuticals<BR>
</b>

<P>
The first phase of government regulation of
the products is a determination of which pharmaceutical products
are permitted to be marketed.  The first stage of this process
typically involves the submission of an investigational new drug
application to conduct trials for a new drug.  The legal requirements
for this application require that the company provide information
with respect to the chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, and results
of animal and laboratory testing.<sup><a href="foot.html">5</a></sup>  These trials may then begin
provided the FDA does not either request more information or modify
the protocol submitted by the company for the proposed clinical
trials.  From a practical standpoint, the nature of the protocols
are often dictated by the FDA.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The clinical trial process consists of three
phases.  Phase one trials are designed to elicit information about
&quot;the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drugs in
humans, [and] the side effects associated with increasing doses.&quot;<sup><a href="foot.html">6</a></sup>
These tests are also intended to provide information pertaining
to the product's safety.  These phase one trials typically involve
tests on a small number of healthy adults- approximately 20-80
people.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
If the phase one trials are successful, the
company proceeds to undertake phase two trials, which typically
involve testing the drug on 200-300 people who have the specific
disease or condition for which the product is targeted.  The phase
two trials are &quot;conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of
the drug for a particular indication or indications in patients
with the disease or condition under study.&quot;<sup><a href="foot.html">7</a></sup>  In addition,
these trials are intended to assess whether there are adverse
side effects associated with the drug.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
If the phase two trials are also successful,
the company proceeds to the phase three clinical trials involving
1,000 - 3,000 patients who also have the specific condition or
disease for which the drug is targeted.<sup><a href="foot.html">8</a></sup>  As the phase three trials
reach conclusion, the company submits a new drug application (NDA)
to the FDA to obtain permission to sell the pharmaceutical product.
 This application must include both safety and efficacy information,
and it is a compendium of all the available data obtained thus
far regarding the performance of the drugs with respect to these
two objectives.  In addition, the NDA must include information
pertaining to the proposed labeling for the new drug.<sup><a href="foot.html">9</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
In evaluating the NDA, the FDA must ensure
that the product complies with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act (FDCA) requirements pertaining to safety, and that &quot;substantial
evidence&quot; of efficacy be demonstrated.  This stage of the
drug approval process is often quite lengthy, as the FDA review
often takes years after the submission of the NDA.  In many cases
these delays arise because the FDA requests new information from
the pharmaceutical company.  Overall, the NDA process takes between
five to seven years and involves a cost that has been estimated
to be as high as $231 million for each NDA.<sup><a href="foot.html">10</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
An additional cost of the drug lag is that
patients in the United States will be deprived of drugs that potentially
could reduce mortality and morbidity.  There are thus two types
of competing errors known as Type I and Type II errors that could
arise with respect to the approval of new drugs.  The FDA might
approve drugs that turn out to have adverse consequences such
as thalidomide, which was approved in Great Britain but never
approved for use in the United States.  On the other hand, the
FDA could fail to approve drugs that are beneficial and would
have reduced risks because of excessively stringent safety standards.
 Many academic critics of the FDA have charged that the FDA has
erred too greatly on the side of preventing errors of commission
rather than being concerned with the risks that would be averted
by the new drugs that it fails to approve.<sup><a href="foot.html">11</a></sup>  The AIDS lobbyists
have called particular attention to the effect of these substantial
delays as well as the imbalance in attention that the FDA places
on errors of commission as opposed to errors of omission.  This
special disease interest lobbying group has succeeded in expediting
the review process for AIDS-related drugs.  Other potential beneficiaries
of drugs that are delayed by the lengthy review process are not
as well organized and are not as effective in bringing political
pressure to bear to make the FDA more responsive to the patients
who could benefit from these new products.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The primary implication of this stringent drug
approval process for the regulatory compliance defense is that
the current concern with the potential safety of new drugs is
already quite substantial.  Indeed, from an economic efficiency
standpoint, one might well argue that the FDA places excessive
reliance on safety, particularly on the safety aspects pertaining
to adverse effects that might be created by drugs.  All that is
needed for purposes of the subsequent discussion of the regulatory
compliance defense is the general result that the FDA procedures
or privately operated procedures will ensure adequate levels of
safety.  These tests will fulfill a company's obligation to provide
an efficient level of safety associated with its products. <BR>
<P>
<b>Regulation of Drug Labeling<BR>
</b>

<P>
Prescription drugs by their very nature pose
potential risks either from misuse or adverse reactions, which
leads to the prescription requirement.  Medical devices also pose
potential risks of a similar nature.  As a result, the FDA requires
that information pertaining to the associated risks be provided
with these products.  In the case of pharmaceutical products,
the warning label must communicate both the overall risk associated
with the product as well as any specific risks associated with
particular groups of product users.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Under the regulatory system established by
the FDCA, the FDA is largely responsible for writing the complete
content of the package inserts<sup><a href="foot.html">12</a></sup> that accompany pharmaceutical products.
 One former FDA General Counsel observed that the &quot;FDA ...
retains, as a practical matter, complete control over package
inserts.&quot;  Unlike the warnings practices under the OSHA hazard
communications standard or EPA labeling requirements for pesticides,
the FDA has both substantial control of the content of the warnings
as well as the warning structure.  In particular, the FDA has
in place a standardized warnings vocabulary that is used to communicate
the risks associated with the drugs.  This vocabulary stipulates
which kinds of information are presented in different places on
the label as well as how different variations in the label, such
as boxing of warnings or larger print, should be used to highlight
specific warnings.  Because of the standardized warnings approach
and the fact that physicians receive training in the processing
of such warning information in pharmacology courses, this system
provides an efficient means of communicating risk information
to the learned intermediary involved in prescribing pharmaceutical
products.  The fact that it is not the patient, but rather the
physician (learned intermediary) who is the target audience for
the warnings greatly affects the character and content of the
warnings message.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The FDA does not develop the warnings language
in isolation.  Rather, the manufacturer is required to submit
to the FDA information pertaining to both the safety and the efficacy
of the product as part of its NDA.  In addition, the manufacturer
must submit proposed labeling for the drug for the FDA review.<sup><a href="foot.html">13</a></sup>
 In conjunction with the manufacturer, the FDA develops the initial
label for the drug.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
There is often a bargaining process between
the FDA and the manufacturer over the content of the warning label.
 The FDA has the ultimate authority since approval of the labeling
is a necessary part of the NDA approval process.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The structure of the warnings vocabulary developed
by the FDA consists of the following sections.  The first section
of the warning label provides information that describes the general
characteristics of the product.<sup><a href="foot.html">14</a></sup>  The second section of the warning
label consists of information pertaining to the clinical pharmacology
of the product, whereby the warning provides information pertaining
to how the particular product operates.  The third section of
the label provides information pertaining to the indications and
the usage of the drug, and this is followed by a contraindications
section indicating the situations under which the drug should
not be administered because of the particular risks that may be
involved.  This section is followed by a warnings section that
details the risks that arise both generally as well as in specific
situations with respect to the drug.  Less frequently occurring
risks are the subject of the precautions section.  Isolated and
more random reactions to the drug are the subject of the adverse
reactions section.  Following this series of risk information
sections, the warning concludes with information about the appropriate
dosage and administration of the product.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The standardized structure of this warnings
vocabulary greatly facilitates the ability of the physician to
process the warnings information.  The FDA also ensures a uniformity
in the use of the warnings language and a correspondence between
the language and the severity of the particular outcomes being
characterized.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
This kind of standardization could be generalized
to contexts in which the FDA did not have the authority to control
and review warnings but instead established as a reference point
a warnings vocabulary framework.  Thus, companies could provide
information with respect to a drug following these guidelines
for the positioning of information and guidelines with respect
to the usage of labeling variations such as boxing of particular
warning sections.  Liability for the company could then be based
on whether the company adhered to the particular warnings vocabulary
guidelines given the characteristics of the product.  Thus, in
our subsequent discussion of the regulatory compliance defense,
no distinction will be made between a warnings policy mandated
by the FDA or a warnings policy based on guidelines established
by the FDA.  It must, however, by recognized that there may be
an additional liability exposure if the FDA does not operate and
specifically approve the warning since then the company must show
that this warning did in fact adhere to the regulatory guidelines.
<BR>
<P>
<b>Post-Marketing Information<BR>
</b>

<P>
After a drug is made available for sale, there
may be adverse consequences that are observed that were not apparent
during the testing process.  If these problems are particularly
severe, it may be appropriate to withdraw the drug from the market.
 Thus, the safety of the drug should be a continuing concern.
 Similarly, if there are adverse consequences associated with
the drug that were not included in the initial labeling, the hazard
information provided should be amended over time to reflect this
changing informational state.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
In each case the appropriate reference point
for whether a firm has met its obligation should be the state
of the information at that particular time.  Moreover, because
adverse reactions and effects of drugs are often the subject of
speculation involving small samples, there must be some test of
the scientific validity of the adverse information before companies
should be held responsible for incorporating it in the drug evaluation
process.  A patient administered a drug for a particular ailment
may experience some adverse health effect.  However, in the absence
of a controlled experiment, it is not possible to ascertain whether
this effect is a consequence of the drug or a random variation
in health status that would have occurred if the drug had not
been administered.  The medical literature is replete with possible
adverse effects of this kind.  Some of these are subsequently
bolstered by scientific data, and others prove to be aberrations
that are never established in the literature.  In retrospect,
it is often possible to point to instances in which there was
initial fragmentary evidence regarding an adverse effect that
is ultimately established, but what is important is whether the
information available at any particular point in time is sufficient
to provide a reason for concern.  Effects that appear clearcut
in hindsight may not be evident given the state of information
at an earlier time.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
In that regard, the FDCA requires that the
pharmaceutical companies share with the FDA information pertaining
to the post-marketing performance of the drug.  This surveillance
process requires that the company report adverse experiences associated
with the drug as well as epidemiologic studies.  The current requirements
are that a company must report any serious reactions to a drug
to the FDA within 15 working days of the receipt of the information.<sup><a href="foot.html">15</a></sup>
 The sources of information that the manufacturer must examine
for these post-marketing studies include clinical, epidemiological,
or surveillance studies, as well as information that appears in
the medical literature.  The FDA then uses that information to
assess whether the drug should continue to be marketed or whether
there should be some change in the labeling for it.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
These provisions ensure the safety of drugs
and the appropriateness of information provision.  Regulation
is consequently an ongoing process that continues to reflect the
evolving state of information with respect to the drug.  Under
the current procedures, the FDA must approve any post-marketing
changes associated with the labeling of the drug, although a company
is free to withdraw a drug from the market should it choose to
do so.<sup><a href="foot.html">16</a></sup>  However, if the company does take such unilateral action,
it must simultaneously seek FDA approval for it, and if the FDA
does not approve the change it can institute a regulatory action
against the company.  Moreover, the FDA can overrule the company's
decision to change the warning label if it believes that such
a change would be inappropriate.  <BR>

<h3>The Role of Tort Law</h3>
<P>
<FONT >By imposing costs on the tortfeasor, the liability
system generates both incentives for efficient risk avoidance
as well as compensation for accident victims.  In the case of
monetary losses, both strict liability and negligence standards
will lead to an efficient level of precautions and will lead to
an optimal level of compensation for the accident victim.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Matters become somewhat different in the case
of health effects.  It is very difficult to compensate an individual
for an extreme loss of health status, such as one's life, since
finite amounts of compensation may not make one whole.  The amount
of compensation that would be needed to generate efficient incentives
would be quite large.  An efficient level of damages from a deterrence
standpoint would provide adequate financial incentive to lead
the manufacture to sell products that had an optimal level of
safety when valued using the preferences for safety of the consumer.
 How, for example, do the values of greater safety compare with
the higher cost levels of safer products?  For example, evidence
on the implicit value of life that is appropriate from the standpoint
of deterring risks is $5 million per life.  However, this amount
is not an appropriate guide for insurance and compensation.  Few
individuals would choose to purchase an insurance policy that
would make a payoff of this size in the event of their death.
 As a result, compensation amounts of this magnitude would provide
efficient incentives for deterrence but would provide excessive
insurance.  Consequently, one could view the current tort system
as somewhat split in that the amount of compensation is more closely
linked to the optimal insurance amount, such as the present value
of lost earnings, medical costs, and some compensation for pain
and suffering.  In contrast, the criteria for liability are linked
to generating efficient standards for safety.  Thus, the firm's
obligation is to provide an adequate level of safety for the good,
where this level of adequacy is what would prevail if a good were
traded in a fully functioning and efficient market.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The responsibilities of tort liability to provide
incentives for safety and compensation to accident victims depend
of course on the other societal institutions in place.  If, for
example, an individual at risk were compensated through the workers'
compensation system, there would be less need for compensation
through the tort liability system.  Similarly, if the risk level
and the adequacy of warnings is handled through a regulatory structure
that ensures an efficient level of precautions, then there is
no rationale from the standpoint of adequate deterrence for having
tort liability.  Thus, to the extent that the FDA regulations
achieve the social objective of efficient levels of control of
risk, then there is no need to duplicate this function through
additional tort liability.  The obvious exception is that in which
the company withholds critical information from the regulatory
agency so that the regulation cannot be set in an ideal manner.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Government regulations can of course be set
either too leniently or too stringently.  The fact that there
is a government regulation does not necessarily imply that there
is no role for any supplementary social institution, such as tort
liability.  However, in the case of the FDA, the general consensus
is that these regulations are certainly adequate in ensuring safety
and, to the extent that there is any divergence from optimality,
it is that the regulations are excessively stringent with respect
to the promotion of product safety.  If there is already over-deterrence,
there is consequently no rationale for bolstering of the level
of deterrence additionally through incentives provided through
tort liability.  This consideration pertains to the deterrence
or incentive role of tort liability, not necessarily to the compensation
function since regulations do not provide for the compensation
of accident victims.  However, at least from the standpoint of
safety incentives, the optimal use of regulations is to target
them in areas where there are clearly inadequate safety incentives
provided.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There is a widespread consensus in the literature
that the current FDA drug approval process establishes safety
incentives that are excessive.<sup><a href="foot.html">17</a></sup>  The stringency of the process
and the meticulous review of new pharmaceutical drugs is reflected
in the substantial delays that U.S. consumers have experienced
with respect to the introduction of new pharmaceutical products.
 These delays are much greater than in other countries, such as
those in Europe, which also have regulatory procedures to ensure
drug safety.  Studies have also shown that because of these delays
Americans have been prevented from having access to new drugs
with beneficial effects, as the agency places a greater weight
on errors of commission rather than errors of omission.  This
imbalance in the emphasis for these two types of errors has led
to excessive deterrence of new risks that may be created by pharmaceutical
products and inadequate weight on reducing existing risks that
patients now experience.  Because these incentives already ensure
a degree of caution and safety with respect to introducing new
pharmaceutical products that is already excessive, one would not
want to further deter companies from introducing beneficial new
products through additional tort liability sanctions.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >One possible counterargument is that after
the drug is approved it may turn out to have adverse effects that
were not anticipated.  However, the task regarding the safety
and efficacy of the product is to make the best judgement that
is possible at the time the product is marketed.  If new information
becomes available to indicate that the product is riskier than
was initially believed, then the company should be held responsible
for acting upon this new information in a reasonable manner and
developing new labeling if necessary.  This way of dealing with
new information is the approach taken in Europe with respect to
medical devices in which companies have a &quot;development-risk&quot;
defense.  Companies are free of liability in the tort liability
regime in all EU countries other than Luxembourg if they can show
that the &quot;state of scientific and technical knowledge at
the time when he put the product into circulation was not such
as to enable the existence of the defect to be discovered.&quot;
 This state of the information defense coupled with a requirement
that companies meet the regulatory standards would ensure than
an efficient degree of product safety be provided both at the
time of the product's introduction as well as throughout the product's
life.  Once this has been assured, there is no additional rationale
for augmenting these safety incentives, at least from the standpoint
of risk prevention.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Off-label uses and their relation to a regulatory
compliance defense is an important issue.  The restrictions that
are pertinent for advertising drugs for off-label usage are now
quite stringent<sup><a href="foot.html">18</a></sup>.  For example, in the case of investigational
new drugs that are currently undergoing clinical study, it is
not possible to promote the drug for the usage that is currently
under scrutiny.  Notwithstanding these restrictions on the promotion
of pharmaceutical products, it is generally believed that off-label
usage are quite prevalent, particularly in the cases of AIDS and
cancer treatments.  Much of pediatric age group drug use is also
off-label.  One survey suggested that nearly one-third of the
prescriptions of oncologists for cancer patients were for off-label
usage.  In addition, an estimated 56 percent of cancer patients
have received at least one drug under an off-label purpose.  
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The degree to which there is insurance reimbursement
for off-label usages depends in large part on the nature of the
experimental treatment and the existence of medical evidence supporting
its reliability.  Many off-label treatments for cancer, for example,
are not reimbursed.  Approximately one-half of 681 oncologists
surveyed by the U.S. General Accounting Office reported that at
some point they had been denied reimbursement for the costs of
an off-label prescription<sup><a href="foot.html">19</a></sup>.  That same U.S. General Accounting
Office survey also found that one-third of all the prescriptions
involving cancer chemotherapy involved off-label uses.  Among
the most controversial reimbursements for off-label usage has
been the insurance coverage for the high dose chemotherapy-autologous
bone marrow transplants, which is an expensive and risky treatment.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Strict adherents to regulatory criteria might
speculate that all off-label uses are inappropriate and should
not be undertaken since they have not been accorded FDA approval.
 However, in many instances the opposite conclusion has been reached.<sup><a href="foot.html">20</a></sup>
 The courts have ruled, for example, that Medicaid coverage could
not exclude AZT therapy for an off-label purpose for some classes
of AIDS patients.  Similarly, the courts have ruled that Blue
Cross-Blue Shield must reimburse high dose chemotherapy-autologous
bone marrow transplants.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >As Christopher (1993) notes, the nature of
the New York legal provisions with respect to off-label usage
is quite complex: &quot;New York forbids insurers from excluding
coverage of off-label uses of cancer drugs if: (1) prescription
drugs are otherwise covered in the policy; (2) the drug is FDA-approved
for some form of cancer; and (3) the off-label use in question
is recognized by one of the three compendia or recommended by
review article or editorial comment in a major peer-reviewed journal.&quot;
 However, he goes on to note that: &quot;The New York law, however,
allows insurers to exclude from coverage off-label uses expressly
contraindicated by FDA-approved labelling and experimental or</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >investigational drugs.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The nature of the regulatory compliance defense
is somewhat complicated by the use of drugs for off-label purposes.
 The regulatory criteria and the assurance that the drug has met
efficient standards for safety only pertains to uses for which
the drug has been specifically approved, or those uses specified
on the label.  In the case of off-label uses, there has not been
the same kind of review and approval that would provide an ex
ante guarantee that the firm has met its obligations with respect
to safety and efficacy for these uses.  As a result, in the case
of the off-label uses the regulatory compliance defense that is
advocated here would not be pertinent.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The practical consequences of this distinction
for off-label uses may be substantial.  It has been estimated
that about half of all drugs prescribed by doctors are given for
off-label uses because the drug is believed to be effective for
these off-label purposes.  At a fairly pedestrian level, one has
doctors prescribing Retin-A for middle aged patients who wish
to eliminate wrinkles even though this is not an on-label purpose
of this anti-acne drug.  Perhaps more importantly in terms of
individual welfare is that many cancer treatments involve off-label
uses of drugs.  At present there are no requirements that physicians
disclose to patients that the particular therapy being prescribed
is an off-label usage.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Whereas there is currently no regulatory compliance
defense in the case of pharmaceuticals, in the case of medical
devices, the 1976 Medical Devices Amendments pre-empted liability
claims against medical devices.  Pre-emption is stronger than
a regulatory compliance defense in that it forecloses all product
liability suits.  The 1995 case of <U>Michael v. Shiley, Inc.</U>
found that these Amendments pre-empted all liability actions involving
negligence, strict liability, and breech of warranty for medical
devices.<sup><a href="foot.html">21</a></sup>  This pre-emption includes all medical devices, not simply
the class III medical devices that are subject to the formal FDA
pre-market approval process.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The main exception to such broad interpretations
of the regulatory compliance defense was the recent decision by
the Ninth Circuit in <U>Kennedy v. Collagen Corp</U><sup><a href="foot.html">22</a></sup>.  In this
case, the court upheld pre-emption only when the FDA had enacted
&quot;specific counterpart requirements&quot; applicable to the
device.  Since the court viewed the pre-market approval process
for Class III devices as not constituting a Federal &quot;requirement,&quot;
the scope of the pre-emption would be severely restricted<sup><a href="foot.html">23</a></sup>.  To
date, this decision remains the exception, as other courts have
interpreted the exemption provisions quite broadly.<BR>
</FONT>
<P><b>Punitive Damages<BR>
</b>

<P>
<FONT >The role of the regulatory compliance defense
has been most prominent with respect to punitive damages rather
than with respect to the overall liability of pharmaceutical and
medical device firms.  Although it will be suggested below that
regulatory compliance should be a defense with respect to all
tort liability, it is even more compelling that punitive damages
are not warranted if a firm has fulfilled all of its regulatory
obligations and has not withheld information from the regulatory
agency.  Groups such as the American Law Institute (1991) have
indicated that abolition of punitive damages in such instances
of regulatory compliance is a particularly desirable reform.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >To see why punitive damages reforms head the
list of necessary changes in tort law, let us examine the circumstances
under which punitive damages above and beyond compensatory damages
are awarded and why these damages are not pertinent when pharmaceutical
and medical device companies have complied with government regulations.
 One rationale for punitive damages may be that compensatory damages
alone do not provide adequate deterrence when life and health
are at risk.  This argument is certainly correct from an economic
standpoint, but the role of optimal deterrence will have already
been addressed through regulatory compliance.  If a firm has already
met regulatory standards that ensure a level of safety that is
either efficient or is a more stringent safety level than dictated
by economic efficiency concerns, then there is no additional economic
rationale for punitive damages to augment the safety requirements.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >A second rationale for punitive damages is
that they would be warranted if the company's safety efforts fell
well below what was required to provide an efficient level of
safety with respect to the product.  If a firm has not met the
requirements stipulated by the regulation, then certainly punitive
damages may be warranted.  However, if all the regulatory stipulations
with respect to testing and information provision have been met,
then it is not possible that a company's safety efforts could
have fallen greatly below what should be expected since these
expectations are already set out through the regulatory guidelines.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This kind of regulatory compliance defense
may not be warranted with respect to every form of government
regulation.  However, the FDA regulations for pharmaceuticals
differ both in their nature and their stringency.  The distinctive
character of pharmaceutical regulations is that they are extremely
meticulous regulations that entail the premarket review of the
product, extensive testing of the product, a determination of
the safety and efficacy of the product, a provision of risk information
through a procedure that conforms with a highly structured warnings
vocabulary, and post-market surveillance.  These stipulations
certainly go well beyond what might be envisioned by a jury in
any particular case. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Another possible objective of punitive damages
is compensation.  However, this objective should already have
been adequately handled by the compensatory aspect of damages.
 The standard components of tort liability are designed to address
the efficient levels of compensation needed by accident victims.
 If, for example, the courts were to routinely award punitive
damages, this practice would not even be in the interest of consumers
of these products.  Higher liability costs will raise the cost
of producing the product, which in turn will raise the product
price.  In effect, purchasers of a product will be paying for
the higher punitive damage awards through more expensive products.<sup><a href="foot.html">24</a></sup>
 Payments of this type are desirable in the case of compensatory
damages that replicate the kinds of insurance that individuals
would have purchased freely.  However, if individuals would not
have purchased insurance to provide for the kinds of compensation
associated with punitive damages, then in effect, a liability
regime that imposes excessive punitive damages will have forced
customers to buy more insurance for their accident losses than
they would have chosen to provide for themselves if they could
have designed such an insurance mechanism.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >A final objective of punitive damages might
be that of retribution.  Although additional penalties on a firm
do serve as a form of retributive punishment, one must also inquire
whose interest such punishment promotes.  If adequate deterrence
and safety incentives are already ensured, retributive punishment
is not needed.  From the standpoint of the consumers of the product,
retributive punishment will not be in their interests if the higher
product price that they must pay for the litigated products reflects
the added costs imposed by such retribution.  Although there may
be instances in which customers will be willing to pay higher
prices for products to know that damages will be assessed to punish
companies, one would expect that such willingness would be associated
with flagrant disregards of safety.  If the company in fact met
regulatory guidelines for efficient provision of safe products,
then there should be little support for retributive punishment
such as this.  If there were such support, then that presumably
would be an indication of a societal preference for even more
stringent pharmaceutical and medical device safety standards than
are now in place.  Thus, a shift in the regulatory guidelines
to promote greater safety levels in response to the preferences
of consumers could ensure that these retributive preferences were
represented without having to rely on punitive damages.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Once the efficient level of safety has been
provided, punitive damages are not innocuous.  Imposing punitive
damages will deter companies from innovating products that might
potentially be subject to punitive damages, such as contraceptives.
 Similarly, companies will have an incentive to exit the market
altogether in an effort to avoid punitive damages, as has been
the case with respect to the production of vaccines.  Deterring
innovations and promoting market exit is not desirable if these
actions are the result of sanctions that are not linked to a provision
of an efficient degree of safety but in fact are imposed on the
firm even if appropriate safety standards have been met.<BR>
</FONT>
<P><b>The Current Common Law Approach<BR>
</b>

<P>
<FONT >Although there have been many discussions of
the regulatory compliance defense for FDA-approved products with
respect to punitive damages, the position taken here will be that
there also should be a regulatory compliance with respect to liability
more generally.  To examine the rationale for this defense, we
must first examine the current status of tort liability as well
as its linkage to the pharmaceutical industry.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Most observers attribute the tort liability
revolution to the emergence of strict liability as well as subsequent
developments in tort law.  The American Law Institute's Restatement
(Second) of Torts was a pivotal document that codified the strict
liability doctrine and indicated that this doctrine would replace
negligence as the preferred theory of liability.<sup><a href="foot.html">25</a></sup>  Section 402a
imposes liability on a firm if the product is &quot;in a defective
condition, unreasonably dangerous&quot; even though &quot;all
possible care&quot; was exercised &quot;in the preparation and
sale of the product.&quot;  This standard consequently is more
stringent than the negligence standard which only required that
an efficient level of safety be provided for the firm to be free
of liability.  For example, additional company expenditures on
safety are desirable so long as the marginal safety benefits exceed
the marginal safety costs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >It is noteworthy that the original drafters
of Restatement (Second) of Torts apparently did not envision that
these criteria were to be applied to &quot;unavoidably unsafe
products,&quot; such as drugs and vaccines:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT >Unavoidably unsafe products.</FONT></I><FONT >
 There are some products which, in the present state of human
knowledge, are quite incapable of being made safe for their intended
and ordinary use.  These are especially common in the field of
drugs.  An outstanding example is the vaccine for the Pasteur
treatment of rabies, which not uncommonly leads to very serious
and damaging consequences when it is injected.  Since the disease
itself invariable leads to a dreadful death, both the marketing
and the use of the vaccine are fully justified, notwithstanding
the unavoidably high degree of risk which they involve.  Such
a product, properly prepared, and accompanied by proper directions
and warnings, is not defective, nor is it unreasonably dangerous.
 The same is true of many other drugs, vaccines, and the like,
many of which for this reason cannot legally be sold except to
physicians or under the prescription of a physician.  It is also
true in many new or experimental drugs as to which, because of
the lack of time and opportunity for sufficient medical experience,
there can be no assurance of safety ... but such experience as
there is justifies the marketing and use of the drug notwithstanding
a medically recognizable risk.  The seller of such products, again
with the qualification that they are properly prepared and marketed,
and proper warning is given, where the situation calls for it,
is not to be held to strict liability for unfortunate consequences
attending their use, merely because he has undertaken to supply
the public with an apparently useful and desirable product, attended
with a known but apparently reasonable risk.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Thus, pharmaceutical products were to be exempted
from these criteria. Not-withstanding this distinction, the judicial
interpretations eventually broadened the &quot;unreasonably dangerous&quot;
test and began to focus on what constituted &quot;defectiveness.&quot;
 In <U>Barker v. Lull Engineering Company</U><sup><a href="foot.html">26</a></sup>, the court ruled
[a] product is defective in design either (1) if the product has
failed to preform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect
when used in an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner or (2)
if, in the light of development factors discussed below, the benefits
of the challenged design do not outweigh the risk of danger inherent
in such design.  In subsequent years, both risk-utility tests
and consumer expectation tests proliferated, and it is the general
consensus that the risk-utility test is more appropriate. <sup><a href="foot.html">27</a></sup> The
manufacturer should not be liable for what the consumer might
expect since these expectations need in no way be reasonable,
but a risk-utility test that has a parallel with an economic benefit-cost
test certainly is pertinent.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The most prevalently used risk-utility test
is that developed by Dean Wade.<sup><a href="foot.html">28</a></sup>  That test consists of a variety
of factors that would affect the desirability of the product,
where all but one of these factors is subsumed into a conventional
benefit-cost test.  The one distinctive factor is that the producer
serves in an insurance role for accident victims through the tort
liability awards for product injuries.  It is this insurance role
that underlies the development of strict liability more generally.
 The general notion is that firms provide insurance for consumers
of products through tort liability, where these insurance costs
are transmitted to consumers through higher product prices.  This
theory is sound in the case of rare event product accidents such
as that associated with isolated manufacturing defects, but this
analogy breaks down in the case of mass toxic torts.  The costs
imposed by large scale litigation such as the Dalkon Shield case
cannot be shifted to consumers.  Moreover, it is not feasible
for the company to bear such large scale costs.  The result has
been that many firms have exited the market with respect to development
of new contraceptives and production of vaccines because of the
large scale of these costs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Pharmaceutical companies have not escaped the
impact of strict liability.  Several jurisdictions have found
that as a matter of law pharmaceutical products are not unavoidably
unsafe.<sup><a href="foot.html">29</a></sup>  More importantly, the courts have not ruled that compliance
with the FDCA provides a defense in the case of product liability
actions.  Pharmaceutical companies have also been found liable
with respect to the development of new liability doctrines with
respect to hazard warnings even though these warnings are specifically
approved by the FDA and developed in accordance with a highly
structured warnings vocabulary specified by the FDA.  At the present
time, the majority of all courts do not recognize the FDA regulatory
compliance defense with respect to overall liability of the firm.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The effects in the absence of regulatory compliance
defense have been quite striking.  Producers of the DPT vaccine,
for example, were exposed to substantial liability that led to
considerable caution throughout the vaccine market.  Since 1968,
the number of vaccine manufacturers in the United States has dropped
by more than 50 percent.  The American vaccine market is now controlled
by single producer monopolies in the case of vaccines for polio,
rubella, measles, mumps, and rabies.  There are similar kinds
of monopolies for many pediatric vaccines as well.  The substantial
costs of tort liability consequently have led to the exit of the
market of substantial markets concentration for vaccines.  The
result has been a considerable rise in the price of vaccines,
well in excess of the inflation rate.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There have been, of course, changes in the
vaccine areas that have been prompted by the effects of the liability
burden.  In particular, Congress passed the Childhood Vaccine
Injury Act of 1986 in order to replace the burdensome tort litigation
process with an administrative compensation system.  Even in the
case of vaccines, this legislation has not completely eliminated
the tort liability problems.  Many vaccines, such as the chicken
pox vaccine, are not covered by the provisions of the act.  In
addition, this administrative compensation system, which is financed
by a tax on the pharmaceutical companies, requires that claimants
file claims through this program, but the claimant is free to
reject this award and can pursue a tort action under state law
if the claimant views the award as unsatisfactory.  An additional
deterrent to competition in the vaccine industry is that once
firms exited the market for vaccines, it was difficult to reenter.
 Thus, this major liability reform in the vaccine area should
be viewed as an incomplete remedy for the liability problems that
existed.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >To the extent that there has been any exemption
it has been with respect to punitive damages.  Thus far, there
are five states - Arizona, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, and Utah
- that have provided for an FDA regulatory compliance defense
against punitive damages.  There has been no punitive damage defense
adopted through Federal legislation, although such a defense is
frequently included in draft bills.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Medical devices are regulated under the 1976
Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  Companies
are permitted to market class I medical devices, such as tongue
depressors without government approval.  Class II medical devices,
such as hearing aids, were formerly required to meet government
approved performance standards, and class III medical devices,
such as heart valves, still must undergo a process similar to
that for pharmaceuticals.  In particular, there is a pre-market
approval process for such devices.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The liability regime for pharmaceuticals is
in striking context to medical devices.  The Medical Devices Amendments
of 1976, which were amendments to FDCA, grant a pre-emption defense
for medical devices that is similar in spirit but stronger than
a regulatory compliance defense.  Indeed, in the recent 1995 case
of Michael D. Shiley, Inc., the court ruled that the medical devices
amendments of 1976 pre-empt actions involving negligence, strict
liability, and breach of implied warranty for medical devices.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In the case of medical devices, there is not
only pre-emption of cases under Federal law but also claims under
state law as well.  In particular, in 1995 the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the First Circuit ruled that the Medical Device Amendments
to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act pre-empted all state tort
claims.  Moreover, this pre-emption was held to be true even if
the manufacturer defrauded the Food and Drug Administration and
did not in fact achieve regulatory compliance.<sup><a href="foot.html">30</a></sup>  The defrauding
company was, however, subject to criminal fines for conspiracy
to defraud the FDA and was required to pay total fines of $61
million.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >What is striking about this regulatory compliance
defense, in contrast with the treatment of pharmaceuticals, is
that only class three medical devices (devices that are implanted
under the skin) are subject to premanufacturing review.  The more
minor class I and II devices are not subject to premanufacturing
review, although they are subject to postmarketing surveillance
by the FDA.  The irony of this distinction is that in contrast
with exhaustive pre-marketing review of pharmaceuticals, which
often takes up to a decade, the device approval process has been
estimated to take an average of one year.<sup><a href="foot.html">31</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This discrepancy has even led to an important
anomaly in terms of product treatment.  The Copper-7 intrauterine
device was in fact a medical device, not a pharmaceutical.  However,
before the passage of the medical device amendments of 1968, there
needed to be some means of classifying this product, and FDA chose
to classify it as a pharmaceutical.  If this product had in fact
been regulated under the subsequently promulgated Medical Device
Amendments of 1976, the firm would have been free of its ultimately
substantial liability.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The overall policy proposal of this report
is to make the regulatory compliance defense more symmetric for
both pharmaceutical products and medical devices.  Although a
regulatory compliance defense for pharmaceutical products will
not be as strong as the pre-emption given to medical devices,
it will create more similar legal framework.  The premanufacturing
review process for pharmaceuticals is much more stringent than
for medical devices.  The criteria involved ensure the safety
and efficacy of the product based on the best available state
of the information at the time.  There is no rationale for continuing
the distinction that puts pharmaceutical products at such a substantial
relative disadvantage.<BR>

<br>
<h3>Legal Implication of a Revised Approval Process</h3><BR>

<P>
<FONT >We have outlined sweeping proposals for the
revision of the pharmaceutical and medical device approvals.<sup><a href="foot.html">32</a></sup> 
The essential elements of this proposal would be to privatize
the review process for new drugs and pharmaceuticals and to foster
competition in this review process.  In the case of pharmaceuticals,
the Drug Certifying Bodies would approve the IND for the drug,
oversee the clinical development, review the NDA, and certify
that the product is safe and effective.  After this review process
was completed, the FDA would have responsibility for the final
sign off in a highly structured review process.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Delegating these responsibilities to private
entities does not necessarily create any legal problems.  Government
agencies, including the FDA, frequently draw on the expertise
and input of private parties in a variety of regulatory areas.
 What is essential, however, is that this delegation of responsibility
be handled in a sound manner to avoid any constitutional problem
that might arise in the delegation of legislative power.<sup><a href="foot.html">33</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In the case of medical devices, the manufacturing
and/or Device Certifying Body would be responsible for compliance
with established standards-based criteria.  In the case of the
highest risk devices, the FDA would do a review and confirm that
proper standards had been used.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In each case, there would be no compromise
in the safety and efficacy levels of products as compared to the
current regime.  The ultimate sign-off for these products would
also be the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration
as would the overall character of the safety criteria.  The same
kinds of regulatory compliance defenses that would be sound proposals
under the current product liability and regulatory regime would
also be pertinent if the plan's proposals were adopted.  Thus,
if companies were in compliance with the government regulation
as administered under this new process, then the level of safety
provided by the company would be efficient, thus meeting the safety
objectives of either a negligence or strict liability standard.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Under the revised plan review process, the
Device Certifying Bodies and Drug Certifying Bodies would have
a critical role in the review process.  What, however, would be
the ultimate liability of these certifying bodies?  In the absence
of specific legal exemptions, these bodies potentially could be
subject to the usual liability criteria notably negligence and
strict liability.  If, however, thh2>IV. Regulatory Reform and Lia
liability then there would be a substantial deterrent for any
firm to enter the market as a DCB.  Such companies would face
the prospect of being named as a defendant in any potential product
liability litigation involving a drug or medical device for which
they had been involved in the approval process.  Particularly
in a world of joint and several liability in which a DCB could
be potentially responsible for the entire liability burden if
the defendant company was unable to meet the cost involved in
the award, the DCBs would risk bankruptcy in much the same way
do many companies which face the prospect of mass toxic tort litigation
or punitive damages.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In this instance, a reasonable proposal for
structuring the liability system would be to draw distinction
between potential liability with respect to negligence and strict
liability.  One would want to maintain incentives for the DCB
to exercise care in the approval of new drugs.  Thus, we would
not want the DCB to be negligent in overseeing the review process
for drugs or medical devices.  Thus, permitting suits against
the DCB by an injured plaintiff on the basis of negligence would
provide for the possibility of court sanctions against irresponsible
DCB behavior.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This liability exposure could be coupled with
the provision of a legal exemption from strict liability.  Although
the experience of Underwriters' Laboratory and other certifying
bodies suggests that strict liability has not been of consequence
to date, a specific legal exemption from strict liability could
be beneficial in eliminating the small risk of catastrophic losses
that might otherwise deter entry of potential DCBs.  Would, for
example, a university hospital be willing to gamble its entire
financial resources on the opportunity to enter this novel and
potentially highly litigious area?  If it did so, the fees needed
to cover potential liability costs would provide a deterrent to
the testing of potentially beneficial new drugs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The underlying rationale for strict liability
in the usual judicial context is that the company has a role beyond
not being negligent.  Rather, the firm should serve as the insurer
for the potential losses of accident victims and spread these
losses in much the same way as would an insurance company.  The
reasoning behind this is that the firm can pass along the cost
of the insurance to the customers who in effect will buy the insurance
for liability costs for pharmaceuticals or drugs as part of the
purchase price.  However, the additional insurance rationale is
not pertinent to whether the firm exercises appropriate care.
 The negligence doctrine alone is adequate to establishing these
incentives.  Moreover, it is not the DCB but rather the pharmaceutical
and medical device company that is marketing the product and has
the ability to spread the cost through the product price.  It
is, of course, true that the DCB can raise its fees to the companies,
which in turn can raise the product price.  Even in this instance,
however, this insurance analogy tends to break down in the case
of mass toxic torts and punitive damages.  Unanticipated awards,
such as those that resulted from the imposition of retroactive
liability, by their very nature cannot be recouped in the marketplace.
 Cases such as those that led to the bankruptcy or reorganization
of the affected firms likewise do not lend themselves to an insurance
role.  Moreover, the types of court awards that are made do not
simply provide insurance of medical costs and other income losses
of accident victims but instead provide for amounts well beyond
these losses.  Such awards will not be valued by prospective consumers
of the product since this is not the type of insurance they would
choose to purchase.  Consequently their cost will not be fully
reflected in the purchase price that consumers are willing to
pay.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The DCBs would, of course, have liability to
the companies as well as to potential consumers.  In particular,
the product certifier would have the responsibility of fulfilling
the terms of its contracts with its clients.  Thus, the certifier
would have the contractual duty to carry out these contract provisions
as well as the tort law duty to provide a workman-like service.<sup><a href="foot.html">34</a></sup>
 The DCB also is subject to the provisions of communicating the
results of its findings to the client.  If the DCB provides false
or inaccurate information, then it is subject to tort liability.<sup><a href="foot.html">35</a></sup>
 Under the theory of negligent misrepresentation the company could
potentially sue the DCB for providing false or inaccurate information.
 Thus, if the company suffered financial losses because of the
false information provided by the DCB and the DCB failed to exercise
reasonable care in obtaining and communicating the information,
then there is a potential basis for a negligence by the company
against the DCB.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The greater practical problem from the standpoint
of DCBs is not whether they are subject to potential liability
actions on the part of corporations purchasing its services but
rather whether third parties injured by the approved products
can obtain liability awards.  As a general rule, U.S. courts have
not found companies responsible for endorsing or certifying products
strictly liable for these defects.  However, a specific legal
exemption from strict liability could ensure that this is the
case and conclusively eliminate the threat of such suits.  The
underlying rationale that has been applied by the courts has been
that the product endorsers or testers are not directly involved
in the manufacturing or the distribution of the product so that
the usual rationales for strict liability are not appropriate.<sup><a href="foot.html">36</a></sup>
 For much the same reasoning, manufacturers have not been held
liable under the theories of breach of warranty.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Our plan's proposal that the DCBs be exposed
to third party suits on grounds of negligence is also consistent
with current legal doctrine in this area.  In situations in which
the courts have first determined that the testers or product certifiers
owed a duty of care to the general public, then negligence rules
have been applied.<sup><a href="foot.html">37</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The underlying reasoning that has led to the
courts determining that product certifiers and testers are potentially
liable can be traced to two principles.  If the individual who
is harmed took actions that were based on reasonable reliance
on the information provided by the certifier/tester and if the
certifier/tester is negligent either in obtaining accurate information
or in presenting it then there is potential liability for whatever
physical harm results from the use of these products.  As a general
rule, companies that are responsible for supplying information
to the public and which will be relied upon by the public in making
their purchasing decisions do have a duty to consumers.<sup><a href="foot.html">38</a></sup>  Of course
in the case of the role of DCBs with respect to product certification,
this aspect of liability will be complicated by the fact that
the FDA has the final sign-off in this review process.  Thus,
it must be the case that it is the DCB and not the FDA that is
responsible for the negligence.  The key issue is whether the
DCB has been careless or negligent in carrying out its responsibilities,
which is a much narrower basis for liability than is the case
for the pharmaceutical companies.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >To summarize, the major changes being proposed
with respect to the liability system pertain both to the current
liability regime as well as the proposed new regulatory structure.
 In particular, the proposal models a regulatory compliance defense
for pharmaceuticals and devices both with respect to punitive
damages and liability more generally.  The plan proposals to revise
the FDA drug and device approval process would not alter the pertinence
or applicability of these legal reforms.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The specific new legal issues that are raised
by the reform proposals pertain to the potential liability of
the DCBs.  If this potential liability is substantial, then entry
into this market will be discouraged and the desired competition
will not be forthcoming.  For the most part, the desired legal
changes needed to accompany this new regulatory mechanism simply
involve clarification of the existing legal structure to eliminate
residual uncertainties.  Potential contractual liability of the
DCBs to the companies purchasing their services would be present
and is entirely appropriate.  The greater dangers are those posed
by strict liability and negligence claims involving the products
tested by the DCBs.  Past legal precedent suggests that strict
liability claims are unlikely to be upheld by the court, but to
eliminate the risk of potentially catastrophic losses we propose
that there be a formal legal exemption from strict liability suits.
 As under the current legal regime, DCBs would be subject to potential
suits with respect to negligence, as indeed they should since
one would want to preserve the incentives for them to carry out
their duties in an efficient manner.<BR>

<br>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>

<P>
<FONT >The pharmaceutical and medical device industry
is in many respects an anomaly with respect to its legal status.
 This industry has been the target of some of the most pathbreaking
and costly product liability suits.  Indeed, not only is the liability
burden for the pharmaceutical and medical device industry quite
high, it is extremely disproportionate to its sales when compared
to other manufacturing industries.  By almost any objective standard,
the pharmaceutical industry is an outlier in terms of the extent
to which it has been hard hit by the rise in liability costs.
 These liability costs have been of substantial practical consequence,
as they have served as a deterrent to innovation and have discouraged
entry into important areas of product development.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >What is perhaps most disturbing about these
high liability costs is that they have been coupled with a regulatory
regime that is extremely stringent, certainly more stringent than
what is in place for any other major class of consumer products.
 Pharmaceutical products are subjected to extensive pre-market
testing and even extensive review before they are permitted to
be tested.  After having been tested and shown to be both safe
and effective, pharmaceutical products are marketed under restricted
market conditions in which a physician must prescribe prescription
drugs before they can be purchased.  In addition, the product
is accompanied by an on-product warning or a patient package insert,
the wording of which is specifically approved by the Food and
Drug Administration and is in large part drafted by the Food and
Drug Administration to be in conformance with a standardized warnings
vocabulary.  After the products are on the market, the Food and
Drug Administration undertakes considerable effort with respect
to surveillance of products and monitoring of adverse effects
that are reported to it.  This extremely vigorous regulatory regime
ensures that the usual tort liability objective of striking an
appropriate balance in the promotion of safety for the product
has been achieved.  Indeed, most critics of the FDA suggest that
the FDA errs on the side of excessive caution leading to too few
innovative new drugs reaching the market.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In the presence of such stringent regulatory
criteria, one wonders why the pharmaceutical industry has been
the object of such extensive litigation.  The reason is not that
the FDA's judgements were in error.  Rather, in some cases new
information becomes apparent over time, which could not have been
known by either the company or by the FDA without even a more
extensive testing process that would have delayed potentially
beneficial drugs from reaching the market even longer.  More important
is that in a regime of strict liability the company will assume
responsibility for insuring any adverse outcomes that occur in
any patient population group.  In some cases there may be adverse
reactions to a drug that lead to a patient injury and a subsequent
lawsuit.  In other instances, the causality may be difficult to
ascertain.  Pharmaceutical companies with their relatively deep
pockets may be held accountable for the losses even though their
product did not in fact cause the injury.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The liability regime we propose would remedy
the inequities created by a liability system that currently imposes
stringent penalties on an industry that already is subject to
extensive regulatory requirements.  A strong regulatory compliance
defense would recognize the role that FDA standards play in addressing
the product safety issue.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Other legal issues are also created by a broader
reform effort.  Under the proposed regulatory process for pharmaceuticals
and medical devices outlined here, DCBs would be potentially subject
to suits from both companies purchasing their services as well
as injured plaintiffs.  Suits on the part of companies that are
attempting to hold the DCBs to their contractual obligations are
entirely appropriate and should be permitted.  In addition, suits
against the DCBs on the basis of negligence in carrying our their
review functions also are appropriate.  At present, certifiers
such as Underwriters' Laboratory are not typically subject to
strict liability.  Nevertheless, it is appropriate to give DCBs
a formal exemption from strict liability in order to eliminate
the low probability chance of a high loss event that may lead
to the insolvency of the DCB.  The prospect of such suits would
deter entry into the DCB arena, which would not be a desirable
outcome.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The legal proposals accompanying our plan simply
involve recognition of the need for a regulatory compliance defense
and codifying the existing legal regime to provide a degree of
assurance that the current legal landscape will not be altered
in a way that will affect DCBs adversely.  Given the past performance
of the liability system, such as the imposition of retroactive
liability in the asbestos cases, the need for a safe harbor for
DCBs even on a limited basis may be desirable in reducing unreasonable
exposures to liability.  The overall objective of legal sanctions
is to maintain the incentives for efficient behavior on the part
of DCBs, and this can be done by adopting the legal reforms that
we have proposed.</FONT>

<P>
<ol>
<li> Clearly, the FDA reports to more than one
Congressional committee, so that the Weingast and Moran argument
is more complicated than the idea of a single, dominant overseer.
 Also, it is not clear that the FDA has responded much to advice
to loosen up, which suggests that it is more of a captive of committees
which criticize the agency for being too easy on industry.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<li>  The following discussion is meant to be
suggestive of how to analyze this case in slightly more formal
terms.  It can be skipped without loss of continuity.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<li>   An important semantical point needs to
be made here. Self-certification in the present discussion simply
means letting the market work, including the adoption of the standards
under which self-certification would take place. In other contexts
in this study self-certification will mean letting firms meet
an exogeneously determined set of standards (e.g., for Class I
medical devices) on their own. Government is not involved in the
former case, while it is involved in setting and policing standards
in the latter case.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<li>  The &quot;lemons&quot; problem resides in
the fact that buyers do not know the true quality of products
before they purchase and use them.  Hence, they tend to overvalue
lower quality products and to undervalue higher quality products.
 This means that only the lower quality products will be sold
in market equilibrium.  Owners of higher quality products will
not supply them for sales because they are systematically undervalued
by the market.  The market for used cars may be used as an example
of the &quot;lemons&quot; problem.  The analysis can also be translated
to the market for medical treatment. There is a pervasive history

Regulation of Medical Devices. New England Journal of Medicine
317:357-66, 1987. In this article, Dr. Kessler (before he became
FDA Commissioner) wrote: &quot;the FDA's extensive reliance on
the 510(k) pathway to reduce the number of devices that require
premarketing approval - and consequently its own workload - is
destined to fail. As technology advances, the number of devices
legitimately found to be substantially equivalent to devices marketed
before 1976 will diminish markedly. If the FDA does not soon develop
other acceptable mechanisms for dealing with new devices, practical
considerations will force it to stretch the statute further, making
the regulation of medical devices even more perplexing.&quot;</FONT>

<P>
<li>  The 1976 Food Drug and Cosmetic Act at least
technically offered the opportunity for the manufacturer to market
a device under section 510(k) 90 days after notification of the
FDA. The 1990 amendments removed this option and the manufacturer,
under the threat of severe penalties, must await an FDA &quot;order&quot;
giving permission to go to market.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  Briones (1995), p. 17. Statistical analysis
of data based on the date the PMA was submitted, by necessity,
does not include PMA's that were still pending at the time of
analysis. When these PMA's are finally acted upon, perhaps many
years after originally submitted, the average elapsed time will
increase. This phenomenon is more important for PMA's than 510(k)'s
as they typically require much more time and are not acted upon
in the year that they are filed.</FONT>

Of the companies surveyed, 61 percent market products offshore
before marketing in the United States. Sixty nine percent anticipated
that the delay would be between 1 and 3 years (pp. 89-91).</FONT>

<li>  George WW. Which Way FDA?. Medical Device
&amp; Diagnostic Industry. 17(12):22-24, 1995. William George,
CEO of Medtronics, states that of their &quot;last 15 major new
product lines or ventures, all have been developed, tested and
produced first in Europe. All will be available first to patients
overseas well before they are introduced to patients in the United
States. Overall, the gap between commercial availability of new
therapies in Europe and the United States has widened from 1 to
2 years to 5 to 7 years.&quot; The author has heard similar statements
from knowledgeable sources in the American device industry.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  In 1994, the Gallop Organization interviewed
58 executives of member companies of the American Electronics
Association and prepared a &quot;Survey of Medical Device Manufacturers
Concerning the Strategic and Economic Impact of the Federal Regulatory
Process.&quot; They looked at the impact of the experience of
these companies with the current 510(k) approval process. Fifteen
percent of these executives reported that their experience has
led them to relocate manufacturing operations outside of the United
States, 35% reported placing a greater emphasis on R&amp;D outside
the U.S. and 59% reported that more products are released outside
the U.S. that in the past.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  Commissioner Kessler in his April 6, 1995
statement before the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources
stated that &quot;Today, the Clinton Administration is announcing
a number of initiatives to improve the speed and efficiency of
the drug and device review process... I would like to submit for
the record FDA's report on regulatory reform in drug and medical
device review. These reforms ... have been developed under the
leadership of Vice President Gore's National Performance Review...
Some of the reforms we announce speak directly to reduced time
for review and approval. Others aim to reduce excessive regulatory
burdens... They will result ... in annual cost savings for industry
of $500 million.&quot; There is currently little debate concerning
whether reform is needed. The only question is which reforms are
best.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  The FDA has recently announced it's &quot;policy
on the development of standards with respect to international
harmonization of regulatory requirements and guidelines&quot;
(Federal Register, vol. 60, no. 196, pp.53078-84, October 11,
1995). The FDA states that &quot;harmonization enhances public
health protection and improves governmental efficiencies by reducing
both unwarranted contradictory regulatory requirements and redundant
applications of similar requirements by multiple regulatory bodies.&quot;
However, taken as a whole, the announced policy has so many caveats
that it is evident that the FDA is still not enthusiastically
embracing the harmonization of standards with Western Europe.
In fact the announcement overtly states that this &quot;policy
document does not ... bind FDA in any way.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<li>  European Council Directive of 14 June 1993
Concerning Medical Devices, Annex I, gives the details of the
14 essential requirements.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  The question of why the FDA, despite the
mandates of the 1976 law, failed to develop performance standards,
while the European system successfully relies upon them is elucidated
by Commissioner Kessler writing (NEJM 317:357-66, 1987) that &quot;the
development of 800 performance standards for the 800 types of
Class II devices, which has been estimated to require 50,000 staff
years, would probably exceed the capacity of the agency under
any circumstances.&quot;  In the European system there is no need
for a vast staff as they take full advantage of the myriad of
non-governmental standards setting bodies in a multitude of countries;
they have the flexibility to use generic standards as well as
standards that apply only to a single device; they, in many cases,
use standards to validate the manufacturer's quality assurance
systems instead of individual device standards; and finally they
allow the manufacture to devise <I>ad hoc</I> methods of proving
conformance with the &quot;essential requirements&quot; instead
of or to supplement relying on published standards. This approach
has allowed for more flexibility than relying primarily on a monolithic
federal agency.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  Annex IX of the Medical Device Directive
contains the details of the classification criteria.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  The full set of EU quality assurance standards
(which are similar to the ISO 9000 series of standards commonly
used in the United States) is equivalent to a super set of the
FDA's GMP requirements in that they also include standards for
ensuring the quality of the design process. The FDA has announced
that it intends to add design quality assurance to its GMP's in
the future.</FONT>

<li>  Magazine AH, Hunt MI. The U.S. Medical Device
Industry Moves Offshore. Medical Device &amp; Diagnostic Industry.
17(8):72-79, 1995. According to a recent survey, &quot;seventy
percent of all companies and 84% of development-stage firm moving
clinical trials offshore rate 'FDA uncertainty and unpredictability'
as a critical element in their decision.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<li>  Wilkerson (1955) pp. 217-27. This lists
100 specific medical devices, currently available in Europe, Canada,
Australia and/or Japan, which are currently not available to patients
in the United States.  Eventual FDA approval is expected for most
of these products. In general, these devices relate to the diagnosis
and treatment of severe disease. For example, 31 of the 100 are
related to coronary artery disease, structural cardiac abnormalities
or congestive heart failure. To the extent that they are more
efficacious than devices currently available in the United States,
regulatory delay may be responsible for unnecessary morbidity
and mortality.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  Less than the Sum of its Parts (1993) p.
81. The House report states: &quot;Clinical utility is the Agency's
[FDA's] requirement that a device manufacturer prove not only
does the device work as claimed, but that patient's health also
improves as a result of the device's action.&quot; &quot;Since
... ODE is barely able to perform the review presently required
by statute, it makes little sense for it to add routinely the
burden of assessing clinical utility to its review process.&quot;
 There is a critical distinction between the EU's concept of requiring
evidence of clinical efficacy and the FDA's requirement for evidence
of clinical utility. The former is related to demonstrating that
the device has the claimed effect; the latter, that the device's
effect is clinically beneficial. For example, the manufacture
of a mechanical ventilator that breathes for a patient may claim
that it delivers large breath volumes at a slow rate. The EU system
would require that this claim be verified and that the gas really
goes into the patient's lungs as claimed; the FDA system would
require that it be shown that this type of ventilation is, in
some sense, good for some subset of patients. In the EU system,
such medical questions are normally outside the domain of the
device regulations (unless, of course, the device manufacturer
makes an implicit or explicit claim of clinical utility).</FONT>
<P>
<li>  Less than the Sum of its Parts (1993) pp.
71-3. This congressional report quotes the head of the FDA Division
of Product Surveillance as stating that the current device reporting
&quot;system doesn't work and everyone knows it doesn't.&quot;
The report concludes that &quot;The weakness of CDRH's MDR system
reflects an FDA-wide problem with its failure to use management
information systems effectively&quot; and that little has changed
since the GAO came to a similar conclusion in their 1989 report.
The report continues on p. 91: &quot;The MDR system currently
cannot serve as an early warning system ... and it makes little
sense to invest additional resources into this system given its
many flaws. The Agency's chronic problems in this area may make
it necessary to have an independent expert contractor develop
a practical and useful system.&quot; For devices, because they
way that they are actually used cannot be fully determined before
actual marketing, postmarket surveillance is at least as important
as premarket review. Fortunately, it is in the interest of responsible
manufacturers to have their own, generally very effective, systems
to act on device problems discovered in the post-marketing period.</FONT>

INTRODUCTION
<P>
       The full Senate is poised to vote on legislation to deregulate the
telecommunications industry.  Unfortunately, the leading bill, while a
modest improvement on current law, misses the opportunity to benefit
consumers by opening the industry to real competition.  If this leading U.S. 
industry is to live up to its potential, and consumers are to reap the rewards
of full competition and innovation, the Senate must make major changes in
the bill.
<P>
       Last year's telecommunications deregulation bill, S.  1822, died in
the Senate because of dissatisfaction with the overly regulatory approach
produced principally by Senator Ernest Hollings (D-SC).  Very late in the
legislative session, then Minority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) began
circulating a draft deregulation bill that was a mere 30 pages long --
compared to the approximately 200-page Hollings bill.  Instead of granting
segments of the industry continued protection from competition, as the
Hollings bill did, the Dole draft legislation removed almost all barriers to
competition immediately.  For example, compared with the many pages of
regulation in S.  1822 dealing with Title VI of the Communications Act of
1934 (governing cable regulation), the Dole bill simply stated that "Title VI
of the Communications Act of 1934 is repealed."  This would have
deregulated the cable market completely upon implementation had the bill
become law.
<P>
       A choice of paradigms.  Thus, when members and key
telecommunications staffers on the Senate Commerce Committee began
meeting late last year to craft legislation for this session, they had a clear
choice of models:  S.  1822, which granted certain deregulatory freedoms
while still restraining competition in other ways, or the Dole draft
legislation to deregulate immediately and comprehensively almost all aspects
and segments of the telecommunications market.  Following the Dole model
would mean little to no intervention by bureaucrats and a more rapid
transition to complete market liberalization.
<P>
       Unfortunately, they have tried to craft a hybrid of both models.  The
result:  a bill that fails to create a clear, consistent, and unconstrained
environment for America's telecommunications industry.  During the early
weeks of this year, relatively "clean" legislation was revised many times,
with each revision moving further toward the Hollings model by adding
more regulatory baggage in an apparent effort to appease various segments
of the industry seeking to avoid new entrants into their markets.  Not
surprisingly, therefore, the first formal draft to emerge publicly from
Chairman Larry Pressler's (R-SD) office was, in many ways, already an
unsatisfactory compromise. 
<P>
        When the final bill emerged at a Senate Commerce Committee
mark-up on March 23, it was even less satisfactory than earlier drafts. 
Apparently in a last-minute effort to gain the support of several Democratic
members of the Commerce Committee, most deregulatory elements of the
bill were watered down.  Even so, many Democrats continued to express
reservations, and several pro-regulatory amendments were added to address
their concerns.  At the end of mark-up, the bill being sent to the floor
comprised close to 150 pages and contained almost 100 new rule-making
provisions for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  The
capitulation to the Hollings model was complete.
<P>
       To be sure, the bill contains some important improvements over
current law.  For example, the Pressler bill would:
<P>
Eliminate many important barriers to industry-wide competition,
<P>
Provide incentives to open the traditionally uncompetitive local market to
competition,
<P>
Eliminate elements of the 1992 Cable Act,
<P>
Allow somewhat increased foreign investment, and
<P>
Devise a system to scale back FCC powers.
<P>
       
       But these benefits are largely outweighed by provisions that retain
or extend suffocating rules.  For example:
<P>
Arbitrary FCC-administered "entry tests" could cause potentially lengthy
delays before competition is allowed in certain industry segments.
<P>
Some elements of the destructive Cable Act will remain in effect, and rules
regulating the video industry remain confusing.
<P>
Foreign ownership rules are relaxed only for a portion of U.S.  industry and
could be enforced retroactively after repeal.
<P>
No serious effort is made to eliminate the FCC or specific bureaus of the
agency; other rules in the bill could increase its size and power.
<P>
There is no serious reform of the electromagnetic radio spectrum to
encourage increased wireless competition and innovation.
<P>
The bill maintains and expands telecommunications entitlements that
discourage industry competition.
<P>
       After seeing this final bill, more deregulatory-minded legislators such
as Senator John McCain (R-AZ) were left asking, "Why do we need to
make a deal if it's a bad deal?"  Indeed, it is unclear why concessions
were made to industry special interests by the committee.  It is likely that
a bill modeled on the Dole draft of last year could win passage in both
houses of Congress.  However, now that one modeled more closely on the
Hollings approach has been adopted by the Commerce Committee, the
Senate must focus on how to improve S.  652, The Telecommunications
Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995.  If this legislation becomes law
as structured today, consumers will not be able to look forward to serious
telecommunications deregulation or competition in the short term.
<P>


WHAT IS GOOD AND BAD ABOUT THE PRESSLER PLAN
<P>
       The Pressler bill essentially is the product of two diametrically
opposed models of telecommunications deregulation.  Thus, both good and
bad elements can be found juxtaposed within the bill.  It is important to
separate the unneeded regulatory elements from the more sound deregulatory
components to consider what needs to be changed in the bill to create a
sound deregulatory environment for the industry.  One way to do this is to
compare the bill with a set of criteria for what could be considered true,
free-market-oriented deregulatory reform. 
<P>       
        Seven such general principles can be used to judge the deregulatory
nature of the bill: 
<P>
Creation of sensible interconnection policy to open the local market to
competition; 
<P>
Elimination of regulation and barriers to entry in the telephone market; 
<P>
Elimination of regulation and barriers to entry for the cable and video
market; 
<P>
Elimination of protectionist barriers to foreign investment; 
<P>
Sharp reduction of the telecommunications bureaucracy; 
<P>
Substantial movement toward a free market in spectrum; and 
<P>
Elimination of telecommunications entitlements.  
<P>

       Judged against these criteria, the bill earns a very mixed report card.
<P>
CRITERION #1:  Creation of a Sensible Interconnection Policy
<P>
Grade:  A 
<P>
Good Points:  A "competitive checklist" provides right incentives to open
local market to competition; does not apply policies too broadly.
<P>
Bad Points:  None.
<P>
       The Pressler bill creates a sensible interconnection policy to ensure
the local telephone market is opened to competition as soon as possible.  A
14-point "competitive checklist" is established that allows competitors access
to the "Baby Bell's" local telephone network.  This framework is based on
an "open access" philosophy, which encourages the expansion of rivals to
incumbent monopolistic carriers while preserving the ubiquitous nature of
the American telephone network.
<P>
       In addition, these access requirements are focused narrowly on less
competitive local markets where firms have traditionally been granted
service monopolies.  The Pressler bill wisely does not apply such access and
interconnection mandates on competitive sectors such as the cellular industry
where they would be counter-productive by discouraging the expansion of
infrastructure and competition.
<P>
CRITERION #2:  Elimination of Regulation and Barriers to Entry(Telephony) 
<P>Grade:  B-
<P>
Good Points:  Opens local telephone market to competition; allows new
rivals a chance to enter market.
<P>
Bad Points:  Allows for potentially lengthy and arbitrary FCC delays on
competition in other segments of the telephone market.  
<P>
       The Pressler bill encourages greater telephone competition by
eliminating all entry barriers to local telephone markets immediately.  This
means alternative providers, such as utility companies and cable companies,
would be allowed to enter the phone market.  This will encourage
competition from entirely different sectors and also help ensure that service
to many rural areas becomes competitive, since these firms already have the
needed infrastructure in place.
<P>
       However, many impediments either remain or are established by the
bill for the first time.  For example, the Senate should have allowed the
Baby Bells to enter the long-distance and equipment manufacturing markets
on a specific date or after they had met the "checklist" criteria discussed
above.  But a last-minute compromise in Committee deliberations eliminated
the "date-certain" or "checklist-certain" approach and substituted a new
"public interest" standard.  Thus, after complying successfully with the
checklist objectives, the Bells must face an arbitrary review of the benefits
of their entry into markets from which they are currently are barred.  If, for
any reason, FCC regulators feel Bell entry into these markets is not
"consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity," they can
block it.
<P>
       This is a disturbing and inferior standard upon which to base
telephone deregulation.  Deregulatory language should establish clear,
objective criteria by which firms can understand what must be done to
assure access to new markets.  Placing a "public interest" test within the bill
is an open invitation to anti-competitive special-interest pleading and
regulatory abuse, since the standard is largely subjective.  In addition,
allowing the FCC to interpret what is in the "public interest" introduces a
perverse incentive for FCC officials to slow down deregulation:  smoothing
the way for competition would mean a corresponding decrease in their
workload and little continued need for their agency's existence.
<P>
       The inclusion of this anti-competitive "public interest" test reduces
the grade the Pressler bill receives for elimination of barriers to telephone
competition, since beneficial Bell entry into new markets will be delayed. 
According to the WEFA Group, this delay could result in approximately
$300 billion in lost economic output and 3.4 million lost jobs over the next
ten years.  With such economic costs, it makes little sense to include
language in the bill delaying entry, especially since Baby Bell power in
local markets is dwindling.
<P>
       In addition, although the Pressler bill makes a half-hearted attempt
to eliminate the constraints placed on the seven Baby Bell companies under
the Modification of Final Judgment consent decree of 1982, no attempt is
made to supersede the consent decree that continues to restrain the GTE
Corporation.  Under a 1984 decree struck with the Department of Justice,
GTE is discouraged from entering many of the same lines of businesses the
Baby Bells are via structural safeguards and specific regulatory restraints. 
Thus, the Bells could be granted operating freedoms much sooner than GTE
under the Pressler bill, resulting in an uneven playing field.
<P>
       Finally, the Pressler bill does little to remove more traditional
regulatory barriers to telephone competition.  Elements of the original
Communications Act of 1934, such as licensing, tariffing, and other
operating requirements, have always been a burden on the industry.  For
example, Section 214 gives the Commission the power to approve or deny
the extension of phone lines and services to consumers.  In addition, the
Commission requires that telephone firms file schedules of their rates, or
"tariffs," with the agency for public inspection.  Although it makes little
sense for the Commission to be determining whether a company should be
extending services and requiring firms to reveal their rates to competitors,
the Pressler bill does not eliminate these uncompetitive and costly
regulations. 
<P>
CRITERION # 3:  Elimination of Regulation and Barriers to Entry
(Cable and Video)
<P>
Grade:  B-
<P>
Good Points:  Eliminates cable-telco cross-ownership restrictions.
<P>
Bad Points:  Does not repeal Cable Act outright; maintains asymmetrical
regulatory standard for video delivery.
<P>
       Recognizing that the Cable Act of 1992 has been a failure, early
drafts of the Pressler bill contained language calling for the repeal of the
Act and prohibiting any future cable rate regulation.  Unfortunately, a series
of last-minute compromises resulted in retention of the Cable Act, albeit
with important modifications.  In essence, cable rates under the Pressler bill
will be regulated if they "substantially exceed the national rate for
comparable cable programming services."  However, if a telephone company
provides video services in a cable operator's territory, rate regulation will
not apply.
<P>
       In addition, instead of eliminating all regulations governing the
delivery of video programming, the bill mandates continuation of a
confusing twofold standard -- one for video signals carried by telephone
wires and one for video signals carried over cable systems.  In essence, this
means that an asymmetrical regulatory standard for the delivery of video
programming will continue to exist.
<P>
CRITERION #4:  Elimination of Protectionist Barriers           
<P>
Grade:  C +
<P>
Good Points:  Potentially allows increased foreign investment and
competition in the common carrier market.
<P>
Bad Points:  Retroactive protectionist provisions could be enforced; ignores
radio licenses.
<P>
       The Pressler bill undertakes a long-needed reform of rules restricting
foreign ownership of American telecommunications companies.  Since 1934,
foreign entities have been effectively prohibited from owning more than 20
percent of the shares of a company holding a radio license or more than 25
percent of the shares of a company holding a common carrier telephone
license.  Foreigners also are not allowed to sit on the board or become an
officer of a radio licensee or a common carrier licensee. 
<P>
        The Pressler bill aims to eliminate the 25 percent cap on common
carrier ownership for any country that has opened its markets to American
goods.  But it does nothing about the 20 percent radio ownership ceiling. 
Furthermore, the bill contains a potentially retroactive "snapback" provision
that allows U.S.  regulators to re-impose protectionist barriers on countries
that fail to provide continued market access to U.S.  firms.
<P>
       While the Pressler bill is superior to current law on foreign
ownership, it still falls short of compete reform.  Exempting radio licenses
from the liberalization makes little sense, and the retroactive snapback
clause will likely be used by less-efficient U.S.  firms to close the American
market when foreign competition becomes intense. 
<P>
 CRITERION #5:  Reduction of Telecommunications Bureaucracy
<P>
Grade:  D-

<P>Good Points:  Eliminates some tasks over time and devises a process to
review regulations.
<P>
Bad Points:  Requires increased telecom spending and bureaucracy in short
term; no end in sight for the FCC.
<P>
       The Pressler bill will eliminate some of the telecommunications
bureaucracy simply by eliminating the regulations it enforces.  In addition,
beginning in 1997, it requires a biennial review of regulations by the FCC
to determine which rules are no longer in the "public interest."  Likewise,
the FCC does not have to enforce any regulations it feels are not in the
public interest.
<P>
       However, the bill does not contain any serious discussion of the
future of the Federal Communications Commission.  Policymakers appear
unconcerned with the role the agency plays in the deregulatory process and
apparently do not realize it is part of the problem they hope to correct. 
Congress should follow the model established by congressional Democrats
and the Carter Administration in the late 1970s when they led the battle to
deregulate the airlines.  From the start, the future of the Civil Aeronautics
Board (CAB), which regulated the airline industry, was on the table.  It was
well understood by most in Congress that deregulating the airlines would
mean eliminating the CAB.  A few years later, the CAB was abolished. 
<P>
        Yet, not only does the Pressler bill fail to mention the future of the
FCC, but many provisions discussed above or found elsewhere in the bill
actually will increase the size of the telecommunications bureaucracy.  For
example, new universal service provisions, "public access" requirements,
content controls, and separate subsidiary safeguards undoubtedly will
require additional FCC enforcement and staff.  Likewise, "public interest"
tests and continued licensing and tariffing requirements probably will require
stable or increasing FCC bureaucracy.
<P>
       Although Section 3 of the Pressler bill is titled "An End to
Regulation," there is no end in sight to the telecommunications bureaucracy. 
Congress could address FCC staffing and funding issues during the
appropriations process, but it is unwise to rely on Appropriations or Budget
Committee members to carry out a task that should be handled within the
bill itself.
<P>
CRITERION #6:  Movement Toward a Free Market in Spectrum
<P>
Grade:  F
<P>
Good Points:  None.
<P>
Bad Points:  No serious reform of the radio spectrum.
<P>
       The opportunities presented by complete liberalization and
privatization of the radio spectrum are enormous.  Billions of dollars in
revenue could be raised through the expansion of spectrum auctions.  More
important, if spectrum was freed for new or alternative uses, consumers
would benefit from more competitive markets, more innovative goods and
services, and falling prices.
<P>
              Sadly, the Pressler bill does not make a serious effort to
exploit these opportunities.  It contains moderate relaxation of national
ownership restrictions on broadcasters, but this falls short of the position,
held even by the FCC, that the rule should be repealed outright. 
Furthermore, many other ownership restrictions remain in the bill which
restrict the ability of broadcasters to operate freely. 
<P>
        Worse yet, the bill makes no attempt to end the nearly seven-
decade-old socialistic spectrum management policies of the FCC.  Spectrum
remains treated as a nationalized public resource to be regulated in the
"public interest" -- meaning, in reality, as the Commission sees fit.  Hence,
spectrum holders will continue to be denied flexible use of their current
spectrum allocation, while no move is made to vest them with property
rights in their allocation.  In addition, although the Pressler bill hopes to
create more efficient spectrum use by instituting a system of fees for
particular uses, the Commerce Committee missed the chance to move to a
superior, efficiency-enhancing system of complete privatization.  This would
have ensured that spectrum was auctioned off to the highest bidder and
owned by the firm that valued it most highly.  It also would have generated
billions of dollars for the federal government.  Moreover, broadcasters will
continue to be regulated under a "public interest model" under the bill, with
only limited First Amendment protections.  Remarkably, the Pressler bill
makes no mention of the First Amendment.
<P>
       As with the scaling back of telecommunications bureaucracy,
spectrum reform technically could take place later in a separate bill.  But the
opportunity for more comprehensive and immediate spectrum deregulation
is missed in the Pressler bill.
<P>
CRITERION #7:  Elimination of Telecommunications Entitlements
<P>
Grade:  F
<P>
Good Points:  None.
<P>
Bad Points:  Expands telecom subsidies; gives FCC larger role; potentially
regulates computer industry.
<P>
       The most disastrous elements of the Pressler bill are the sections
dealing with universal telecommunications service.  Current telephone
subsidy policies redistribute wealth in a highly inefficient manner to provide
cheap local telephone service.  Subsidies generally flow from long-distance
users to local users, business users to residential users, and urban users to
rural users.  These overlapping cross-subsidies have destroyed industry
competition by discouraging market entry, since few potential competitors
have the capital necessary to take on the subsidized firms.  By artificially
elevating prices in the long-distance market, these subsidies also have cost
society between $1.5 billion to $10 billion per year in higher prices. 
<P>
        Instead of attempting to reform or eliminate this destructive subsidy
system, the Pressler bill actually expands its scope.  For example, the bill:
<P>
Maintains current price controls by requiring that services be provided at
"just, reasonable, and affordable rates," and does not define what these
highly subjective terms mean.
<P>
Continues inefficient rate averaging, which requires that rates in rural areas
be roughly the same as those in urban areas, regardless of cost.
<P>
Expands telecommunications entitlements by mandating that, "At a
minimum, universal service shall include access to telecommunications
services that the Commission determines have, through the operation of
market choices by consumers, been subscribed to by a majority of
residential consumers."
<P>
       The continuation of the failed subsidy policies of the past, combined
with the expanding definition of universal service mandated under the bill,
places at risk almost everything else the bill hopes to accomplish.  Once
personal computers, on-line services, set-top boxes, and other future
technologies become part of a package of mandated benefits to which every
American must have access, it is likely these technologies will be regulated,
and thus made less competitive.  Although the bill does not specifically
require that these goods and services be included in a package of mandated
technological benefits, the Pressler draft has provided the FCC with the
incentive to do so by requiring that universal service be considered an
"evolving level of telecommunications service."  It is likely this will
encourage the agency to adopt traditional subsidization and regulatory
measures to extend these technologies to more Americans once they are
included in the evolving definition. 
<P>
        If this occurs and these markets become less competitive, consumers
will have less choice, higher prices, and perhaps even less access to these
technologies.  As the above chart illustrates, it is significant that
unsubsidized and unregulated technologies have been made available to
American consumers much faster than subsidized and regulated
technologies, such as telephone technology. 
<P>
        In addition, it will be more difficult to make the local telephone
market competitive, as the bill aspires to do.  This is because real price
competition will not be allowed to develop freely if subsidies remain in
place.  Further, it is unclear just how expensive it will be to carry out these
new provisions.  And although these mandates may not be considered
technically a tax increase, since the subsidies flow within the industry and
not from a general revenue fund, they will have the effect of a
redistributionist tax and likely will require an increase in the size of the
FCC.
<P>
HOW TO IMPROVE THE PRESSLER BILL
<P>
       If the Senate wishes to correct the flaws in the Pressler bill, several
changes must be made before the bill is passed.  Specifically, to create real
competition in the telecommunications industry, Congress should:
Strip out all unnecessary bureaucratic impediments to immediate
deregulation, such as the "public interest" test, licensing and tariffing
requirements, delays in equipment manufacturing liberalization, separate
subsidiary requirements, and all rate regulation provisions.
<P>
       There is little need to delay the onset of complete deregulation and
competition.  For six decades, consumers and entrepreneurial firms have
been forced to sit on the sidelines and watch bureaucrats conduct a
regulatory experiment that has ended in failure.  Immediate deregulation will
ensure that telecommunications companies face a much more ruthless
regulator -- the American consumer.  Policymakers cannot create
competition with waiting periods and bureaucratic entry tests.
<P>
Strip out retroactive foreign ownership provisions and eliminate
telecommunications protectionism.
<P>
       Instead of continuing to deny American consumers the benefits of
increased rivalry, competition, and service quality, as the Pressler bill would,
Congress should repeal these protectionist provisions in current law.  It
makes little sense to continue restrictions on foreign ownership of American
firms when so many diverse media and communication outlets exist.  Some
countries like the United Kingdom and New Zealand have liberalized
completely their telecommunications markets and enjoy the benefits of
increased capital investment and entrepreneurial foreign competition.
<P>
       To help pry open foreign markets, the White House should pursue
a multilateral trade agreement in this area.  This would be less likely to fuel
the fires of protectionism and avert the chance of a trade war that would
threaten U.S.  investment abroad.  Instead, the Pressler bill attempts to keep
one foot in the protectionist camp while slowly stretching the other toward
the free market.  Unconditionally opening the American telecommunications
sector to foreign investment and competition will lower prices, produce
more innovative products, and create new jobs.  Continuing current
restrictions on foreign access to the American marketplace will hurt U.S. 
consumers more than any foreign firm conceivably might.
<P>
       
Require immediate and unconditional repeal of the Cable Act and all
video regulation.
<P>
       Policymakers must recognize that the Cable Act has done nothing to
advance the interests of consumers.  Although the cable industry has not
been cost competitive in the past, that is due more to misguided regulatory
policies than to any natural market outcome.  The Cable Act of 1992 should
have focused on opening the cable market to competition, not on applying
new price regulations.  Not only have the new regulations resulted in
smaller gains for consumers, but they have restricted the cable industry's
ability to invest in new technologies and to compete in new markets. 
Congress should repeal the Cable Act and all cable regulation and focus on
opening the market to competition from alternative video providers.  In
addition, alternative video providers should be placed on equal footing with
cable carriers to achieve deregulatory parity.  This would serve the interests
of consumers better than any current price or entry regulation.
Define the "public interest" as the best interests of consumers, to ensure that
regulators cannot use the term for other purposes.
<P>
       Throughout the Pressler bill, the FCC is given the ability to regulate
or deregulate according to what the agency believes is in "the public
interest."  Congress would be wise to eliminate any mention of this from the
bill, specifically entry tests based upon the "public interest" standard.  But
if Congress insists on maintaining this standard, it should try at least to
reduce the potential for regulatory abuse by defining the term as clearly and
objectively as possible.  Six decades of unconstrained "public interest"
regulation has demonstrated that what the FCC determines arbitrarily to be
in the "public interest," rarely is in the best interests of consumers.  The
reason is simple -- regulators, not consumers, are making the decision.
<P>
       Congress should define the public interest standard in statute if
lawmakers insist (unwisely) on keeping it in the legislation.  The definition
should focus on three specific criteria:
Maximizing consumer welfare by broadening the general scope of individual
decision-making within telecommunications markets;
Utilizing market processes instead of regulatory proceedings whenever
possible; and
<P>
Protecting property and First Amendment rights in telecommunications
regulation.
<P>
       This "consumer welfare" standard would better serve the interests of
all Americans.  But Congress also should consider defining what would
not be in the public interest.  This should include any action that constitutes
taxation by regulation, such as current universal service mechanisms. 
Other arbitrary regulatory practices could be included in this general
definition.
<P>
Include provisions granting the FCC authority to conduct auctions to
privatize the spectrum and eliminate all ownership restrictions on
spectrum allocations.
<P>
       The Pressler bill missed a rare opportunity to de-nationalize one of
America's most important and valuable natural resources -- the radio
spectrum.  Congress should give the Commission the authority to use
spectrum auctions whenever there are competing interests for a spectrum
allocation.  This will allow the FCC to sell off most if not all of the
remaining spectrum to those who value its use most highly, thereby ensuring
that it will be used much more efficiently.  Once spectrum is auctioned off,
property rights in the spectrum should be created and enforced by a small
panel or the courts.  Holders of spectrum property rights should be given
complete operating flexibility to use their allocation however they see fit. 
Incumbent holders of spectrum licenses should be given an absolute property
right in their holding.
<P>
       Creating spectrum property rights and broadening current auction
authority to include all competing uses would generate potentially hundreds
of billions of dollars in revenue and spur more innovation within wireless
markets.  In addition, it would create more competition for landline voice
and video operators.
<P>
Mandate equal First Amendment protection for all media, whether print
or electronic.
<P>
       Since the inception of electronic communications technologies (such
as radio, TV, and cable), First Amendment protections have been all but
ignored by regulators.  Congress should make it clear that the First
Amendment plays a pre-eminent role in the future of this industry.  To
accord second-class speech protections to the electronic media is a gross
violation of the rights of communications broadcasters and carriers.
<P>
       As traditional print technologies (such as newspapers and magazines)
converge with modern electronic technologies (such as the Internet), it will
become increasingly difficult to determine how to separate the different print
and electronic standards.  For example, will the New York Times be
regulated under a different interpretation of the First Amendment once it can
be delivered to most Americans via computer or cable system?  Existing
regulatory distinctions distort the true meaning and intent of the First
Amendment:  "The First Amendment, after all, does not distinguish one
'press' from another."
<P>
Include a timetable for closing down the FCC.
<P>
       A failure to reduce the size of the bureaucracy that governs the
telecommunications sector is a failure to deregulate this industry.  As long
as regulators have jobs, they will regulate.  If there is to be full deregulation
of this industry, Congress must devise a detailed and workable plan for the
eventual closure of the Federal Communications Commission. 
Unfortunately, with so many provisions in the Pressler bill expanding the
federal regulatory workload, this goal cannot be achieved unless the bill is
amended significantly. 
<P>
        Lawmakers should eliminate the bill's expansionary language and
substitute a plan to close down the FCC.  Congress should begin by
reducing current FCC appropriations and including procedural reforms in the
bill to end destructive regulatory activities.  For example, all licensing and
tariffing restrictions could be repealed immediately, resulting in substantial
cutbacks in bureaucracy.  Likewise, entire FCC bureaus, such as the Cable
Services Bureau, could be eliminated as the rules they enforce are repealed. 
<P>
 Substitute a more pro-competition alternative for the current universal
service sections of the bill.
<P>
       If policymakers fail to eliminate the language in the Pressler bill that
would expand subsidies and entitlements, telecommunications competition
could be stifled and current technologies could be made less competitive. 
Instead of adopting the failed model of the past, Congress should craft
policies in this field that fit the new thinking on entitlement reform on
Capitol Hill. 
<P>
        Just as some other entitlements are being limited and then devolved
to the states, universal telecommunications service policies can be
transferred to lower levels of government.  States and localities can
determine better what their residents need.  Ideally, state or local lawmakers
could create a voucher plan that would deliver a subsidy directly to a
qualified individual, not a company, based on perceived need.
<P>
         The subsidy would be narrowly drawn, means-tested, and more
friendly to competition -- unlike policies today that artificially price service
in rural areas below costs.  By transferring all authority for the universal
service system back to the states, Congress could eliminate the federal
bureaucracy that oversees the universal service system.
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
       Although it would be unfortunate if telecommunications deregulation
legislation died this year, as it did last year, it would not be the proverbial
end of the world.  For one thing, technologies and the courts are
undermining or dismantling many of the barriers now in place.  With each
passing year, technological innovation circumvents outdated regulatory
distinctions, and court decisions are eliminating many regulatory barriers
outright.  These trends are likely to continue.  Another reason to reject
flawed legislation is that the Pressler bill actually would make some things
worse.  In particular, the universal service elements place at risk everything
else the bill hopes to accomplish by mandating the continuation and
expansion of failed subsidy policies.
<P>
              Still, supporters of the bill will argue correctly that allowing
the perfect to be the enemy of the good can destroy any chance of freeing
the industry from many statutory constraints on competition and innovation. 
They will cite the length and heavy cost of court-based deregulation and the
economic losses associated with continuing restrictions for longer than
necessary.  However, if supporters feel this passionately about the need for
immediate deregulation, they will act to eliminate the overly regulatory
baggage of the bill and insert more deregulatory, pro-competitive
alternatives in its place.  Without such changes, S.  652 as currently written
is not the landmark telecommunications deregulation bill its sponsors claim,
since it continues to rely more on regulators than consumers to decide which
firms and technologies prevail in the marketplace.

<a href="#five">FIVE AMENDMENTS TO MAKE THE BILL TRULY DEREGULATORY</a><br>
<a href="#conclusion">CONCLUSION</a><p>
<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

	Following the recent Senate passage of S. 652, the Telecommunications Competition 
and Deregulation Act of 1995, the House of Representatives is ready to act on companion 
legislation, H.R. 1555, the Communications Act of 1995. The chief sponsors of this legislation 
are Representatives Thomas Bliley (R-VA), John Dingell (D-MI), and Jack Fields (R-TX). 
Unfortunately, like the Senate bill, the House bill fails to take the many important steps needed 
to deregulate, completely and comprehensively, all aspects of this industry. Worse yet, the House 
bill actually adds new regulatory powers to an already bloated federal bureaucracy. If Congress 
hopes to produce landmark deregulatory telecommunications legislation this year, the House 
must make important changes in the bill.<p>

<a name="what's"></a><h4>WHAT'S RIGHT AND WRONG WITH THE BILL</h4><p>
[ <a href="#content">Contents</a> ]<p>
	Although H.R. 1555 does include some positive incremental improvements in current 
law, it needs to go much further to achieve real reform. The bill takes important steps toward 
liberalizing the telecommunications market. For example, like its Senate counterpart, H.R. 1555:<p> 
<b>
<ul>
 <li>Eliminates many important barriers to industry-wide competition in both voice and 
video markets,

 <li>Provides incentives to open the traditionally uncompetitive local market to competition,

  <li>Eliminates elements of the 1992 Cable Act, and

  <li>Somewhat liberalizes broadcast ownership restrictions.
</ul>
</b>
However, the legislation also is riddled with unnecessary regulation and new mandates. For 
instance, the bill purports to establish a framework to minimize bureaucracy and regulation, yet 
contains well over 100 new rule-making provisions for the Federal Communications 
Commission alone. According to FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, the agency "will need substantial 
resources" to implement the legislation. "We'll need economists, statisticians, and business 
school graduates." (1)  Testifying at a June 19 House hearing, Hundt noted the agency would need a 
substantial increase in funding next year because passage of the legislation would put the agency 
"on the verge of a prodigiously detailed undertaking." (2)<p>  
	This beefed-up activity may be the type of "deregulation" that FCC bureaucrats like, but 
it is very different from what most industry experts and consumers would view as true 
deregulation.<p>

	Among its disturbing regulatory provisions, H.R. 1555:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Establishes excessive entry tests for Baby Bell companies seeking to enter long-distance 
markets.</b> Before removing outdated restrictions on Baby Bell entrance into the long-distance 
market, H.R. 1555 requires the companies to meet a series of standards to prove their local 
market is open to competition. Yet, the bill contains a perverse incentive that makes meeting 
these standards very difficult.<p>

	Before the Bells are deregulated, they must prove they face regional "facilities-based 
competitors" that offer comparable network service to both business and residential 
customers. However, they also must prove they are providing access to their own networks at 
"economically feasible rates" to allow competitors to resale service through the Bell 
infrastructure. This would create a perverse incentive, because competitors are unlikely to 
build a competing network if they can resale off the Bells' network at low rates. Competitors 
will find it more profitable to resale instead of building the competing infrastructure that 
needs to be present for the Bells to pass the "facilities-based" test. Consequently, Bell entry 
into long distance may be delayed for some time.<p>

		Another bill passed by the House Judiciary Committee could further complicate this 
process if it is included in H.R. 1555. The Antitrust Consent Decree Reform Act of 1995 
(H.R. 1528), sponsored by Representative Henry Hyde (R-IL), would add a role for the 
Department of Justice (DOJ) in determining whether a Bell should be granted access to the 
long-distance market. Basically, the DOJ could deny Bells access to that market if it found 
there was a "dangerous probability" they could monopolize another market. Combined with 
the excessively bureaucratic test already contained in H.R. 1555, this would place almost 
insurmountable obstacles on the path to operating freedom. Furthermore, consumers would 
be denied access to new competitors and their services.<p>

 <li><b>Requires that a separate subsidiary be established each time a telephone company 
wants to enter a new line of business</b>. Before a Baby Bell can enter long-distance, video 
services, or electronic publishing markets, it must establish an entirely separate entity to 
deliver that service. This means unnecessary duplication of facilities and staff, higher 
operating costs, and lower overall efficiency. The Bells should be allowed to enter a new line 
of business in any manner they find efficient and profitable, just as any other business can.<p>

  <li><b>Fails to eliminate barriers to international investment.</b>  Although an amendment to H.R. 
1555 allows some opening of the American market to foreign investment, such beneficial 
activity still would be delayed while the executive branch determined whether it was 
warranted. This would give provide American firms time to delay the liberalization process 
to discourage additional competition. Outright repeal would ensure a steady increase in the 
flow of capital to the American telecommunications market and a subsequent increase in job 
opportunities, just as free trade has accomplished in such other areas as computers and 
automobiles.<p>

  <li><b>Expands telecommunications entitlements.</b>  Like its Senate counterpart, H.R. 1555 expands 
uncompetitive and ineffective subsidies that flow to corporations instead of to individuals. 
The bill contains broad, open-ended mandates for the FCC and the states to design and 
deliver a more extensive package of communications services to all Americans, in part by 
manipulating the rates consumers pay for those services. <p>

		For example, subsidies generally flow from long-distance to local users, business to 
residential users, and urban to rural users. These overlapping cross-subsidies have destroyed 
industry competition by discouraging market entry, since few potential competitors have the 
capital necessary to take on the subsidized firms. (3)  By artificially elevating prices in the long-
distance market, these subsidies have cost society between $1.5 billion to $10 billion per year 
in higher prices. (4)  Because the House plan preserves and expands many of these mechanisms, 
it distorts market competition and fails to ensure access to more innovative and truly price-
competitive services. (5)<p>

  <li><b>Fails to move toward complete privatization of the radio spectrum.</b> By missing another 
chance to denationalize the government-owned national resource of radio spectrum, the bill 
fails to open the wireless world to even more vigorous competition. Although making some 
minor modifications in FCC licensing authority and relaxing some ownership restrictions, 
H.R. 1555 makes no effort to create property rights in spectrum ownership or to allow 
holders of spectrum the flexibility to use their spectrum as they choose. Spectrum holders 
now can use their allocation only for purposes defined by the FCC. For example, the holder 
of a television station spectrum license may not convert that station into a cellular telephone 
system even if it would be more efficient and profitable to do so. H.R. 1555 does nothing to 
rectify this inefficient policy.<p>

  <li><b>Makes no serious attempt to minimize bureaucracy.</b> Instead of taking the opportunity to 
eliminate entire branches and bureaus of the FCC, the bill will lead instead to an increase in 
the size and power of the federal bureaucracy overseeing the communications industry. The 
FCC will be responsible for the administration of numerous new transitional rules and 
regulations. This will prevent deregulation from proceeding rapidly, because the agency 
works against market liberalization. (6)<p>

	In addition to these many flaws, the bill fails to remove all rate and price regulation; fails 
to lift unnecessary licensing and tariffing requirements; (7)  fails to allow utilities into 
telecommunications markets they currently are prohibited from entering; fails to define what it 
means to regulate "in the public interest" even though many important decisions hinge on such a 
determination; (8)  and fails to include any mention of the First Amendment.<p>

	The legislative approach being taken by the Senate and House is most appropriately 
labeled "deregulatory industrial policy." Supporters of deregulatory industrial policy are 
convinced they can "create" competition in the telecom industry by rigging the rules of the game 
to achieve desired results. Countless safeguards, transitional rules, and continued protections for 
certain industry segments remain in the bills, supposedly to create a "fair playing field." True 
deregulation, on the other hand, would remove the many unnecessary regulations that constrain 
the industry without adding numerous new rules in the process.<p>

	Although creating a more competitive communications market is a desirable goal, it is 
unlikely the existing regulatory apparatus is up to the task. The FCC and state regulatory 
commissions have done more to destroy competitive opportunities than to create them. And it is 
these institutions that will be charged with creating "competition" under the current Senate and 
House approach. Telecommunications' sister industry --  computers  -- is a good example of how 
competition can develop without centralized direction, regulation, or subsidy. Market power is 
constrained by vigorous technological innovation and consumer choice -- not by arbitrary 
bureaucratic edict. This should be the model for telecommunications.<p>
</ul>



  	



<a name="five"></a><h4>FIVE AMENDMENTS TO MAKE THE BILL TRULY DEREGULATORY</h4>
<p>
[ <a href="#content">Contents </a>]<p>
Despite these weaknesses in the bill, proponents argue correctly that it represents 
an improvement over the status quo. But the House should strengthen the framework 
established in H.R. 1555 by more completely and effectively deregulating the industry. 
Five simple changes would accomplish this.
<p>
<b>Change #1: Mandatory Forbearance and the "Most Favored Regulation" Clause</b>
The addition of a mandatory forbearance clause would relieve competitive carriers 
from all regulation and open the market to unconstrained competition. A competitive 
carrier would be defined as any carrier facing either actual or impending rivalry. In 
markets where competition is less pervasive, such as the residential telephone market, 
regulatory constraints would remain in effect until a pre-determined list of requirements 
like those found in the bill is met. For example, after completing the "checklist" 
requirements, Baby Bell companies would be considered competitive and therefore 
eligible for forbearance from regulation.
<p>
The addition of mandatory forbearance should include a "most favored 
regulation" clause similar to the most favored nation (MFN) treatment accorded by global free trade agreements. Countries that are granted MFN treatment can import their goods on identical terms as other countries. In other words, MFN requires non-discriminatory legal treatment in trade. 
<p>
This same concept can be applied to ensure non-discriminatory regulatory treatment of competing providers and technologies in telecommunications markets. Once a carrier seeks to offer a new service, it can be regulated no more stringently than its least regulated competitor. Such a provision would ensure regulatory parity within 
telecommunications markets as the lines between existing technologies begin to blur.
<p>
<b>Change #2: Mandatory Sunsetting of New Rules After Two to Three Years</b>
A second important change in H.R. 1555 recognizes that while there may be a 
need for transitional rules, they should be phased out as quickly as possible. Although the bill clearly contains too many transitional rules, some will probably remain. For these, the House should include language sunsetting their applicability after a two- or three-year transition period. Any perceived need for their continued existence will have to be dealt with in subsequent legislation or the rules will become invalid.
<p>
<b>Change #3: Devolving Telecommunications Entitlements</b>
This change would create a more sensible method of subsidization by transferring full authority over the definition and delivery of universal service to the states, thereby ensuring a more geographically tailored and state-specific subsidization policy that targeted subsidies more precisely to those who need them most. Because H.R. 1555 could be scored as a tax increase by the Congressional Budget Office, this alternative would address the problems raised by the House approach.
<p>
Again, the "most favored regulation" concept would apply to the provision of 
subsidies to ensure that no company received an unfair advantage over a competitor. By requiring non-discriminatory subsidization, this amendment would discourage states from subsidizing corporations and encourage them to design a means-tested, voucher-like mechanism to deliver assistance directly to individuals instead of through companies.
<p>
<b>Change #4: First Amendment Parity for All Media</b>
All media, whether print or electronic, should be accorded the same First 
Amendment protection under the law. It makes little sense to regulate an on-line service provider of news differently than a daily newspaper. As such technologies converge, it will become difficult, if not impossible, to regulate them under different standards. H.R. 1555 makes no mention of the First Amendment or of how electronic technologies should be regulated. Congress should recognize the importance of placing all technologies on equal regulatory footing by mandating they be granted the same First Amendment protections. (9) 
<p>
<b>Change #5: Creating a Free Market for Spectrum</b>
Beyond the incremental reforms found in H.R. 1555, lawmakers should free the 
electromagnetic radio spectrum from its seven-decade-old regulatory constraints. All 
incumbent holders of spectrum should be granted irrevocable, perpetual property rights in their wireless holdings. Like all other property, spectrum could be used as the owner sees fit, subject to common law standards of trespass and interference. More important, the FCC would be directed to auction off immediately all competing claims for unused spectrum. Finally, to encourage the government to disgorge as much of its current spectrum as possible, federal agencies would be provided with a certain percentage of any <p> revenues raised from the sale of their spectrum. This would encourage government spectrum users to place some of their vast spectrum holdings on the auctioning block to be purchased for more efficient uses. This plan, originally laid out in a recent report by the <a href="http://www.pff.org">Progress and Freedom Foundation</a>,  would guarantee more efficient deployment and use of wireless communications technologies. 
<p>
<a name="conclusion"></a><b>Conclusion</b><p>
[ <a href="#content">Contents</a> ]<p>
Many supporters of H.R. 1555 argue that adding more radical pro-deregulatory 
language to the bill decreases the likelihood of final passage. However, it is unlikely that a more principled bill would face any more serious opposition than the current bill. 
<p>
Proponents of the current telecommunications bill also point out that it represents 
the first of many efforts at comprehensive deregulation of the telecommunications 
industry and that additional improvements can be made in subsequent legislation. This is unlikely. On June 19, the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee held a single two-hour hearing to discuss the future of the FCC. No budget cuts were recommended and no substantial changes in the FCC's current structure were proposed -- despite earlier public calls by leaders of that committee for a radical downsizing of the agency.
<p>
Although spectrum policy could be dealt with in a separate bill, it is unclear why 
it should be broken out of the current legislation since a competitive wireless sector is 
essential to a more competitive wireline sector. If Congress waits months or even years to deregulate the wireless sector properly, a truly uneven playing field could result, further wireless technological innovation could be repressed, and local telephone competition could be delayed.
<p>
 The House must help the Senate fundamentally reform U.S. telecommunications 
policy. It can do this by removing -- immediately and unconditionally -- all barriers to 
entry, scrapping any overly regulatory language remaining in the bill, effectively 
reforming the universal service subsidy mechanisms as well as wireless spectrum policy, and  guaranteeing that First Amendment protections are enforced equally across all media.
<p>
If the House misses this final opportunity to remove the bill's excess regulatory 
baggage and strengthen its market-oriented elements, it is unlikely that Congress will 
produce a truly deregulatory bill this year.

<H2>WHO ARE THE "EXTREMISTS"?<BR>

<P>
In response to mounting problems, the White House has adopted
a new strategy to promote the nomination of Dr. Henry Foster as
Surgeon General.  It has chosen to frame the debate as a referendum
on the legality of abortion and to label its opponents as right-to-life
&quot;extremists.&quot; 
<P>
The White House's attempt to evoke a knee-jerk reaction from the
American public fails to address the salient issues of the debate,
however.  The Foster nomination is <U>not</U> about the legality
of abortion, and those calling for Foster's withdrawal are not
&quot;extreme.&quot;
<P>
The dictionary defines &quot;extremism&quot; as deviating to the
greatest degree from the center of opinion.  So what is the center
of opinion?  On the issue of abortion, the White House implicitly
argues that Henry Foster represents the center of public opinion.
 However, public opinion polls compiled by the American Enterprise
Institute show that Henry Foster occupies one end of the abortion
spectrum and that the majority of Americans do <U>not</U> subscribe
to Dr. Foster's views.
<UL>
<LI> A 1994 Gallup poll commissioned by CNN and <I>USA Today</I>
found that 65 percent of Americans believe that abortions should
either be &quot;illegal in all circumstances&quot; or &quot;legal
under certain circumstances.&quot;  Only 33 percent would agree
with Dr. Foster that abortions should be &quot;legal under any
circumstances.&quot;
<P>
<LI> A 1995 CBS News/<I>New York Times</I> poll (1/95) found that
60 percent believe that abortion should either &quot;not be permitted&quot;
or have &quot;stricter limits.&quot;  Dr. Foster's views that
abortion should be &quot;generally available&quot; are shared
by only 38 percent of the population.
<P>
<LI>A 1994 Roper study commissioned by Focus on the Family and the
Family Research Council polled abortion views on a 9-point continuum.
 From category 1 representing the most pro-life stance to category
9 representing the most pro-abortion stance, Dr. Foster's views
place him in either category 8 or 9.  Only 13 percent of Americans
fall into those two categories combined.
</UL>
<P>
Dr. Foster's record shows that he vigorously opposes popular measures
such as waiting periods and parental consent and notification
laws.  Foster also believes that abortions should be available
through all nine months of pregnancy, even 
after the fetus is viable outside of the mother's womb.  Can Dr.
Foster, as an 
individual who not only holds these views, but has also personally
performed abortions, conducted studies on mothers and their unborn
children to test abortion drugs, and performed sterilizations
on mentally retarded young women without their consent, be accurately
described as holding to the center of this public opinion?
<P>
And then there's the issue of Dr. Foster's credibility.  Dr. Foster
and the White House have not been forthright in representing Foster's
abortion record.  First, the White House said nothing about abortion.
 Then it admitted to Sen. Nancy Kassebaum that Foster had performed
<B>one</B> abortion.  Then Dr. Foster issued a statement saying
that he had done &quot;<B>fewer than a dozen</B>.&quot;  Then
there was the 1978 Department of Health, Education, and Welfare
transcript that recorded Foster as saying he had done &quot;<B>probably
near 700</B>&quot; amniocentesis tests and therapeutic abortions.
 Then Dr. Foster admitted his involvement in <B>55</B> abortions
when conducting abortion drug trials in 1981.  Then Foster told
<I>Nightline</I> that he was the &quot;physician of record&quot;
for <B>39</B> abortions.
<P>
The issue of credibility is hardly a minor point, especially for
an individual in whom Americans are asked to repose their trust.
 Are Foster's critics &quot;extreme&quot; for wanting a Surgeon
General who is truthful and forthright?
<P>
Lastly, the White House has characterized Foster's critics as
&quot;right to life extremists.&quot;  As of this writing, those
calling for the withdrawal of the Foster nomination include pro-life
groups, pro-family groups, the New York chapter of the National
Organization for Women, the <I>New York Times</I>, the <I>Washington
Post</I>, the <I>Washington Times</I>, the National Coalition
of Abortion Providers, Senators Joseph Biden, Nancy Kassebaum,
Bob Dole, and Dan Coats, among others.  Are all of these &quot;right
to life extremists&quot;?  If so, then where does that put the
White House and Henry Foster?  If not, then why has the White
House singled out the pro-life community for its rhetorical venom?
<P>
Groups coming from many different perspectives oppose the Foster
nomination for many different reasons.  Yet the White House has
chosen to label anyone who doesn't agree with its position as
&quot;extreme&quot;?  Did I miss something, or does the White
House now hold a monopoly on what can be considered &quot;mainstream&quot;?

Abortion advocates have seized upon the results of the latest
public opinion poll on abortion, proclaiming that the overwhelming
majority of Americans (75 percent) are &quot;pro-choice&quot;
while only a small group (23 percent) are &quot;anti-abortion.&quot;
 The White House has used these purported findings to justify
its promotion of Dr. Henry Foster for Surgeon General.  And &quot;pro-choice&quot;
legislators have cited these &quot;findings&quot; as evidence
that the Republican Party should abandon its historic pro-life
commitment.
<P>
But a closer examination of this and other public opinion polls
reveals that such an interpretation is, in fact, misleading. 

<P>
The CBS News/<I>New York Times</I> poll to which abortion advocates
are referring found that 23 percent of respondents believe that
&quot;abortion should not be permitted;&quot; 37 percent believe
that &quot;abortion should be available but under stricter limits
than it is now;&quot; and 38 percent believe that &quot;abortion
should be generally available to those who want it.&quot;  These
results do not show 75 percent being in favor of the pro-abortion
activism of Dr. Henry Foster.  Nor does the survey show a mandate
for the GOP to disenfranchise its constituency who are morally
concerned about abortion, as abortion advocates would argue. 
Rather, the survey shows that 60 percent of Americans believe
that abortion should either be banned or more strictly limited.
<P>
Similar results have been obtained from other public opinion polls.
 A September 1994 Gallup poll for CNN and <I>USA Today</I> found
that 65 percent of Americans believe that abortions should either
be &quot;illegal in all circumstances&quot; (13 percent) or &quot;legal
under certain circumstances&quot; (52 percent).  Only 33 percent
believe that abortions should be &quot;legal under any circumstances.&quot;
<P>
Interestingly, when the &quot;legal under certain circumstances&quot;
category is defined more narrowly, a majority of respondents still
offer a &quot;pro-life&quot; response.  A September 1994 <I>Time</I>/CNN
poll found that 52 percent of respondents believe that &quot;abortion
should be illegal in all circumstances&quot; (13 percent) or that
&quot;abortion should only be legal in certain circumstances such
as when a woman's health is endangered or when the pregnancy results
from rape or incest&quot; (39 percent).
<P>
These findings reveal that large numbers of Americans express
moral objections to or reservations about abortion.  Indeed, when
a 1995 CBS News/<I>New York </I>
<I>Times</I> poll asked respondents to choose which one of two
statements more closely resembled their viewpoint on abortion,
46 percent responded that &quot;abortion is the same thing as
murdering a child&quot; as opposed to 41 percent who agreed that
&quot;abortion is not murder because the fetus really isn't a
child.&quot;
<P>
A 1993 Family Research Council poll conducted by the Voter/Consumer
Research group asked respondents whether they &quot;strongly agree,&quot;
&quot;somewhat agree,&quot; &quot;somewhat disagree,&quot; or
&quot;strongly disagree&quot; with the following statements about
abortion:  &quot;Unborn children should have the right to life&quot;
and &quot;Women should have the right to choose to have an abortion.&quot;
 Not surprisingly, the phrasing of the questions influenced some
respondents' answers -- towards the unborn child's right to life
in the first case and towards the woman's &quot;right to choose&quot;
in the second.  However, when the results were cross-tabulated
to discover those who would &quot;strongly agree&quot; with one
question and &quot;strongly disagree&quot; with the other, 25.6
percent held strongly pro-life views; 20.4 percent were strongly
pro-choice.  The rest were somewhat torn or confused.
<P>
Syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer identifies with this
torn or confused group.  While he does not support efforts to
make abortion illegal, he opposes the Foster nomination because
he is troubled by the prospect of having a Surgeon General who
has personally performed abortions, who has tested abortion drugs
on mothers and their unborn children, who opposes waiting periods
and parental consent/notification laws, and who believes in abortion
through all nine months of pregnancy, even after the fetus is
viable outside of the mother's womb.  Krauthammer believes many
other &quot;pro-choice&quot; Americans share his objections to
abortion and to the Foster nomination.  He believes the White
House's nomination of Dr. Foster shows an insensitivity to the
fact that most Americans do believe abortion is immoral.
<P>
The GOP would be wise not to abandon the high moral ground in
the abortion debate.  While the issue is certainly not settled,
a majority of Americans do morally disapprove of abortion -- and
this broad moral unease means that pro-life policymakers need
not shrink from the battle.  Indeed, the Foster nomination is
but one example of how the abortion issue cuts for pro-lifers.

<title>BAN PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTIONS</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<h2>BAN PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTIONS</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<p>
It isn't often that congressmen and senators have the opportunity
to vote on something as important as preserving human life.  But
those in the House of Representatives will have such an opportunity
during the first week in November, and those in the Senate may
have the opportunity shortly thereafter.
<p>
Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.) has introduced H.R. 1833, which would
ban partial-birth abortions.  The companion bill, S. 939, has
been introduced by Sen. Bob Smith (R-N.H.).  This important bill
should gain support from people across the political spectrum
because the bill helps to protect innocent human life from being
exterminated outside the womb.  Moreover, because the bill focuses
on the partial-birth abortion procedure, it educates both the
Congress and the public about the reality of the abortion act.
<p>
Rep. Canady's bill already has more than 150 cosponsors on both
sides of the aisle.  (The Senate bill has six.)  The House Judiciary
Committee passed H.R. 1833 overwhelmingly in July, and even the
12-member American Medical Association's legislative council voted
<I>unanimously</I> to <I>endorse</I> the Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban Act.  When asked about the council's decision, one legislative
council representative called the procedure &quot;basically repulsive,&quot;
saying that it wasn't a &quot;recognized medical technique.&quot;
<p>
...And it isn't, or at least it shouldn't be.
<p>
First of all, partial-birth abortions involve aborting partially-delivered
babies from four and a half months into the pregnancy up to even
the <I>ninth month</I>.  The procedure consists of  partially
delivering the live baby feet first so that all but the head is
outside the mother's womb.  The head remains in the uterus while
the abortionist kills the baby by stabbing surgical scissors into
the base of its head, then suctioning out the brain by a small
tube, and then completing the delivery of the now-dead baby. 
The legislation makes it a crime to perform this procedure except
to save the mother's life.  A woman undergoing the abortion would
not be penalized and could not sue the abortionist, but the abortionist
could be punished  for up to two years in prison and/or fined.
<p>
Ohio Registered Nurse Brenda Pratt Shafer, who has assisted in
three partial-birth abortions, describes the process this way:
<p>
&quot;Dr. Haskell brought the ultrasound in and hooked it up so
that he could see the baby. On the ultrasound screen, I could see the heart 
beating. I asked Dr. Haskell, and he told me that, 'Yes, that is the heartbeat.'
 As Dr. Haskell watched the baby on the ultrasound screen, he
went in with forceps and grabbed the baby's legs and brought them
down into the birth canal.  Then he delivered the body and the
arms, all the way up to the neck.  At this point, only the baby's
head was still inside.  The baby's body was moving.  His little
fingers were clasping together.  He was kicking his feet.  All
the while his little head was still stuck inside.  Dr. Haskell
took a pair of scissors and inserted them into the back of the
baby's head.  Then he opened the scissors up.  Then he stuck the
high-powered suction tube into the hole and sucked the baby's
brains out.  I almost threw up as I watched him do these things....&quot;
<p>
&quot;I never realized how perfect these babies really are at
this point.  When you hear the word 'fetus,' I think a lot of
people think, as I did, of just a blob of cells, or a mass or
something.  It was very revealing to me.  I don't think about
abortion the same way anymore.&quot;
<p>
According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, the research arm of
Planned Parenthood, approximately 13,000 abortions every year
occur after the 20th week of pregnancy (four and a half months).
 While it is not known how many of these are partial-birth abortions,
two abortionists, including Dr. Haskell, have said publicly in
different interviews that they have performed 3,000 &quot;late
term&quot; abortions, including the partial-birth procedure, between
the two of them.  Rep. Canady's bill is a first step to preventing
the horror of late-term abortions.
<p>
Public opinion polls show that an overwhelming majority reject
late-term abortions.  Yet, the Supreme Court has never dealt with
the issue of a &quot;partially-born&quot; child.  The Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban Act will rightly outlaw the most barbaric of the
late-term abortion procedures.
<p>
Proponents of abortion will argue that all abortions are needed
in cases of &quot;health of the mother.&quot;  This reasoning
is flawed because typically, courts have defined &quot;health
of the mother&quot; clauses very broadly to encompass &quot;all
factors -- physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the
woman's age -- relevant to the well-being of the patient.&quot;
(<I>Doe v. Bolton</I>, 410 U.S.C. at 192 (1973), emphasis added.)
In fact, of the many reasons why a mother would elect to abort
her unborn child (i.e., parental disapproval, physical inconvenience,
emotional distress), none would fall outside the realm of this
&quot;exception.&quot;
<p>
Similarly, the case is often made for abortions that are &quot;medically
necessary.&quot;  However, this is equivalent to abortion on demand.
William Hamilton, vice president of the Planned Parenthood Federation
of America, told Knight-Ridder Newspapers that &quot;medically
necessary&quot; means &quot;anything a doctor and a woman construe
to be in her best interest, whether prenatal care or abortion.&quot;
Judith Feder, a Clinton Administration health official, stated
that &quot;the decision of the woman and the physician&quot; determines
whether a service can be considered &quot;medically necessary.&quot;
<p>
This modest legislation provides a means for a civil society to
register its objections by banning this unwarranted act of violence
against a helpless member of our human family.

<title>MANY COUPLES STILL WAITING TO ADOPT CHILDREN</title>

<body>

<p>
<h2>MANY COUPLES STILL WAITING<br>
TO ADOPT CHILDREN</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>

The National Council for Adoption (NCFA) conservatively estimates
that there are at least one million infertile and fertile couples
who are waiting to adopt children.[1] For every one adoptable infant
available, there are at least 40 couples hoping to adopt.[2] Today,
it is not unusual to pick up a local newspaper and find an advertisement
placed by a married couple searching for a child to adopt.
<p>
What is causing this high &quot;adoption demand&quot;? While the
answer is no doubt multi-faceted and complex, the following factors
have contributed to this phenomenon:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Plummeting adoption rates among unwed mothers --</b> Despite
the four-fold increase in the number of births to unmarried women
since 1967, the number of these unwed mothers choosing to place
their children for adoption declined by one-third during that
same time period.[3] Thus, while about one in five premarital births
to white women was placed for adoption in the late 1960s, by 1988,
this proportion had shrunk to one in 30.[4]
<p>
<li><b>Abortion</b> -- Approximately 1.5 million abortions take
place in the United States every year. About one-quarter of these
abortions are to teenagers, and more than four-fifths are to unmarried
mothers.[5] Each of these aborted pregnancies represents a potential
adoption; and if adoption rather than abortion were chosen in
these instances, the high adoption demand could be greatly alleviated.
<p>
<li><b>Infertility</b> -- The demand for adoptable babies remains
high due to continued infertility. Two sources of infertility
are examined below:
<p>
<b>Sexually-Transmitted Diseases (STDs)</b> -- The Alan Guttmacher
Institute estimates that between 100,000 and 150,000 women become
infertile each year as a result of an STD that has resulted in
pelvic inflammatory disease. Thus, of the 2.3 million U.S. couples
who are infertile, 15 to 30 percent are infertile or unable to
conceive as a result of an STD.[6] Furthermore, while the rate of
infertility remained about the same from 1967 to 1982 at 2.4 million
couples (or one couple in every seven), infertility among couples
aged 20-24 increased from 4 percent in 1965 to 11 percent in 1982.[7]
It is likely that a good portion of this increase in early-age
infertility is directly attributable to sexually-transmitted diseases.
<p>
<b>Delayed Marriage and/or Childbearing</b> -- Data shows that
more people are delaying marriage and postponing childbearing
until older ages. For example, the proportion of first-time brides
who were between 25 and 39 years of age rose from 11 percent in
1970 to 41 percent in 1990.[8] In addition, the percentage of women
reaching age 35 who were still childless increased from 15 percent
in 1980 to 21 percent in 1991.[9] These statistics are significant
because age is positively associated with elevated risks of infertility
and miscarriage.[10]
<p></ul>
Because prospective adoptive couples greatly outnumber available
adoptable children, there exist long waiting lists for children,
regardless of age, race, or &quot;special needs.&quot; Consider
the following:
<ul><p>
<li>Of the 51,157 American children who were adopted in 1986 (the
latest available published data on domestic adoptions by the NCFA),
approximately one-half (24,589) were adoptions of healthy infants
(under 2 years of age) of all races and ethnic backgrounds. The
remainder were adoptions of older children or children with &quot;special
needs&quot; (physical, mental or emotional disabilities, being
part of a sibling group, etc.).[11]
<p>
<li>Babies, regardless of medical problems, are in particularly
high demand. There are waiting lists of couples who would like
to adopt infants with Downs Syndrome or spina bifida. The National
Downs Syndrome Adoption Exchange reports they have more than 100
approved families waiting to adopt children with Downs Syndrome.
There are also a large number of couples who would like to adopt
terminally-ill babies, including babies with AIDS.[12]
<p>
<li>In addition to the 50,000 domestic adoptions each year, American
couples or individuals adopt several thousand foreign-born children.
Begun first as a solution to emergency situations in foreign countries,
these adoptions have now become an important adoption alternative.
</ul><p>
<center><h4>Number of foreign adoptions by year, 1973-1994:[13]</h4>

4,323  5,446  6,290   7,051  6,854  5,652  4,864  5,139  4,868  5,749  7,127

</pre></center>
<p>
The numbers of foreign adoptions per year does not follow a recognizable
trend because intercountry adoptions are driven by supply. For
example, the Korean government has been on the front lines in
facilitating adoption. As a result, thousands of Korean children
were adopted by American citizens, accounting for the swell in
intercountry adoptions during the mid-1980s.[14] But even when foreign
governments fail to facilitate adoption, the demand for children
remains high. For example, after it aired a story on abandoned
Romanian infants, ABC-TV's &quot;20/20&quot; reported that it
received over 25,000 self-addressed stamped envelopes from individuals
wanting to adopt Romanian orphans.[15]
<p>
The &quot;adoption demand,&quot; though a large problem, could
<I>theoretically</I> be erased or at least drastically reduced
if more pregnant women chose to adoption rather than abortion
or if more unwed mothers chose adoption rather than single parenting.
However, until the adoption option is chosen by more of these
mothers in <I>reality</I>, many of these couples' desires to adopt
children will remain unfulfilled.

<p>
After presidential candidate Bill Clinton vowed to make abortion "safe, legal, and rare," President Clinton and his administration devised a somewhat bizarre strategy to help accomplish that goal. Within days of assuming office, the president signed four executive orders addressing abortion: He lifted the ban on fetal tissue research; he ended the ban on abortion counseling in federally funded clinics; he began a process to approve the abortion pill RU 486; and he revoked the prohibition against abortions in military hospitals overseas. All these policies would seem to increase the accessibility and likelihood of abortion.<p>
Even so, it is remarkable that abortion does seem to be slightly rarer. The total number of abortions in America dropped by 80,000 in 1992, hitting its lowest level since 1979. Abortion rates, declining for more than a decade, dropped again, to under 26 per 1,000 women of child-bearing age. There was a decrease as well in the percentage of pregnancies ending in abortion, from a high of about 30 percent in 1983-85 to less than 27.5 percent in 1992. For the first time since Roe v. Wadethe Supreme Court ruling that repealed every state law restricting abortionwe have seen significant declines in all three categories for measuring abortion in America. And, though statistics aren't yet available, abortion providers expect to see lower numbers for 1993 and 1994.<p>
Why? <p>
The evidence for a decline in abortion is, admittedly, incomplete. Many states don't collect the sort of data required to draw solid conclusionssuch as precise, annual figures for abortions, teen pregnancies, and illegitimate births. And whatever the decline in abortion, the descent has not been terribly steep. From 1980 to 1990, the annual figure wobbled between 1.55 million and 1.61 million. Though abortions performed in 1992 dropped to 1.53 million, the figure represents only a 5 percent decline from its 1990 peak.<p>
There seem to be at least four reasons for this slight decline. Over the last several years, we have witnessed a social movement to encourage teenagers to postpone sexual relations until marriage, increased professionalism and sensitivity in the nation's pro-life pregnancy care centers, growth in state laws fostering a fully informed abortion decision, and a decline in the number of doctors who perform abortions.<p><center><b>Learning to Wait</b></center><p>
Until recently, the prevailing approach for reducing the level of abortion has been to encourage contraceptive use, while reserving abortion as a fall-back solution. The assumption of this approach is that it is impossible to reduce sexual activity among teens or adults outside of marriage. Advocates of this position hope there are fewer abortion clients because women are making more efficient use of contraceptives. According to Susan Tew of the Alan Guttmacher Institute, the proportion of unplanned pregnancies actually increased in the 1980s, from 54 percent in 1982 to 56 percent in 1988, the latest year for which figures are available. Tew says that women who are "young, poor, unwed, and minority" are more likely to have abortions, less likely to find access to contraceptives, and to understand the relative risks and benefits of various methods. More recent survey data indicates that the use of oral contraceptives and condoms is increasing; the latter may be due to heightened awareness of the dangers of sexually transmitted diseases.<p>
However, part of the recent drop in abortions could be attributed more to a decline in teenage sexual activity than a rise in contraceptive use. Studies by the Centers for Disease Control have shown the proportion of sexually experienced highschoolers dropping: In 1989, 59 percent engaged in intercourse, in 1991 the figure was 54 percent, and in 1992 it dropped to 43 percent. A 1994 Roper Starch survey, conducted in association with the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States, found that only 36 percent of high schoolers said they had had sex. In the latter survey, many of those who had "done it" wished they hadn't: 62 percent of sexually experienced girls, and 54 percent of all experienced high schoolers, said they "should have waited." <p>
Confirmation of these sentiments is found in an Emory University survey that asked 1,000 sexually active young teen girls what topic they wanted more information about. Nearly 85 percent checked "How to say no without hurting the other person's feelings." The meaning of politeness has shifted in one generation from "nice girls don't" to "nice girls have to."<p>
Abstinence-education programs across the country have found that telling kids not to have sex is surprisingly successful. A Title XX performance evaluation found that, two years after the Sex Respect program, non-participants were twice as likely as participants to have gotten pregnant. When the Teen Aid program moved into a California junior-high school, 147 students were reported pregnant; two years later, only 20 girls were pregnant. At a Chicago middle school, each eighth-grade graduating class usually included some pregnant girls; but three years of Project Taking Charge yielded three classes with no pregnant graduates.<p>
One of the most unusual success stories is that of True Love Waits, a program begun by a Baptist youth pastor in Tennessee. It offers adolescents a chance to sign "pledge cards" vowing virginity until marriage. What sounds to hip and aging baby boomers like boring prudery was seized by teenagers with an eagerness their parents had reserved for hula hoops. In one year, 500,000 cards were signed, and the program has spread across 26 denominations, Catholic and Protestant. Last July, 20,000 kids staked 200,000 of the cards on the Washington Mall, and spent the day dancing and picknicking. President Clinton came by for a few minutes to join them.<p><center><b>Rising Moral Concerns</center></b>
<p>
A rise in youthful morality about sex outside marriage is paralleled by moral concerns about abortion. A recent CBS/New York Times poll found that, while 46 percent of respondents said that abortion is murder, the age group most likely to voice that opinion was 18 to 29. In 1990, a series of focus groups was conducted by researchers for the Center for Population Options, exploring teens' attitudes toward abortion. To the authors' evident dismay, "In response to the question, 'What first comes into your head when you hear the word "abortion"?' participantsregardless of race, sex, or residencemost often responded with 'murder,' 'killing a baby' or 'death.'In general, the female participants were especially judgmental of other women's motivesin some cases not even sanctioning abortion in the case of rape. Comments focused on the 'innocence' of the baby, regardless of the circumstances."<p>
The growing concern about the "innocence" of the baby has not yet led to a change in attitudes about the legality of abortion. For example, a periodic NBC/Wall Street Journal poll asks, "Do you think abortion should be illegal, or not?" In eight surveys between 1989 and 1993, those responding "illegal" wavered from 33 percent to 26 percent and back up to 35 percent, a wobbly but fairly consistent response. Nor does a conviction that abortion is wrong necessarily insure that the respondent would refuse to have one. While researching for my book, Real Choices, I interviewed women across the country who had had abortions, and found several who had been pro-life, committed Christians at the time. They fully believed that in choosing abortion they were killing their babies. A common coping mechanism was, "God, I'll send this baby back to you now, and when I'm ready you send it back to me." Anti-abortion opinions did not prevent them from having abortions when their situations felt overwhelmingly difficult.<p>
The goal of my research project was to discover why women had abortions, in hopes that we could reduce the numbers by solving pregnancy problems. Like the Guttmacher Institute and other researchers' studies, I found that women usually have several interconnecting reasons for their abortions, involving job, school, finances, present concerns, and fears for the future. However, when I asked women to recount the story of their abortion decision, one factor emerged as determinative nearly every time: problems in personal relationships. Almost 90 percent of the women surveyed said the main reason for the abortion was to please or protect some other person, usually a partner or parents. When asked, "What would you have needed to continue the pregnancy?" the answer was consistent and emphatic: "Just one person. If I'd had only one person to stand by me, I would have had my baby."<p><b><center>Compassion and Persuasion</b></center><p>
The pregnancy-care wing of the pro-life movement has been trying to provide that personal support and friendship for 30 years, with increasing professionalism and success. This care usually shows up in the form of pregnancy-care centers, humble storefront operations scattered across the land, where material and emotional support is given to women free. These centers are usually run on a shoestringmany have no paid staffand they can only give what others donate, from maternity clothes and diapers to housing, job training, medical care, and advice on adoption and parenting. <p>
In these pages a few years ago ("Victorian Secret," Spring 1992), Marvin Olasky suggested that aid to pregnant women was more effective than legal prohibitions in reducing abortion rates in the 19th century. Are advances in the provision of pregnancy support an element in the reduced number of abortions? "There just isn't enough information there to say, one way or the other," Olasky says. "But certainly the pregnancy-care movement has been tremendously effective in keeping the numbers as low as they are. Without pro-lifers offering support and shelter to pregnant women over the years, the abortion toll would have been far higher."<p>
Some pregnancy-care centers are independent operations, while others affiliate with national chains. The two largest chains are Birthright and Care Net, which together represent about 1,000 centers. In these chains and elsewhere, the last few years have seen a shift toward a philosophy sometimes summarized in the slogan, "Love them both." Pam Stearns, director of the Hope Unlimited Pregnancy Care Center in Paducah, Kentucky, says, "Before, we had pictures of aborted fetuses right in the lobbywe had an aggressive agenda of saving the baby. Now the focus has been enlarged, and our mission is to serve the client. Everything is done to make her feel comfortable, not used and manipulated." Today, a visitor to the Paducah center will see landscapes and flowers in the lobby, and be greeted by a volunteer who listens carefully to her needs and fears.<p>
A unexpected phenomenon that may be implicated in the drop in abortion rates is being observed at these pregnancy-care centers: an increased demand for grief counseling, for men as well as women. Several pregnancy center directors say that this is becoming their fastest-expanding area of service. Staff at a center in South Carolina report, for example, that while they usually start one grief group per month, in January they had to start three, plus their first men's group. <p>
For many years, abortion mourning had no outlet; as one Real Choices interviewee, Bette, put it, pro-choice friends needed her to continue affirming her decision, and she feared revealing to pro-lifers that "I did what you despise." Now, as women find the freedom to tell their friends about their heartbreak, it may become a form of negative word-of-mouth advertising that could cause others to avoid abortion. In theory, both pro-life and pro-choice forces have an interest in helping women make the best resolution they can, but Bette goes on, "I was surprised at the way [pro-life] people accepted me. They were able to recognize and validate my pain. The pro-choice side can't do thatthey have too much need to pretend that it isn't there."<p><center><b>Legislating for Life</b></center><p>
State laws to encourage informed decisions about abortion have multiplied in recent years and seem to have achieved some results. Nineteen states require that clinics provide information on the development of the baby, as well as the risks of and alternatives to abortion; 11 require women to wait 24 hours for "reflection"; 24 states require a parent to be involved before a teen's abortion.<p>
It should be noted that none of these laws actually places restrictions on abortion. No one is prevented from having the procedure. The Supreme Court's stipulation in the Casey decision of 1992 was that such laws were valid only if abortion was still permitted in all situations, with no "undue burden" placed on the freedom to abort. If women are declining abortion because more information and time to think have increased their awareness of alternatives, that is an expansion of choice, not a restriction. No one's business has been inhibited. Big-city yellow pages still run display ads by providers offering to end pregnancies up through the 24th week, with specialists available around the country to perform them later on request.<p>
In 1991, the American Journal of Public Health published an article examining the effect of a parental-notification law in Minnesota. During the four years the law was in effect, the abortion rate for minors fell dramatically27 percentwhile the birth rate continued to fall in accord with a long-term trend. Overall, teen pregnancy was down 21 percent. The hopeful conclusion is that the law did not merely stop abortions, but caused teens to be more careful about preventing pregnancy. According to the report, "Positive claims about these laws are that they promote responsibility (by encouraging teenagers to 'think before they act'), foster parent-child communication, facilitate mature decision making, and may reveal medical history information that would otherwise remain unknown to the physician."<p><b><center>Market Realities</b></center><p>
Another explanation for the decline in abortions is that fewer doctors will perform the procedure. Between 1985 and 1988, there were an average of 33 fewer abortion providers every year; by the 1988 to 1992 period, the yearly loss had accelerated to 51. Part of this loss is due to the "graying of abortion providers," as the average age of a provider slips above the average age of physicians, and retirement claims an increasing proportion. Some doctors leave the field because of harassment or fear of violence; the increased cost of security is one reason the average price of an abortion rose from $250 in 1988 to $300 in 1992.<p>
Why aren't younger doctors entering the field?<p>
To an idealistic young doctor, abortion has little appealit's fundamentally a destructive operation, offering little professional challenge, and no ongoing doctor-patient relationship. In addition, other doctors hold abortion providers in low esteem. Warren Hern, an abortion specialist in Boulder, Colorado, complains that his fellow providers "are treated as a pariah by the medical community. At best, we are tolerated." In 1993, the controversial Project Choice survey (staged by pro-life activists under a sympathetic-sounding name) polled almost a thousand abortion providers; 69 percent said their profession was "not respected in the medical community" and 78 percent said that they did not feel "pro-choice organizations and politicians are doing enough to support those who provide abortion care." <p>
A better question is, in the face of these discouragements, why did older doctors join the field? Thirty years ago, doctors were still seeing women come into emergency rooms injured by self-abortion or illegal abortion, and it was possible to see the provision of legal abortion as a noble, lifesaving act. Seventy-one percent of the Project Choice respondents had "personally [seen] a tragedy as a result of an illegal abortion," another subtle indication of their age. Younger doctors have not had that galvanizing experience. On the other hand, they have had experience with more recent medical advances: sonograms and fetoscopy, fetal surgery, and the rescuing of ever-younger preemies. All of these make indelibly visible what abortionlegal or illegaldestroys. Likewise, it was easier to feel positive about delivering abortions when only a few desperate cases were envisioned; the routine toll of 1.5 million a year sours everybody. <p>
Abortion provision is a specialty that is not intrinsically rewarding, is held in low esteem by the public and medical colleagues alike, and exposes one to the risk of hatred or even violence from protesters. When an aspiring doctor thinks, "What do I want to be?" a great many other options will come to mind before this. <p>
The dwindling ranks of abortion providers seem to be helping to bring down the abortion rates in some states. Nationally, there are about four providers per 100,000 women of reproductive age. In Hawaii, where the relative number of providers is 19.6, the abortion rate is the second highest in the country. In states such as Kentucky and Missouri, with fewer than 1.5 providers, the abortion rate hovers between one fourth and one half the national average.<p>
If there are fewer abortion providers available, would women, in large numbers, resort to self-inflicted abortions? Or would they simply cross state lines to have abortions elsewhere? The answers are no and perhaps. Though the number of providers has already dropped, there is simply no evidence that illegal abortion has returned. It may be that illegal abortion has been so thoroughly discredited that no woman wants to risk it.<p>
Some travel would undoubtedly occur: In 1987, more Wyoming women had abortions out-of-state than in-state. (In Cheyenne, the state's largest city, no abortions were performed in 1992.) On the other hand, abortion rates tend to be higher for poor non-white or Hispanic women, who are less likely to have the resources to travel. Then again, they are more likely to live in metropolitan areas where providers already cluster (94 percent of non-metropolitan areas now have no provider). Making state-by-state predictions is maddeningly uncertain, however. Between 1988 and 1992, North Dakota went from three providers to one, and the abortion rate dropped 28 percent. South Dakota remained steady with only one provider, and the rate rose 19 percent.<p><b><center>The Age Factor</b></center><p>
A final consideration of the drop in abortions involves age: As the baby boomers get older, the cohort of women of reproductive age (15 to 44) is weighted more heavily toward the end, where fewer pregnancies occur. Since two thirds of all abortions are performed on women under 25, the abortion rate should drop when the size of that group shrinks. The decline in the ranks of females age 15 to 22 from 1988 to 1992 could account for one-sixth of the decline in abortions over this period.<p>
Among the uncertainties regarding the abortion decline, one unhappy certainty looms: A great many more women are choosing single parenting. In 1981, births to unwed mothers occurred at the rate of 30 per 1,000 women of childbearing age, rising to 39 by 1988 and 45 by 1991. Pregnancy-care centers report that most of their unwed clients who choose birth opt for single parenting, while only a tiny number choose adoption. Amid a growing social consensus that unwed parenting damages both mother and child, these statistics are discouraging. Prochoice advocates may think that abortion would have been a better choice; pro-lifers would rather see these children born than aborted, but would prefer their moms either marry or place the child for adoption. Both sides agree that prevention is better than cure.<p>
The drop in abortion numbers in 1992 is a tantalizingly cryptic event. Analyzing it is like trying to follow the action of a play with the curtain risen only far enough to show the actors' ankles. No one on any side in this debate, much less the confused folks in the middle, can predict what will happen next. But a scrap of information like this does tantalize, because the abortion issue reverberates with meanings beyond itself. Abortion asks us big questions about "Life, the Universe, and Everything." It asks ultimate questions like, "Who belongs in our human family?" "Who may kill?" and "When does life begin?"<p>
For the last question, at least, there is an answer. It is 23. Life begins at 23 pairs of chromosomesor, for those with Down's syndrome, 23 pairs plus one. Unless that number were somehow repealed, it matters little whether the other numbers are a million-point-five or a million-point-six. It's still more than 4,000 every day, more than 31 million since Roe v. Wade; it's still a number that prods our weary consciences, a little more sternly every day.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
	Soaring rates of illegitimacy are threatening America's social fabric. But Members of Congress and state officials, as they wrestle with the problems of reforming America's welfare system, can design a functional public policy to combat adolescent pregnancy and illegitimate births. This policy should be based on personal responsibility, including sexual abstinence.
<p>
	For the last quarter century, government has pursued a pragmatic "contraceptive approach" to adolescent pregnancy. This approach has been a costly failure because it generally ignores basic realities of culture and developmental psychology. The "abstinence approach," on the other hand, successfully incorporates the basic cultural and psychological realities of the transition to adulthood. By inculcating individual "resistance skills," abstinence becomes more firmly established the more widely it is applied, which in turn has a beneficial effect on social norms.
<p>
	In a healthy society, individuals are motivated by hope for the future rather than instant gratification, and rely on social skills rather than technology to overcome interpersonal problems. These are precisely the qualities abstinence promotes. Without personal responsibility, which is recognized throughout society as the basic requirement for life achievement, attempts to reform the current dysfunctional system can have only minor, inconsequential results.

<p>	Taxpayers' money should be used only for social programs that work. If state officials are going to administer these programs, with funding transferred in block grants to the states, they should focus on attacking illegitimacy directly. This includes using funds for abstinence counseling, not merely contraception, and for adoption rather than abortion.1 While plans advanced by the Clinton Administration and the Senate Republican leadership ignore abstinence education as a way to help control illegitimacy, the proposal by Senators Lauch Faircloth (R-NC), Phil Gramm (R-TX), and John Ashcroft (R-MO) earmarks $200 million for such education under the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant.2<p>	Young people who want to avoid poverty and dependency can do three things: complete high-school; get a job, even a low-paying one; and have children only within marriage. For several decades, this formula has been ignored in the development of public policy as increasing numbers of unmarried teenage mothers have slipped out of school, out of the economic mainstream, and into dependence. Many remain dependent for long periods of time in spite of attempts by policymakers to reform this key aspect of welfare.3<p>	Responding to growing public concern, President Clinton and many Members of Congress have attempted to focus welfare reform efforts on the illegitimacy crisis. Unfortunately, although official Washington's rhetoric has been stirring, many of these proposals are unchanged from the existing failed strategy.
<p>	While no one can dispute the health advantages of abstinence, and while most people would admit that it is the socially, developmentally, and psychologically appropriate course for an adolescent, there are many who assert that abstinence is impossible for an adolescent. This assertion is groundless. For decades, if not centuries, sexual abstinence was expected of unmarried individuals in Western society. According to the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), abstinence was the norm among unmarried American teenage girls at least until 1982.4 The best of the recent surveys of high school age youth (young people 14-17 years old) was conducted as part of the National Health Interview Survey of 1992. This survey showed that 56.6 percent of adolescents were virgins.5 A series of surveys conducted over the last 25 years by <i>Who's Who Among American Highschool Students</i> shows that only one in four top students is sexually active. This suggests that abstinence is not only possible, but associated with high levels of personal achievement.6<p><b>UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES</b><p>	Recognizing the struggles and special needs of single parents, American public policy throughout this century has experimented with various forms of aid. Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) began as Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) in the 1935 Social Security Act but was modeled on the cash-grant "Mothers' Aid" programs that various states had developed several decades earlier. As these modest, supervised programs expanded due to legislation, regulations, and court decisions, there was growing concern that for many, welfare dependency was becoming a permanent status, not a transitional phase. A cultural shift accompanied this program expansion: Where previously there was a social and often legal presumption against the ability of an unmarried teenager to raise a child, the perception began to arise that giving birth outside marriage was not only socially acceptable, but also without consequence to children born and raised 
in non-formed families.7<p>	The family is responsible for the basic socialization of children, and when the family breaks down or is never fully formed, children are most affected. They suffer in health, education, and emotional development.8 This is well-documented, but a few facts help to suggest the human impact. White girls growing up fatherless are two and a half times more likely to have a child out of wedlock. For a fatherless white child, the chances of finishing high school drop 40 percent; for a fatherless black child, they drop 70 percent. Yet, as welfare recipients increased in number, in some neighborhoods, children dependent not on a father and mother but on the state became the norm rather than the exception. In these areas, welfare programs are the dominant legal economic force, and recipiency is common among young women.
<p>
	Recognizing that in many communities there is a cycle of poverty, public policy should be concerned about how dependency is transmitted from one generation to the next. Welfare traditionally has focused on adult female recipients; however, their children also merit increased concern. This is especially true for boys growing up without the guidance of fathers in neighborhoods where few boys have the example of fathers who support the family. They are raised by peers on the streets, without social norms, achievable goals, or hope. In the worst cases, their lives are marked by violence and crime, and end early. This is just one more area in which a program meant to do good spawns social disorganization and cultural turmoil.9<p>	Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY) relates a conversation between a social scientist who was visiting a poor neighborhood in Chicago and an adolescent living there. The visitor asked the child what she would do when she grew up and was told that she "would draw." Sensing some hope in the bleak surroundings, the visitor asked a follow-up question: "What would you draw?" The girl's answer: "Welfare, like my mother."10 Although the fate of this particular child is not known, examples abound of the subtle yet pervasive draw of welfare in urban areas.<p>	The United States is not alone in its perplexing re-examination of the social effects of such relief programs. A similar review is underway in Britain, where the out-of-wedlock birthrate has risen from 5 percent in 1960 to the current 30 percent. British analysts examining the impact on children note that the weakened family damages society as well, both in taxes and in other social costs, including crime: Armed robberies increased by a factor of eleven in England and Wales between 1970 and 1991.11<p>	The United States is heading in the same direction. Census Bureau figures released in August 1994 show that 19 percent of white children live in single-parent families. Among Hispanics and blacks, the proportions of children living in si
ngle-parent families are 31 percent and 49 percent, respectively. The deleterious influence of single-parent households on welfare costs is apparent to most observers, regardless of political persuasion. Solid welfare reform depends on reducing the proportion of children living in single-parent families. This obviously entails a drastic slowing of illegitimate births, especially illegitimate births to teens. The consensus about illegitimacy and welfare reform breaks down, however, when it comes to how births to unmarried teens are to be reduced. Liberals often recommend increased contraceptive education for teenagers and resort to abortion when contraception fails. Conservatives generally favor a new emphasis on responsibility, virtue, and sexual abstinence in a broad cultural setting.
<p>

<b>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION AND WELFARE REFORM: A CASE STUDY</b>
<p>
	In the 103rd Congress, the Clinton Administration's welfare reform bill (S. 2224) sat sidetracked as intense attention was given health care reform. The bill proposed "to redesign the program of aid to dependent children... [and among other things] prevents dependency.... " Detailed summaries of the bill and Sections 505 and 506 also described the "Teen Pregnancy Prevention Grant Program" by which 1,000 schools and community-based groups would receive grants for "teen pregnancy prevention strategies." Although the bill itself never mentioned the abstinence strategy, this six-page narrative summary includes three surprising references: to "the delay of sexual activity" (twice) and to "premature sexual behavior" (once). Given the growing cultural awareness of the inherent soundness of a prevention strategy based on sexual abstinence, this language seemed to promise dramatic change -- but not for long. These references, when translated into the bureaucratic language of Clinton Administration planners and policies, were contradicted and emptied of meaning.12<p>	<b>Reading the Fine Print.</b> Consider what the Administration meant by "delay of sexual activity" or "premature sexual activity." In the first place, neither "abstinence" nor any related term was to be found in the Administration document. There was no statement that sexual activity is inappropriate for teens or best expressed within marriage. Instead of clearly stating its intentions, the Administration discussed teenage sexual activity with such vague words as "delay" or "premature." Clinton's policy team at the Department of Health and Human Services has a long track record of using ordinary language in misleading ways. For instance, sexual intercourse is "premature" for pre-teens or early teens (11 or 13-year-olds) and should be "delayed" until the age of 16 or 17 years, at which point programs that teach sexual "delay" can shift to contraceptive education. The basis for this educational shift was apparent in the language of the bill summary:
<blockquote>
	Particular emphasis must be paid to the delay of sexual activity and prevention of pregnancy before marriage. Programs that combine these elements have shown the most promise, especially for adolescents who are motivated to avoid pregnancy until they are married.
</blockquote>
	It becomes apparent that "delay of sexual activity" and "prevention of pregnancy" are two very different and contradictory directions.
<p>
	The Clinton document is further decoded by examining the next sentence: "Programs that combine these elements have shown the most promise." The word "combine" refers to the current vogue in sex education of giving the "delay/abstinence" message to young children and then "combining" it with the contraceptive strategy for middle and older teens. Although touted as having "the most promise," this approach has not been effective; only the abstinence component has shown any positive effect.13<p>	These combination programs are called "abstinence plus" by their supporters, largely because they find a way to include the government contraceptive promotion programs that planners favor. The notion that adolescent sexual activity can be divided into two categories -- premature and mature -- did not originate with the policymakers of the Clinton Administration.14 Yet only in a time of policy confusion could such a notion gain a foothold in government programs. Like "safe drug use," "mature adolescent sexual activity" is a contradiction in terms.<p><b>EVOLUTION OF SOCIAL RESPONSE TO UNWED PREGNANCY</b><p>	Expert opinion about teenage pregnancy has undergone continuous change through the last three decades. The grave consequences of high rates of illegitimate births among blacks were first brought to the public's attention by Senator Moynihan in the early 1960s when he was a policy advisor in the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson. At the time Moynihan issued his first earnest warnings, the proportion of illegitimate births among blacks was about 28 percent -- slightly less than the proportion in society at large today.
<p>
	In the late 1960s, rising levels of premarital sexual activity among many ethnic groups led to concern about the epidemic of births to teenagers. This notion of an epidemic of teen births flourished among policymakers and the public for two decades, despite the fact that demographers such as Maris Vinovskis have shown that the teenage birth rate fell steadily through the 1960s and 1970s. Even a pause in this decline in the late 1980s did not erase the fact that the birth rate to teenage mothers is significantly less now than forty years ago. The number of births to unmarried teens, however, has risen dramatically. The understanding that the epidemic of births to teen mothers is really an epidemic of illegitimacy did not gain currency among policymakers until the 1990s.
<p>
	The success of programs designed to resolve social problems such as teen illegitimacy depends on how those problems are defined. To talk of an "epidemic of births" among teens suggests that teen pregnancy is a medical problem, which in turn suggests that medical science can produce a remedy. In the minds of many social scientists and government policymakers, the obvious answer to this supposed medical problem was to provide teens with birth control drugs and devices. Thus, the federal government's formal family planning program, Title X, passed in 1970 with the general understanding that it would continue to follow the practice of previous efforts by providing services only to married women, soon became strongly oriented to providing contraceptives to unmarried teens.15<p>	Due to the huge growth in the number of abortions among adolescents during the middle and late 1970s, the number of births to teenage mothers declined while the number of teen pregnancies rose dramatically. By the mid-1980s, efforts to reduce teenage pregnancy through sex education and contraception were having no beneficial effect -- perhaps even a deleterious effect.16 About this time, however, it was becoming clear that AIDS also could be a disease of heterosexuals. Very quickly, the problem of teenage sexuality was redefined: The major threat now was sexually transmitted disease.
<p>
	Until a few years ago, the prevailing view among health educators such as Debra Haffner17 was that it was useless to try to frighten teenagers with the consequences of sexual activity. Increasing fear about AIDS, for instance, would render teens unable to take positive action, such as condom use, which could reduce the risk of AIDS transmission. Of course, in this view, the possibility of paralyzing teenagers with fear went only so far; they did not believe, for instance, that fear-induced paralysis would render teenagers reluctant or unable to engage in sexual activity.
<p>
	The evolution of sex education programs has been described at length by Douglas Kirby, Ph.D., of ETR Associates in Scotts Valley, California. Kirby has categorized sex education curricula into four generations. The first generation "focused primarily on increasing students' knowledge about sexuality and on emphasizing the risks and consequences of pregnancy."18 The second placed more emphasis on values clarification and decision-making skills. The third developed "in reaction or opposition to" the first two. Kirby describes the third generation in the following terms:
<blockquote>
	Concerned that the first two generations of programs were "value free," and supported by a moralistic and ideological fervor, a different group of people developed programs consistently emphasizing the message that young people should not engage in intercourse until marriage. To avoid any possibility of a double message, these programs commonly did not discuss contraception.19</blockquote>	The fourth generation of programs, including one of Kirby's, "represents a synthesis of the first three." These programs "are neither value-free nor moralistic.... Instead, they emphasize that it is a good idea for young teenagers to delay sex and that it is important for all young people to practice effective contraception if they are going to have sex."20<p>	Kirby notes that the first generation of programs imparted knowledge about sex but failed to achieve the desired results: "It has subsequently become more widely recognized... that knowledge about issues such as contraception is only weakly related to behavior, and that increased knowledge may not produce much of a reduction in risk-taking behavior."21 As for the second generation, which stressed values clarification, "when specific values were not given prominent emphasis in the course, there was little evidence of impact."22 Kirby concedes that the third generation (based on abstinence) managed in the short run to change attitudes about premarital intercourse. With regard to changing behavior through abstinence, Kirby remarks that few published studies have examined this topic and notes that "the methods used in those studies have been somewhat limited, but thus far those evaluations indicate that the programs did not delay intercourse or reduce frequency of intercourse."23<p>	Kirby reserves his praise for fourth-generation programs, which he says have shown an ability to delay the initiation of intercourse. He arrives at this result by assigning a program, Postponing Sexual Involvement, to the fourth generation despite the fact that it was funded by the federa
l government as an abstinence-only program. To justify his categorization, Kirby argues that "Although the program focused on delaying sexual intercourse, Postponing Sexual Involvement was not moralistic, and it differed in other important ways from the third generation of programs."24 The nature of these important differences is never explained.
<p>
	This account of the evolution of teen pregnancy prevention programs is artificial and does not comport fully with the classifications of funding agencies. Moreover, Kirby's classifications dilute the effect of abstinence-only programs. Programs that are similar in content and approach are segregated according to whether they are considered moralistic. This points out a central feature of the academic discussion of adolescent sex: Academics and policymakers generally focus only on the physical consequences of sexual activity, such as pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease. Psychological and spiritual consequences of early sexual involvement rarely receive consideration. Even topics like the coercion of teenage girls by older males, which would seem certain to elicit strong reactions, until very recently have not garnered much attention from academics and policymakers.
<p>
	Though Kirby's analysis fails to give abstinence programs the credit they deserve, it does contain some interesting news: Abstinence programs can be successful without an overt appeal to traditional morality. There appears to be enough evidence about the health and career advantages of abstinence to persuade most young adolescents that it is the best course to follow. Indeed, overt appeals to morality actually may work against the success of an abstinence program for certain teenage audiences. For those adolescents who regard themselves more as consumers in a marketplace of ideas than as heirs to the intellectual heritage of their parents, traditional values and good ideas must be marketed creatively.
<p>
	Fourth-generation, or "abstinence plus," sex education programs are sophisticated and well-presented but have not demonstrated success in delaying the initiation of sexual activity. They can claim success only by defining it in very broad terms. They claim success when sexual initiation is delayed, when frequency of sexual activity is decreased, or when contraceptive use is increased. Promoters of "abstinence-only" programs in general do not even bother to measure frequency of sexual activity or use of contraceptives, for they realize that social and psychological damage results from the premature initiation of sexual activity. Using contraceptives merely avoids part of the adverse consequences of sex for a teen.
<p>
	Ignoring the psychological realities of teenage sex also helps demonstrate why "abstinence plus" programs are not likely to be successful. Teenagers in these programs understand that they are being offered two mutually exclusive lines of behavior by adults associated with trusted institutions. If these options are presented as equally good, teens naturally will pick the one that costs them less -- or, put another way, that forces them to relinquish less. It is no surprise that even highly touted "abstinence plus" programs such as Reducing the Risk have not managed to increase abstinence.
<p>

<b>ADOLESCENTS AND THE RISKS THEY FACE</b>
<p>
	Many adolescents face multiple risks in the transition to adulthood: lack of future orientation and discipline, poverty, dropping out of school, family instability, pressures for sexual activity, alcohol and drug abuse. Although adolescents, because of their developmental status, tend to misunderstand and minimize the seriousness of these risks, the phenomenon is more pronounced in youths who lack real direction in their lives.25<p>	Teenagers generally have other developmental limitations as well. According to developmental psychologist Erik Erikson, adolescents are incapable of the intimacy that comes with committed love. Also, on the practical side, adolescents are poor and inconsistent contraceptors even though current oral contraceptives are low-dose formulations that should be taken every day at the same time.
<p>
	In dealing with children with multiple risks, the Clinton Administration argues that "for those populations where adolescent pregnancy is a symptom of deeper problems, education and contraceptive services alone will be inadequate; they must be part of a much wider spectrum of services." This correctly identifies the need for intensive services for adolescents who believe, because of cultural or peer pressure, that having children out of wedlock is a desirable goal. One defect of this strategy, however, is the inclusion of the contraceptive element; adolescents would be left to the same risks and cultural pressures, only with suggestions to go about them more carefully. This guarantees that the "new" approach would collapse upon itself.
<p>
	<b>Personal Responsibility.</b> A safe transition to adulthood requires the development of self-respect, self-restraint, and orientation to achievable life goals, summed up in the traditional recognition that the successful and good life requires the cultivation of virtue. Adult direction, good counsel along the way, and growth in virtue are all essential to youth. Yet adolescents with multiple risks (such as unformed families, low levels of education, or low socioeconomic status) are excluded all but systematically from this vision of life; it is assumed to be impossible for them. At the same time, they are exposed constantly to the most self-destructive behaviors, including illegal drug and alcohol use. Adolescents at high risk for self-destructive behavior also have the greatest need for life orientation, hope, and virtue.
<P>
	If personal virtue is the key to responsible adulthood, programs that claim to prevent dependency must address the real needs of adolescents by focusing on these elements and equipping young people for adult responsibilities. Any other program modifications will not be worth the effort.
<P>

<b>TEENS, CONTRACEPTION, AND BIRTH</b>
<p>
	Casual observers often attribute the rise in single-parent households to a putative rise in the teen birth rate. This is not entirely accurate. As noted above, historically speaking, the teen birth rate is at a low level. The National Center for Health Statistics makes this point precisely: In 1970 the birth rate for 15-19 year olds was 68.3 for every thousand girls of that age; in 1992, it was 60.7. During the same period, the rate of births to unmarried teens almost doubled, rising from 22.4 per thousand to 44.6 per thousand.26 Nevertheless, the birthrate for unmarried teens is still less than the birthrate for unmarried women in their twenties. It is these illegitimate births among adolescents and young adults which have particular relevance to welfare programs and policies. The epidemic of illegitimacy among all age groups is a cultural rather than a biological or technical problem. The remedy must be cultural as we<p>

	President Clinton's Work and Responsibility Act of 1994 is probably a good indication of future liberal policy proposals. It acknowledged that the increase in illegitimate births to adolescent mothers has a serious impact on the nation's social welfare system, and Sections 505 and 506 ostensibly answered the problem of births to unwed teenage mothers. Unfortunately, it seems the Clinton plan tried to rectify the problem of early unwed motherhood through sex education and school-based clinics featuring contraception. The Work and Responsibility Act presupposed these techniques would cause teens to have intercourse in ways that reduce the likelihood of pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease. The Act identified this as "sexual responsibilit<p>

	This attempt to make sexual activity safe for teens is not novel; its failures are visible everywhere. Except for a pause in the early 1980s, pregnancy rates for 15-19 year olds have risen over the last 25 years to the present high of 111 pregnancies for every thousand girl<p>

	Another unfortunate physical consequence of the attempt to render sex safe for teens is an epidemic of sexually transmitted disease. The U.S. Public Health Service estimated in 1989 that one in four sexually active teens will be infected eventually with a sexually transmitted disease. The federal Centers for Disease Control estimate that there are at least 12 million new cases of such disease every year. Since many sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDS, herpes, genital warts, and hepatitis B have a viral etiology, they are incurable. Because viral STDs are lifelong, some estimates suggest that one in five Americans eventually will contract a viral STD.27 Obviously, not all of these people are adolescents, but in an era of multiple sexual partners, everyone in the pool of sexually active people is at risk<p>	In addition, certain nonphysical dangers of early sexuality often are ignored, either because they are not visible or because they are not easily quantifiable. Poor academic grades and a decrease in orientation toward the future have been documented among adolescents who initiated sexual intercourse prior to marriage.28 Unfortunately, disillusionment with life (sometimes called a broken spirit) is a consequence that is not susceptible to public health analysis.<P>	Family disruption and a tendency to engage in other risky behaviors such as drinking also are associated with early sexual activity. Recent studies performed for the state of Illinois by John Vessey, Ph.D., of Northwestern University quantify several risk factors for premarital sexual activity. Not having two parents in the home and believing that parents accept adolescent sexual activity are associated with a doubling of the chances that a teen will have premarital sex. Smoking and frequent drinking are associated, respectively, with fourfold and sixfold increases in the likelihood of premarital sex. Believing that condoms are safe is associated with a fivefold increase.29<P><b>REASONS FOR FAILURE OF "RESPONSIBLE TEEN SEX"30</b><P>	
The inability of adolescents to shield themselves from the adverse consequences of early sexual activity is not due to poor technology. Theoretically, there is not much room for improvement in the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives (oral pills or implanted capsules). There may be some room to reduce their unhealthful or unpleasant side effects, but the natural tendency of scientific research is to concentrate on the more important risks, such as breast cancer, heart attack, or stroke, rather than on minor side effects like acne, weight gain, or hair loss that are important to image-conscious teenagers. Considering the purpose of hormonal contraception -- to alter the natural process of ovulation --some side effects are unavoidable.
<P>	By far the greatest impediments to efficient pregnancy prevention through contraceptives are human error and failure to use these devices. According to one large, well-controlled study, 58 percent of women forgot to take their oral contraceptive pills every day, and 80 percent failed to take them at the same time every day as prescribed.31 This study included women of all ages, with the mean age over 20; it is recognized generally that the level of compliance with contraception protocols among teenagers is much worse than for the population of women as a whole. This helps explain why there are millions of unplanned pregnancies even though 90.1 percent of sexually active American women use some type of contraception.32 Failure to comply with professionals' prescriptions must be regarded as one of the immutable facts of contraceptive life.
<P>
	It may be argued that failure to follow medical recommendations does not affect so-called passive methods of contraception, such as Norplant. Hence, when Norplant was approved for the market in 1991, many family planning advocates hailed it as the "magic bullet" that would end unintended pregnancy among teenagers and others likely to forget their pills. Within months, all state Medicaid programs were paying for Norplant.
<P>
	Researchers became concerned that the euphoria surrounding the arrival of a low-effort, long-term contraceptive might cause users to become careless about their reproductive health practices. With funds from the U.S. Public Health Service, a large study was initiated on a population of Medicaid women in Arkansas, one of the leading states in Norplant use. The study confirms some of the fears of reproductive health professionals: Medicaid women with Norplant are more likely to miss regularly scheduled gynecological screenings, more likely to contract sexually transmitted diseases, and less likely to get needed services. This study contains no information on whether individuals with Norplant have more sexual partners, though such data certainly would be relevant to the spread of sexually transmitted disease.33 Another large study, conducted in Baltimore to compare adolescent and adult Norplant users, revealed that only 13-18 percent of users returned for their routine follow-up examinations.34<P>	When confronted with the failure of prescription contraceptives to protect against sexually transmitted disease, proponents of birth control for adolescents respond with condoms. But family planning professionals historically have been reluctant to recommend condoms for pregnancy prevention because of their high failure rate. The contraceptive failure rate among young, low-income women who use condoms, oral contraceptives, or diaphragms is shown below.<P>	 These rates reflect failure to prevent pregnancy. There are no specific data about the failure rate of barrier contraceptive methods in preventing sexually transmitted diseases. Some published studies indicate slippage and breakage rates exceeding 14 percent, even among experienced condom users.35 It would be a mistake, however, to equate every instance of slippage and breakage with an accidental pregnancy or the transmission of a disease. Condoms often slip or break without resulting in an STD or a pregnancy; conversely, an STD or a pregnancy can occur in spite o
f an intact condom. Even an intact condom cannot necessarily prevent the spread of serious sexually transmitted diseases. Human papillomavirus (HPV), the agent which causes genital warts and the root cause of most of the nation's 6,000 cervical cancer deaths per year, can exist in parts of the genital region not covered by condoms.36<P>	<b>Teens and Condoms.</b> In view of high contraceptive failure rates, responsible reproductive health professionals have concluded that the minimum standard for reducing the chances of pregnancy or sexually transmitted disease is to use a hormonal method and a barrier method simultaneously. This "dual use" is what the Public Health Service recommended in 1990 as a fallback position for adolescents who do not remain abstinent.37 More recently, Dr. David Kessler, head of the Food and Drug Administration, correctly decried the tendency of health professionals to give dangerously insufficient advice regarding contraception: "you don't hear people saying use Norplant plus a condom... or oral contraceptives plus a condom. That's not being said and it needs to be said."38<P>	Unfortunately, family planning professionals have neglected this message. Perhaps they are reluctant to spread the message of dual use because they recognize that it complicates sexual activity and, thus, that many sexually active people will be loath to heed it. Acceptance of dual contraceptive methods is very low; the Public Health Service estimates that only 2 percent of sexually active teens attain even this insufficient standard of risk reduction.39<P>	What dooms dual use as a means of risk reduction for teens is what has always plagued barrier methods and hormonal contraceptives separately: Many adolescents simply do not want to use them. This indifference to contraception points to a central fact of developmental psychology: that teenagers and adults evaluate risks differently. The cognitive pattern that characterizes most people in early and middle adolescence (sometimes called concrete operational t
hought) is characterized by haphazard processing of information and failure to anticipate future outcomes of actions.40 This predisposition makes it difficult for teens to use contraception effectively and consistently. In many cases, their low ability to take positive action to reduce the risks associated with sex is impaired further by drugs or alcohol. The failure to take these facts into account has undermined many pregnancy prevention programs, especially those based on contraception.<P>
	The contraceptive approach to adolescent pregnancy prevention faces also more formidable obstacles than teenagers' psychological disinclination to use inconvenient contraceptive methods. In some areas, statistics show that 70-90 percent of the children of teenage mothers were fathered by men in their twenties.41 Thus, what is commonly described as the teen pregnancy problem actually involves more than teenagers.<P>	Men in their twenties enjoy a certain status with teenage girls simply because of their age. In the current social climate, there is little disadvantage to a young adult male in fathering a child out of wedlock. Perversely, he incurs financial responsibilities only if he admits paternity. In many states, a declaration of paternity made in the hospital when his child is born has no legal effect; he must repeat the statement in court. These slightly older men are not above using force or coercion to make sexual conquests. Social science research only recently has begun to plumb the depths of coercive sex suffered by teenagers.42 It is no wonder that in a national survey, a plurality of teens regarded pressure to have sex as the greatest threat to their well-being.43<P>	The fact that men who impregnate teenage girls are often in their twenties points to a serious problem in current adolescent pregnancy-prevention programs: We cannot reach these young adults with school-based campaigns. These young men are not impressed with any contraceptive method because fathering a child out of wedlock brings them only advantages (unless they marry). Previous cultural and legal prohibitions about older males' being involved sexually with teens have loosened. As damaging as this is in itself, it leads to another problem: Teenage males, who tend to model their actions on the behavior of their slightly older counterparts, try to act out their own version of this life. Thus, a vicious cycle is born. In terms of sexually transmitted disease, substance abuse, and non-marital sexual activity, the early twenties are an 
even more troubled age than the teen years.
<P>

<b>FALSE DIAGNOSES</b>
<P>
	Adolescents do not lack information about sex. Aside from the continual media onslaught, there are numerous sources of formal education about sexuality, contraception, and sexually transmitted disease. A recent survey shows that 93 percent of U.S. high schools offer classes on sexuality and AIDS.44 According to a national study of 15-19 year old males, a large majority (79 percent) had received formal instruction about birth control. Unfortunately, only 58 percent had received formal instruction about resisting pressure to engage in sexual activity.45<P>	It is also clear that the high rate of repeat pregnancy among teens cannot be attributed to ignorance about sexual matters. A study of contraceptive use and repeat pregnancy among welfare-dependent teenage mothers found that half had become pregnant again within two years even though the majority were using some method of contraception.46<P>	<b>Funding for Pregnancy Prevention.</b> Despite its frequent portrayal as a national problem, federal funding for adolescent contraception is ample. Overall, the federal government spends about $1 billion per year on family planning. These expenditures include Title X of the Public Health Service Act (family planning for low-income persons) and Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid, which pays for more contraceptive services than any other program), but not matching funds from the states or other institutions. Judging from the age distribution of Title X clients, about $300 million of this money is devoted to adolescents each year. On the other hand, the Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs, which runs the only federal program dedicated to promoting sexual abstinence (Title XX of the Public Health Service Act), spends about $1.9 million for that purpose annually. If there is a funding problem for adolescent sexuality programs, it is only that current funding is misdirected.47<P>	Asked to explain the absence of evidence that their programs work, proponents of contraceptive education fall back on arguments
 of "face validity." All this means is that, on its face, a program seems as if it ought to work. When "experts" state that contraceptive education programs have "face validity," they are saying that they believe imparting information, regardless of its quality or evidence of any effect, is good. Yet proponents of abstinence in Congress and elsewhere have not been able to invoke face validity to support their programs. In the hands of abstinence proponents, face validity is considered offensively moralistic. Thus, in a field with a perennial scarcity of solid data, policy arguments all favor the contraceptive side.
<P>
	Without any persuasive evidence that it benefits adolescent development, or that it is effective when used, the contraceptive approach is regarded most appropriately not as a pragmatic policy choice, but as an ideology, though admittedly one that remains widely respected.48<P><b>WHAT WORKS TO REDUCE ADOLESCENT PREGNANCY</b><P>
	When seeking what works to reduce teenage pregnancy, federal and state policymakers should not search primarily among federal government programs. Some successes have been achieved in the Title XX Adolescent Family Life program, but its tiny size and the bureaucratic and legislative constraints under which it labors have prevented it from having a substantial impact.49<P>	The Title XX program does serve, however, as a useful point of departure in exploring successful abstinence programs. The program funded ground-breaking research on the precursors and consequences of sexual activity among unmarried adolescents. Among its findings were that a family's pattern of communication affected the abstinence behavior of adolescents. In particular, good communication between adolescents and their mothers tended to promote abstinent behavior. Title XX-funded research also documented that adolescent initiation of sexual intercourse had a negative effect on the reported academic grades of white males, as well as on the college aspirations of white females.50<P>	Influenced perhaps by polls which found that 65 percent of teenagers thought the most effective way to convince their peers to postpone sex would be to describe the dangers of diseases like herpes and AIDS,51 many early Title XX programs emphasized the adverse consequences of early sexuality. This approach failed for two major reasons. First, these programs tried to focus teens' attention on the grim facts of AIDS and sexually transmitted disease while AIDS advocates and most of the public health establishment were asserting that grim outcomes generally could be avoided with condoms. Second, the adverse consequences approach did not give sufficient weight to the statements of adolescents who actually had abstained. According to a poll of adolescents who abstained (the Gallup Study of American Youth, 1977-1988), 55 percent were concerned about pregnancy, but 75 percent wanted to save sex until marriage.
<P>
	Nabers Cabaniss Johnson, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from 1987-1990 and director of the Title XX program, credited a project conducted by the Search Institute of Minnesota with finding that "knowledge alone has little effect on sexual decision-making and that teens' own values and strength of conviction about what is right far outweigh peer pressure or fear of consequences."52<P>	Willingness to abstain, then, is the heart of the matter. It is unlikely that the desire to wait can be taught in the didactic sense. But if the culture at large, the neighborhood culture, or even the subculture at school supports the virtue of abstinence, well-designed programs can help a teen to practice it. Abstinence programs over the years have developed effective methods, such as resistance skills, which teens can use to implement their convictions. American culture must provide the concepts of virtue toward which adolescents can strive.
<P>
	The Title XX program has funded about 75 abstinence projects across the country since 1981. Remarkably, by law, this portion of Title XX could be no more than half as big as the portion devoted to caring for teens already pregnant or rearing young children. The abstinence projects were located in urban, suburban, and rural areas. Because Title XX was a demonstration program, the projects it funded generally were quite small.
<P>
<b>DEMONSTRATED EFFECTS OF ABSTINENCE PROGRAMS</b>
<P>
	Ideological opponents of the abstinence approach, such as former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, suggest that abstinence cannot be promoted successfully among teens. Yet even those who oppose abstinence programs recognize that the small projects funded by Title XX generally have produced favorable cognitive and attitudinal results. These programs meet the standard stated by the summary of Sections 505 and 506 in the Clinton plan, and yet they have no real chance of approval as part of the Clinton Administration's program.
<P>	The "gold standard" among sex education or abstinence programs is not whether they increase knowledge, or even whether they change attitudes. The important achievement is to affect behavior. In this regard, the Title XX program has enjoyed notable success.53<P>	A program called Preventing Sexual Involvement (PSI) was conducted by Emory University faculty members at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1983. Since it received funding under Title XX, it was by definition an abstinence-only program. The study population was entirely urban, poor, and African-American. A scientific evaluation of PSI showed that adolescents who went through the program were significantly less likely to initiate sexual activity than similar adolescents in a control group. The beneficial results were recorded in a Public Health Service document entitled "Adolescent Family Life Program; Highlights from Prevention Projects":
<blockquote>
	During the year that the students participated (eighth grade), nonprogram students were five times more likely to begin sexual activity during the school year than were program students (20 percent vs. 4 percent). The differences were greater for girls (15 percent vs. 1 percent) than they were for boys (29 percent vs. 8 percent). At the end of the ninth grade, the differences between non-program and program students continued (39 percent vs. 24 percent) even though no additional program involvement was provided.
</blockquote>
	Another program which apparently has reduced the level of sexual activity among adolescents is Reducing the Risk (RTR). Unlike PSI, RTR was not eligible for Title XX funding because it included a contraception message in addition to its abstinence message. The scientific evaluations of both programs specifically attribute resulting favorable changes in behavior to their abstinence components. As Kirby states in his evaluation of RTR, "In combination with the findings from the evaluation of PSI, this suggests that it may actually be easier to delay the onset of sexual activity than to increase contraceptive practice."54<P>	Another Title XX abstinence project was conducted by the American Home Economics Association. An independent analysis of data from Project Taking Charge, made by a federal evaluator, showed that this project also reduced the likelihood of premarital sexual activity among adolescents who participated in the program.55<P>	<b>Adolescent Acceptance of Abstinence.</b> Other successful abstinence programs have been developed without funding from Title XX or any other government source. In the schools of Conway, Arkansas (population 38,000), a concerned parent named Thelma Moton and a group of volunteers have conducted the EXCEL program for three years. EXCEL accepts no government funds because of an abiding belief that promoting civic virtue is a community's own responsibility. With the expertise of volunteers from among medical professionals, educators, parents, and older students, EXCEL has provided semester-long programs for 1,300 junior high students each year. Though a scientific evaluation of the program has just been initiated, a preliminary survey showed that 27 percent of students in the program were sexually active as opposed to 31 percent of those who were not in the program.
<P>
	The EXCEL program makes good use of the prestige of senior high school students willing to "admit" that they have not engaged in sex. Younger students report that they are relieved to hear these "admissions" because they remove the peer pressure to engage in risky activities. EXCEL uses the same method to reduce other risky behaviors such as drinking and drug use.
<P>
	Like PSI and RTR, EXCEL teaches refusal skills, or methods by which students can resist pressure from peers to indulge in sex, drinking, or drugs without becoming a social outcast. Refusal skills are practiced through role-playing and are considered crucial by the EXCEL staff. According to Thelma Moton, "If you don't have refusal skills, you don't have a program."56 Practicing refusal skills is common in successful risk-reduction programs. Clearly, today's adolescent culture filters out fewer expressions of deviancy. Though this creates a more tolerant society in a superficial sense, it also generates more overt pressure on teens to participate in activities they may consider frightening.

<P>	Contrary to the expectations of many adults, the majority of teens seem interested in what abstinence-based programs might have to offer. A survey of 1,000 girls conducted by Emory University found that of a dozen possible sex education topics, the most popular (chosen by 84 percent of the respondents) was more information on how to say "no" to a boyfriend's requests for sex without losing the boyfriend.57 It is also evident from a February 1994 Roper Starch poll that 12-17 year olds regard the pressure to have sex as the prime threat to their well-being.58 It seems obvious that adolescents have been calling on adults to protect them with reasonable behavioral limits. For many years, however, the vogue in child-rearing was to ignore such calls.<P>	Another common characteristic of successful programs is an approach that recognizes and responds to the needs of the individual.59 For example, Washington, D.C.'s Best Friends program, directed by Elayne Bennett, works with girls who are at high risk for adolescent pregnancy. It asks them to remain abstinent through completion of high school. By pairing each girl in a mentoring relationship with a mature, stable woman, the program takes advantage of adolescents' tendency to model their behavior on the actions of slightly older people, thus starting what might be called a virtuous cycle. It also builds group identity and celebrates life events, such as completion of the school year and academic success. As of 1993, Best Friends had graduated over 500 young women without a single instance of pregnancy.
<P>	Further evidence that abstinence programs can have a positive effect on children with multiple risks is found in the Hoyleton project. Evaluators of this East St. Louis, Illinois, project funded by the Title XX abstinence program found that it combines classroom instruction with an after-school program to channel the energies and promote the further development of children enrolled in the classroom element. In addition, it involves parents as the primary sexuality educators of their children and provides academic tutoring, field trips, and games. This program attempts explicitly to change the cultural influences on children, thereby helping to give them a new vision of the possibilities beyond their present circumstances. This would be accomplished by helping teenagers avoid sexual activity, drug, and alcohol use, all of which are symptomatic of crisis in adolescents.
<P>
	The programs that work are the ones that focus on adolescents as individuals during the transition to adulthood, a time fraught with risk, especially for those with weak or nonexistent parental assistance or other adult role models. These programs recognize, implicitly or explicitly, that the rise in adolescent pregnancy has significant psychological and cultural implications. Therefore, their approach is not merely to give large numbers of teens more information. Programs that have relied simply on dispensing information have not been successful in reducing teen pregnancies, whether the information was on abstinence or contraception.
<P>

<b>WHAT POLICYMAKERS CAN DO</b>
<P>

<b>1) Employ abstinence counseling.</b>
<P>
	Considering that about one young woman in five makes her first family planning visit before initiating sexual activity, there is a strong possibility that abstinence counseling could be effective.60 Directive abstinence counseling has not been tried widely because it runs counter to the philosophical views of most family planning clinicians. But directive counseling is accepted and encouraged with respect to contraception. As we have seen, it is regarded by some experts as essential to gaining contraceptive compliance from teenagers.61 If directive counseling can persuade teens to use certain types of contraception, there should be no ethical objection to using it to promote abstinence.
<P>
	If the teen already is sexually active, counseling could be geared toward what some teens describe as "secondary virginity." At least one survey has discovered that many teens who have had one occasion of sexual intercourse view it as an aberration they are unlikely to repeat.62<P><b>2) Promote adoption counseling.</b><P>	In cases where pregnancy already has occurred, adoption can break the cycle of welfare dependence. Despite its overwhelmingly positive outcome, however, only rarely is adoption described as an option by counselors who favor the contraceptive approach to reducing births among teens.63<P><b>3) Establish parity for abstinence programs.</b><P>	Congress is considering block grants as a major part of welfare reform. Abstinence programs can help stem the tide of early teen sexual involvement, but they must be accorded the same treatment that state and federally funded contraceptive programs now enjoy. Block grants should provide that opportunity. At the state level, officials can plant well-designed programs across communities so that they support each other and achieve a critical mass. The goal of government-supported abstinence campaigns is not necessarily to make it possible for every adolescent to be in a government-funded abstinence program. Rather, the idea is to make communities aware that government tangibly supports the idea of adolescent development rooted in abstinence, risk avoidance, and the attainment of positive life goals.
<P>
	In an era when teens spend an average of 80 hours per week watching TV or listening to the radio,64 it would be of inestimable value for state and local officials to provide grants to local private organizations for media campaigns to support the idea of abstinence -- for example, to disabuse teens of the idea that they are the last virgins in their schools or neighborhoods.65 Teens respond more to what they believe their peers are doing than to what their peers actually do. The success of local and nationwide abstinence promotion efforts like True Love Waits, which has been recognized even by national news magazines, demonstrates that teens will take up the abstinence message gladly if given a rallying point.
<P>

<b>THE LONG-TERM SOLUTION: MASSIVE CULTURAL REALIGNMENT </b>
<P>
	"Abandoning the poor" is hardly a responsible position, yet AFDC, as we know it, itself abandons the poor. More taxpayers today are aware that AFDC recipients who enter the program as adolescent mothers will be the longest recipients, will remain mired in poverty, and most likely will never marry or complete high school. At best, AFDC provides some income support for poor mothers and their children. At worst, it perpetuates cultural patterns that encourage illegitimacy, family non-formation, and difficulties for mothers and children steeped in the subculture of dependency.
<P>
	The roots of today's dependency problem lie in a lack of hope for any achievable life goals and the collapse of cultural support for marriage and removal of any shame or stigma attached to illegitimacy. When this is recognized by those who make public policy, truly creative responses to the needs of these young women can be crafted. At the same time, promotion of abstinence, personal respect, and responsibility must be the "new" approach in any welfare reform proposals geared to preventing dependency. Abstinence programs must be part of a whole, unambiguous cultural message that promotes responsibility in all facets of life, including the sexual. Abstinence is the hallmark of responsibility. This message must be directed at both sexes and at all ages.
<P>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>

<P>	Well-designed abstinence programs can help teens as individuals, but the environment in which they live is also important.66 Thus, it is necessary for state and local policymakers to support efforts, such as the Hoyleton project in East St. Louis and similar programs, which promote positive cultural influences in the lives of adolescents.<P>	The Clinton Administration's claim that responsibility means using a contraceptive during non-marital sex turns the concept of responsibility on its head. The failed and feeble notion of sexual responsibility embodied in the Administration's Work and Responsibility Act would infect every program that accepts it. Participants would soon perceive that "responsibility" is a matter not of choices and behavior, but of acquiring new technology (or merely new terminology).
<P>
	Policymakers instead should promote reforms that encourage personal responsibility. Only this can rescue another generation from dependency. Such a program would represent a true commitment to young people in their struggle to deal with difficult life issues. It would help them form and reach achievable goals, would give them hope, and would increase their chances of becoming responsible adults.

Polaneczky et al. recently published an article in <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i> (Vol. 331, No. 18) containing findings from a study comparing post-partum teenaged Norplant users to oral contraceptive users. Forty-two percent of the Norplant users and 36 percent of the pill users contracted a sexually transmitted disease in the follow-up period. This difference was not statistically significant. There was no difference in clinic visits. However, in view of the small size of the study group -- 48 people received Norplant --it should not be given as much weight as the Arkansas study, which was over ten times as large. The Arkansas study has yet to be published, though a report has been sent to the U.S. Public Health Service.

<li>The measure of behavioral change usually is sexual activity, which is difficult to measure. At best, programs which have attempted to measure this variable have relied on the self-reporting of adolescents. Some analysts have suggested strongly that adolescents greatly exaggerate their sexual activity. Males, "School Age Pregnancy:  Why Hasn't Prevention Worked?"  Considering some of the extreme reports that have appeared recently in the social science literature -- for example, that 13 percent of ten-year-old girls and 28 percent of ten-year-old boys in an urban population had initiated sexual intercourse -- it seems likely that the self reports are exaggerated.

This tendency to exaggerate coital activity is an important factor in teen sexuality because teens are highly influenced in their sexual behavior by what they think their peers are doing. This becomes a vicious cycle because teens consistently overestimate the sexual activity of their peers.

Backgrounder No. 1045<br>July 27, 1995<br><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%> <p></center><b>INTRODUCTION</b><p>	With the national out-of-wedlock birthrate heading toward 40 percent by the year 2000, and 50 percent around the year 2012, lawmakers are concerned about the increase in abused and neglected children which likely will accompany this disturbing trend. There now are close to 500,000 children in the foster care system,2 but only about 50,000 are cleared for adoption each year. Because of bureaucratic obstacles, many of these children cannot find a permanent, loving home.3<p>	The comprehensive House welfare reform bill (H.R. 4, the Personal Responsibility Act) tries to address this problem by rewarding states for reducing their out-of-wedlock birthrate without resorting to abortion. But another way is to increase early adoptions of neglected children. During the congressional debate, some Members balked at trying to reduce the illegitimacy rate, fearing they might appear harsh or uncaring toward the young unwed mother and her child. For these lawmakers and others with similar apprehensions, adoption is a solution that is kind to both mother and child. Its advantage is well documented:  a better life.
<p>
	The House-passed tax reform bill (H.R. 1215) also encourages adoption. To help defray the significant costs involved, a couple whose income is below $60,000 receives a $5,000 tax credit. This credit is reduced gradually for couples with incomes between $60,000 and $100,000 and phased out at incomes above $100,000. While significant, however, this step will not lead to a major increase in adoption unless the barriers to adoption in the social service bureaucracy are removed by congressional and state action.
<P>
	Adoption rates have declined in recent decades as adoption has fallen out of favor with state governments and the social services establishment. In 1979, 598,000 babies were born out of wedlock; almost one in four was adopted. In 1991, of the 1,225,000 born out of wedlock, only one in 25 was adopted. Yet public interest has increased:  close to two million couples would like to adopt these children. Clearly, the problem is far more basic than any financial burden that may be involved.
<P>
	Because of the vast need for adoption and the large pool of parents willing to adopt, Congress not only should encourage adoptions through generous tax relief for adopting parents, but also must change the public social service ethos by eliminating all barriers to speedy and permanent adoption.
<P>
	The simplest and fastest way to bring about these improvements is to privatize all adoption services. Government agencies have institutional strengths in applying and enforcing the law, but private institutions can better harness the human qualities needed to nurture and develop children. To encourage adoption through private organizations, and to reduce barriers to adoption through government agencies, Congress, the Administration, and the states need to take several important actions.
<P>
<B>What the federal government should do:</B>
<P><ul>
<LI> Enact a means-tested, fully refundable, inflation-adjusted tax credit of up to $5,000 for non-recurring adoption expenses.<P>

<li> Hold hearings on the Clinton Administration's blocking of a very effective drug testing and treatment program for cocaine-addicted pregnant mothers. If necessary, pass legislation to reverse the Administration's action.<P>

<LI> Issue annual report cards on the rate of adoption in each state.<P>

<LI> Require federally funded family planning services to provide clear and accurate information on the benefits of adoption to all out-of-wedlock teenage mothers.<P>

<LI> Make it easy for all churches, particularly black churches that serve the poor, to affiliate with adoption agencies and become involved in the adoption process as outreach to prospective adopting parents.<P>

<LI> Ensure the civil rights of all children in foster care and modify the Multi-Ethnic Placement Act to prohibit any use of race or ethnicity to deny or delay the placement of a child for foster care or adoption.<P>

<li> Change the Indian Child Welfare Act to curtail the reach of Indian Nation law over those who have emigrated from those communities and societies.
<P>
<LI> Reject the language in the U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child.
<P></ul>
<b>What the states should do:</b>
<P><ul>
<li> Privatize adoption services.
<P>
<LI> Change the way public welfare agencies are financed so that they are obliged to contract for all public adoptions.
<P>
<LI> Establish separate units at the county level to assist the courts in making speedy and appropriate judgments.
<p>
<LI> Maintain special Medicaid coverage for all special-needs adopted children.
<P>
<LI> Remove obstacles to transracial adoptions.
<P>
<li> Use leadership opportunities to encourage adoption.
<P>
<li> Establish separate units for termination of the parental rights of convicted abusing parents.
<p>
<LI> Enact a strict 12-month timeline for adjudication of the long-term parental status of every child in foster care.
<p>
<LI> Centralize the collection of state data on all formal adoptions and foster care actions.
<P>
<li> Enact legislation subjecting public social service agencies to the same licensing standards and requirements as those imposed on private adoption agencies.
<P>
<LI> Mandate drug testing of pregnant mothers suspected of drug abuse, particularly cocaine abuse.
<P>
<li> Prohibit the removal of a child eligible for adoption from foster parents who are willing to adopt, except when the child is being returned to his legal parents. Enact legislation to permit foster parents to initiate adoption proceedings.
<P>
<LI> Enact laws requiring child welfare agencies to initiate adoption proceedings for any child who has been abandoned by his parents for six months.
</ul><P>

	Adoption works. It increases the emotional, physical, and cognitive capacities of the children who are adopted. It improves the life chances of the biological mother. It saves vast amounts of money for the public. It brings much happiness, both to the adopting parents and to the adopted child. It is good for all involved.
<p>
	The current welfare reform debate in Congress offers one of the best chances in decades to promote adoption. Sharply rising out-of-wedlock births add steadily to the long-range costs of welfare, because being born out of wedlock significantly increases the chances of ending up on welfare. At the same time, up to two million couples waiting to adopt frequently find themselves hamstrung by government agencies and government practices.

<P>
<b>THE NEED FOR ADOPTION</b>
<p>
	Over the past 25 years there has been a dramatic increase in the numbers of children born out of wedlock, children being raised by single parents, families on welfare, and children entering the foster care system because of abuse and neglect. Family disintegration is widespread. There also has been a sharp decrease in the number of children being adopted, with formal adoptions dropping by almost 50 percent:  from 89,000 in 1970 to a fairly constant 50,000 annually throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s.4<p>	The National Council for Adoption estimates that of the 50,000 children adopted annually, 25,000 are healthy children under age two, 10,000 are healthy children over age two, and 15,000 are children with "special needs" (the social work term of art for children considered difficult to place because of their age, physical or mental condition, race or ethnicity, or need to be placed with siblings).5  About one-third of these adoptions are arranged by government-funded and government-managed public agencies, some by contract with private agencies. Another one-third are arranged by private, mostly nonprofit agencies, and the rest are contracted outside of agency auspices, mostly through lawyers in private practice. International adoptions accounted for an additional 8,000 adoptions during 1994.
<p>
	Adoption fell out of favor among social workers during the 1970s, even as single parenthood and abortion became more widespread. Advocates of government-sponsored social programs argued that increases in welfare would make it possible for unmarried mothers to rear children without the assistance of a father.6  Yet, as is evident from the skyrocketing foster care numbers7 and from the chronic problems associated with the absence of fathers, such as crime, poor school performance, poor health status, and low income,8 that view has turned out to be a tragic mistake. By contrast, children adopted by two parents are doing as well as their peers raised in their own intact families.9<p><b>PATTERNS OF PARENTAL NEGLECT </b><p>	The rapid increase of illegitimacy and the staggering problems of children born out of wedlock and raised without fathers are well documented.10<p><ul><li>In 1991, 29.5 percent of all births and 68 percent of minority births were out of wedlock.11  In 1970, 10.7 percent of all children and 37.6 percent of minority children were born to unmarried mothers.12<p><li>In 1986, 66 percent of unintended pregnancies ended in abortion and 33 percent ended with a woman choosing to be a single parent. Only 1 percent ended in adoption.13<p><li>In 1992, 659,000 children were in state-sponsored foster care and institutional care for all or part of the year. On any given day, half a million American children live in government-sponsored substitute care.14<p><li>In 1982, 7,100 infants were in substitute care outside their homes; in 1988, there were over 17,000.<p><li>In 1991, 2,000 children died from abuse or neglect. Some were murdered. Between 30-50 percent of children killed by their parents or caretakers were known to child protective services before their murders took place.15</ul><p>	There has been a sharp increase in the number of infants abandoned by their frequently drug-addicted mothers. According to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), 12,000 infants were abandoned in 199
1.16  In response to this crisis, there has been a proliferation of "boarder baby"17 homes to care for these children until their parents can be located and rehabilitated. A 1993 General Accounting Office report showed that 10,000 infants were being boarded in hospitals for no medical reason. Less than 40 percent of the boarder babies -- and none of the abandoned babies -- were expected to leave in the care of their parents.
<P>
	The average total cost of caring for these babies in hospital after their medical treatment is almost $13,000.18  Nonetheless, only 2.5 percent of the boarder babies and 6 percent of the abandoned infants were expected to go into adoptive placements.19  The vast majority of these children will spend years in and out of the foster care system while the biological mother attempts to get her life together.20<P>	Federal efforts to deal with this have been small and swamped by the size of the problem.21  When Representative Harris Fawell (R-IL) introduced the At-Birth Abandoned Infants Act (H.R. 2936) last year to help move abandoned babies out of the system and into permanent adoptive homes, the child welfare establishment lobbied against it, arguing that creating a two-tiered system -- a fast track for new-born abandoned babies and a slower, less responsive one for older children -- was unfair.22  The bill was not enacted.<P><b>WHY ADOPTION SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED</b><P><b>Benefits for Children</b><P>	Adopted children do as well as or better than their non-adopted counterparts, according to a 1994 study by the Search Institute, a Minneapolis-based public policy research organization specializing in questions of concern to states and cities.23  This study, the largest examination of adopted adolescents yet undertaken, concludes that:
<P><ul>
<LI>Teens who were adopted at birth are more likely than children born into intact families to live with two parents in a middle-class family.24<P><LI>Adopted children score higher than their middle-class counterparts on indicators of school performance, social competency, optimism, and volunteerism.25<P><LI>Adopted adolescents generally are less depressed than children of single parents and less involved in alcohol abuse, vandalism, group fighting, police trouble, weapon use, and theft.26<P><LI>Adopted adolescents score higher than children of single parents on self-esteem, confidence in their own judgment, self-directedness, positive view of others, and feelings of security within their families.27<P><LI>On health measures, adopted children and children of intact families share similarly high scores, and both those groups score significantly higher than children raised by single parents.28<P><LI>Adopted children do well at school. In 1981, only 7 percent of children adopted in infancy repeated a grade, while 12 percent of children living with both biological parents repeated a grade.29<P><LI>Compared with the general child population, children placed with adoptive couples are better off economically. Their parents are better educated and older than the parents of other children.30<p><LI>Adoptive parents are less likely to divorce.31<P></ul>	Virtually all of these findings have been replicated by Nicholas Zill, Vice President and Director of Child and Family Studies at Westat Research Corporation of Maryland, in his analysis of data from the federal government's 1988 National Health Interview Survey on Child Health.32  Results from the survey were compared across four groups:  adopted children, children of unmarried mothers being raised by the mother, children of intact families, and children being raised by their grandparents. The data indicated that adopted children:<P>* Enjoy a quality of home environment superior to all the other groups;33<p>* Have superior access to health care compare
d to all the other groups;34<P>* Enjoy health similar to that of children of intact families and superior to that of the other two groups; and<P>* Do better in educational attainment than single-parent children and children raised by grandparents.35<p>	When compared with those adopted later, born outside of marriage and raised by the single mother, or raised in an intact family, children who are adopted in infancy:<p>* Repeat grades less often than any other group;
<P>
* See mental health professionals less than all other groups, except children of intact families;
<P>
* Have better health status than all other groups;
<P>
* Have a better standing in their school classes than all other groups, except children raised in intact families; and
<p>
* Have fewer behavior problems than all other groups, except children raised in intact families.
<P>

<b>Benefits for Mothers Who Give Up Children for Adoption</b>
<p>
<li>	Significantly, teenage mothers who choose adoption also do better than mothers who choose to be single parents.
<p>
<LI>They have higher educational aspirations, are more likely to finish school, and less likely to live in poverty and receive public assistance than mothers who keep their children.
<p>
<li>They delay marriage longer and are more likely to marry eventually.
<p>
<li>They are more likely to be employed 12 months after the birth and less likely to repeat out-of-wedlock pregnancy.
<P>
<li>They are no more likely to suffer negative psychological consequences, such as depression, than are mothers who rear children as single parents.36</ul><p>All the goals of liberal government programs like job training, supplemental education, and family planning are attained with greater ease, and at lower cost, through adoption.37<p><b>HOW MANY POTENTIAL PARENTS ARE THERE?</b><p>	Although growing numbers of children need adoption, there are more than enough families to meet the demand. The National Council for Adoption estimates that at least one million infertile couples and an additional one million fertile couples would like to adopt.38<P>	Couples who want to adopt are not looking just for healthy, Caucasian infants, despite assumptions to the contrary. The National Down's Syndrome Adoption Exchange reports a waiting list of over 100 couples who would like to adopt a child with Down's syndrome -- more than enough to accomodate parents who want Down's children given up for adoption. Nor is it difficult to find families for children with spina bifida and children who are HIV positive. For example, the National Council for Adoption is identifying children who will be orphaned when their parents die of AIDS, so that appropriate plans can be made before the parents' death. The response by individuals and families willing to adopt such children has been overwhelming.
<p>
	Americans are also willing to help with children from overseas, especially because of the anti-adoption bias in the United States. When the communist regime in Romania fell, ABC-TV's "20/20" reported that thousands of children were warehoused in government orphanages. Pictures showed many children with health and developmental problems. ABC received over 25,000 self-addressed, stamped envelopes from people who wanted more information, and within six months 2,000 Romanian children were adopted by Americans,39 many of whom had not considered adoption until this need became known. This suggests that the pool of parents willing to adopt could be expanded signficantly.
<p>
	In 1993, over 56 percent of the 7,348 children from other countries adopted by American parents were over the age of one. Of these, 9 percent were between the ages of five and nine, and 5 percent were over the age of ten.40  In addition, many of these foreign-born children have physical and emotional problems at the time of their adoption.41<p>	Despite the evident readiness and desire to adopt, many families report a lack of support or encouragement from the social services establishment. They report such things as unanswered phone calls, inadequate networking with other agencies which may have children ready for adoption, a disinclination to identify children with needs that correspond to the gifts of the family, and a general lack of support to bring couples successfully through the adoption process.42<p> <b>THE BARRIERS TO ADOPTION</b><p>	Although adoption meets the interests of the needy child better than any other option, Elizabeth Bartholet of Harvard Law School concludes that "our adoption system has failed to live up to even its own limited vision.... Laws and policies that are supposed to protect children have created barriers to adoption that function effectively to prevent these children from getting the kind of protection they most need 'a loving, nurturing and permanent home.'"43<P>	The legal system often resolves cases in ways that trouble many Americans. In two widely publicized recent cases, for example, children were wrested from their adoptive parents on the basis of biological ties. Baby Jessica was given to her biological father, who had failed to support two previous children, and Baby Richard was given to his biological father, with whom he had never lived, instead of being allowed to remain with the adoptive family which had nurtured him from birth for three years. In both cases, the overriding "biological ties" of the fathers prevailed over the needs of their children.
<P>
	Several barriers make it very difficult for many families to adopt children.
<P>
<B>BARRIER #1:  Anti-Adoption Bias in Pregnancy Counseling</B>
<P>
Only 1 percent of women who experience an "unwanted pregnancy" choose adoption for their children.44  A University of Illinois study explains some of the causes:<P><UL><LI>Some 40 percent of individuals in a variety of settings (health, family planning, social services, and adoption agencies) who identify themselves as "pregnancy counselors" do not even raise the issue of adoption with pregnant clients.<p><LI>An additional 40 percent provide inaccurate or incomplete information to clients.
<p>
<LI>By contrast, 38 percent of the clients whose counselors offered adoption went on to choose adoption.45<p></ul>	Congress's efforts to require adoption information and counseling in one federally funded program providing services to pregnant women have met with resistance from family planning professionals. For instance, the Adolescent Family Life Act46 was passed in the early 1980s to provide a modest ($7.8 million), more "pro-life," adoption-friendly alternative to the pregnancy counseling provided by established Title X and Title XIX family planning services (typically over $300 million per year). The bias among professionals against adoption can be seen in the evaluation of the program's effectiveness. Some 7 percent of the grantees violated the most basic terms of their grants by not providing any information on adoption to their clients. Most grantees failed to provide either adequate adoption information or counseling.47<P><B>BARRIER #2:  Misuse of the Foster Care System</B>
<P>
	In 1980, Congress enacted P.L. 96-272, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act. This legislation sought to provide permanent homes for children at risk of abuse and neglect by establishing a hierarchy of services for these children and for their families. In order of priority, these services were:
<P><ol>
<li>Family preservation;<p>

<li>Short-term foster care with a goal of family reunification; and<P>

<li>Long-term foster care or adoption.<p>
</ol><p>
	This legislation requires that each child's situation be reviewed every six months. Within 18 months of opening every case, a permanent plan for the child's future must be in place. This placement plan embodies a decision by the child welfare agency as to whether the child will be returned to the family or placed for adoption. Such decisions and plans must be in place before the work of clearing the child for adoption can be undertaken. Only after both steps have been taken can the search for adoptive parents begin.
<p>
	During the 1980s, these permanency planning guidelines evolved into the operating principle of "family preservation" -- keeping families intact through early, intense, comprehensive social services. The goal was to keep families united and thus avoid the high costs of foster care.
<P>
	Because of their own high costs, however, family preservation services cannot be sustained for long periods; and because of high demand, caseworkers move quickly to take care of the next family in crisis. This approach did succeed in stopping the removal of children from the home, but not necessarily in preserving them from further abuse.48  In fact, there is evidence that children fare worse under these new practices. In New York City alone, during the 12 months of 1992, 21 children were killed by a parent or mother's boyfriend after the Child Welfare Administration had intervened.49<P>	A study by John Schuerman and his colleagues at the University of Chicago found that the "Family First" program did not realize even its central goal:  preventing the removal of children.50  Neither did it protect children from further abuse. There is evidence that some families continue to abuse their children even during the period of intensive state intervention.51  By contrast, there is strong evidence that children do better when left in foster care than when they are returned to abusive families.52  This evidence leads to a simple and commonsense conclusion:  children need a permanent home to which they can belong. For children at serious risk, an adoptive home is their best chance for real permanence.
<P>
	Some child advocates challenge the principle of applying the "family preservation" approach in all cases. At a 1994 conference sponsored by the National Council for Adoption at Boys Town, Nebraska, Dr. Richard Gelles of the University of Rhode Island, a pre-eminent child abuse researcher and an early and optimistic supporter of family preservation programs, presented the following paraphrased views on these practices in light of recent evaluation data:

	There are a now a number of studies of children who were returned home only to be abused again or even killed. These studies show dramatically that some abusive parents cannot be rehabilitated.53  In these cases the appropriate care of such a child is to terminate the parents' rights as quickly as possible and place the child with a permanent caring adoptive family.</blockquote><p>		The Boys Town conference highlighted the central problem of family preservation services. The first logical step should be to assess whether the child should be removed immediately and whether the parents are likely to benefit from support services. Instead, family preservation services are assumed to be the best first treatment. Though these services are activated because of abuse to the child -- sometimes very severe abuse -- they must fail before the child can be protected from the abusing family.<P>

	The foster care system is the aggregate network of parents who work for state and local social service agencies by taking abandoned, abused, or neglected children into their homes. They receive a set amount each month with which to feed, clothe, and nurture these children. Foster parents try to function as substitute parents. Prudently, they are admonished not to expect that placement will be permanent. However, from among the couples who take on this work come many who would like to adopt, particularly as they get to know these children and their lack of prospects for a happy and safe life in their families of origin.
<P>
	Government funding reinforces an anti-adoption bias by supporting "family preservation" programs with free technical assistance and generous grants while providing only restricted support for adoption. The National Council for Adoption and the Institute for Justice report that numerous families, including foster families, have had their attempts to adopt waiting children rebuffed by the social service agencies for whom they work.54  Conna Craig of the Institute for Children in Boston reports receiving hundreds of letters from foster parents who are willing and able to adopt their foster children, some of whom have been eligible for years.
<P>
<B>BARRIER #3:  Overload and Confusion of Social Service Roles</B>
<P>
	According to Douglas J. Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute, the rising incidence of reported child abuse keeps local child welfare agencies extremely busy on policing activities, diverting time and resources from adoption.55  Often the same staff must investigate abuse reports, provide family preservation services, file for the termination of parental rights, and recruit and prepare adoptive families.
<P>
	The child welfare system typically does not separate the responsibility for terminating parental rights of parents who continue to abuse and neglect their children from the responsibility to help those parents who can be helped. Deaths of children result, as in the cases of the 21 who died in New York in 1992. By contrast, in Arizona and Oregon, separate professional units are used to make initial determinations and to justify the necessary court proceedings. Professionals are not trapped in the role confusion caused by simultaneous demands to reunite every family while also protecting the child.
<P>
	If units like those in Arizona and Oregon were in general use, a number of benefits would result:
<P><UL>
<LI>Courts could separate those children more decisively and quickly from parents unlikely to reform or benefit from family preservation services.<P>

<LI>Children in danger of severe abuse would be separated more quickly and expertly from their families and made available for adoption.<P>

<LI>Social workers involved in helping the more tractable parents would be free to pursue that work with much less likelihood of endangering the child.<P>

<LI>Local government agencies could turn to the adoption services of nonprofit agencies much more quickly and frequently. Private agencies do not have the immense burden of child protective services and related policing requirements that public agencies have. Their mission is to recruit and prepare adoptive families, and they tend to have great expertise in this work.<P>
</ul><p>
<b>BARRIER #4:  Unsatisfactory Protection of Confidentiality</b>
<P>
	State adoption laws generally guarantee the confidentiality of the identity of the mother, the inviolability of the internal intimacy and harmony of the adoptive family, and the peaceful development of the adopted child.
<P>
	In adoption law and philosophy, there has arisen a view which parallels the modern revisionist view of marriage and parenthood embodied in "no-fault" divorce. New relationships between parent and child are imagined, and a new type of contract is forged between parents. Open adoption is akin to no-fault divorce, and the "birth parents" take on the role of the visiting parent who has not yielded up all his rights to the child, particularly rights of visitation and vacations together. The adoptive parents are bound not just to their adopted child, but also to the birth parents and must facilitate the continuing relationship between the child and his birth parents. This form of open adoption exists in Oregon from birth and in Indiana for children over two years of age.
<P>
	Open adoption provides no seal of confidentiality regarding the identity of the birth parents, the adopting parents, and the child. It essentially blends birth families with adopting families, directly undermining the creation of a permanent new family for a child. The professional literature shows a frequent confusion of roles when the birth family continues a relationship with the child. This also interferes with parent and child bonding56 in the adoptive family and inhibits the birth parents' grieving process.57  There are parallel experiences and research findings with respect to divorce and the increased risks of being raised in blended families.58Confidentiality, especially in infant adoptions, helps minimize these risks.<P>	Oregon is an example of a state in which open adoption allows birth parents to take adoptive parents to court to uphold visitation agreements. This policy undermines the rights of adoptive parents to make parenting decisions. It also changes the nature and dynamics of a close, intact, inviolably intimate adoptive family, exposing it to the disruptions, conflicts, and anxieties characteristic of divorced and blended families. The professional literature on childhood emotional and behavioral development shows that children of blended families do less well than children of single parents and intact families.59  If successful, the growing push for open adoption60 could cause similar difficulties for adopted children, undermining the generally strong mental health reported by the Search Institute and Nicholas Zill.61<P>	Proponents of open adoption even recommend abolishing adoption in favor of "guardianship," which does not offer the same permanency of family for the child.62  Like any other government policy which treats the adoptive families differently from intact families, this undermines the very essence of adoption.
<P>
	Understandably, many children become interested in knowing about their birth parents as they reach early adulthood. Their desire may be fulfilled if everyone involved is prepared to cooperate in lifting the veil of confidentiality. Most states try to maintain confidentiality if there is not full agreement among all concerned. Others do not. Two, Alaska and Kansas, will release the original birth certificate with the names of the biological parents to the adopted person after the age of eighteen, regardless of the birth mother's desires.63<P>	Proponents of opening adoption records seek legislation at the federal level. Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) has introduced various versions of a "national reunion registry" to help connect birth parents with persons who are adopted. The National Council for Adoption and many of its affiliated private adoption agencies have challenged the vagueness of the legislative proposals which do not assure confidentiality. They also have questioned the need to federalize a state issue.
<P>
<b>BARRIER #5:  Unknown, Uninvolved, or Unmarried Fathers</b>

<P>	Another major barrier for unmarried women considering adoption for their children is the need to obtain the consent of uninvolved fathers. Fortunately the Supreme Court, in a series of opinions,64 has clarified and restricted the rights of uninvolved, unmarried fathers. According to current federal law, these rights correspond to the effort the father has made to establish a relationship with his child. The unmarried father who is unknown, is uninvolved, or has otherwise demonstrated no responsibility or interest in the child may not be entitled to the same consideration as an involved and responsible unmarried father. Federal courts have ruled consistently65 that ignorance of a pregnancy is no excuse for uninvolvement, because the father was present at conception and could have followed through to assure adequate care for the child. <P>	 A growing trend in state legislatures, upheld by the Supreme Court in Lehr v. Robertson,66 is the establishment of father registries which make the father responsible for asserting his parental rights. The registry usually requires the father to file a paternity action within 30 days of the child's birth. This will result in his being notified of a pending adoption. He then will have an opportunity to demonstrate that he has tried to establish a relationship with the child and to take responsibility for the child's care. If he fails to meet any of these requirements, he forfeits his rights to contest the adoption of the child, and the adoption can proceed. While many conservatives think an absent unmarried father should never be an obstacle to adoption, this procedure at least frees the mothers to place children without registered fathers for adoption.

<P>	The House welfare bill requires paternity establishment at birth for all fathers. This is a major step in the right direction. Fears that efforts to locate unknown, unmarried fathers will slow down, and possibly stop, adoption are unfounded. If the mother is not seeking AFDC support (and she will not if she is placing her child for adoption), she will not need to identify the father. Simultaneously, the putative father registry protects the due process rights of all fathers. Those who do not register, however, cannot benefit from the protection it would have given them.
<P>
<b>BARRIER #6:  Race of the Child and Adoptive Parents</b>
<P>
	Two forms of racial discrimination take place within adoption:  against adoptive parents and against children waiting to be adopted. Potential black parents lose the chance to give their love to needy children of their own race. Black children in foster care are deprived of new parents and a stronger foundation in life, in addition to being exposed to the risks of retarded social and intellectual development. Both forms of discrimination must be eliminated. Fortunately, the means to accomplish this already exist within the private sector. There is no need for coercive race-matching legislation.
<P>
<B>THE SPECIAL PLIGHT OF BLACK CHILDREN</B>

<P>	There are more black children waiting in foster care than there are prescreened black families ready to adopt them. With the need for permanent adoptive homes growing more acute and the exit rate from foster care slowing continually, the likelihood of multiple placements for black children increases.67  Indeed, some 24 percent of the children in foster care today have been in three or four different homes.68  According to Ira Schwartz of the University of Michigan, 53 percent of all children in Michigan who entered the foster care system as newborns are still in foster care at age four.69  A number of regional studies confirm this trend and demonstrate that black children typically wait two to three years longer than white children for adoptive homes.70<P>	The length of stay in foster care is very important. The longer the newborn stays in foster care, the more at risk he is of approaching the "difficult to adopt" age and the greater the problems associated with long-term foster care become. If half the children who arrive in foster care at birth are still in it at age four, the system is not serving their needs.
<P>
	This statistic highlights the need for termination units -- specialized units of social workers who work with the courts to determine whether the parental rights of an abusing or neglectful parent should be withdrawn so that the child may be placed for adoption. If the "best interest of the child" principle is used, this decision will be made quickly. If the "family preservation" principle is used, the decision will be delayed again and again, often until repeated neglect convinces the authorities that parental rights must be removed. At this point, in addition to having suffered even more, the child is older and more difficult to place.
<P>
	Given these figures, public welfare agencies are a major source of neglect of young black children. The bias against adopting early, when the child is most adoptable, feeds the foster care system and ensures a larger clientele for public agencies. The present system of financing foster care and not financing adoptions perversely rewards this form of government neglect.

<P>
<b>Black Families and Adoption</b>
<P>
	There is evidence that blacks adopt at a much higher rate than whites if one controls for family structure, income, and age of parents.71  A 1983 Department of Health and Human Services study72 put these comparable rates at:<P><UL><LI>7 adoptions per 10,000 black families for all black families;<P><LI>2 adoptions per 10,000 white families for all white families; and
<P>
<LI>2 adoptions per 10,000 Hispanic families for all Hispanic families.<P></ul>

Controlling for age of parents (below 55), family income (above poverty level), and family structure (intact families), the rates change to:<P>

<LI>18 adoptions per 10,000 black families within the range;<P>

<LI>4 adoptions per 10,000 white families within the range; and<P>

<LI>3 adoptions per 10,000 Hispanic families within the range.<P>

	These figures convey the reality of much higher adoption rates among blacks than among whites or Hispanics for children in public welfare agencies who are available for adoption.73<P>	To meet the needs of all children within their own racial communities by placing them in couple-headed families above poverty, the same study suggests that the response rate among black families would have to be far higher than it is. It would need to approach 44 per 10,000 families for blacks, compared with 6 per 10,000 families for whites and 6 per 10,000 families for Hispanics. This would require an enormous increase in the rates of adoption by blacks and Hispanics. Richard Barth of the School of Social Welfare at the University of California at Berkeley sums up the conclusions to which these data lead:
<P><blockquote>
	The growth of African-American adoptions have increased by 92% in the last 5 years and Hispanic adoptions by 80%. The growth of African American adoptions would have to grow four times faster than that during the next five years in order to give African American children parity of access to adoption. For Hispanic children, the growth rate would have to double for their opportunity to be adopted to reach parity with Caucasian children.74</blockquote><P>	To achieve these levels of adoption will require a great community effort by black and Hispanic people.<P>	As well-run private agencies demonstrate, large pools of adoptive parents can be developed over time. Even pools of parents for "harder to place children" can be developed when the effort is made by a committed organization. For instance, Down's syndrome children are adopted quite quickly because there is a network of screened parents in place and ready to adopt. Similarly, a pool of parents ready to adopt HIV-positive babies has been developed by the National Council for Adoption.
<P>
	In a 1980 study of black parents, sociology professor Robert Hill of the Institute for Urban Research at Morgan State University estimated that three million black households are interested in adopting children. This translates into one hundred black families for every black child in foster care waiting for adoption.75  Given this potential, a pool of prescreened adoptive parents big enough to take care of the needs of black children represents an achievable goal.<P>	The private sector can best develop this pool because private organizations are motivated to do so. Building pools of parents is not the strong suit of public agencies.76  Some private organizations in the black community have achieved remarkable results. Recently, for instance, in just one year, Detroit's Homes for Black Children placed 132 children in black homes -- more than all the other 13 child welfare agencies in the city.77  To increase the rate of adoption within black families, the leadership of the black community should commit itself strongly to using private organizations.<P>	Although the emphasis should be on making it easier for black families to adopt, blocking transracial adoptions just because the children are black and the parents are white discriminates against many needy black children because of race. Moreover, it does not increase the rate of in-race adoption. California, despite a law requiring a 90-day search for a same-race family before a child can be adopted across racial lines, still has twice as many black children as white children waiting for adoption, often for long periods.78<P>	The Institute for Justice recently filed suit on behalf of a white foster couple who had cared for a black child since birth. When the child became eligible, they sought to adopt him but were blocked by the public welfare agency because they were not black. Even when black parents were not found, the agency persisted in blocking this adoption. No one can argue that this was in the best interest of the child.79  Similar racial discrim
ination prevented the adoption of a white child by a black couple who had fostered the child since birth. <P>	 In 1984, liberal black columnist Carl T. Rowan argued against the "abominable notion that race must be the dominant factor in deciding who can deliver loving care and protection to a child."  Rowan equated the position of black social workers who support only in-race adoption with a 1954 statement by a segregationist Mississippi editor that "every child has the right to be educated among children and by teachers of the same racial background."80  Furthermore, according to professor Rita Simon, sociologist at the American University and expert in transracial adoption, "The data in our studies and indeed in all the studies that have been done show that transracial adoptions serve the children's best interests."81<P>	Still, opposition to transracial adoption is strong. When former Senator Howard Metzenbaum (D-OH) steered S. 1224 through Congress in 1993, he did so to outlaw obstacles similar to the above restrictions that exist in most states. But the Clinton Administration, which supports race matching, succeeded in changing the legislation so that lack of race matching could be used to deny or delay a placement.82  Instead of encouraging solutions, such as private adoption agencies that specialize in placing black children, the Administration's policy aggravates the problem.<P>	The Bunning Amendment, now incorporated into the House-passed welfare bill, repeals the Clinton policy. Senator John McCain (R-AZ) has a similar amendment (S. 637) to the Senate version of the welfare reform bill. The Children's Defense Fund supported the Clinton Administration's approach,83 despite the evidence of researchers such as Rita Simon, who shows that transracial adoption does not damage the child emotionally or developmentally and that transracially adopted children do just as well as those adopted by parents of their own race.84<P>	Race matching can be achieved easily if there are enough prescreened adoptive p
arents. The difficulty lies not in the lack of parents but in the poor track record of public agencies in building a pool of black adoptive parents.<P><B> NEED FOR FEDERAL LEADERSHIP</B><P>	A child's needs are best served, and his potential fostered most effectively, by the love and sense of belonging provided by a stable family environment. As in other areas of social concern, however, the government's ability to increase love and dedication is limited. This competence resides primarily with the family, the church, and the school. However, through their power to enact wiser laws and provide leadership, lawmakers at the federal level can affect the rate of adoption. They can expound upon its benefits for the child, for the mother who gave birth, and for the parents who adopt.
<P>
	Adoption is one of those rare good solutions to many thorny problems. Political leaders should help the country realize that it is one of the most effective ways to alleviate the problems arising from illegitimacy, child abuse, and neglect.
<P>
Lawmakers also must challenge the leaders of other major institutions, especially church leaders, to talk about the goodness of adoption. Educational leaders, particularly in social studies areas, ought to be challenged to develop good materials on adoption. Health insurance leaders ought to be challenged as well, for adoption is a less costly solution to infertility than is fertility treatment, which averages about $35,000 per course of treatment. Media leaders ought to harness their expertise in communications to promote adoption to the nation at large, instead of attacking it.85<P>	The more this is done, the more attractive adoption will be to growing numbers of families. America also needs to celebrate parents who adopt and parents who care for foster children -- especially those who both foster and adopt. They show a double generosity.
<P>
	Adoption is a national resource that should be encouraged and expanded by government where possible. The federal government should undertake a public relations campaign, targeted to girls under the age of 18 who have conceived out of wedlock, on the benefits of adoption. In addition, Congress should:
<P>
<b>1.) Enact a means-tested, fully refundable, inflation-adjusted tax credit of up to $5,000 for non-recurring adoption expenses.</B>
<P>

	The House-passed tax bill (H.R. 1215) provides a non-refundable tax credit of up to $5,000 for adoption costs for those with incomes up to $60,000, gradually phased out for those with incomes between $60,000 and $100,000.
<P>
	Congress permits a tax deduction for the medical costs of fertility treatment (typically between $35,000 and $50,000 for testing, test tube conception, and deep freeze, development, and discard). The average revenue loss for such treatment is about $8,000. Some corporate health plans, the costs of which are fully excludable from employees' taxable income, also cover fertility treatment. By contrast, the Treasury would gain financially from a one-time $5,000 tax credit that encouraged parents to assume the total cost of caring for foster children -- each of whom now costs taxpayers over $13,000 each year.86<P>	This tax credit should be fully refundable (including against Social Security taxes) so that poorer parents who adopt a child receive the same level of support as those who earn more and have larger tax liabilities. The object is to encourage and support those who want to adopt. Being less generous with poorer parents (and more black parents are poor compared to white parents) is unwise because it reduces the incentive to adopt.
<P>
<b>2)  Hold hearings on the Clinton Administration's blocking of an effective drug testing and treatment program for cocaine-addicted pregnant mothers. If necessary, pass legislation to reverse the Administration's action.</b>
<P>
	The high incidence of serious child abuse among drug-addicted mothers inflicts pain and damage on cocaine-addicted babies. With some 350,000 children affected each year, there is an obvious need for a change in federal law to permit the testing of mothers suspected of cocaine addiction. These babies are at high risk for foster care and for severe damage to their health and development.
<P>
	South Carolina Attorney General Charles Molony Condon ran a successful program of testing, mandated treatment, or a jail sentence if the mother refused treatment. The result was dramatic:  the incidence of cocaine-addicted mothers fell from 24 per month in Charleston to five or six per month.87  The Clinton Administration, however, called the program punitive and racially discriminatory and threatened to cut off all federal reimbursements to the hospital involved, effectively threatening to shut down the program and discouraging other states interested in replicating the Charleston model.
<P>
	Congress should take steps to reverse this Administration policy. The use of cocaine by pregnant women is a major factor in the death or severe damaging of many thousands of cocaine-affected newborns.
<P>
<b>3) Issue annual report cards on the rate of adoption in each state.</b>
<P>
	To redress the poor quality of national data on adoption and foster care, Congress should instruct the Department of Health and Human Services to issue comparative report cards on the performance of each state in a number of areas concerning the family condition of children, including:
<P><ul>
<LI>The number and rate of out-of-wedlock births,<P>

<LI>The rate of adoption,<P>

<LI>The length of stay in foster care, including information on the longest stays,<P>

<LI>The typical period between the availability of a child for adoption and the child's adoption, and<P>

<LI>The typical period between the beginning of foster care and the agency's finalization of a placement plan (decision regarding the future of the child).</ul><P>

	Dissemination of such information will keep state residents better informed and help encourage agencies to find children good, permanent homes.
<P>
<B>4)  Require hospitals and clinics receiving federal funds for family planning services to provide clear and accurate information on the benefits of adoption to all out-of-wedlock teenage mothers.</b>
<P>
	Congress should require HHS to contract with pro-adoption experts for the writing and distribution of an appropriate brochure on the benefits of adoption for both mother and child. Congress then should require that this brochure be distributed in all hospitals which receive federal funding, either directly or indirectly, and in all federally funded family planning clinics, and that the staff of such hospitals and clinics draw attention to this material.
<P>
<B>5)  Make it easy for all churches, particularly black churches that serve the poor, to affiliate with adoption agencies and become involved in the adoption process as outreach to prospective adopting parents.</b>
<P>
	One of the best ways the federal government can help these churches is by providing an incentive for members to adopt more children waiting in foster care. The full refundability of the $5,000 tax credit will do much to effect this. Unless their members are able to pay most of the normal costs of adoption, there is little likelihood that black churches in poor neighborhoods will be involved. With the tax credit and with church involvement, however, the probability of an increase in adoption is significantly greater.
<P>
<B>6)  Ensure the civil rights of all children in foster care and modify the Multi-Ethnic Placement Act to prohibit clearly the use or consideration of race or ethnicity in denying or delaying the placement of a child for foster care or adoption.</B>
<P>
	The fundamental principle behind all civil rights is equality of rights and equal treatment under law. A young child without a family cries out for as quick a placing as possible within a caring family, so that his long-term human potential may not be thwarted at critical early stages of development. The "personness" of that child is infinitely more important than his or her "blackness," "Indianness," "Hispanicness," or "Asianness."  In cases where parents of similar ethnic background are unavailable within, say, a 90-day period, then those who are available and willing to adopt should be united with the child, both for the child's benefit and for the good of society.
<P>
	Those who are anxious to have the children of a community adopted within that community must ensure a sufficient supply of parents wanting to adopt. The onus is on the community and ought not to be placed on the waiting child. To help assure a pool of parents, Congress should work with states to streamline and simplify adoption procedures in minority communities.
<P>
	Many opportunities for developing a pool of waiting parents are available. The network of minority churches is extensive. By linking with private adoption agencies, these churches can help respond to the needs of minority children awaiting adoption. Many other ethnic organizations can be harnessed to bring the pool of minority adopting parents up to the level needed. The press could carry public service announce-ments in minority communities. Minority fraternities and sororities also could play an important role. These and similar community efforts would raise public consciousness about adoption.
<P>
<B>7)  Change the Indian Child Welfare Act to curtail the reach of Indian Nation law over those who have emigrated from those communities and societies.</B>
<P>
	While fully respecting the right of Indian nations to regulate adoptions within their territories, and while fully respecting the rights of all Indian parents giving up their children for adoption to request that the Indian nations take these children for adoption, Congress ought to change civil rights law so that the rights of Indian or part-Indian parents living outside the nations' territories are upheld.
<P>
	Under current law, a child with as little as one sixty-fourth Indian ancestry may be under the control of that Indian tribe for adoption, no matter where the child lives. While the number may be modest, the principle of "personness" again is paramount. Just as a foreign-born American citizen is not subject to the adoption laws of his country of origin, an Indian who has chosen freely to leave the Indian nation and to marry someone outside it should no longer be subject to its laws.
<P>
<B>8)  Reject the language in the U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child. </B>

<P>	This charter could preclude adoptions for millions of children over time and deny U.S. couples the option of adopting foreign children. The unsigned U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child may come before Congress in the near future for ratification. In the current draft, international adoption is declared to be a last option, after the home country has exhausted its search.
<P>
	As in cases of transracial and race-matching adoption, each nation has a responsibility to assemble a pool of prescreened adoptive parents if it has children waiting to be adopted. If a nation does not have such a pool, and yet blocks couples from abroad from adopting, that nation is neglecting its children. The United States should be on the side of the child rather than on the side of governments that seek international acceptance of some specious "right" to neglect their nation's children.
<P>
	If the language of the U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child is accepted by Congress, it could mean an end to most international adoptions. The Hague Convention, to which the United States is a signatory, and which guides present policies, is superior though far from sufficient. Its guiding principle is that care in a family is better for a child than care in an institution.
<P>
<B>WHAT THE STATES SHOULD DO</B>
<P>
	Because regulating adoption is a state function, most of the practical reforms must be enacted by state legislatures. And because of the particular need to address the transracial adoption issue in a just and caring fashion, the states must take special care to eliminate discrimination against black adoptive parents and black children.
<P>
	To increase the pool of available parents to fill the needs of all children, states should encourage the privatization of adoption. Specialized agencies can work constructively with those sections of the community that are willing to serve the many different needs of children:  black children, older children, children with special medical problems, and children with other emotional or developmental difficulties. As different groups already have demonstrated, it is possible to line up a pool of screened and qualified parents more than willing to adopt children with even the most difficult needs.
<P>
	One effort, started by Fr. George Clements in Chicago in the mid-1980s, had each church set about achieving the adoption of one child within the congregation.88  Though initially the program received wide publicity and had some impact, it has not become a sustained and organized national effort. However, in Florida, One Church, One Child of Florida has developed a successful partnership between church and state. Between March 1988 and September 1990, this organization placed 805 black children in adoption.89<P>	Phoebe Dawson, a social worker who heads New Beginnings, a licensed nonprofit adoption agency in Columbus, Georgia, has been very successful in this work. For instance, an agency in Cleveland, Ohio, was not able to find minority parents for a young minority child, leaving the child at serious risk of a protracted wait for adoption. One worker at the agency contacted New Beginnings, which was able to resolve the problem quickly because of its close ties to black Baptist churches across the country.
<P>
	To encourage adoption, states should:
<P>
<B>1)   Privatize adoption services.</B>
<P>
	Private adoption services are more efficient and more effective than state agencies where adoption is concerned, as illustrated by the track record of Detroit's Homes for Black Children. They are accountable to a board of directors, while state agencies are not. Private organizations may be sued, which increases their accountability to the children and parents they serve. By contrast, state agencies often cannot be sued. Furthermore, people are more inclined to donate money, time, services, and goods to a private adoption agency than to pay taxes for government agencies.
<P>
<B>2)  Change the way public welfare agencies are financed. </B>
<P>
	Public welfare agencies dealing with children receive more money to keep children in foster care than they do to clear them for adoption. States should make the allocation of Title IVE monies to these agencies contingent on their record in making final determinations on the future status of children within 12 months of entering foster care. Those not returning to their families must be adopted within three months or handed over to a private agency for adoption.
<P>
<B>3)  Establish separate units at the county level to assist the courts in making speedy and appropriate judgments. </B>
<P>
	These units should make the initial decision whether to terminate the rights of the parent and bring the process to court or return the child to his family. All babies under 12 months of age coming into the protective custody of a public welfare agency should be processed through the termination unit as a matter of course. A great many such children should be placed for adoption quickly. This in turn would prevent the buildup of a large number of children in foster care -- children who grow more and more difficult to place with each passing year, as the significant drop in the percentage of older children who get adopted clearly indicates.
<P>
<B>4)  Maintain special Medicaid coverage for all special-needs adopted children. </B>
<P>
	This makes it possible for many middle and low-income families to adopt a sick child they would not be able to care for without Medicaid support. It makes sense for government to provide this support, for the special-needs child in foster care will cost the government even more.
<P>
<b>5)  Remove obstacles to transracial adoptions. </B>

<P>	While working to increase the pool of minority parents and to enhance the flow of prequalified and ready-to-adopt minority parents, states should continue the practice of transracial adoption when no same-race parents are available. When the child becomes ready for adoption, his need is immediate and acute. Minority community groups can monitor the pool of prescreened, qualified minority parents for all the relevant categories of children:  older children, older male children, sibling groups of children, medically needy children.
<P>
In addition to the issues involved in ending discrimination against black children waiting to be adopted and against black couples waiting to adopt, there is much else to be done by the states.
<P>
<B>6)  Use leadership opportunities to encourage adoption.</B>
<P>
	Governors and state legislatures should consider mounting campaigns to increase interest in adoption. With the prompting and advocacy of the Institute for Children in Cambridge Massachusetts, the State of Massachusetts, under Governor William Weld's direction, recently embarked upon Assignment Adoption, a series of government reforms to reduce the number of children in foster care and to increase the practice of adoption.
<P>
<B>7)  Establish separate units for termination of the parental rights of convicted abusing parents.</B>
<P>
	When the difficult duty of assessing the appropriateness of terminating parental rights is commingled with the mandate to preserve the family at all costs, the good of the abused child suffers. The long-term good of the child is helped by establishing separate units of social workers who help the court reach clear and speedy decisions regarding the parents' right to continue as parents. These workers can help the courts without the conflict of interest that is present when they also try therapeutically to help the family come together or stay together. It is best that such work be carried on by a different set of professionals. The best interests of the child remain paramount while the effort to help the parent is vigorously pursued.
<P>
<B>8)  Enact a strict 12-month timeline for adjudication of the long-term parental status of every child in foster care.</B>
<P>
	A University of Chicago study finds that children who enter foster care as infants remain in the system 22 percent longer than other young children.90  Within a 12-month period, the court and the termination unit should decide whether a child should be returned to his parents or placed for adoption. Continuance in foster care beyond that time must be regarded by all as a failure to provide properly for the needs of the child. To be lax or negligent in this matter is to be guilty of serious child neglect.
<P>
<B>9)  Centralize the collection of state data on all formal adoptions and foster care actions.</B>

<P>	In order to facilitate the practice of adoption and the reduction of foster care lengths of stay to the minimum time needed, the collection of accurate data is critical. At present it is poor and varies greatly in quality between states. National leaders, national and state campaigns to encourage adoptions, and the stimulation of executive action to initiate and maintain reforms all require an accurate picture of what is happening to children in adoption and foster care. The state Office of Vital Statistics or its equivalent ought to be the repository of all adoption information, and the state Office of Human Services or its equivalent ought to be the repository of all foster care data.
<P>
<B>10) Enact legislation requiring of public social service agencies the same licensing standards and requirements as those now imposed on private adoption agencies.</B>
<P>
	Just as Congress has passed a law (H.R. 1 and S. 2) to subject itself to the same regulations it imposes on the rest of the country, all state agencies involved in adoptions ought to be subject to the same reporting and regulatory oversight as adoption agencies are. This reform will likely have the speedy effect of reducing these regulations to the bare minimum needed for the good of the child.
<P>
<B>11) Mandate drug testing of pregnant mothers suspected of drug abuse, particularly cocaine abuse.</B>
<P>
	Because of the high incidence of serious child abuse among drug-addicted mothers, because of the pain and damage done to cocaine-addicted babies, and because this condition now affects 350,000 children a year, states should push for a federal law permitting the drug testing of mothers suspected of cocaine addiction so that hospitals may participate in such programs without being threatened with a cutoff of federal funds as happened in the South Carolina case discussed above.
<P>
	Children born to drug-addicted mothers are at risk for a host of difficulties and abuses:  lower birth weight, physical abuse, and not getting the affectionate nurturing critical for early attachment formation and its concomitant long-range benefits, among them the formation of a solid conscience and the ability to relate well with others. Given these risks to the child, the requirement of drug testing when cocaine or crack cocaine ingestion is suspected is an appropriate protection.
<P>
<B>12) Prohibit the removal of a child who is eligible for adoption from foster parents who are willing to adopt the child, except when the child is being returned to the legal parents. Enact legislation to permit foster parents to initiate adoption proceedings.</B>
<P>
	If the parents are deemed by the agency as suitable for fostering the child, they should qualify automatically as suitable for adopting the child. Today, many foster parents are willing to adopt the children they have fostered once they become available for adoption. However, mainly because of the effective prohibition of transracial adoptions, these parents frequently are denied the chance to adopt the children who have become attached to them. These couples should have the right to adopt the child once the courts have decided he may be adopted. If child welfare agencies have not made this possible within six months of the court decision, foster parents ought to be granted the standing in law to sue the adoption agency and initiate adoption proceedings.
<P>
<B>13) Enact laws requiring child welfare agencies to initiate adoption proceedings for any child who has been abandoned by his parents for six months.</B>
<P>
	This rule should apply for any child in out-of-home care for six months whose parent has not engaged in meaningful interaction with the child during that period. Due process in the courts will protect the rights of parents barred from contact with their children due to very unusual circumstances. However, a child left alone for six months is a child without a dedicated parent.
<P>
<B>CONCLUSION</B>
<P>
	More and more of the nation's children are at risk of child abuse and neglect as rates of illegitimacy rise. Their plight merits the generous response of dedicated people. Few responses can match the depth and devotion entailed in adopting a child. This dedication reduces a host of problems for the nation:  the costs of extended foster care, the poorer health and slower development of children in foster care or in the home of neglectful and abusing parents, and the higher incidence of addiction, crime, and dependency.
<P>
	Adoption increases the emotional, physical, and cognitive capacities of the children who are adopted. It improves the life chances of the biological mother. It saves vast amounts of money for the taxpayer. It brings much happiness to the adopting parents. It is good for all involved.
<P>
	Adoption works.
<P>
	The current welfare reform debate in Congress offers one of the best chances in decades to promote adoption. Sharply rising out-of-wedlock births add to the long-range costs of welfare, because being born out of wedlock significantly increases the chances of ending up on welfare. As this pool of needy children grows, all too often, up to two million couples waiting to adopt are frustrated in their efforts.
<P>
	The need is great and the solution is obvious:  adoption. Yet government agencies and practices actively discourage this solution which, unlike present policies, could help solve a major national problem while also reducing both welfare dependency and long-range costs. The situation cries out for reform. The suffering of the children cries out for reform.

<li> In FY 1992, a total of 659,000 children were in or passed through substitute care (foster care and specialized homes for foster children) during the year. The 421,000 children in substitute care at the beginning of the year had grown to 442,000 at the end of the year. From American Public Welfare Association, Voluntary Cooperative Information System (VCIS) Research Notes No. 9, August 1993.<P><li> For an excellent overview of the anti-adoption bias in government agencies, see Conna Craig, "What I Need Is a Mom," Policy Review, Summer 1995, pp. 41-49.<P>
<li> This number does not include informal adoptions by relatives that frequently take place within families -- something extended families have always done for other members in need.<P><LI> However, the term often causes initial resistance or apprehension on the part of potential adopting parents, who may fear having enormous burdens placed upon them. Many experts complain of the unnecessary and inordinate use of the term by state workers, the consequence frequently being the loss of a home for the child.<P>

However, "family preservation" guidelines (as opposed to the best interests of the child) lead to prolonged and frequently futile efforts at maternal reform.<P>
<LI> GAO Report, op. cit.<P><LI> The opponents, the Child Welfare League of America and the American Public Welfare Association, also argued that the child's first right is to his biological family, not to care and nurturance, and that family preservation services must first be attempted with the mother -- even if she had abandoned her baby.<p><LI> Peter L. Benson, Anu R. Shorma, and Eugene C. Roehlkepartain, Growing Up Adopted -- A Portrait of Adolescents and Their Families (Minneapolis:  Search Institute, June 1994).<P>
<LI> This finding illustrates the power of early adoption and the need to reform agency practices which keep children in prolonged foster care during their early infancy, when they are highly adoptable.<P><LI>   1Benson et al., Growing Up Adopted.<P><LI> Ibid.<p><LI> Kathleen S. Marquis and Richard A. Detweiler, "Does Adoption Mean Different?  An Attributional Analysis," Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol. 48, No. 4 (1985), pp. 1054-1066. An interesting anomaly has emerged from an analysis of adoption studies. Clinical studies traditionally have shown adopted adolescents to be overrepresented in psychiatric settings. The same occurred here, but these adolescents were found not to have emotional or psychological problems at these rates. Adopted adults are less likely to receive treatment than the general population. This seeming contradiction occurs because adoptive parents are more likely to refer their adopted children for possible treatment. Of all adopted children referred by parents for clinical treatment, only 27 percent had a clinical diagnosis. The remainder -- almost 75 percent -- received counseling for normal adolescent issues.<P>

The fact that the exit numbers of minority children are smaller than those of white children will result in additional increases in the proportion of minority children in care. If current trends continue, minority children will become the clear majority in the nation's substitute care population in the next few years. There already are more minority children than white children in the substitute care systems of several large urban states today.

National Minority Politics is published monthly by Richberg Communications, Inc.  The magazine and this World Wide Web site are founded on the following principles:<p>
 




<ol>
  <b><li>Strong Families.</b> The foundation of any stable society is -- first and foremost -- strong families in every community.  We should stress to our youth the importance of marriage and keeping families together.<p>

  <b><li>Individual responsibility.</b> Almost every human being is endowed with the necessary means to be successful -- a sound mind and the ability to think, reason and make choices.  These natural gifts are accompanied with the equal obligation to take responsibility for one's actions.<p>

  <b><li>Free enterprise.</b> Our nation has been the most successful on earth in fostering and promoting a free enterprise system with opportunity for all.  Strengthening this system is our best hope for a thriving economy in the future.
<p>
  <b><li>Less government.</b> The size and influence of government at all levels must be minimized in order to guarantee a free society.  Government should play a role in performing certain functions, like maintaining a strong defense, but we should not expect government to solve all our problems.<p>

  <b><li>Strong Defense.</b> While it is not America's role to be the world's policeman, there are sometimes threats to American lives and interests which we cannot tolerate.<p>

  <b><li>Community-based problem solving</b> Rather than looking to the federal government to solve local problems, such as crime and education, we can and should develop solutions in our local communities.<p>

  <b><li>Good taste and common sense in popular culture.</b> The level of violence, promiscuous sex and immoral behavior on television, in movies and in music lyrics should be reduced as it has adverse effects on society, especially our children.<p>

  <b><li>Compassionate conservatism.</b> While stressing the importance of free enterprise and less government, we must recognize our responsibility as a society to help those who help themselves, or who are unable to help themselves through no fault of their own.<p>

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>
<h3>An American Opportunity</h3>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>Introduction &amp;  Summary</h2>
</center><blockquote>
<P>
 America is in the midst of  an historic period of  dynamic change
and opportunity driven by a transformation of  technology.  In
1995, one half of all capital investment in America, broadly defined,
will be in computers and telecommunications equipment. The telecommunications
industry already constitutes one seventh of our economy and is
growing.  By the early 21st century, the global information industry
is expected to be a $3 trillion market.  Yet the government statutory
and regulatory system now in place was erected in the 1930s during
the New Deal and embodies the limits and technological realities
of a long-vanished era.
<P>
 To seize the opportunities of the knowledge age, a new, modern
and efficient governmental role with respect to telecommunications
is needed.  Government can, and indeed should, perform certain
tasks.  This report is an effort to identify and focus on the
essential governmental functions needed for America to enter the
new century -- and to cleanse the detritus of the past.  Many
current governmental institutions and regulations are relics of
past practices and  seek to perform tasks better performed by
competitive markets.  The report has a simple goal: to provide
for a modern and effective government to complement market forces
to speed the development of  new products and services for Americans.
<P>
 The new, smaller government role (hereafter the 'Replacement
Model') is based on a functional analysis of what a government
should be for a digital era of the 1990s and beyond.  A functional
analysis reveals certain overarching principles which are applied
by the Replacement Model.  Conceptually, a functional analysis
supports a government role for ensuring parity of  opportunity
 across media such as wireline, cellular, broadcast, DBS and video
dialtone.  The success of any one company or even industry should
reflect their inherent attributes rather than their relative regulatory
handicaps.  With respect to mission, the Replacement Model will
provide for a new Office of Communications (the &quot;OC&quot;)
to be located within an existing Executive Branch agency.  
<P>
 The OC will concentrate on the following tasks: (1) overseeing
the implementation of a transition from the current practice of
universal service based on hidden and elaborate cross-subsidies
to a smaller, more efficient and targeted needs -- based system;
(2) overseeing the mass privatization of  spectrum to the American
people through a sequenced, phased-in  auction process; (3) coordinating
a non-interference standard to govern the private sector's use
of spectrum; and (4) coordinating U.S. international commitments
and opportunities for telecommunications. Supporting the new,
more focused  governmental role will be an emphasis on traditional
antitrust enforcement utilizing existing expertise and personnel
located within the U.S. Department of Justice. 
<P>
 The Replacement Model offers a detailed and  specific action
plan for the transition to a the new, modern government.  Existing
statutes, rules and regulations are either eliminated immediately,
subject to a three year sunset provision, or retained and re-assigned
to the Replacement Model's Office of Communications.  At the end
of the sunset period, those rules and regulations deemed necessary
by the OC to promote economic welfare through competition will
be retained only by affirmative action of Congress.
<P>
 Part One of this report establishes the case for replacing and
modernizing the existing regulatory regime. The focus is on the
systemic influence of  regulations and statutes which authorize
the Federal Communications Commission (&quot;FCC&quot;) and have
inflicted staggering costs upon American consumers and the economy.
 The report recognizes that other restrictions arising from federal/state
mechanisms such as the Modified Final Judgment (&quot;MFJ&quot;)
 settlement also have had an impact on competition.  
<P>
 The systemic problem, however, remains that the statutes, rules
and regulations underlying the FCC have denied through intrusive
regulation the U.S. economy tens of billions of dollars in annual
growth. Current public servants may be dedicated and hard working.
 It is the system itself which in some measure mandates that the
FCC engage in certain practices and procedures which block new
products and services such as cable TV, microwave, cellular, voice
mail, video dialtone and new personal communications services.
For decades these technologies have been denied Americans while
the FCC struggled to decide what to allow to the consumer.  Price
competition has been stymied and business costs ultimately borne
by the American public have been needlessly inflated by a plethora
of entry, ownership and contractual regulations of telephone and
media markets. Part One details the history of this structural
obstruction of technology and competition.
<P>
 Resolving the economic imbalances imposed by universal service
is a key ingredient to any meaningful reform proposal.  Basic
dialtone telephone service for those truly in need is an essential
element to a sustainable modernization of government's role. 
Part Two offers two approaches to providing basic service for
those truly in need.  The approaches make the actual price of
phone service open and clear to the American people.  Currently,
a hidden tax is imposed on all through various subsidies.  Urban
users subsidize rural users. Business and long-distance rates
subsidize residential rates. Much of the money is paid to companies,
not consumers.  Many of the well-to-do get subsidized.   The current
system imposes burdens on those allegedly it seeks to help --
those financially less well off.  An urban, single parent family
on government assistance programs today actually subsidizes the
phone bills of  rural users -- even if the rural user calls from
a ski chalet or vacation home  straight out of  <I>Lifestyles
of the Rich and Famous.</I>
<P>
  Moreover, no one knows what the subsidies cost despite the billions
of dollars in the system because the lack of accountability destroys
incentives to economize.  Like a Soviet-era good under Gosplan,
no one really pays the true cost of the phone services they use.
 The replacement model puts a halt to this muddle.  
<P>
 The model supports the claimed purpose of cross-subsidization,
promotion of so-called &quot;universal service,&quot; but in ways
that are more accountable, explicit and efficient.  Both plans
recognize a <I>national </I> interest in keeping basic phone service
affordable to all Americans.  The first model has three facets.
 First, the federal program to keep residential telephone rates
affordable in high cost areas would be limited to that amount
needed on a going forward basis to provide wireline service to
those areas.  Second, the model embraces use of  a specific, targeted
means test to provide assistance to those truly in need.  Third,
the responsibility for the remainder of the universal service
subsidies paid by interstate long distance callers would devolve
to the state level subject to broad federal guidelines.  Restoration
of market prices and efficient pricing will foster real competition
and result in substantially lower prices.
<P>
 The second approach proposes that the responsibility for maintaining
universal service be transferred to the states.   Those local
exchange costs that are now allocated to the interstate jurisdiction
are returned to the respective states.  Each state could recover
those costs as deemed fit, subject to federal guidelines.  Under
this model, federal law would  pre-empt entry restrictions and
prohibit discriminatory treatment of interstate users for comparable
services. 
<P>
 Both approaches are subject to strict federal guidelines forbidding
price discrimination and requiring interconnection for all competitors.
 Moreover, the Replacement Model continues the federal pre-emption
of state regulation of wireless services.
<P>
 In Part Three, the Replacement Model promotes American competitiveness
through a modern approach to use of  the spectrum. Spectrum is
transferred to private hands in a sequenced,  phased-in approach.
 In Phase One, those with current licenses in spectrum are granted
title to the spectrum currently used.  These owners of spectrum
, the vast majority of whom have already purchased their stations,
will be free to use, transfer and develop spectrum as they deem
necessary.   Property rights in spectrum will be enforced through
traditional legal protections afforded all property owners in
the courts. Under this approach, industry would also have recourse
to the OC for interference issues and use of laboratories for
testing and evaluation of new equipment and technologies.
<P>
 In Phase Two, applications pending before the FCC as of May 1,
1995,  would be granted title to the spectrum on an expedited
basis.  In addition, the OC will on an expedited basis, begin
to roll-out non-allocated spectrum for the presumptive 
<P>
use by private sector entities seeking its use.  Competing bids
for the spectrum will be subject to expedited auction.  This bottom-up,
demand-driven process will allow market forces to determine spectrum
use and jump start competition and technological innovation. 

<P>
 In Phase Three, the government will begin the process of turning
over its spectrum to the private sector by beginning an expedited
survey of available spectrum bands, establishing standardized
parcels for entrants to claim.  The government currently presides
over massive amounts of under-utilized spectrum far in excess
of its needs for possible use by the Department of Defense, NASA,
etc. 
<P>
 In Phase Four, the government will  permit claimants to claim
title to available spectrum as identified in the spectrum survey.
In the event that there are multiple claimants for a particular
parcel of spectrum, an auction will be held.  Each department
making the spectrum available that is subject to an auction will
retain a portion of auction proceeds for modernization to more
efficient digital equipment, re-location expenses and for current
operations.  Remaining auction proceeds can be dedicated to deficit
reduction.
<P>
 The premise again is that spectrum use will be dictated by the
American people, not the government.  The Replacement Model envisions
a governmental role for coordinating &quot;spectrum contours,&quot;
&quot;overlay rights&quot; and &quot;band management rights&quot;
but mandates that these rights be defined quickly and made available
for private investors willing to risk capital in developing new
wireless services.  The key is to sell title in property, not
mere licenses.  Those who claim unchallenged use of identified
parcels or bid and win title to spectrum are free to develop and/or
re-sell the spectrum as with any other private property right
subject to antitrust review and the geographic and interference
boundaries of property assignments.  The primary goal of these
spectrum reforms is the rapid and efficient creation of a spectrum
market and to provide an economic stimulus in job creation.  Recent
announcements by the government confirmed that auctioning spectrum
can also have a supplemental benefit of raising billions in revenue
for deficit reduction.
<P>
  Finally, Part Four sets out a detailed and specific plan for
implementing the Replacement Model's recommendations.   It re-assigns
and re-organizes the functions now performed by the FCC.  The
goal is to focus on the critical tasks for today and the future.
 Government unquestionably should fulfill some functions and services
for the benefit of all Americans.  Others should be eliminated
immediately. A third residual category of FCC rules and regulations
would be sunsetted in three years.
<P>
  The Replacement Model  updates government to account for the
differences between the analog past and the technologies now emerging
through market forces.  For sixty years, the government substituted
administrative, bureaucratic decision-making for the free market.
 Two old, major assumptions -- (1) the existence of a &quot;natural
monopoly&quot; in telecommunications; and (2) the assumption that
technology would remain essentially static or unchanging -- are
untenable for the 21st century.  The model makes a clear break
with the past, embracing competition with antitrust enforcement
and by transferring authority to the states in those instances
when monopoly regulation remains temporarily necessary. The new
role for government is leaner, more cost effective and serves
the American people.   This, then,  is a call to action to meet
the challenges of the telecommunications revolution -- an American
opportunity.

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>
<h3>An American Opportunity</h3>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>Part One: The Regulatory Roadblock to the Telecom Revolution</h2>
</center>

<P>

<B>Overview</B>
<P>
 The failure of telecommunications regulation is systemic to the
regulatory structure created by and under the Communications Act
of 1934.  Regulation has been prone to wasteful delay, costly
and unnecessary intrusion on market processes without due regard
for regulation's unintended effects, and abuse of process by special
interests.  These problems are not linked to any particular FCC.
 Rather they span the decades and continue to this day.  Nor are
the hard work and many hours spent by public servants in the FCC
a factor in improving the situation.  It is systemic. In light
of the accelerated pace of technological change and heightened
global competition, the ill effects of this system are increasingly
unacceptable.   
<P>
 The FCC's processes have been prone to delay for three reasons.
 First, considerable delay results simply from good old fashioned
 bureaucratic practices. The Commission's processing of licenses
and formal complaints take inordinately long.  Second, centralized
decision making by regulators dealing with complicated issues
better left to market forces leads to wasteful regulatory vacillation.
 As explained below, the agency's back-and-forth handling of basic
regulatory questions has been extensive.  Third, some of the regulatory
functions assigned to or assumed by the FCC functions duplicate
responsibilities of federal antitrust and other authorities. 
This duplication complicates the review of matters such as telecommunications
and represents needless expense.   
<P>
 Over time, the regulatory system has expanded its regulatory
authority to address problems it did not fully understand in ways
fraught with unintended effects.  Through the financial interest
and syndication and prime time access rules, the FCC attempted
to increase diversity in television programming by attempting
to shift profits from the television networks to Hollywood producers.
 Instead, it simply created a bonanza for game-show producers.
 Through its so-called fairness doctrine, it justified encroachment
on broadcasters' First Amendment rights without due regard for
the chilling of speech.  In the late 1960s and 1970s, the FCC
dramatically increased the tax on interstate long-distance service,
lowering residential telephone rates artificially for the rich
and poor alike.  Perhaps most costly of all, the FCC's top-down
management of the electromagnetic spectrum frustrated the development
of new broadcast stations, television networks and innumerable
&quot;wireless&quot; radio services.  
<P>
 Lastly, the FCC's regulatory process has lent itself to abuse
by existing firms and special interests resistant to competition.
 Using regulatory processes against one's existing or potential
 competitors is a temptation few businesses and almost no trade
association can resist.  The perennial loser of this &quot;gaming&quot;
of the regulatory system has been the American public.  For example,
if the Commission had authorized phone companies to begin competing
directly against cable in 1984, cable consumers would have saved
between $3 and $7 billion annually between 1983 and 1992.  Likewise,
the FCC-imposed delay in licensing cellular telephony cost America
$85 billion in growth and consumption.  
<P>
 The case for reforming and replacing this  failed regulatory
regime is compelling.  Over the last two decades the FCC moved
laboriously -- sometimes in the face of political opposition from
Congress and sometimes after prodding from the courts -- to open
markets to competition and to reform existing regulation. Despite
these steps, the systemic problems persist.   Delay through regulatory
gaming is still the order of the day.  For example, in the past
it was AT&amp;T who opposed opening the long distance and equipment
markets to competition and broadcasters who stymied competition
from cable TV systems.  Today, it is MCI and other long distance
carriers who oppose AT&amp;T's efforts to compete, it is the cable
companies who oppose telephone companies' efforts to compete in
video markets, and it is the broadcasters who oppose satellite-delivered
radio services.  
<P>
 In numerous cases the FCC continues costly regulation and intrudes
on business decision making that could be much better handled
by market forces or state government.  For example, federal price
regulation of the long-distance market is counterproductive. 
Virtually all of the existing broadcast regulation imposed unnecessary
costs ultimately borne by the American viewing public.  Most of
the spectrum remains hostage to bureaucratic gridlock. 
<P>
 The case for radical transformation is even more compelling now
given that the market power rationale for much of this regulatory
intervention has largely disappeared. The telephone industry used
to be a monopoly; but the main segment of that industry under
the FCC's jurisdiction  long-distance service  has become highly
rivalrous.  Although some experts disagree on the current extent
of competition in local telephone service, most would agree that
full competition in the local loop is both feasible and highly
likely.  The broadcast industry used to be oligopolistic; now
the number of broadcasters has burgeoned and they compete vigorously
with cable and direct broadcast satellites.  An invigorated &quot;wireless
cable&quot; (MMDS) industry supplies additional competition, and
telephone companies will enter video markets in the near future.

<P>
  If America's regulatory and statutory regime for telecommunications
dates back to the Communications Act of 1934,  it is helpful to
recall that in 1934 the telegraph still was the dominant form
of communications for Americans. Enacted in the midst of the Great
Depression, the 1934 Act today is defended after the fact by the
following assumptions: (i) a natural monopoly existed in the telecommunications
industry, warranting price-and-entry federal regulation; (ii)
broadcast spectrum , both radio and TV, was scarce and required
federal oversight; and (iii) the analog technologies of the day
dictated the form and function of communications. At that time
only a telephone let people communicate point to point; only a
radio broadcast, for example, could reach out to many.  None of
these assumptions holds true today.   We are now in an era of
accelerating innovation moving towards digital technologies in
 the 21st century:
<UL>
<LI><B>Competition, not monopolies. </B>Introduction of microwave,
fiber optics, cellular, digital cellular, co-axial cable, satellite
and the new personal communications services/personal communications
networks (&quot;PCS/PCN&quot;) mean that competition, rather than
natural monopoly, better characterizes the telecommunications
 industry.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Abundance, not scarcity. </B>The future is and will be
characterized by abundance, not scarcity. Over the wireline, the
capacity to transmit data (&quot;bandwidth&quot;) is doubling
every five years. A fiber in the new fiber optic networks can
carry in 1995 simultaneously 37,500 separate conversations.  The
marginal cost of  transmitting a call is literally zero.
<P>Wireless spectrum also is characterized by new abundance.
 New digital techniques<B> </B>known as Code Division Multiple
Access (&quot;CDMA&quot;)  present a massive wideband increase
in efficient use of spectrum.
<P>In broadcast fields, other compression techniques and advances
in spectrum management open up huge segments of spectrum for commercial,
educational and public applications.
<P>The old approach of the government husbanding scarce spectrum
and tightly regulating its use no longer has a valid basis.  

<LI><B>Flexibility in transmission, not limits.  </B>Digital signals,
consisting of 1s and 0s, do not define and are not characterized
by the devices through which the signals are transmitted. Telephone
calls, faxes, or TV broadcasts can be sent and received by any
variety of platforms, processed by on- board microprocessors.
 Video can be sent into the American home <I>via </I>coax cable,
wireless, satellite direct digital broadcast, or over the telephone
line. Telephone calls can be cellular/ wireless, sent over the
telephone line or through a Cable TV coax cable. In all instances,
how the digital transmissions are sent and the means they are
received do not change the nature of the transmission.  
<P>The 1s and 0s are the same.  The analog technology of the
1934 Act could not offer that flexibility.  A telephone had to
make a phone call.  A radio had to receive a broadcast, etc. 
The 1934 Act's separate provisions for wireline telephones, radio
broadcasts, etc. are obsolete and reflect the limits of analog
technologies. 
</UL>

<P>

<P>
 Despite the rapid growth of competition in all sectors of the
industry, the FCC continues to expand.  At present, the Commission
has over 2,200 full-time employees. Its budget for 1995 is $185
million.  Adjusted for inflation, the Commission's budget fell
6.5 percent during the Reagan Administration.  It rose over 56
percent during the Bush and Clinton Administrations.  In the two
most recent fiscal years, the Commission's budget increased a
total of 35 percent. The Clinton Administration has proposed a
budget for fiscal year 1996 of $224 million, a 62 percent increase
over bloated 1994 levels.
<P>
[FIGURE 1]
<P>
 The Commission's staff has grown from 1,753 full-time employees
in 1993, to a proposed 2,271 for 1996  a 30 percent increase in
three years.  The Common Carrier Bureau employs 270 people, and
spends an estimated $22 million a year.  The Mass Media Bureau
employs 335 employees, spending an estimated $27 million a year.
 The Cable Services Bureau has 223 employees; its 1995 budget
was about $18 million.  About 865 people, or more than 40 percent
of FCC staff, provide &quot;executive direction and support.&quot;
 Nearly 40 percent are engaged in &quot;non-feeable&quot; activities
that cannot be linked to any specific regulatory program.
<P>
 <I><B>The Challenge.  </B></I>Apart from budgetary savings, transforming
telecommunications regulation will create an enormous opportunity
for America.  The pace of technical change and global competition
have accelerated.  The faster the potential rate of innovation,
the greater care that must be taken to assure that regulations
designed to address outmoded monopoly concerns do not have the
unintended effect of retarding innovation.  Likewise, the globalization
of markets and economic liberalization of Soviet bloc and developing
countries have heightened the competition facing U.S. companies.
 At the turn of the century, a country growing at 4 percent per
year would have been considered to have a high growth rate.  Now
something closer to 10 percent would be in order.  Starting in
1780, it took Britain 60 years to double its output per person.
 Beginning in 1880, Japan achieved this feat in 34 years.  Starting
in 1966, South Korea did it in 11 years.  
<P>
 Our country is poised to take advantage of tremendous opportunities
for economic growth and social development through reform of the
government's role in regulating the telecommunications industry.
 At stake is our ability to compete and prosper in an international
information market that is projected to exceed $3 trillion by
the close of the decade.  Our entrepreneurial culture, openness
to innovation and acceptance of robust competition give American
concerns a comparative advantage.  America's technical resurgence,
especially in the digital arena, provides a basis for reforming
its telecom regulatory regime to provide a powerful springboard
to greater technical advance and levels of prosperity.  The chief
obstacle in the way is unnecessary, increasingly costly, regulation.
<P>
 <I><B>The FCC's Performance.  </B></I>The rest of Part One details
some of the regulatory system's &quot;highlights&quot;.  The FCC's poor performance here in part is a symptom of  the regulatory
regime mandated by the 1934 Act.  We consider its processes for
licensing wires and spectrum and its program content. We end by
reviewing wasteful regulatory vacillation,  the complaint process
and duplicative functions.

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>
<h3>An American Opportunity</h3>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>1.1 Licensing</h2>
</center><blockquote>

<P>Section 214 of the 1934 Communications
Act gives the FCC broad power to license wireline facilities and
services used in interstate common carriage.  No facilities may
be deployed or operated without the FCC's advance approval.  The
FCC licenses use of the airwaves too, under section 307 of the
Act.  The Commission allocates frequencies to various uses, and
assigns them to specific users.  Cable facilities, by contrast,
are licensed by local authorities; the Commission exercises only
general oversight over the franchising process.
<P>
 Across the board, the Commission's licensing process is characterized
by procrastination, equivocation and seemingly endless delay.
 Unnecessary delay in issuing licenses ultimately found to be
in the public interest imposes enormous costs on the industry
and the national economy.  It particularly increases the risk
and cost of introducing new technologies.  While the FCC equivocates
about issuing new licenses, the market waits.  If a $20 billion
a year industry develops five years later than it might have because
of unnecessary FCC delays in issuing the needed licenses, the
American public pays  in lost services and jobs.
<P>
 <I><B>a. Licensing wires</B></I><B>.  </B>The most surprising
fact about the licensing of interstate wires is that it is required
at all.  There is no obvious reason why a federal commission must
approve every new deployment of equipment, wires or wireline services
that can arguably be characterized as &quot;interstate.&quot;
 As the long-distance telephone industry has demonstrated, entry
can be completely deregulated with no adverse effects.  Nonetheless,
comprehensive licensing by the FCC remains the norm.
<P>
<I>  </I><B>1). </B><I> <B>Customer Premises Equipment</B> (CPE).</I>
 Until the 1960s, the FCC backed AT&amp;T's position that telephones
and other forms of customer premises equipment were an integral
part of &quot;telephone service,&quot; to be provided only by
the monopoly telephone company.  In 1956, for example, the Commission
agreed with AT&amp;T that the sale of the Hush-a-Phone  a small
plastic device that snapped onto the mouthpiece of the phone to
provide privacy  violated AT&amp;T's tariffs and was therefore
illegal.
<P>
 Today, the CPE market is fully competitive.  The market for telephone
handsets alone generates $750 million a year.  Assuming that competition
has driven prices in this market down by 20 percent (a reasonable
assumption) if the FCC had simply approved handset competition
in 1956, when the Hush-A-Phone sought to enter the market, consumers
could have saved several billions between 1956 and the late 1970s
when competition was allowed.
<P>
 These figures reflect what consumers might have saved if the
FCC had merely authorized competition in handset markets.  The
overall market for CPE  including PBXs, key systems, voice processing
equipment, teleconferencing equipment, telephones and fax machines
 generated $16 billion in 1994.  One can only speculate as to
how much more consumers would have saved if the FCC had approved
competition in all CPE markets generally a decade or two before
it did.  What is clear is that in this single market, FCC licensing
delays cost consumers billions of dollars.
<P>
<B>2). <I>Long-distance Services</I></B>.  The Commission's
forty-year effort to protect AT&amp;T from long-distance competitors
tells a similar story.  The FCC grudgingly permitted limited private-line
competition in 1969, six years after MCI filed its first request
to do so.  The Commission rejected subsequent attempts by MCI
to expand its offerings in 1975, and to interconnect with AT&amp;T
in 1978.  On both occasions, MCI had to go to the D.C. Circuit
Court of Appeals to win those rights.
<P>
 Today, long-distance is a $65 billion market, more than double
its 1978 size.  Both the FCC and Department of Justice maintain
that competition in long-distance markets has spurred innovation
and pushed prices sharply down.  To the extent this is so, the
Commission's decades-long policy of <I>forbidding</I> competition
in long-distance markets once again cost consumers tens of billions
of dollars had the FCC fully opened long-distance markets in 1968,
rather than in 1978.
<P>
 The FCC's regulation of the competitive process in the long distance
market has also denied consumers the benefits of robust competition.
  Throughout the 1980s, the FCC stymied efforts by the incumbent
carrier to cut prices in the face of competition.   When it eventually
allowed AT&amp;T to respond by introducing optional calling plans
in the residential market and tariff 12 and contract offerings
in the business market, prices fell substantially.  Amazingly,
long-distance carriers continue to operate under difficult notice
and tariff requirements.  Just this year, MCI intervened to delay
reductions in tariffs that would have given consumers discounts
up to 50%.  MCI contended that the rates were too low. The delay
in introducing the plan, which was finally approved, cost consumers
an estimated $30 million. Generally, had competition been permitted
to reduced interstate rates by 10 percent, consumers would have
saved tens of billions of  dollars.
<P>
<I>  </I><B>3). <I>Enhanced Services</I></B>.  The Commission's
two-decade crusade against the provision of &quot;enhanced services&quot;
by telephone companies has imposed yet another layer of costs.
 From the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s, the Commission enforced
a policy of &quot;maximum separation&quot; between &quot;basic&quot;
voice services and network-based data processing, electronic services,
and computers.  The Commission did not back away from this quarantine
until 1986, and did not allow AT&amp;T or the Bell Companies to
provide enhanced services directly until 1992.  Today, enhanced
services comprise a $13.6 billion market.  Phone companies compete
head-to-head with independent providers to deliver enhanced services
like voice mail to consumers.
<P>
 It is impossible to estimate precisely what this unnecessary
quarantine has cost consumers.  But the single example of voice
mail demonstrates that the costs were staggering.  Today, phone
companies provide voice-mail services at roughly $5 a month per
mailbox, to roughly ten million customers.  This single service
alone is thus a $600 million a year industry in the U.S. economy.
 Yet the market scarcely existed at all until phone companies
were finally authorized to serve it.  Though the technology was
available in the 1970s, if not earlier, FCC permission to deploy
it did not come until 1988.  The cost to the economy from the
Commission's delay in authorizing these services has been estimated
to approximate $6 billion.
<P>
<I>  </I><B>4). <I>Cable TV</I></B>.  In 1958, the Commission
declared that it had no jurisdiction over cable television; cable
was viewed as a strictly local matter.  The Commission revisited
the issue in 1959 and again disclaimed jurisdiction.  In 1962,
the FCC decided it would regulate cable, but only indirectly,
through the microwave systems used to import distant television
signals.  The FCC adopted a more general cable policy in 1965,
still relying on its authority over microwave common carriers.
 Finally, the Commission announced it had full jurisdiction over
cable after all, because cable competed with television.
<P>
 The Commission did not wade into the threshold business of franchising
local cable networks; it left that to local authorities.  Instead,
as described below, the Commission set out general rules for what
cable systems could or must carry, simply to limit cable competition
against established broadcasters.
<P>
 Cable today is a $23 billion a year industry.  Once again, it
is impossible to quantify with precision what consumers lost by
Commission policies that aimed to suppress cable for the benefit
of broadcasters.  But given the high value consumers place on
television programming,  the Commission-imposed drag on competition
certainly cost consumers billions of dollars in the 1960s and
1970s.
<P>
<I>  </I><B>5). <I>Video Dialtone</I></B><I> (VDT)</I>.  In 1970,
the FCC put in place rules to exclude phone companies from the
provision of video programming and cable television.  In 1987
it suggested that the policy might be inhibiting competition and
began to reevaluate it.  The reevaluation occupied the Commission
for five years.  In 1992 the Commission again declared its general
support for telco provision of video dialtone services.  Many
phone companies then filed for permission to provide commercial
services.  The Commission took another two years to approve the
first such application.
<P>
 In the few markets where a second cable company has challenged
the first, cable television rates are 20 to 30 percent lower than
in markets served by only a single provider.  If the Commission
had authorized phone companies to begin competing directly against
cable in 1984, and had phone companies actually entered at that
time, cable subscribers could have benefited from billions in
savings <I>a</I> <I>year</I> for the period from 1983 to 1992.
<P>
 The Replacement Model recognizes that federal licensing of both
common-carrier and cable wires and their uses is now obsolete.
 State regulators already oversee the physical deployment of facilities
along public rights of way.  State authorities likewise regulate
the prices charged by local phone companies in areas where the
phone companies are still deemed to possess monopoly power.  The
FCC's role in licensing wireline facilities is now simply an expensive
anachronism, one that costs the economy enormously in lost competition
and yields no concomitant benefits whatsoever.  The Replacement
Model addresses this by updating the 1934 Act specifically in
Part Four, sharply reducing any federal role in licensing and
therefore slowing the introduction of the wireline facilities.
 
<P>
 <B>b.  <I>Licensing spectrum</I>. </B>Licensing of spectrum presents
somewhat different problems.  Two adjacent radio stations cannot
broadcast on the same frequencies simultaneously; rules or property
rights of some kind are needed to prevent interference.  The Commission
licenses spectrum to private users for fixed periods of time.
 With few exceptions, the licenses are given away; they are not
sold.
<P>
 Protracted delays in issuing licenses cost both industry and
consumers enormously.  And the Commission seldom issues licenses
cleanly; there are almost always many strings attached.  These
prescriptions impose additional, large costs on the economy and
consumer welfare.
<P>
<I>  </I><B>1). <I>Radio and Television</I></B>.  The introduction
of both FM radio and television was delayed by years of FCC equivocation
over which bands would be assigned to which uses.  FM radio technology,
which was invented in 1933, was not in widespread use until the
1960s.  The modern television was exhibited by RCA in 1939, but
the FCC took years to adopt initial standards.  The FCC then froze
all applications for TV licenses until 1952.  In the year after
the freeze was ended, the number of stations tripled. However,
a 1952 FCC decision deliberately limited the number of viable
stations per market  and impeded the creation of additional TV
networks at enormous cost to the American viewing public.
<P>
 Licensing radio transmitters of every kind remains one the Commission's
largest and most time-consuming activities.  Between 1984 and
1994, the Commission designated 6,834 broadcast license applications
for hearing.  The administrative costs of those proceedings approached
$50 million over ten years.  Licensing broadcast applicants by
lottery would have cost the FCC just over $12 million; licensing
via auction would have cost just $2.4 million, in addition to
generating substantial revenue.
<P>
 But those numbers pale beside the costs society bears while it
waits for the FCC to get licenses out the door.  Judging from
the secondary market, broadcast licenses for AM radio, FM radio
and broadcast television are worth, in the aggregate, about $13
billion.  Direct broadcast satellite (DBS) spectrum is worth an
estimated $3 billion; MMDS spectrum is worth roughly $1 billion;
IVDS spectrum is worth over $200 million.  Spectrum, in short,
is an enormously valuable commodity  when it finally gets into
private hands.  In the aggregate, broadcast spectrum licenses
in use today are worth an estimated $17 billion.
<P>
 With a commodity this valuable, every year, every month, of delay
in putting it to productive use costs the economy enormously.
 If it just sits idle for a year, the economy suffers an irretrievable
loss.  If FCC licensing procedures were responsible for delaying
the movement of  spectrum into productive, private uses, the delays
would be responsible for reducing the broadcast industry's total
revenues by about $38 billion, and total economic output by a
substantial fraction of this $38 billion.
<P>
<I>  </I><B>2. <I>Cellular</I>.</B>  Cellular technology was first
conceived in 1947 by Bell Laboratories.  AT&amp;T was operating
its first experimental cellular telephone system in 1962, but
the FCC did not even get around to allocating spectrum for cellular
until 1974.  The first cellular licenses were not handed out until
1983.  Today, the cellular industry generates some $14.2 billion
in revenues a year.
<P>
 But the delays were much longer than a year.  Cellular service
could have been introduced a decade earlier; the technology was
in hand, and the only obstacle was FCC licensing.  Economists
estimate that the decade of delay cost  America roughly $85 billion.
<P>
 At a finer level of detail, the economy lost millions simply
because cellular licenses were issued through lengthy comparative
hearings rather than through quick auctions.  Comparative hearings
typically took 18 months.  In 1985, it was estimated that delays
of that order eroded the value of each cellular license by $90,000
and cost the government $20,000 per hearing in administrative
costs.  Extrapolated over the 60 licenses for which comparative
hearings were used, this method of license assignment cost the
economy roughly $9 million.  The remaining 1,400 cellular licenses
were assigned through a lottery process, which was estimated to
have delay and administrative costs of $67,000 per license; overall,
these lotteries thus cost the economy another $130 million in
1994 dollars.  Auctions, if used instead, could have saved the
economy more than $100 million. 
<P>
<I>  </I><B>3). <I>PCS</I>.</B>  The FCC's handling of Personal
Communication Services (&quot;PCS&quot;) licenses marked a significant
improvement over past practices.  But even here, unnecessary delays
have been very costly.  PCS services were introduced in the United
Kingdom in 1989.  That same year, the FCC received two petitions
for a PCS rulemaking.  In the more than five years since, fewer
than 150 of the nearly 3,500 broadband and narrowband PCS licenses
have actually been assigned.
<P>
 Assuming that PCS competition can push the price of wireless
phone service down by 20 percent, existing cellular consumers
would have realized more than $9 billion in savings if PCS licenses
had been assigned five years ago.  If PCS had added five millionnew wireless customers during that period, an additional gain
to the economy of more than $1.5 billion from subscriber revenue
would have been realized.
<P>
<I>  </I><B>4). <I>Subcarrier Channels</I></B>.  Radio and TV
stations can readily use interstitial bits of their spectrum to
transmit paging signals, electronic TV guides, and other kinds
of data.  The transmission of radio programming via subchannel
frequencies was developed as early as 1948.  The Commission did
not permit use of these frequencies for anything but broadcast
services until 1983.  In 1994, the subcarrier market was worth
$40 million.  Had the FCC decided in 1948 to permit unlimited
use of subcarrier frequencies, the economy would have gained hundreds
of millions of  dollars.
<P>
<I><B>  </B></I><B>5).  <I>Vertical Blanking Intervals</I></B><I>
(VBI)</I>.  Restrictions on another usable part of the broadcast
video signal  the vertical blanking interval (VBI)  have entailed
significant losses as well.  The VBI was first used in 1967. 
But for the next 16 years the FCC did not permit the VBI to be
used for anything but closed-captioning.  In 1983, the Commission
finally authorized television stations to begin offering teletext
services on the VBI; additional VBI communications services such
as data transmission, computer software delivery, and paging were
authorized in 1985.  Total dollar values for this market are unavailable,
but like FM subcarriers, the delay in permitting full use of VBI
technology imposed an unnecessary cost on the economy.  
<P>
<I>  </I><B>6).  <I>Spectrum Zoning</I></B>.  Sub-carrier channels
and the VBI illustrate a more general point: the FCC routinely
&quot;zones&quot; spectrum licenses.  Licensees may use the spectrum
only in the specific, designated ways approved by the Commission
at the outset.  A licensee that discovers a new way of squeezing
more transport out of its spectrum (as sub-carrier and VBI technologies
allow), or discovers an entirely new, more valuable way of using
the spectrum  must go back to the Commission for a new license
 and risk standing in line for years or even decades while the
Commission considers the matter.
<P>
 The gains from dezoning can be substantial.  A government study
concluded that if a single UHF television station in Los Angeles
were to shut down and transfer its spectrum to a third cellular
provider, the overall public gain would be about $1 billion over
eight years.  This study predates the PCS decision and assumes
that the introduction of the third provider would cause a 25 percent
reduction in prices.  What the PCS auctions indicate are that
markets will move spectrum to higher valued uses.  Another example
is  Nextel (formerly &quot;Fleet Call&quot;).  In 1991, Nextel
purchased approximately 9 MHz of spectrum for roughly $45 million
in the Los Angeles market to provide digital wireless telephone
service.
<P>
 The Replacement Model, in Part Three, identifies a procedure
to permit the American economy to capture gains by dezoning spectrum
licenses across the board.  The simple <I>deletion</I> of a few
lines of legal boilerplate from FCC spectrum licenses -- and a
streamlined &quot;rollout&quot; of spectrum for creative use by
the private sector -- could create a very substantial increase
in social welfare nationwide.

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>
<h3>An American Opportunity</h3>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>1.2 Content and Program Regulation</h2>
</center><blockquote>
<P>
 <B>a. <I>Broadcast Program Formats. </I></B>Neither the Radio
Act of 1927 nor the Communications Act of 1934 expressly requires
broadcasters to provide specific kinds of programming or to serve
any particular constituency.  The Commission, however, spent decades
trying to prescribe program formats.
<P>
 In 1946, the FCC published its &quot;Public Service Responsibility
of Broadcast Licensees&quot;  the &quot;Blue Book.&quot;  In applying
for license renewals, broadcasters were to show they had provided
&quot;balanced program structure.&quot;  In 1960, the Commission
replaced the Blue Book with even more specific guidelines as to
what constituted a well balanced programming structure.  From
1970 to 1981, the FCC tried unsuccessfully to curtail its program
review. The D.C. Circuit disagreed a third time.  In 1981 the
Supreme Court at last agreed that the Commission could reasonably
leave program formats to the marketplace.  The Commission eliminated
certain programming guidelines for radio in 1981, and for broadcast
television in 1984. 
<P>
 The Commission continues to insist, however, that programming
respond to &quot;community needs.&quot;  FCC regulation superflously
requires every radio and television broadcaster to provide &quot;significant
programming&quot; to five or more community issues each quarter.
 The Prime Time Access Rule, promulgated in 1970, and modified
in 1974 and 1975, still requires network affiliates to devote
at least one of the four daily &quot;prime time&quot; hours to
non-network programming.
<P>
 The decades of Commission meddling with program formats have
served no demonstrably useful purpose at all.  Between 1934 and
1978, the Commission found only eighteen occasions not to renew
a license because of inadequate program service.  Its programming-related
license revocation rate was less than one station every two years.
 Indeed, it has only refused to renew 142 licenses in all, for
any reason.  The vast majority of license renewals are approved.
<P>
<I> <B>b.</B> <B>The Fairness Doctrine</B></I><B>.</B>  In an
effort to make the airwaves accessible to the largest variety
of voices, the Commission instituted the so-called &quot;Fairness
Doctrine&quot; in 1949.  Broadcasters were to offer access to
their facilities for the airing of opposing viewpoints.  In 1959,
these rules were partly codified by Congress in its &quot;equal
time&quot; amendments to section 315 of the Communications Act.
 In 1967, the FCC extended the doctrine to advertising, or at
least to cigarette advertising.  In 1974 the Commission retreated
from this position and exempted all commercial advertising except
for &quot;editorial advertisements.&quot;  In 1981, the FCC determined
the Fairness Doctrine was no longer in the public interest and
in 1987, repealed it.  During the course of nearly 40 years, the
Commission issued more than 20 orders in pursuit of this policy.
<P> <HR>

<P>
<B>The FCC on the Fairness Doctrine:</B>                                
<P>                                                                 
<B>1974:</B><I> [T]he First Amendment impels, rather than prohibits, governmental promotion of a system which will ensure that the public will be informed of the important issues which confront it. . .The purpose and foundation of the fairness doctrine is therefore that of the First Amendment itself.</I>  (48 F.C.C.2d at   
5-6)                                                             
                           <P>                                      
<B>1985:</B><I> [W]e no longer believe that the fairness doctrine, as a matter of policy, serves the public interest. . . Furthermore, we find that the fairness doctrine, in operation, actually inhibits the presentation of controversial issues of public importance to the detriment of the public and in degradation of the editorial prerogatives of broadcast journalists.</I>  (102       
F.C.C.2d at 147)                                                 
                                                                 
<B>1987:</B><I> [W]e are persuaded that the fairness doctrine is unconstitutional on its face.</I>  (2 F.C.C. Rec. at 5047).          

<P>
<HR>

<P>
<I> </I><B>c. <I>Cable Programming</I></B><I>.</I>  The Commission
has also spent three decades trying to dictate what kind of programming
should or should not be carried on cable.  In 1966, the FCC tried
to persuade Congress to prohibit cable from originating its own
programming.  Three years later the Commission embraced the opposite
position: larger cable systems were <I>required</I> to originate
their own local programming on at least one channel.  The rule
survived two months; the Eighth Circuit found that the Commission
lacked the authority to regulate cable this way.  The Supreme
Court eventually upheld the Commission's power to require cable
program origination, but expressed no view on the validity of
the content rules.  In 1974, however, the Commission deleted the
origination requirement entirely.  The 1984 Cable Act expressly
forbids the FCC from imposing any new requirements concerning
the content of cable television services.                    
<P>                                    
<HR>
<P>

<P>
 A second FCC rulemaking crusade has addressed the carriage of
broadcast stations on cable.  In 1965, the FCC issued its first
set of &quot;must carry&quot; rules, directing cable providers
to carry local broadcast signals.  It revised the rules in 1972.
 In 1985, the D.C. Circuit struck down the Commission's rules.
 The Commission immediately responded with a new set of rules.
 These were struck down again a year later.  In 1992, Congress
passed its own version of must-carry rules.  A three-judge district
court upheld the rules; the Supreme Court has remanded the case
for further factual findings.  Since 1965, the Commission has
issued 57 orders promulgating or affirming must-carry rules, acted
on hundreds of petitions for carriage by broadcasters and waiver
requests by cable operators, and been reversed on appeal twice.

<P>
 While it has tried to require cable to carry some broadcast stations,
the FCC has labored equally hard to forbid carriage of others.
 Rules were designed to outlaw &quot;leapfrogging&quot;  the importation
of a distant network affiliate rather than a nearby one.  In 1970,
the Commission proposed a new version of &quot;distant signal&quot;
rules, somewhat less restrictive than the old.  In 1972 the Commission
changed its regime yet again.  Almost before the ink had dried,
the FCC began to amend and backtrack.  In 1976, the FCC eliminated
the &quot;leapfrogging rules.&quot;
<P>
<I> </I><B>d. <I>Financial Syndication Rules (Fin-Syn)</I>.</B>
 For many years, the Commission labored to control the relationships
between television networks and suppliers of TV programming in
order to encourage more diverse programming.  The Commission initiated
its first rulemaking on the subject in 1965.  Five years later
it issued its financial interest and syndication (&quot;fin-syn&quot;)
rules, which barred the networks from selling network-produced
programming directly to independent stations and from acquiring
a financial interest in syndicated programming. 
<P>
 The Department of Justice followed in 1974 with an antitrust
suit against the three networks, which resulted in a consent decree
that largely incorporated the FCC's rules.  After those decrees
expired in 1991, the FCC tried to reinstitute a modified set of
rules; these were struck down by the Seventh Circuit.  In thirty
years, the Commission has come roughly full circle.  The networks
have as much leeway to purchase and sell programming in 1995 as
they had in 1965.  In the three decades in between, however, the
Commission significantly intruded on this process.  Along the
way it issued 15 major opinions and a comprehensive staff report,
and defended its action before federal appellate courts three
times.  During much of this period a comprehensive antitrust consent
decree addressed precisely the same concerns and both were based
on misguided notions of network power over program supply.
<P>
 The Replacement Model, in Part Four, <I>infra</I>, proposes immediate
elimination or in a few instances sunsetting all program content
regulations.  Media markets are competitive today and will be
still more rivalrous tomorrow.   Content regulation is unnecessary,
counterproductive, and runs afoul of the First Amendment rights
of speakers.

<h2>1.3 Wasteful Vacillation</h2>
</center><blockquote>

<P> Centralized decision-making
by the FCC deals with complicated issues better left to market
forces.  Consequently, with rare exceptions, Commission rulemaking
is a quagmire of false starts, delay, backtracking, and endless
fine-tuning.  The Commission announces a major new regulatory
scheme: time and again, after substantial delay, it then abandons
it, drastically revises it, steps back to an earlier plan previously
discarded, or starts all over again after a rebuff from the courts.
 Both industry incumbents and firms considering entry spend years
guessing at what the final regulatory regime will be.  Endless
uncertainty in the regulatory process entails huge losses for
both consumers and providers alike.
<P>
<I> <B>a. Enhanced Services Supplied by Phone Companies</B></I>.
 The Commission has been equivocating for three decades over the
rules to govern phone company provision of &quot;enhanced services,&quot;
like voice mail.  During that period, the Commission has issued
over 150 orders, and has made five trips to appellate courts to
defend its rules. 
<P>
 The process began in 1966, when the FCC began investigating the
convergence of computers and communications.  Seven years later,
this <I>Computer</I> <I>I</I> proceeding culminated in rules mandating
that telephone companies offer enhanced services only through
separate subsidiaries.  Just three years into this scheme, the
Commission proposed another.  Its <I>Computer</I> <I>II</I> inquiry
lasted almost eight years.  <I>Computer</I> <I>II</I> resulted
in a new definition of what kinds of services properly belonged
in the separate subsidiaries.  Two years after this scheme was
fully developed, the FCC reconsidered the rules again: <I>Computer</I>
<I>III</I> had been launched.  <I>Computer III</I> would eliminate
the separate subsidiary requirement; network interconnection requirements
and accounting rules, the Commission now concluded, would suffice.
 A fourth rulemaking proposal was issued in February 1995.  Astonishingly,
the Commission is proposing separate subsidiaries once again,
the position first adopted in 1966.

<I> </I><B>b. <I>Cable Television Supplied by Phone Companies</I></B>.
 In 1968, the Commission declared that telephone companies required
certification before they could offer cable television service.
 The Commission formally barred telephone companies from the cable
market in 1970.  With hardly any consideration of the matter,
Congress codified the ban in the 1984 Cable Act.  In August 1986,
the FCC began reexamining the ban; by 1988 it had tentatively
concluded that it didn't serve the public interest.  In 1991,
the Commission invited further comment on the ban.  A year later,
the Commission formally recommended that Congress repeal it.
<P>
 In 1993, phone companies finally brought First Amendment challenges
against their blanket exclusion from the arena of &quot;video
speech.&quot;  Since then, fifteen federal judges have examined
the ban.  Without a single dissenting vote so far, all have concluded
that the ban is unconstitutional.
<P>
 The FCC has responded with open defiance: it has simply reaffirmed
its power to license all phone company operations under the common
carrier (not the cable television) provisions of the Communications
Act.  Phone companies have filed a new round of First Amendment
challenges.

<I> </I><B>c. <I>CPE</I>.</B>  Customer premises equipment (&quot;CPE&quot;)
is another example of FCC obstruction of market forces.  After
a decade of skirmishing and with prodding from an appellate court,
the FCC struck down all tariffs barring foreign attachments in
1968.  This ruling did not, however, cover handsets; they would
still be provided exclusively by the monopoly carrier.  It was
1975 before the FCC allowed full competition in the provision
of CPE, nearly 25 years after the issue arose.  In the process,
the Commission issued nearly 60 major notices and orders, including
13 in the Computer II proceedings dealing with structural separation
and tariffing issues.

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>
<h3>An American Opportunity</h3>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>1.4 Processing Complaints</h2>
</center><blockquote>

<P>
Some significant share of the
FCC's budget and energy is spent on processing complaints.  The
Commission does keep track of how many complaints are filed, and
tallies how many it takes off of the books.  But the Commission
makes no attempt to determine whether complaints are resolved
to anyone's ultimate satisfaction.  Most complaints of any significance
simply put the Commission in the position of adjudicating disputes
between large corporations, disputes that often require ultimate
resolution in court.
<P>
<I> </I><B>a. <I>Common Carriage</I></B>.  The Commission is required
by statute to investigate and dispose of all complaints against
interstate common carriers.  Charges against carriers for violations
of the Act generally begin as informal complaints. During fiscal
year 1993, the most recent year for which figures have been made
publicly available, the Enforcement Division of the Common Carrier
Bureau received more than 10,000 informal complaints.   There
is no way of knowing how long the Commission takes on average
to dispose of an informal complaint.
<P>
 A complainant may follow up the initial round with a formal complaint.
Formal  complaint proceedings must conform to strict standards
prescribed by the Commission. Judging from reports in the F.C.C.
Record, the Commission has adjudicated some 154 formal carrier
complaints from 1990 to March of 1995.  Nearly 90 percent (134)
involved disputes between two or more carriers.  Most end user
complaints were brought by large entities such as Bank of America
or local utility companies.  Only four of the complaints were
brought by individual customers; of these, three were dismissed
by the Commission.  During the past five years, the Commission
required an average of almost three years to adjudicate a formal
complaint against a carrier.
<P>
<I> </I><B>b.  <I>Cable.</I></B>  The procedures for cable rate
complaints are similar to those used for common carriage.  Complaints
are simply forwarded to the cable operator, which is then expected
to respond.  Broadcasters may also petition for must-carry rights.
 After considering the initial petition and comments, the bureau
may issue a ruling or specify additional procedures such as oral
argument, an evidentiary hearing or further written submissions.
  The 38 complaints of unreasonable rates resolved by the full
Commission since the 1992 Act took effect required an average
of almost fourteen months to resolve.  Must-carry complaints resolved
between 1990 and 1994 took an average of six months.
<P>
<I> </I><B>c. <I>Broadcast</I></B><I>.</I>  Between 1990 and 1995,
the Commission issued more than 4,500 orders and notices concerning
disputes over the regulation, licensing, construction, and spectrum
allocation for radio and television broadcasters.  Most complaints
are filed around the time licenses come up for renewal, when complaints
may help tip the scale against an incumbent and in favor of a
challenger.  During the first five of the six months before its
license is due to expire, a station must post its renewal application
for public view and announce over the air its intention to renew
and the schedule for filing public comments.  The Commission takes
the station's complaint record into account when deciding whether
to renew a license.  There is apparently no &quot;resolution&quot;
of complaints of this sort beyond that.
<P>
 The FCC also processes a large number of complaints concerning
spectrum interference.  Most of these complaints are processed
by regional and local FCC district offices.  Market forces, controlled
by property rights, contracts and privately-enforced limits on
trespassing, could do the job at least equally well.

</PRE>
<HR>

<P>

<P>
 When AT&amp;T sought to acquire McCaw Cellular, for example,
the Department of Justice reviewed the proposed merger.  The Commission
mercifully decided not to invoke its Clayton Act jurisdiction,
but rather to consider antitrust issues in connection with the
application to transfer the radio licenses.  Had it chosen to
conduct the Department's whole antitrust review again, it could
have.  Though it would have been expected to consider the Department's
conclusions, the Commission would not have been bound by them.

<P>
 In addition to enforcing the antitrust laws, the FCC has put
in place a huge labyrinth of structural rules aimed at preventing
antitrust violations before they even occur.  These rules generally
forbid more than is necessary, particularly when markets are changing
fast, and thus suppress more competition than they promote.  For
example, the Commission's rules ban affiliations between newspapers
and broadcasters;<B> </B>prohibit common ownership of two or more
television stations, two or more AM stations, or two or more FM
stations with overlapping service contours; prohibit common ownership
of a television station and an AM or FM radio station in the same
market; ban telephone companies from acquiring Enhanced Specialized
Mobile Radio (ESMR) licenses  in or out of their telephone service
areas; bar cross-ownership of broadcast television and cable systems
in the same market; and preclude local exchange carriers from
providing video programming in their service areas.  
<P>
 The FCC has duplicated most of the mandates of the AT&amp;T divestiture
decree.  The FCC regulates equal access, cross-subsidization and
vertical integration.  The Department of Justice and the consent
decree purport to do so as well.  The decree forbids the Bell
Operating Companies from discriminating in the dissemination of
network information; under the Commission's &quot;All Carrier
Rule,&quot; carriers must make any information necessary for carrier
interconnection available in a timely manner and on a reasonable
basis. 
<P>
 FCC regulation duplicates Department of Justice antitrust enforcement
in other areas, as well.  In 1974, for example, the Department
of Justice filed an antitrust suit that sought to limit the power
of ABC, CBS and NBC to monopolize prime-time entertainment by
combining with their affiliates and controlling all access to
network air time.  All three networks signed consent decrees that
incorporated the FCC's weaker rules on the subject and added stricter
conditions.  Unlike the FCC rules, however, most elements of the
consent agreements were to sunset in 1991.  The remaining provisions
were vacated on November 8, 1993, by which time the networks were
clearly in decline.
<P>
 The 1992 Cable Act and FCC rules implementing it likewise address
relations between cable operators and their video programming
affiliates.  But actions brought separately by the Department
of Justice and a group of state Attorneys General against various
major cablecasters culminated in two 1993 consent decrees addressing
precisely the same issues.  The decrees require the video programming
affiliates of several major cable operators -- including the largest,
TCI -- to provide their programming to other video distributors
(like operators of direct broadcast satellites) on reasonable,
non-discriminatory terms.  Unlike the Commission's regulations,
these decrees address specific circumstances that present serious
anticompetitive concerns; they are targeted at particular defendants
and a specific record of abuse.
<P>
 The Commission duplicates itself internally as well.  It recently
announced, for example, plans to regulate cable television services
provided by phone companies under both Title II and Title VI.
 Thus, non-common-carrier cable television service, ordinarily
licensed under section 541 of Title VI, must <I>in addition</I>
be licensed under the more restrictive provisions of section 214
of Title II.  The two Titles, however, create sharply different
and inconsistent rights and duties.
<P>
 Finally, there is extensive overlap between FCC and state authority.
 Every major line and switch operated by local phone companies
for the joint provision of in-state and interstate services is
allocated roughly three parts to state regulators and one part
to the FCC; the regulation of all matters of depreciation, pricing
and so on are double regulated accordingly.

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>
<h3>An American Opportunity</h3>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>PART TWO: A NEW MODEL FOR COMPETITION, UNIVERSAL SERVICE, AND DEVOLUTION</h2>
</center><blockquote>

<P>
 The 1934 Communications Act required the FCC to &quot;make available,
so far as possible, to all people of the United States, a rapid,
efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication
service.&quot;  This language has been used to justify so-called
universal service policies designed to encourage penetration of
telephone service to as many households as possible.  The means
of  doing so was through massive cross-subsidies administered
through the FCC.  As of this writing, over 96 percent  of American
households have access to a telephone.  While it  is not clear
that these subsidies have any material impact on maintaining this
access rate, they do suppress toll calling and greatly complicate
the introduction of local competition.
<P>
 Competition poses a direct challenge to existing universal service
subsidies designed to keep local residential rates lower than
they otherwise would be.  The local telephone companies and their
state regulators transfer among themselves, out of the public
eye, literally billions and billions of dollars.  Residential
telephone services have been priced below cost since at least
the 1940s.  At present, there are five explicit support funds
administered by the FCC-mandated National Exchange Carriers Association
(&quot;NECA&quot;).  Most of the $1.4 billion disbursed by NECA
yearly goes to support low-cost telephone service to high-cost
rural areas.
<P>
 There are disagreements regarding the magnitude of current implicit
rate support payments.  The current transfer payments are estimated
to be about $20 billion a year.  The going-forward cost of subsidizing
wireline service to high-cost areas is estimated to be less than
$7 billion.  No responsible party seriously challenges the existence
of a substantial subsidy.
<P>
 Below-cost residential service constitutes one of the largest
off-budget entitlements programs.  Generations of economists have
criticized the program.  Its inefficiencies, faulty signals and
fundamental unfairness have been amply documented.   Moreover,
competition makes this subsidy program increasingly unsustainable.
  It is grounded on gross, government-sanctioned price distortions.
 The same product is sold to different customers at inordinately
different prices.   Such discrimination can be sustained only
when customers can be denied access to alternatives.  Competition
and technological advance are exactly that -- alternatives.
<P>
 <I><B>The replacement model: two approaches.</B></I>  <B> </B>While
one need not be convinced of the need to continue to provide subsidized
access to high-cost areas, two alternative approaches are identified
below to maintain (perhaps increase) telephone penetration rates
at less cost and in fairer, more efficient ways.

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>
<h3>An American Opportunity</h3>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>2.1 The Federal Universal Service Plan Approach.</h2>
</center><blockquote>

<P>
 </B></I>Under the Federal Universal Service Plan, every residential
and business telephone customer would pay a universal service
line charge for each access line it purchases.  The plan is similar
in concept to the existing federal charge levied against all long
distance subscribers of 52 cents per subscriber but under this
plan, the customer would make the direct payment.  The U.S. line
charge addresses two goals: (i) keep affordable service in high
cost areas; and (ii) fund policies targeted at the needy.  The
charges would be made explicit to endusers and be explained in
billing.
<P>
 <B>a.  <I>High-cost areas. </I></B> The high-cost subsidy would
be limited to companies serving high-cost areas.  Within 180 days
of enacting legislation, the new Office of  Communications would
determine a &quot;high-cost schedule&quot; which would set out
the cost of serving high-cost areas. The national average cost
of local basic dialtone service now is estimated to be about 
$18.00.  The replacement model envisions using census block data
currently available and the going-forward costs of serving those
lines. 
<P>
 Under the federal U.S. plan, the total high-cost subsidy would
initially be the product of the number of high-cost lines times
each line's respective &quot;line subsidy.&quot;  The line subsidy
is the cost of serving that line as indicated in the high-cost
schedule minus the $18.00 national average cost of service.  Each
year the high-cost subsidy is recovered by a monthly universal
service subscriber line charge levied equally on all residential
and business access lines.  
<P>
 Companies serving high-cost areas, the so-called carriers of
last resort, receive a subsidy payment for each high-cost line
equal to its line subsidy, that is, the cost of serving that line
as indicated on the high-cost schedule minus $18.00.  Over a fifteen
year period, the line subsidy payments would be reduced by one
dollar a year.  The total high-cost subsidy amount and the universal
service subscriber line charge would be reduced accordingly. 

<P>
 After three years, all carrier of last resort payments would
be put up for competitive bid.  The individual states would define
the relevant carrier of last resort areas within which bidding
would take place, but the areas should be defined as narrowly
as possible to preclude distortion to competition.  The high-cost
line subsidy and the carrier of last resort payment would be reduced
to reflect the competitive bidding process.
<P>
 Alternatively, the subsidies could be paid directly to subscribers
in high-cost areas.  In that case, the phase down of the subsidy
should be increased to replace the cost reducing effect of  the
auction process.  In either case, the plan would reduce interstate
long-distance prices substantially and generate billions in consumer
welfare and promote the development of new technology.  
<P>
 <B>b. <I>Targeted aid to the needy. </I></B> The second component
of the Federal Universal Service Plan is to target aid to low-income
users to assure that telephone service remains affordable for
all.  The OC will advise Congress within 180 days after enactment
on how best to perform this function. Possibilities include funding
means tested waivers for installation charges, deposits and the
federal universal service subscriber line charge.  Each year the
low-income subsidy would be recovered as an explicit component
of the monthly universal service subscriber charge.  As the high-cost
fund is ramped down, only a small portion of the savings would
be needed to fund this second component of the federal subscriber
line charge.
<P>
 By targeting assistance to low income households, the Federal
Universal Service Plan would be more fair and less expensive.
 It would also be more effective in raising telephone penetration
rates among the poor, because installation charges and deposits
are widely believed to represent larger obstacles to telephone
subscribership than does the monthly cost of telephone access.
<P>
 It should also be noted that the lower long-distance rates under
the Federal Universal Service Plan would be beneficial to many
rural households.  Rural callers make more long distance calls
on average than do urban customers.   Also, one study found that
low-income (life-line) customers in one state paid more than 60
percent of their monthly bill for long-distance services.
<P>
 The administration of the universal service subscriber line is
envisioned as being administered by a private organization such
as the National Exchange Carriers Association.  All other existing
subsidy programs either would be funded by the Federal Universal
Service Plan or  eliminated.  All local exchange carriers would
provide itemized billing of the universal service subscriber line
charges with brief accompanying explanations. 
<P>
<B> c.  <I>Devolution of the Remaining Subsidies Back to the States.
</I></B> Within 180 days after enactment, the OC will determine
best how to return those interstate costs not covered by the plan
 to the individual states.  States will have broad flexibility
to recover these costs as they deem fit, subject to general federal
guidelines.  The essential federal guideline in this regard is
the &quot;most favored nation&quot; approach, which would prohibit
State regulators from discriminating against interstate users
when pricing access to local exchange facilities.  A strict MFN
approach is designed to promote interstate commerce.   Moreover,
the Replacement Model assumes elimination of all legal barriers
to entry in local telephony markets and pre-emption of all state
public utility regulation of  wireless carriers.  Additionally,
the OC could be required to calculate an appropriate national
access cap below which all states would have to price interstate
access.  This one time cap would be set to reflect that portion
of interstate costs that are recovered by the universal service
subscriber line charge. 
<P>
 States will nevertheless retain the flexibility to adopt additional
universal service policies.  Nothing here will limit the ability
of the states to formulate universal service policies beyond those
expressly provided for in the federal universal service subscriber
line charge.  For example, the states may maintain residential
rates at or below the national average or expand the definition
of services covered under universal service.

<h2>2.2  The Replacement Model's Option Two: Full Devolution</h2>
</center><blockquote>

<P>

This alternative model also emphasizes transition, not maintenance,
and explicit, not implicit subsidies.  In contrast to the Federal
Universal Service Plan, however, it transfers the full responsibility
for universal service back to the states. 
<P>
 <B>a. <I>Transition, not maintenance.</I></B> Due regard for
transitional inequities is appropriate. Where changes are contemplated
in regulation for the purpose of benefiting society as a whole,
the full cost of such change should not be visited on one single
group.  Due regard for transitional inequities should not be converted
into creating long-term maintenance programs.  
<P>
 In 1977, Senator Ernest Hollings, then-Chairman of the Senate
Communications Subcommittee, proposed a program which would have
essentially frozen both the total amount of subsidy dollars and
those eligible to receive them.  Support payments would have been
made in aid of ensuring a single party, Touch-tone service with
access to 911 emergency services, but not the full range of options
available. Such services could be purchased, of course, but not
at subsidized prices.
<P>
 A comparable approach today would entail freezing the size of
the five NECA-administered support funds (an initiative that the
FCC has, in part, already undertaken).  Alternatively, a freeze
coupled with an automatic reduction over the next decade -- say,
10 percent a year -- could be put in place.  Again, the objective
would be to safeguard legitimate transactional inequities while
at the same time encouraging efficiencies and to take into account
the lower cost options and technologies.   
<P>
 <B>b. <I>Implicit to Explicit.  </I></B>Most support payments
are buried in telephone company FCC and state-filed tariffs, with
the result that the magnitude and direction of subsidies is at
best disputable, and there is scant accountability.  Congress,
under this full devolution plan, would direct the OC promptly
to discern and make public the magnitude and direction of telephone
industry price support programs.  In effect, a &quot;subsidy budget&quot;
would be established, much as a &quot;burden hours budget&quot;
is required in conjunction with Federal paperwork reduction measures.
 To quote Justice Brandeis, &quot;Sunshine is the best disinfectant.&quot;
 
<P>
 <B>c.  <I>Devolution. </I></B> Then, the full responsibility
to devise and administer residential telephone price support programs
for today's implicit subsidies should be transferred from Washington
to the states.  States would  have the responsibility to regulate
the price charged for access to and from that state.  Several
mechanisms exist for generating funds necessary to meet a pre-determined
State &quot;universal service&quot; budget.  Assume, for example,
Tennessee were to determine that, next year, $250 million is needed
to cover its local exchange carrier's costs and maintain the status
quo -- $200 million to subsidize residential rates and $50 million
to provide nearly free &quot;lifeline&quot; services to the truly
needy.  Tennessee would have the flexibility to determine the
charges levied by local phone companies in conjunction with the
origin and termination of intra- as well as interstate calls.
  State authorities might choose to raise access charges in order
to meet a clearly defined societal purpose.  Alternatively, those
authorities might choose sharply to reduce access charges to make
the state more competitive with peers for attracting and retaining
investment and jobs.  
<P>
 This approach would give states new responsibilities subject
to a federal interest in promoting interstate commerce.  The states
would still be required to meet MFN non-discrimination requirements
noted above.  Elements of this approach exist in certain FCC-administered
programs today.   The outlines of  state-sanctioned &quot;lifeline&quot;
programs are nominally subject to local option and legislative
endorsement.  State authorities traditionally have been left with
the option of defining what constitutes &quot;universal service.&quot;
  Instead of being bit-players in a system largely administered
through Washington, here states would have the primary responsibility.
<P>
 This approach would also give states broader latitude for experimentation,
subject to the limitations imposed by their competing for commerce
and industry.  The communications component of business enterprise
has nearly doubled over the past 10 years.  States know this and
are aware of the impact on their competitiveness should they hike
phone charges significantly.  The top 10 largest states in the
country today account for more than two-thirds of the total &quot;telephone
economy&quot; and for the preponderance of long distance calling.
 
<P>
 States also could be required to meet the MFN non-discrimination
requirement noted above.  This would give states new responsibilities
and opportunities to experiment and control their destiny subject
to a federal interest in promoting interstate commerce.

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>
<h3>An American Opportunity</h3>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>PART THREE:
VOLUNTARY RE-ALLOCATION OF RADIO</h2>
</center><blockquote>

<P>
 The Replacement Model implements a pro-competition, anti-monopoly
regime which will not protect incumbent companies by placing the
onus on new entrants to the market to justify themselves.   New
wireless service providers will have a presumptive right to compete.
 The Replacement Model envisions that government's role will be
dedicated to providing an orderly entry-way for the robust forces
of competitive rivalry, as well as safeguards to ensure the continued
vitality of market competition.
<P>
<B>1.</B> <I><B>Spectrum defined.  </B></I>The radio spectrum
-- generally defined as the range of electromagnetic frequencies
between three kilohertz and 300 gigahertz -- is  one of the Nation's
most valuable economic resources.  Television and radio broadcasting,
cellular telephone communications, paging and messaging, satellite
services, point-to-point microwave and taxi dispatching -- all
use spectrum.
<P>
 The use of spectrum as a resource is largely determined through
administrative allocation and licensing procedures first developed
in the 1920s.  Under this system, the federal government determines
the general uses for the radio spectrum, allocates bands of frequencies
to each of those uses, and then assigns licenses to specific users.
 This system involves a large degree of central planning by federal
regulators.   The FCC today determines which services are to be
provided, the frequencies on which they will be provided, the
conditions under which they will be provided, and the technology
to be used. 
<P>
<B>2. </B><I> <B>The Replacement Alternative: A  Property Rights
Approach to Spectrum.  </B></I> As far back as 1959, Nobel-laureate
economist Ronald Coase proposed that property rights be accorded
to radio licenses, that license owners pay for the right to use
spectrum, and that bidding for that right was the most efficient
way to allocate spectrum.  Privatizing spectrum would eliminate
the years current applicants must wait to provide new services,
permit market forces to move spectrum to its highest valued use,
and greatly reduce spectrum scarcity, unleashing a raft of new
wireless technologies.
<P>
 In 1991, NTIA studied the idea, reviewed the considerable literature
and past proposals on the subject, and concluded that a &quot;market-based
system for spectrum management would improve considerably the
efficiency and fairness of the current U.S. system, and, if properly
designed and implemented, can fully address concerns about such
issues as competitive equity, spectrum 'warehousing,' and the
preservation of socially-desirable services.&quot;  As part of
its recommendation, NTIA supported private transfers and subleasing
of spectrum rights directly from one user to another.
<P>
 All of this is administratively feasible.  Spectrum is already
bought and sold, although only in the secondary market.  New Zealand
has already liberalized significant bands of  spectrum already.
 In 1927, Congress -- persuaded by incumbent broadcasters -- to
establish a &quot;public interest&quot; licensing scheme.  That
system served the interests of incumbents well, short-circuiting
competitive forces from almost the very beginning.  America can
now correct this mistake.
<P>
 The Replacement Model presumes that new companies, new services
and new ideas have a presumptive right to access spectrum with
non-interfering use.  New entrants are encouraged to invade existing
markets and compete.  New and existing users have the right to
compete freely without &quot;public interest&quot; restrictions,
thereby lowering prices, increasing consumer choices, and expanding
services.  <HR>

</PRE>
<HR>

<P>
<B></B> As this chart indicates, the U.S. government is the prime
holder of spectrum in the 30,000 megaHertz  to 300 gigaHertz range.
 Spectrum is used for a wide variety of critical law enforcement,
national defense, and other important needs.  Nevertheless, large
portions of the spectrum go unutilized or vastly under utilized,
and many of the wasted bands are under the control of the federal
government.  The Replacement Model, as discussed below, encourages
through incentives the government to privatize this spectrum.
 In addition, Congress may well wish more direct and explicit
 means of ensuring this resource is used more efficiently, as
it has in the past -- as when it recently re-assigned 220 Mhz.
in the emerging technologies band from the federal government
to the private sector.  
<P>
 Auctions are an efficient way to assign rights.  The objective
is not to generate funds for the U.S. government.  Indeed, the
objective of the auction approach stressed below is to reduce
scarcity values which are currently associated with spectrum licensing
and use.  Nonetheless, it is currently estimated by all, including
the FCC itself, that auctions will generate billions in direct
proceeds over five years.  This sum, while substantial, will pale
compared to the economic growth, new jobs, new companies, new
products and consumer saving that will accompany the more efficient,
market-oriented use of spectrum.
<P>
<B>3. </B> <I><B>The current standard is hostile to consumers.
 </B></I>The centerpiece of the 1934 Act is a &quot;Public Interest
Standard&quot; which came into being first with the 1927 Radio
Act.  The Public Interest Standard was requested by David Sarnoff
and incumbent radio broadcasters so government would have a legal
basis to deny licenses to newcomers.  Senator C.C. Dill, the author
of the both the 1927 Radio Act and the 1934 Act, liked the standard
because it permitted policymakers (such as himself) political
discretion to shape the marketplace.  Dill subsequently wrote
that political control was important because common law was rapidly
shaping spectrum access rights as private property.  The public
interest standard, in practice, allows regulators to stop decentralized
development and to engage in both industrial policy and political
handicapping.
<P>
<B>4.</B> <I><B>&quot;Public interest&quot; cannot be defined.
 </B></I>Today there is still no effective definition of the &quot;public
interest&quot; standard.  In 1993, Commissioner Duggan attacked
critics of the FCC and the public interest standard -- claiming
the FCC indeed, could define it.  That this debate was still occurring
almost sixty years after the concept was promulgated makes the
point cogently.  In effect, the public interest standard is exactly
whatever three of the five FCC members say it is. Nothing is ruled
out.
<P>
<B>5.</B>   <I><B>The Replacement Plan</B></I><B>. <I> </I></B>The
Replacement Model sequences reforms to give markets and competitors
time to make rational decisions based upon market information.
 Phase One can be completed soon after enactment.  All current
license-holders of spectrum are granted a complete fee simple
in their spectrum -- the title to use, sell, lease or transfer
as they deem fit, subject only to interference and antitrust concerns.
 A one time registration fee can be assessed to help fund the
replacement model's title registry service of the spectrum.
<P>
 Phase Two contemplates expediting all exclusive applications
pending before the FCC for spectrum licenses as of May 1, 1995
(as a representative date).  These applications, upon completion
of geographic, power and location contour analysis, will be promptly
converted to property rights of the applicant to the spectrum.
 Competing applications will be subject to auction.
<P>
 Phase Three would open up all unallocated (non-government) spectrum
for application.  This process would facilitate entry by surveying
available spectrum bands (all those where entry is currently feasible)
and establish standardized parcels for new entrants to claim.
 Such a survey function is designed solely to promote consumer
welfare by encouraging competition and is not to block off spectrum
&quot;for reserves.&quot;  For spectrum frequencies in which there
are more than one claim asserted, the model mandates that the
government auction the new bands within 180 days.  As much as
efficient, the new Office of Communications should permit market
forces, subject to antitrust review, to determine the geographic
and interference boundaries of the initial property assignments.
 The FCC's current experience in creating  &quot;overlay rights&quot;
for PCS licensees should be a valuable guide in this process.
<P>
 The premise is that spectrum use will be dictated by the American
people, not the government.  The model allows for &quot;spectrum
contours,&quot; &quot;overlay rights&quot; and &quot;band management
rights&quot; to be defined quickly by the government and made
available to investors willing to risk capital in developing new
wireless services.  Auctions will be mandatory when more than
one entity registers for use of spectrum under a defined and short
timeframe.  The process encourages competition amongst potential
users to establish new wireless services, triggering a discovery
process which will usher in dynamic application of cutting-edge
technology.  These auctions will sell property, not licenses.
 Those who bid and win title are free to develop and/or re-sell
the spectrum as with any other private property right subject
to antitrust review and geographic and  interference boundaries.

<P>
 Under Phase Four, unallocated spectrum held in reserve by the
government would be opened for use by the private sector as applicants
see fit.  Spectrum bands currently reserved for government use
would be made available for private users through direction the
of  Congress.  The federal government owns the vast majority of
 &quot;clean&quot; spectrum -- spectrum which is not in use. 
Phase Four envisions that those government agencies with a claim
to spectrum will disgorge their unused spectrum within a determined
timeframe.  New companies and new services are encouraged to establish
new wireless services -- triggering a process of discovery as
new technologies are tried and used.  
<P>
 When more than one private party registers for use of the same
parcel of spectrum, an auction will be held.  Current entities
such as the Department of Defense and NASA will be permitted to
retain a portion of the proceeds from spectrum roll-out for modernizing,
re-location expenses and operational uses.  Although it can be
expected that certain departments will resort to &quot;national
security&quot; arguments to not only maintain but possibly expand
their claim to spectrum use, Congress is encouraged to view such
assertions skeptically.  Much of government's use of spectrum
is inefficient, with competing elements within a single bureaucracy
refusing to share spectrum for narrow, internal rivalries or other
reasons.  Any claim to &quot;national security&quot; should be
justified with full inquiry by Congress into the validity of the
claim and whether more efficient means can be found to accomplish
the asserted mission.
<P>
 Auctions will be held within a specified deadline time of 180
days.  This approach would account for transaction costs to the
extent they are a significant obstacle to the aggregation of spectrum
where that might be efficient.  
<P>
<B>6.</B> <I><B>The property rights model is supported by courts
and common law.  </B></I>The model encourages both new competitors
and existing licensees to push the process forward from below.
 This reform is not a descendant from the edict of a civil servant
from above.  Not even interference rights should be set forth
in detail in new legislation.  The model instead broadly defines
what new competitors are entitled to do, and offers spectrum users
the opportunity to fulfill their market-driven aspirations.  The
government remains involved to protect the marketplace <I>via
</I>antitrust and property law.
<P>
 <I><B>Conclusion.</B></I>  The Replacement Model is predicated
upon a fundamental re-appraisal of the rationale and validity
of the current &quot;public interest&quot; approach to spectrum
management.  The model is premised on a new standard to gain economic
benefits from the efficiency of a competitive market: &quot;consumer
welfare.&quot;  Government action will be explicitly designed
to promote the economic choices for the American consumer,  with
lower prices, improved selection, and better, more innovative
services.
<P>
 The legal content for this standard draws from the spirit of
competition embedded in over 120 years of  antitrust law.  More
importantly, it is a clean break with the industrial policy of
the central planners,  representing a series of almost unbroken
failures over the past seven decades.

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>
<h3>An American Opportunity</h3>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>PART FOUR: THE REPLACEMENT MODEL</h2>
</center><blockquote>

<P>
<I><B> A clean sheet approach. </B></I> The Replacement Model
adopts a  clean sheet approach to the government's role in the
knowledge age.  The model addresses the  four critical functions
that should be performed regardless of  era or technology.  First,
government should establish, protect and enforce a system of 
property rights, tangible and intangible.  The central task of
government is to protect individual rights  and formulate the
laws by which the rights are adjudicated.  Government should also
define the application of individual rights to a particular sphere
of activity.  Clarity is essential.  Ambiguous property rights
are an invitation to litigation, diverting energy and creativity
into lawsuits that serve no customers nor generate no new wealth.
 
<P>
  Second,  the government should promote market efficiency and
competition by policing market break down.  Since the 1934 Act,
technological progress is turning the telecommunications marketplace
from one characterized as &quot;economies of scale&quot; and &quot;natural
monopolies&quot; into a competitive market.  While government
can assist industry when possible through cooperative efforts
to promote standards and technical guidelines, in general, competition
has made whole areas of FCC central planning, such as broadcast,
cable and long distance regulation unnecessary and costly.  These
regulations should be eliminated immediately.  
<P>
 Third, where government supervision is called for it will frequently
be best done through antitrust enforcement.  Antitrust law is
designed to prevent acts and practices that can lead to the creation
of new monopolies, or harm consumers by forcing up prices, limiting
access to competing products or reducing service quality.  For
more than 120 years, America has relied upon antitrust law to
foster competition and ensure that all compete fairly and by the
same rules.  Telecommunications is such a market --  telephone,
cable, satellite, wireless -- all are seeking to compete.  The
implication is that the price-and-entry regulation of the 1934
Act should therefore be replaced by antitrust law as quickly as
possible.
<P>
 Fourth, many of the remaining necessary governmental functions
in telecommunications should be transferred to the states with
appropriate federal guidelines, as well as to other federal agencies
with expertise.  For example, most regulation of local exchange
facilities could be returned to the states which already regulate
75 percent of these costs.  Where appropriate, federal interests
regarding local telephony could be transferred to the proposed
new Office of Communications in an existing agency in the Executive
Branch.
<P>
<B>B.  A Functional Re-Assignment of  FCC Responsibilities Under
The 1934 Act. </B>
<P>
     The following is a suggested roadmap for analyzing the salient
 provisions in Title 47  by function in accordance with a modern
approach to telecommunications.  In general, the analysis  corresponds
to the five operational bureaus of the Commission:  common carriage,
mass media, wireless, cable and international/satellite (a functional
organization not coincidentally mirroring the limits and functions
of analog technology).  
<P>
      Many statutory provisions and FCC rules and regulations
can be eliminated immediately upon enactment of  the  replacement
law. Some provisions can be phased out over time. Others, however,
need to be retained and their enforcement transferred elsewhere.
 Unless indicated otherwise, all FCC statutory authority and FCC
rules and regulations will be sunsetted within three years of
the FCC replacement law.

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>
<h3>An American Opportunity</h3>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>4.1a  The New Office Of Communications</h2>
</center><blockquote>

<P>
 The edifice government created sixty years ago drastically needs
an update and facelift to match the realities of contemporary
technologies. The replacement for the FCC is the Office of Communications
(&quot;OC&quot;).  The OC will oversee a telecommunications industry
based on the proposition that a digital transmission can not be
characterized by differentiating regulations based on function.
 A digital transmission of 1s and 0s can be transmitted by and
received through any variety of means -- twisted pair, cable,
wireless, video dialtone or satellite.
<P>
 The OC will consist of far fewer than the approximately 2,200
current federal bureaucrats.  It will reside largely in an Executive
Branch agency.  Placing the OC within a consolidated niche within
the Executive Branch should have <B>no </B>impact whatsoever on
the integrity or independence of decision-making.  At present,
the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission are both parts of Executive departments.
 There has not been any indication that these arrangements impaired
independence or generated undue political influence.  
<P>
 The OC would assume the following functions:  oversee for a transition
period the remaining federal responsibilities to regulate interstate
access to local exchange facilities, coordinate the privatization
of the spectrum, and prepare for Congress a phase out plan for
all FCC rules and regulations which will be sunsetted in three
years (except as noted below).
<P>
 First, the OC will: (a) monitor interconnection requirements
under Section 201 of the 1934 Act consistent with the federal
guidelines against discriminatory pricing, with enforcement under
the jurisdiction of the Justice Department; (b) monitor compliance
with hearing-impaired and speech-impaired requirements under Section
225 of the 1934 Act with enforcement under the Department of Justice
civil division; (c) monitor uses of telephone communication for
harassing calls or prohibited commercial purposes; and (d) implement
the universal service plan and federal responsibilities to monitor
and facilitate the development of local competition created by
legislation terminating the MFJ. 
<P>
 Second, the OC will also coordinate the transfer and privatization
of spectrum.  It will consist of the frequency coordinator role
of the current FCC and the NTIA, which currently chairs the &quot;Interdepartmental
Radio Advisory Committee,&quot; established in 1922 by then-Commerce
Secretary Herbert Hoover. The OC will establish and run the Spectrum
Registry File (&quot;SRF&quot;).  The SRF will be the resource
to keep track of centralized registration of spectrum.  
<P>
 Under the plan to privatize spectrum, all current licensees of
spectrum will be granted title in the spectrum.  A deed to the
spectrum will be filed with the SRF.  All new spectrum to be auctioned
will be registered with the SRF as well.  
<P>
 Currently,  all engineering, screening and approval of applications
of  &quot;private radio&quot; -- commercial mobile radio service
-- is handled by &quot;frequency coordinators.&quot;  These are
private entities such as the National Association of Business
and Educational Radio (&quot;NABER&quot;), the Associated Public
Safety Communications Officers (&quot;APCO&quot;), etc.  These
user groups perform most of the functions that the government
staffs at one time undertook.  The frequency coordination process
has worked well, and paid important dividends in terms of speed,
flexibility and reduced tax payer costs.   
<P>
 The OC will harness this system and work with the private sector
and industry associations to perform for broadcast and other forms
of spectrum use what NABER and APCO do currently for private radio.
 An important result would be to speed up title issues with respect
to spectrum.  The OC, as the FCC does today, will retain ultimate
authority.  But a large volume of the engineering &quot;sweat
work&quot; will be delegated. 
<P>
 The OC will prepare within one year a phase out plan for all
FCC rules and regulations which will be sunsetted except in the
event that Congress affirmatively acts to preserve the regulation
in the interest of competition.  The OC will also make recommendations
for the efficient phasing-out of other FCC regulations should
the three-year sunset create transitional problems.  A critical
component of the OC's work will be to document instances where
safety or substantial market failure would make continuation of
any sunsetted regulation beneficial to consumers.   Unless Congress
acts before the sunset date, all designated FCC rules and regulations
will be rescinded on that date. 
<P>
<B> </B>The OC will reverse the massive grant of power given to
the FCC under Title II of the 1934 Act.  Previously, pursuant
to the 1934 Act, the FCC controlled rates for common carriers,
investigated existing ones and  determined new ones.  The FCC
controlled which companies compete, where and under what corporate
structures. The OC will supervise the transition back to the market.
 It will develop and implement the universal service plan on a
transitional basis with a finite sunset provision for non-needs-based
subsidies.  The OC will also supervise on a temporary basis the
availability of interstate access on a non-discriminatory basis
to local exchange facilities.
<P>
<B> </B>The OC will also roll back government impositions under
Title III of the Act.  All existing broadcast stations are presumed
to face effective competition.  The OC model returns cable TV
to the 1984 Cable Act.
<P>
 The OC model makes a break with the Cable Act of 1984, however,
by repealing the grant to the FCC to regulate cross-ownership
of cable and exclude telephone companies from cable programming.
 The FCC authorized state and local authorities to regulate cable
rates as well as set technical standards.  Federal law pre-empted
local attempts to require cable systems to operate as common carriers
or utilities.  The legislation, however, expressly barred new
FCC regulation of content on cable programming.  The new standard
for effective competition will be the original 3 over-the-air
signal standard promulgated by the FCC.  Local cable regulation
is pre-empted.
<P>
 The goal, as indicated at the outset of the Report, is to fashion
a new, modern governmental approach to telecommunications supportive
of and in harmony with the realities of the technological changes
over the past 60 years.  Government has a role to play in the
information age.  But that new, modern role has no basis in the
1930s and the values and technological limits of that era.

<p><b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</b><br>

                                  January-February 1996, Number 75</I>

</center><p>

	The first act of an incoming president is to "solemnly swear (or affirm)" that he will "preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States."  In judging prospective candidates for the presidency, it is therefore important to examine whether they interpret the Constitution properly. To help voters with this determination, <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i> asked the following question of the principal presidential candidates still running as of November 1995: "Which parts of the Constitution are commonly misinterpreted or underappreciated, and therefore deserve more emphasis in political discourse?" We publish responses from Senators Bob Dole, Phil Gramm, and Dick Lugar; Governor Lamar Alexander, and Representative Robert Dornan. (President Bill Clinton, Patrick Buchanan, Steve Forbes, and Alan Keyes were invited to participate but did not respond by our deadline.) 
<p><hr><p>


<a name="dole"></a><b>Senator Bob Dole</b><br>
<i>The Establishment Clause</i><br>
<a href="http://www.dole96.com">Dole for President Home Page</a><p>
	Perhaps no provision of the Constitution is more misunderstood today than the First Amendment as it applies to religion.
<p>

	The most basic misunderstanding is that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment demands that any reference to religion must be absolutely cleansed from our schools and other public institutions. A second misunderstanding is that anyone who wants our public institutions to show more respect for the religious faith of the American people is really plotting to impose a particular religious viewpoint on those with different beliefs.

<p>	A good part of the blame for this confusion lies with the Supreme Court of the United States. Years ago, the Court cast aside the original meaning of the First Amendment's Establishment Clause, which forbids the establishment of an official state religion or policies favoring one religion over another. In its place, the Court has erected a variety of confusing formulas -- the Lemon test, the endorsement test, and others -- that invoke the Constitution to support the proposition that religion must be purged from public life. Using such tests, the Supreme Court has banned the display of the Ten Commandments in any public school, even for educational purposes.


<p>
	Unfortunately, misguided school administrators and teachers in some areas of the country have also wrongly embraced the idea that all references to religion in school settings are unconstitutional. Among the results of this misreading of the First Amendment:

<p><ul>

<li>Teachers have been disciplined for wearing a cross as personal jewelry and for reading their own Bible during break periods.<p>

<li>Two Texas third-graders were prohibited from wearing T-shirts depicting Jesus -- though Power Rangers and Barney were just fine.

<p>


<li>Many communities have banned holiday crche displays from public buildings and parks, even where 
they have been set up by private civic groups.


<p>

<li>Some schools have banned religious songs at choir concerts, as well as Christmas carols, and even Christmas trees.
<P>

<li>Students have been told they may not talk about God to classmates, and teachers have rejected religious artwork and reports on "my hero" where the students took the politically incorrect decision to write about Jesus.
</ul><p>


	In fact, studies by the National Institute of Education, People for the American Way, and Americans United for the Separation of Church and State have all confirmed that references to religion's role in American life and history have been systematically stripped from textbooks and curricula.
<p>

	A fair reading of the historical record, however, shows that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment was designed to protect religious liberty, not strip religious expression from all public institutions. As Professor Stephen Carter writes: "[T]he metaphorical separation of church and state originated in an effort to protect religion from the state, not the state from religion. The religion clauses of the First Amendment were crafted to permit maximum freedom to the religious."

<p>	After all, it was the first Congress -- which passed the Bill of Rights and sent it for ratification to the states -- that opened each day's session with a prayer led by a chaplain. This practice continues today. And 24 hours after it voted in favor of what is now the First Amendment, the Congress considered a resolution proclaiming a national day of thanksgiving. Indeed, if the Supreme Court itself really adhered to the view that the government must divorce itself from religion, then it would not open every one of its sessions with the appeal, "God save the United States and this Honorable Court."

<p>	There are some hopeful signs that the confusion surrounding the First Amendment's Establishment Clause is now beginning to clear up. Earlier this year, in a close, 5-to-4 decision, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that a public university can deny funding to a Christian student newspaper while financing student publications generally. It now appears that there are at least five justices who believe that religious expression is entitled to the same constitutional protection as other forms of expression.

<p>	To say that our public institutions should accommodate religious speech is not to say that the state should impose official prayers and punish students who do not participate. That's certainly not my position. Nor is it the position of Jay Sekulow, Pat Robertson's counsel at the American Center for Law and Justice, who has said, "We don't want to see a return to the pre-1962 situation, with a teacher leading a class i
n prayer."

<p>	At the same time, we simply do not accept the view that the Constitution commands that religion be erased from whatever government touches. This view misreads the First Amendment and distorts history.
<p>

<a name="gramm"></a><b>Senator Phil Gramm</b><br>
<i>The Takings Clause</i><br>
<a href="http://www.gramm96.org">Phil Gramm for President Home Page</a>

<p>
	When considering the most "underappreciated" element of the Constitution, anyone who sees what is going on everyday across this country as I do will respond immediately, "the Fifth Amendment." Well known for its protection against self-incrimination, the Fifth Amendment also contains a clause that protects private property, a building block of the American foundation. The Takings Clause is a quintessential constitutional shield, artfully and specifically rejecting the idea that government officials can seize property without compensation, regardless of what public good they intend to accomplish.

<p>	Unfortunately, we are facing a threat to the right to own property that our Founding Fathers could never have imagined. In America in 1995, two consenting adults can engage in any kind of consensual behavior with total constitutional protection -- except owning private property  and engaging in commerce and business. Over and over again -- every day all across America -- people are having their private property taken without compensation -- by way of the Endangered Species Act, wetlands regulation, and a host of other "regulatory takings." Property values are being reduced and land is effectively being taken to promote objectives that society considers good, but for which society refuses to pay. In fact, we have a president today whose interior secretary has suggested that private property may even be outdated in the modern world!

<p>

	If government takes your property or restricts its use, you should be compensated. On this issue there can be no compromise. Private property is the foundation of our freedom, and I will defend it as vigorously as the freedom of speech and freedom of religion. As president, I will work hard to protect private-property rights and to bring the Fifth Amendment back into the family of the Bill of Rights on behalf of the people who own property, till the soil, and produce the goods and services in our country.

<p>	The most pressing constitutional issue facing our nation, however, involves a matter not actually enshrined in that great document. I am referring to the need for a Balanced Budget Amendment. I introduced a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution on my first day in Congress and have worked hard to pass it ever since. But, as surprising as it may be to some of my colleagues, this debate did not begin with my tenure in Congress.

<p>	Through the course of American history, we have amended our Constitution 27 times, but haven't yet had the political will to fix the only thing Thomas Jefferson found wrong with the document. Jefferson was this country's Minister to France during the writing of the Constitution, and when he was first shown the document, he had a proposal for one change. In a subsequent letter to John Taylor, Jefferson recorded that proposal:

<p>	"I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our Constitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for the reduction of the administration of our government to the genuine principles of its Constitution. I mean an additional article taking from the government the power of borrowing."

<p>	So the present controversy is not just a debate over a balanced budget amendment, but a debate on the Jefferson amendment. It is also a debate about the future of America and a potential seed of its destruction. We need a contract between the government and the people that binds Congress with a chain that cannot be broken. The genius of the Const
itution is that it rules out of bounds actions that the people have determined that they do not want Congress to take. Read the first words from the Bill of Rights in our Constitution: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for redress of grievances."

<p>	The American people were clear about the grievances they wanted redressed in November 1994. In the most decisive election since 1932, the people said to their government, "Stop the taxing. Stop the spending. Stop the regulating." To do that, they supported the Contract With America, a key element of which is a balanced budget amendment. But we haven't given the people what they want yet. We have not fulfilled a promise we made.

<p>	The Constitution was written because people did not trust the government. With Congress's failure to honor its promises, act responsibly, and be accountable for its actions, there is much for the people not to trust. 
<p>

<a name="lugar"></a><b>Senator Dick Lugar</b><br>
<i>Enumerated Powers</i>
<br>
<a href="http://www.iquest.net/lugar/lugar.html">Lugar for President Home Page</a>
<p>
	Virtually every clause in the Constitution has been used -- even tortured -- to justify a variety of causes. What deserves more emphasis in political discourse, however, is the spirit of what the Constitution set out to do generally: to assign to the federal government specific tasks and the powers to carry them out, and to reserve all else to the states or the people. This intent is most clearly articulated in the Ninth and Tenth Amendments of the Constitution.


<p>
	The aim of the Constitution's Framers was clear enough: to create a strong, but limited, national government. Having first decided to omit a list of specific limits (or "negatives," as the Framers called them) on the national government's authority, the Framers then agreed in principle to accept them as the first amendments to the new Constitution. The first eight amendments impose specific limits on the power of government, both at the national and state levels. All serve the same end: restricting the scope and power of government. Lest there be any ambiguity, the Ninth Amendment makes clear the presumption that rights belong to the people: "The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people." And the Tenth Amendment makes clear the boundaries that this places on the national government: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."

<p>	In a way, it might be said that these provisions were not so much "amendments" to the Constitution -- in the sense of replacing existing provisions or adding new features -- as clarifications of the Constitution's underlying intent. The Framers were no libertarians; they set out to create a strong national government with powers sufficiently robust to accomplish its functions. This is especially true in the realm of national security, where powers are largely reserved to the national government. That which the federal government should do, the Framers believed, it should do well.

<p>
	But that which the federal government should not do and cannot do well, it should not do at all. The modern departure from this philosophy is largely responsible for the lack of confidence that Americans now express about their government. As the national government has expanded its reach into virtually every sphere of Americans' lives, it should not be surprising that the volatility of voter preferences and discontent with government have increased. The passions of individuals and groups are inflamed on all sides of issues that are not properly within the sphere of the federal government.

<p>	Take the recent debate over funding formulas and federal "strings" on welfare block grants. It is well and good that states and localities should administer their own social welfare programs. They are closer to the people and, on the whole, they will do a better job than the federal government. This is surely consistent with the intent of the Framers.

<p>	But why should the federal government be the tax collector for the states' programs? Why, for example, should citizens of Iowa or New Hampshire or any other state send their money to Washington, only to have it returned -- after bitter fights over allocation formulas and conditionsto run their own programs? Wouldn't it make more sense for states to raise the funds to pay for the programs they establish?


<p>
	In this regard, I have proposed to eliminate the federal income tax (and the 16th Amendment, which makes it possible) and replace it with a national sales tax collected by the states. National and state sales taxes can coexist perfectly well and, after a brief time, are likely to come into conformity with one another. Once this occurs, the federal government could reduce its sales tax, and allow the states to raise the funds for their own programs. Gone would be monetary transfers to Washington; gone would be formula fights; and gone would be federal strings. And limited federal government would be here to stay.

<p>	The Ninth and Tenth Amendments to the Constitution offer much needed guidance. If we were to ask whether each new proposed program, as well as many existing programs, represent legitimate tasks of the federal government, our answer would often be "no," and we could start to fashion a more efficient federal government. We would also discover that properly limiting federal government would raise its public standing commensurately.

<p>	In speaking of the amendment process, James Madison says in The Federalist No.49, "As every appeal to the people would carry an implication of some defect in the government, frequent appeals would, in great measure, deprive the government of that veneration which time bestows on everything." A society that appeals to its national government to attend to all things -- including those for which it is not suited -- will find that that same government loses the veneration of the people in political discourse. That cannot be the goal of true friends of limited government.
<p>

<a name="lamar"></a><b>Lamar Alexander</b><br>
<i>Presidential Powers</i><br>
<a href="http://www.Nashville.Net/~lamar">Alexander for President Home Page</a><p>

	One section of our Constitution distinguishes the United States from virtually all other countries: Article II, the description of the role and powers of the president. The president is the only figure in our government whose oath of office is actually written in the Constitution. He is the only person who is elected by and represents all of the people. Yet, today, it is the president whose power and authority is most in decline.

<p>	The reasons for the decline are obvious. Even at the outset of his administration, when Bill Clinton's own party controlled both Houses of Congress, nearly all his actions undermined the strength of the presidency. He has retreated from campaign promises (the middle-class tax cut, a balanced budget), sown disaffection among his own supporters (gays in the military, health-care reform), dragged the White House into embarrassing scandals (Travelgate, Whitewater), and zigged and zagged on foreign policy (Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia).

<p>	But the presidency has also suffered from the rise of the legislative branch, especially since the elections of November 1994. This development is unusual. While the Congress has often had energetic leaders, it is rare in the modern era to see the national agenda set by the legislative branch rather than the executive.

<p>	Setting the national agenda may be the single most important function of a president. A strong president is someone who can focus on the two or three most urgent needs facing our country, develop a strategy to deal with them, and then convince at least half the country he's right. President Carter, by contrast, tried to involve himself in virtually every policy matter. President Clinton has done the same. The result has been an unfocused, and consequently weak, presidency. I am convinced that much of Ronald Reagan's effectiveness as president came from having three clear goals -- lower taxes, less government, and strong defense -- and spending all eight years of his presidency pursuing them.


<p>
	A careful reading of the Constitution shows that Article II provides the president with the tools to set the national agenda. He is the commander in chief and he is responsible for the conduct of the nation's foreign affairs. He can pick his own cabinet and appoint the chief officers of the government. He can select candidates for the federal bench. Through the careful use of the veto, he can reject whatever competing ideas the Congress tries to impose on the nation. All of these instruments of executive power can make for a strong president who helps chart the nation's course.

<p>	Again, President Clinton provides us with the best example of how the misuse of these powers leads to a weak executive. President Clinton's role as both commander-in-chief and the executive responsible for the conduct of foreign policy has done nothing to persuade America that there is a steady hand on the tiller. The result has been a Congress all-too-eager to usurp the president's prerogative in making foreign policy, whether it is in trade matters or the deployment of troops in Bosnia. A strong executive, as the Constitution implies, must make foreign policy, and resist congressional encroachments.

<p>	Our current situation is often ascribed to President Clinton's "inexperience" in foreign policy matters. Of course, it is not unusual for a president to arrive at the White House without a detailed knowledge of foreign affairs. But it is alarming to have a president who apparently doesn't know anyone else who does. Here we see President Clinton's ineffectual use of the power of appointment. The bureaucratic in-fighting among the State Department, Pentagon, and National Security Council personnel at the start of the Clinton presidency was a sign of the chief executive's inability to put together a first-class team that could work together. Joycelyn Elders and the series of bungled nominations at the Justice Department further eroded our confidence in the president's judgment. More recently, President Clinton's threats to veto a balanced budget amendment and the Republican Medicare plan seemed like pure political posturing rather than prudent use of executive power. These actions weakened both the president and the office of the presidency.

<p>	To be sure, there are many other aspects of our Constitution that receive too little notice: the Ninth and Tenth Amendments; the 22nd Amendment that created term limits for the president (the precedent for Congressional term limits); and the two alcohol amendments that tried to impose national legislation where local ordinances had proven more effective.
<p>
	But today we are on the brink of electing the first president of the next century. It would be worthwhile for all students of the Constitution -- not to mention all candidates for president -- to reexamine Article II. Used the way our Founders intended, Article II will help a strong, agenda-setting president committed to a limited central government achieve his goals.
<p>

<a name="dornan"></a><b>Representative Robert K. Dornan</b><br>
<i>"Government by Judiciary"</i>

<p>

	James Madison wrote that if "the sense in which the Constitution was accepted and ratified by the Nation . . . be not the guide in expounding it, there can be no security for a consistent and stable [government], more than for a faithful exercise of its powers." I couldn't agree more.

<p>	Seventy years of liberal activism, defined as opposing Madison's sentiment, have undone the original intent of the Framers. But no single point of judicial activism has done more harm to our nation than the doctrine of "incorporation"  in the Fourteenth Amendment of the Bill of Rights. In one fell swoop, the majesty and wisdom of the Tenth Amendment -- not to mention every doctrine of liberty upon which this nation of states was founded -- came crashing down.
<p>

	Our national penitence for the gross and evil sin of slavery has taken its toll on our every public institution. We fought a civil war, the bloodiest of all American wars, in large part to shed the physical chains of slavery protected by states' rights. We could have used surgically precise remedies to eventually bring closure to this historic tragedy without savaging the very liberties we insisted we were defending; instead we ignored the wisdom of our Founding Fathers and attempted a solution -- government by judiciary -- that fell way off the mark. In our earnest attempt to stop injustice from hiding behind the shield of states' rights, we threw the baby out with the bathwater. And, politics and power being what they are, "absorption" gave way to "incorporation."

<p>	Government by judiciary is perhaps the severest price our nation has paid for slavery. Through "incorporation" in the Fourteenth Amendment, the voice of the people (Congress and state and local governments) is patronized by "benevolent" judges, manipulated by strident ideologues, and mortgaged for generations by monied special interests. If the courts are, for all practical purposes, a "continuous constitutional convention," then how does our democracy differ from past oligarchies?

<p>	It is no small irony that this abrogation of federalism, our ultimate response to slavery, has brought on the second crushing evil to beset our nation: abortion. Only a judiciary that felt it had free rein to invoke "penumbras" within our Constitution could be so sick with power as to legalize mass extermination of our most innocent and defenseless citizens, our pre-born. Millions of pre-born children have been cruelly and brutally slaughtered -- a toll more horrific than any other holocaust -- because a simple majority of only nine men, ruling on behalf of 50 separate state constitutions, held that the Constitution, somewhere and somehow, contains a paramount right to privacy . . . and that "incorporation" dictates that this "penumbra" apply to the states.

<p>
	Every great social question in which the U.S. Supreme Court has weighed its opinion is the spawn of incorporation. Again, by what force of irony have our earnest attempts to rectify the problem of slavery ultimately given birth, not only to an even greater national sin in abortion but to a brood of contentious national issues that federalism was designed to pacify?

<p>	Consider, for instance, the charged issue of prayer in public schools. Any person with half a brain recognizes the insurmountable social problem of maintaining one collective way of publicly expressing our national adherence to the benevolent hand of God. And yet, precisely in response to public prayer -- contention that is completely natural and expected -- a simple majority of only nine unelected rulers told all of us that because one collective way of public prayer is not compatible with national cohesion, then no public prayer will be allowed. The doctrine of incorporation gives the Court this prerogative to rule in this manner.

<p>
	Every thinking American schooled in our national heritage -- all except a majority of the robed nine -- knows the intrinsic secular benefit from publicly acknowledging our Creator. Allowing and even encouraging public-school children to formally and vocally acknowledge their Creator impresses upon each of them a fundamental doctrine of Americanism -- that inalienable rights come from a Creator and not from man.

<p>
	Hence, these rights cannot be justifiably taken from them by men and their governments. How else can we more effectively impress this powerful message on the minds of rising generations? Incorporation states that we need not even try.

	States across the country are trying to reduce welfare costs and attack the system's culture of 
subsidized family breakdown. They're capping benefits for additional children born into welfare 
families, booting childless recipients from the rolls, and setting time limits on assistance. One of 
the nation's most provocative experiments aims to reform not only welfare but the individuals 
who receive it -- by turning over the state's role as social worker to local churches and 
synagogues.
<p>
	"God, not government, will be the savior of welfare recipients," says Mississippi governor 
Kirk Fordice. The Republican governor is convinced that the religious community can succeed 
where government by itself cannot -- by transforming the attitudes and behaviors of the welfare 
class. What is emerging in Mississippi is an unprecedented alliance between the governor, the 
state's Department of Human Services (DHS), and scores of local churches_all determined to 
tap the moral and spiritual resources of congregations to help lift Mississippi's 167,000 welfare 
recipients into permanent economic independence.
<p>
	Mississippi appears ripe for such an experiment. It is at once one of the nation's poorest states 
and one of its most religious. There are more churches here per capita than in any other state, but 
it also has the largest percentage of citizens receiving welfare assistance. Here many children still 
begin their school days in prayer, but more and more of those same children are having babies, 
pushing the state's illegitimacy rate to 44 percent. Here the cab drivers listen to Christian radio 
but navigate in cities where more than half of all children now live with an unmarried mother.
<p>
	A Gallup poll reveals that Mississippi and its southern neighbors boast "the greatest 
concentration and highest levels of religious fervor in America." So why hasn't all of this 
religiosity translated into stronger families, fewer people dependent on government welfare, and 
fewer social problems?
<p>
	It is perhaps ironic that a politician, not a preacher, has moved that question near the center of 
welfare reform in Mississippi. A year ago, Fordice summoned the state's religious leaders to the 
capitol, where he more or less read them the riot act. He challenged them to reach out 
aggressively to needy families in their communities, but to stop repeating the errors of 
government assistance. "The present system does absolutely nothing to inspire self-esteem, 
independence, or healthy family relationships," he has said.
<p>
	The "Faith and Families Project" hopes to revolutionize that system by matching welfare 
families, typically headed by an unmarried mother with at least two children, with congregations 
ready to become their <i>de facto</i> social workers. DHS officials expect participating 
churches to help individuals find good jobs and keep them. That means getting personally 
involved in ways that most state caseworkers, each tracking more than 200 families, cannot: 
lending emotional support and helping with child care, household budgeting, even grocery 
shopping.
<p>
	So far, the state has struck an arrangement that is keeping church-state litigators quiet. 
Churches are not asked to provide any financial support to welfare recipients; families are not 
required to attend the churches providing help. No welfare benefits are funneled through 
congregations, but government assistance, averaging $858 a month per family, continues until 
the family is independent.
<p>
	State officials expect, however, that congregations will do what they dare not try: wield moral 
authority and spiritual values among the state's 50,000 AFDC families -- one by one -- to 
transform their culture of dependency. "The problem is not material poverty, it is behavioral 
poverty," says Donald Taylor, executive director of the Mississippi DHS. "We're not interested 
in getting churches to replace welfare. What we're asking them is, `what can you provide to help 
move a family from economic slavery to economic independence?' "
<p>
	The answers are becoming increasingly urgent as Congress converts the federal welfare 
system into block grants, shifting primary responsibility for the poor back to the state and local 
level. Mississippi's tough welfare-to-workfare program, buoyed by rapid job growth, has helped 
reduce AFDC rolls by 12,000 families over the last three years. But state and federal welfare 
costs, including Medicaid, food stamps and supplemental security income, hit $2.3 billion in 
Mississippi in 1993, or at least $16,870 per family in poverty. Moreover, no state has a higher 
portion of its welfare expenses -- about 80 percent -- paid by the federal government than 
Mississippi.
<p>
	By maintaining the state's safety net but focusing on permanent behavioral change, Fordice 
hopes to reduce generational poverty. The goal: to see each of the state's 5,000 congregations 
adopt a welfare family, or about 10 percent of the existing caseload. Fordice hopes to bring down 
the number of long-term dependents, keep newly independent families from slipping back into 
poverty, and help families at risk -- hopefully making large new state expenditures on welfare 
unnecessary.
<p>
	Will it work?
<p>
	Beatrice Branch, Mississippi director of the NAACP, expects "minimal" results, claiming the 
plan "does not have broad-based support." Rims Barber, an ACLU lobbyist in Jackson, calls the 
program an election-year ploy, "a strong PR campaign, but that's all." 
<p>
	Try telling that to the Rev. Ronald Moore, the pastor of Stronger Hope Church in north 
Jackson. Moved by the governor's vision to enlist the aid of local churches, Moore began to 
challenge his black, middle-class congregation to reach out to welfare families in the city's 
depressed central and south sections. His congregation of about 200 has adopted 17 families, and 
five have found full-time employment. "I think the governor has hit a grand slam," says Moore. 
"He has caused many church leaders to say `yes, we've dispensed love, but there is a group of 
people who we've not really changed.' "
<p>
	Much of the state's religious community -- dominated mainly by independent-minded Baptist 
churches and black congregations with memories of racial segregation -- remains skeptical about 
any partnership with government. Nevertheless, about 175 churches have contacted the DHS to 
get profiles of welfare families in their neighborhoods, and have adopted more than 75 families 
on AFDC. In September, the Mississippi Family Council hosted a conference on breaking the 
welfare cycle that drew more than 200 church leaders and lay people.
<p>
	 The most common refrain was that churches -- black and white -- are indeed failing in their 
most basic moral and spiritual responsibilities to the poor.
<p>
	"There is something wrong with a gospel that will not lead people out of poverty," says the 
Rev. Thomas Jenkins, chairman of the church-based New Lake Development Foundation in 
central Jackson. The foundation offers tutoring programs and classes for the General Equivalency 
Degree, carpentry, computer training, and transitional housing for women and children -- all 
emphasizing the implications of faith on daily decision-making.
<p>
	Moore, who recruits congregations statewide for the program, emphasizes the role of the 
church in teaching personal responsibility and hard work, sexual abstinence and fatherhood. His 
favorite theme: "Stop doing what the government's been doing. Government has been trying to 
treat the effect, the aftermath. But we've got to go back to the basics and treat the cause." 
<p>
	Over the last year, Moore has addressed more than 300 pastors representing several 
denominations. Numerous churches have endorsed the initiative, including the National Baptist 
Convention, the nation's largest black denomination.
<p>
	Top DHS officials, handpicked by Governor Fordice, are reading from the same reform 
hymnal. Executive director Taylor has invited a leading consulting firm to work with his deputies 
and divisional directors to remake the agency's philosophy of assistance. State caseworkers who 
continue to function as "enablers," Taylor says, are in for a rude awakening. 
<p>
	The buzzwords at the DHS now are "accountability," "responsibility," and "permanent 
change." That's a significant leap for any state welfare department. And if large numbers of the 
state's congregations take up the governor's challenge to labor among the poor, then Mississippi 
could redefine the welfare debate with other words -- such as faith, hope, and charity.

<h2>Graham Cracks the Racial Barrier</h2>
<p>
	Mississippi governors haven't always had such cordial relations with religious leaders. In 
1952, a fiery young Southern Baptist preacher named Billy Graham led an interracial crusade in 
Jackson, defying segregationist governor Hugh White's request that he hold entirely separate 
services for blacks.
<p>
	Graham wrestled with the segregation question just as he was beginning to attain national 
prominence as an evangelical preacher. Though he rejected separate services during his Jackson 
campaign, Graham accepted segregated seating. He seemed to have done so with reservations. 
Toward the close of the crusade, he said that God's love knows no racial barriers. Moreover, he 
identified Jackson's two greatest social problems as illegal liquor (Mississippi was still dry) and 
segregation.
<p>
	"There is no scriptural basis for segregation. It may be there are places where such is desirable 
to both races, but certainly not in the church," Graham told the crowd. "The ground at the foot of 
the cross is level. . . . [I]t touches my heart when I see whites stand shoulder to shoulder with 
blacks at the cross."
<p>
	Though Graham's statements were both risky and visionary -- he made them four years before 
Martin Luther King Jr. rose to national prominence -- he waffled on the segregation question 
when challenged by critics. He must have done some soul-searching over the next several 
months: In March 1953, a year before the Supreme Court outlawed segregated schools, Graham 
told the sponsoring committee of his Chattanooga, Tennessee, crusade that he could not abide 
segregated seating. The committee balked. Graham didn't blink: Committee members watched in 
astonishment as he personally took down the ropes separating black and white sections.
<p>
	After the Court's <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> ruling, Graham never permitted any 
form of enforced segregation in his meetings, even in the Deep South.
<p.
	"The church should have been the pacesetter. The church should voluntarily be doing what the 
federal courts are doing by pressure and compulsion," the young preacher said. Graham soon 
became convinced -- as even many secularists now claim -- that "a great spiritual revival is 
needed to relieve the racial and political tensions of today."

<B>The Value of Victorian Virtues</B>
<br><I>The
De-Moralization of Society: From Victorian Virtues to Modern Values</I> by
Gertrude Himmelfarb (Knopf)<br>
 Maybe it's not so bad being a Victorian
moralist after all. True, writes Himmelfarb, the Victorians could
be stuffy, self-absorbed moralists. But it is equally true that
they acted &quot;on behalf of the poor, whom they sought not only
to assist materially but also to elevate morally, spiritually,
culturally, intellectually.&quot; The distinction provides a crucial
lesson for contemporary welfare reformers. The Victorians are
moralists in the sense that they believed in virtues-qualities
of character and morality that were desirable for every citizen
in a civilized society. Late-20th-century America no longer believes
in virtues, Himmelfarb writes, but has substituted for them the
notion of values-preferences that are relative and subjective.
One result is a welfare system that delivers services to the poor
but dares not address their deeper moral or spiritual needs. &quot;We
have so completely rejected any kind of moral principle,&quot;
Himmelfarb writes, &quot;that we have deliberately, systematically
divorced poor relief from moral sanctions and incentives.&quot;
The discrepancy between Victorian virtues and modern values has
produced vastly different outcomes. As it entered the 19th century,
England was caught in the teeth of industrialism, capitalism,
secularism-features of modernity responsible for the social upheaval
America is now experiencing. But the Victorian ethos was grounded
in the Christian traditions of Evangelicalism and Methodism, along
with their secular counterpart, Utilitarianism. The result? &quot;At
the end of the 19th century,&quot; she writes, &quot;England was
a more civil, more pacific, more humane society than it had been
at the beginning.&quot; Two social indicators: Between 1845 and
1900, illegitimate births in England fell from 7 percent of all
births in 1845 to less than 4 percent by 1900, while the rate
of serious crime declined by almost 50 percent.<P>
<B>The Economics
of Trust</B><br><I>Trust: The Social Virtues &amp; The Creation of Prosperity</I> by Francis Fukuyama (The Free Press)<br>
 Fukuyama argues
that America's greatness comes from a spirit of individual liberty
balanced by &quot;a rich network of voluntary associations and
community structures to which individuals have subordinated their
narrow interests.&quot; America in the past was as group-oriented
as Japan and Germany, Fukuyama writes, and this trait accounts
for the dominance of these countries in the international marketplace.
Only societies with a high degree of social trust can create the
flexible, large-scale business organizations needed for successful
competition in the global economy. The crucial difference between
America and the two other nations is that social cooperation here
was not enforced through emperors or kaisers. In America, strong
community emerged in the absence of a strong state. America's
economic future is now endangered by the rapid depletion of its
social capital. Fukuyama argues that the dominance of rights-based
liberalism, the rise of violent crime and civil litigation, the
collapse of the family, the decline of neighborhoods, churches,
unions, and charities, and the breakdown of shared values are
destroying Americans' ability to cooperate with each other. It
is no accident, he suggests, that those ethnic groups with the
highest degree of internal trust are economically the most successful.
He cites the importance of Asian-American rotating credit associations
that count on family members and business associates to honor
their debts. The author explores &quot;the paradox of family values&quot;:
While families in America are &quot;too weak to perform their
basic task of socialization,&quot; in some societies families
&quot;are too strong to permit the formation of modern economic
organizations.&quot; In Chinese, Italian, and French societies,
Fukuyama suggests, family members trust each other completely.
But intense distrust of outsiders precludes civic or political
life outside the family, and nearly all economic organizations
are family-based. Most giant corporations are government-run,
because unrelated people don't trust each other enough to work
together.<P>
<B>Building Blocks</B><br>
<I>Building a Community of Citizens:
Civil Society in the 21st Century</I> Don E. Eberly, ed. (University
Press of America)<br>
 The 23 essays that make up <I>Building a Community
of Citizens: Civil Society in the 21st Century</I> explore the
condition of America's civic life and endeavor to identify the
ideas and policies required for social renewal as America moves
into the next century. The work seeks to define the unique American
&quot;creed&quot; that will inform this renewal: &quot;If Americans
are to build a community of citizens,&quot; Don Eberly argues,
&quot;they will have to do so within, not outside of, the American
philosophical tradition.&quot; Many of the contributors see that
tradition in the ideas of the American founding, including justice
and limited government as well as equal opportunity and responsible
freedom. These ideas remain, as Heather Higgins puts it, the &quot;cultural
building blocks&quot; of America's future. Edward Schwartz (among
others) would include Tocqueville's concept of civil society and
mediating institutions. In the political sphere, &quot;governmentalism&quot;
must be replaced by active citizenship and revitalized political
institutions. The political party, according to Colleen Sheehan,
was supposed to be &quot;the most encompassing and decisive expression
of our common republican opinion and civic character.&quot;  In
the cultural sphere, relativism must be replaced by strong families,
personal morality, and religious faith. Unless America &quot;respects
and protects&quot; the relationship between religion and public
life, writes Os Guinness, &quot;both American religious liberty
and public discourse will he handicapped.&quot;

<B>Small is Beautiful</B>
<br><I>Loving
Your Neighbor: A Principled Guide to Personal Charity</I> Marvin
Olasky, ed. (Capital Research Center)<br>
 Culled from <I>Philanthropy,
Culture and Society</I>, the 12 practical essays in this book
illustrate the virtues and pitfalls of personal charity. The book's
premise is that government welfare and the &quot;upstairs&quot;
philanthropy of wealthy foundations fail because they aim to meet
only the physical needs of the poor. Through factual reporting,
the writers show small-scale, &quot;downstairs&quot; charities
that do more good by urging the needy to change their conduct
and attitudes. As the title implies, the book also emphasizes
the centrality of religion in transforming lives. But even small,
religious charities can forget some of the &quot;basics of successful
philanthropy: think small, and think of souls rather than bodies.&quot;
Some charities err in relying on one charismatic leader; others
imperil their religious character by accepting government or foundation
funding with strings attached. The writers draw key lessons from
successful programs as well as from those that have gone awry.
Gerry Wisz investigates one New York soup kitchen's evolution
from merely offering meals to the homeless to encouraging personal
responsibility. Frederica Mathewes-Green shows how volunteer-run
pregnancy care centers in Maryland enable low-income women to
bring their babies to term by offering them shelter, clothing,
and comfort. Marvin Olasky examines a Texas charity that sacrificed
its success by purging its spiritual qualities to secure government
funding. Dan McMurry recounts how competition for grants among
charities in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, led them to create a pauper
class to justify their existence. Olasky concludes that &quot;poverty-fighters
should commit themselves to helping only those . . . who are willing
to work hard and change their life-styles.&quot; <I>Capital Research Center -- tel: 202-393-2600, fax: 202-393-2626.</I>

<B>A Second Look at Habitat</B><br>&quot;It's
Time to Take Habitat for Humanity Seriously&quot; by Howard Husock<br>
<I>City Journal</I>, Summer 1995. Conservatives treat Habitat for
Humanity lightly, writes Husock, because of its affiliation with
former president Jimmy Carter. But Habitat is fast becoming the
biggest homebuilder in America and offers a program that draws
on conservative ideals. The organization builds modest new houses
in the belief that low-income families will maintain orderly neighborhoods
if they own their own homes. To qualify, a low-income applicant
must meet rigorous standards of responsibility. A prospective
owner must participate in the construction of his home. Habitat
then offers the owner an interest-free mortgage. The owner must
also help build someone else's home, and his house is repossessed
if he defaults on the payments. The result, in many cases: Safe,
clean neighborhoods and low-income homeowners with pride and a
stake in an orderly and prosperous community. All of the money
used in Habitat's construction projects comes from private sources. <I>Manhattan

<B>Foundation Fossils</B><br>&quot; Philanthropical Correctness&quot; by
David Samuels <I>The New Republic</I>, Sept. 18 &amp; 25, 1995<br>
Although their assets have tripled in the last 25 years, Samuels
contends that America's philanthropic foundations have become
irrelevant to public policy. The foundations that once funded
the discovery of the polio vaccine and the expansion of our public
library system cannot boast such lofty achievements today. Samuels
cites four reasons. First, rather than fund programs that offer
practical solutions to failures in education, welfare, and crimefighting,
these foundations fund multicultural programs designed to promote
&quot;diversity&quot; and &quot;tolerance.&quot; Second, these
foundations give more money to liberal advocacy groups like the
Children's Defense Fund than they give to university research.
Third, foundations no longer subject grantees to independent scholarly
review but rely on foundation bureaucrats with little policy expertise.
Finally, these foundations suffer from inbreeding and parochialism.
Nearly 40 percent of foundation CEOs are hired from within the
nonprofit sector, 30 percent from within their own foundations.
The result: chronic myopia. Obsessed with multicultural concerns
and hamstrung by stale thinking, our leading foundations pay little
attention to our society's most pressing issues.<I>The New Republic -- tel:

<B>Wilsonian Liberals</B><br>&quot;Liberalism's
Lost Tradition&quot; by Fred Siegel &amp; Will Marshall <I>The New Democrat</I>, Sept./Oct. 1995 <br>
Writing in the Democratic Leadership
Council's house magazine, Fred Siegel and Will Marshall assure
Democrats fearful of obsolescence that one tradition within liberalism
might accord with America's repudiation of New Deal statism. Woodrow
Wilson's &quot;New Freedom&quot; liberalism took aim at the concentration
of power in turn-of-the-century corporate America by curbing trusts.
Siegel and Marshall suggest that today's Democrats should direct
this ideological animus toward our centralized federal government.
During the 1912 presidential contest between Wilson and Theodore
Roosevelt, they note, Roosevelt was supported by both corporate
moguls and social workers. These odd bedfellows were united in
a &quot;common condescension&quot; for the common man. Wilson
criticized paternalism, argued against social planning by either
corporate monopolies or by a large, interventionist federal government,
and championed individual and economic liberty. Siegel and Marshall
urge today's Democrats to tap into this lost &quot;anti-statist
but radically democratic&quot; tradition by breaking the federal
government's monopoly over public decisionmaking and resources. <I>Democratic Leadership Council -- tel: 202-546-0007, fax: 202-544-5002.  <P>

<B>Drafted
Volunteers</B><br>&quot;Charity Begins at School&quot; by Chester E.
Finn Jr. &amp; Gregg  Vanourek <I>Commentary</I>, Oct. 1995 <br>
Government
by the people or people by the government? Hudson Institute Scholars
Finn and Vanourek assess mandatory community service in our schools.
Finn and Vanourek oppose &quot;compulsory-service learning&quot;
because it confuses political action with community service and
hence promotes projects with an ideological cast. In Cecil County,
Maryland, students earned credit for lobbying the county government
to maintain its recycling program. Furthermore, mandated volunteer
service is itself an oxymoron that obscures the virtue of true
voluntarism. And who's to say which student projects meet service
requirements? In Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, a high-school student
was denied her diploma because the time she spent volunteering
in a nursing home and for Meals on Wheels was not school-directed
service. Finally, the authors claim that mandatory service threatens
church-based and private-sector volunteer work. In the near-term,
mandatory service monopolizes the time children might otherwise
devote to private-sector charity, and it discourages private-sector
voluntarism in the long-run by teaching children that voluntarism
is no more fulfilling than writing lab reports and meeting paper
deadlines. <I>Commentary -- tel: 212-751-4400, fax: 212-751-1174.</I>

<B>Vo-Tech
Strikes Out</B><br>
&quot;The President's Apprentices&quot; by Jonathan
Marshall  <I>Reason</I>, March 1995 <br>
Faced with declining wages
for high-school graduates, the Clinton administration has embraced
school-to-work programs. But Marshall argues that students put
through the paces of vocational training are no better off in
the long-term than students who go the strictly academic route.
A recent National Assessment of Vocational Education study reports
that graduates of vocational education in California are employed
at the same rates and earn about as much as general track graduates.
In fact, according to a Labor Department report released last
year, many male graduates of vocational education actually earn
less than those who have graduated from traditional high school
programs. The central difficulty seems to be that graduates of
vocational education often do not obtain jobs that match their
training. In Germany, where most trained bakers work for Ford
Motor Company, only half of German apprenticeship graduates work
in the fields in which they were trained. Consequently, some studies
show that students might do better to delay career choices until
they gain more work experience and until they can better direct

&quot;Why Koreans Succeed&quot; by Heather Mac Donald <I>City Journal</I>, Spring 1995 <br>
Mac Donald assures us that
the American dream is alive and epitomized by Korean-American
grocers in New York. Their success, she argues, is fueled by the
same factors that have enabled other immigrant groups to succeed:
hard work, an emphasis on education, and strong community ties.
Some of these factors manifest themselves in distinctly Korean
ways. Korean communities form gaes, or communal savings pools,
to provide interest-free loans to budding businessmen. And many
Korean children boost their academic achievement by attending
a hagwon or &quot;prep school&quot; after school and on weekends.
But Mac Donald warns that America has grown economically and culturally
hostile towards Korean entrepreneurship. New York City requires
grocers to pay 14 different taxes and obtain numerous licenses;
Koreans also endure race-based boycotts and racial crimes. Consequently,
Korean immigration has slowed to a trickle and some are returning
home. Urban America will suffer if Korean entrepreneurship is
stifled. By introducing stable and successful businesses to low-income
neighborhoods in New York and Los Angeles, Koreans have spearheaded
urban renewal. Many Koreans are still committed to building successful
businesses here. Will we let them? <I>Manhattan Institute -- tel:

<p><B>Hired Off the Streets</B><br>&quot;From
Underclass to Working Class&quot; by James L. Payne  <I>The American
Enterprise</I>, Sept./Oct. 1995 <br>
The Dallas branch of the Industrial
Labor Service Corp. (ILS) proves that the invisible hand can be
a helping hand. ILS, Payne reports, is the largest employer of
temporary laborers in Dallas. It hires from among Dallas's down-and-out.
ILS pays these workers $4.70 an hour but charges companies $7.50
an hour for their services. ILS uses the difference to provide
its workers with lodging, breakfast and lunch, transportation,
and tools, and it makes a profit of 17 cents an hour per worker.
Unlike most private charities touted by conservatives, ILS is
primarily profit-driven. It does not demand its &quot;clients&quot;
change personal habits and attitudes as many faith-based charities
do. But, Payne reports, laborers find ILS benevolent (it provides
lunch out of generosity, not a desire to raise productivity).
And they also learn the lesson of exchange-you have to give something
to receive something-that many charities try to instill by demanding
behavioral or spiritual change in exchange for material aid. Payne
warns that &quot;working halls&quot; like ILS are threatened by
the news media and the government, which accuse them of exploitation. <I>American

<B>Black Christian Schools</B><br>
&quot;The
New Exodus&quot; by Joe Maxwell <I>World</I>, April 15, 1995<br>
In 1954,
Brown v. Board of Education paved the way for the integration
of public schools. Many black families abandoned Christian schools
in favor of integrated public education. Forty years later, Maxwell
reports, blacks are returning. Nearly 10 percent of African-American
children from kindergarten to fifth grade attend private schools,
up from 3.8 percent in 1968. Maxwell argues that black parents
appreciate the discipline and the unambiguous moral education
their children receive at these schools. They are happy that their
children are required to wear uniforms, that the school environment
they send their children to is drug-, gang-, and violence-free,
and that prayer is an essential component of their children's
school day. The revival of black Christian academies is hardly
the result of separatist sentiment. Their main agenda is providing
excellent Christian education. The rise of such schools is an
indictment of poor public education. In the words of one supporter,
&quot;How many more generations of black children's education
are we going to allow to be destroyed . . . by an incompetent,
costly, self-serving government education establishment?&quot; <I>World -- tel:

<B>Mormon Charity</B><br>
&quot; Work, Not Welfare
in the Mormon Church&quot; by Ralph Hardy <I>The American Enterprise</I>,
Sept./Oct. 1995 
<br>Sixty years ago, at the dawn of the welfare state
and its &quot;culture of dependence,&quot; the Mormon Church built
its own welfare program on the principle of individual responsibility.
At the center of this system lies the &quot;bishops' storehouse.&quot;
Akin to a discount retailer like Price Club, it warehouses foodstuffs
and other essentials. At times throughout the year, Mormons volunteer
their labor on farms that supply the storehouse. Mormons also
fast on the first Sunday of every month, and the money that would
have been spent on skipped meals is used to purchase items for
the storehouse. When a Mormon bishop determines that a truly needy
individual or family has no other means of support, such as relatives
in another state, he may offer food and supplies from the church's
storehouse. In exchange, recipients are usually required to perform
some service for the church community and to search for employment,
with the church's help. Hardy argues that his church's system
is one antidote to the maladies of our current welfare system.<I>American

<B>Future Businessmen</B><br>
&quot;New
Kids on the Block: The National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship&quot; by
Martin Morse Wooster <I>Philosophy, Culture and Society</I>, June
1995 <br>
After being mugged on a Bronx street in 1981, businessman
Steve Mariotti wondered why bright inner-city kids would risk
their futures for the paltry $10 they stole from him. Mariotti
wanted to help at-risk children learn how to calculate risk and
reward for legitimate ends. Because schools often do not give
students the practical skills and work habits that lead to success
in business, Mariotti established the National Foundation for
Teaching Entrepreneurship (NFTE) in 1986. Today, NFTE operates
in nine urban centers, including New York City, Boston, and Philadelphia.
Its budget has grown from $600,000 in 1991 to $5.5 million today,
thanks to charitable contributions from foundations and other
sources. And what does this money buy? Student entrepreneurs are
given business cards, a $10 bank account, $50 for start-up costs,
and the opportunity to read the Wall Street Journal once a week.
With this start, students build their own small businesses and
learn about profit, loss, finance, marketing, negotiation, and
customer service. Greg Blair sells trading cards. Regina Jackson
markets the jewelry she makes. Low-income minority students are
the target of this program. In Washington, D.C., nearly all of
the approximately 250 students who participate in NFTE are low-income
African Americans. Consequently, the textbooks used in NFTE classes,
one of which is co-authored by Mariotti, profile the entrepreneurial
successes of formerly disadvantaged minorities. Wooster's reporting
is choc-full of heart-warming anecdotes garnered from his visits
to NFTE programs in D.C. schools. He concludes that NFTE fills
a valuable niche: It is the one program that actually shows inner-city
youth a path to success different from one littered with violence
and despair. <I>Capital Research Center -- tel: 202-393-2600, fax:

<B>Welfare as We Will Know It</B><BR>&quot;Ending the Welfare State, Pts. I and II&quot; <I>Alternatives in Philanthropy</I>,
April &amp; May 1995 <BR>
In this two-part series, 14 leading conservatives
propose alternatives to the welfare state. David Forte wants to
bolster private charities by offering taxpayers a 110 percent
tax deduction for charitable contributions. William Tucker thinks
that for every hour a person spends doing volunteer work, he or
she should be rewarded with a tax credit equal to his or her regular
earned income per hour. Charles D. Hobbs suggests making working
more profitable than welfare by subsidizing private-sector employment
for welfare recipients. George Liebmann argues that we should
model day care in the U.S. after the British, who rely heavily
on parent-organized and volunteer-run cooperative playgroups.
Michael Tanner urges that adoption be eased by lifting restrictions
on transracial adoption, terminating the custodial rights of biological
parents whose children have been in foster care for a year, and
by ending funding formulas that encourage states to keep as many
children as possible in the foster care system.  Michael Novak
argues that teen moms should be blocked from setting up independent
households, while Elizabeth Fox-Genovese advocates placing them
and their children in maternity homes. The proposals assume that,
absent welfare, the private-sector holds the answers to our social
problems. <I>Capital Research Center -- tel: 202-393-2600, fax: 202-393-2626.</I>

<B>Pope John Paul II on Democracy</B><P>
Democracy cannot be sustained
without a shared commitment to certain moral truths about the
human person and human community. The basic question before a
democratic society is: &quot;How ought we live together?&quot;
In seeking an answer to this question, can society exclude moral
truth and moral reasoning? Can the Biblical wisdom that played
such a formative part in the very founding of your country be
excluded from the debate? Would not doing so mean that America's
founding documents no longer have any defining content, but are
only the formal dressing of changing opinion? Would not doing
so mean that tens of millions of Americans could no longer offer
the contribution of their deepest convictions to the formation
of public policy?   Every generation of Americans needs to know
that freedom consists not in doing what we like, but in having
the right to do what we ought.        -- Baltimore, Md., Oct. 8,

<B>Sen. Bill Bradley on Civil Society</B><br>
What both Democrats
and Republicans fail to see is that the government and the market
are not enough to make a civilization. There must also be a healthy,
robust civic sector-a space in which the bonds of community can
flourish. Government and the market are similar to two legs on
a three-legged stool. Without the third leg of civil society,
the stool is not stable and cannot provide support for a vital
America. . . .  We also have to give the distinctive moral language
of civil society a more permanent place in our public conversation.
The language of the marketplace says, &quot;Get as much as you
can for yourself.&quot; The language of government says, &quot;Legislate
for others what is good for them.&quot; But the language of community,
family and citizenship at its core is about receiving undeserved
gifts. What this nation needs to promote is the spirit of giving
something freely, without measuring it out precisely or demanding
something in return.        -- speech, National Press Club, Feb.

<h2>Japan's Parole Models</h2><br>
by <b>Leslie Gardner</b>
</center><p>
	To bring America's crime explosion under control, new prisons and longer sentences will not 
be enough. Most criminals are eventually released, and most return to a life of crime. In addition 
to tougher law enforcement, we need to find ways to turn former criminals into law-abiding 
citizens. Perhaps here, Americans can learn from the success of volunteer probation and parole 
officers in Japan.
<P>
	America's current system of probation and parole is a joke. On average, each of the nation's 
35,000 probation and parole officers must supervise 100 convicts. With so many charges, the 
typical officer is lucky if he can find his parolees or probationers, let alone monitor their 
movements. "Most state probation and parole systems have a serious problem with case 
overload," says Steve Varnum, the executive director of Justice Fellowship at Prison Fellowship 
Ministries. "This leads to a high percentage of parole and probation violations, with many 
offenders returning to prison." 
<p>
	Japan, by contrast, has fewer than 1,000 full-time professional probation and parole officers. 
These officers are recruited and trained as professionals in counseling, but with an average of 
100,000 new qualifying convicts each year, they are too few to counsel clients individually. 
Their real work is to assign cases to approximately 48,000 volunteer parole officers throughout 
the country.

<p>	Each volunteer on average supervises only two convicts, and his primary responsibility is 
to help them rejoin their families and neighborhoods as well as to monitor their movements. 
These volunteers-cum-social workers are clearly getting the job done: Fewer than 4 percent of 
Japanese criminals who have been assigned to a volunteer officer will commit another crime 
within a year of their release on parole or probation.
<P>
	What is the Japanese secret in dealing so effectively with criminal offenders? Part of the 
answer is the selection process for parole and probation. To qualify for probation or parole in 
Japan, an offender must show remorse  for his crime and meet certain criteria that prevent the 
release of serious or habitual criminals.
<p>
	In Japan, acceptance by one's family is often the most important factor in an offender's 
rehabilitation, for the concept of shame is still alive and well in this society. A volunteer officer 
visits the offender's home to help his family overcome the shame of having a relative convicted 
of a crime. If family reunification is deemed impossible, the volunteer finds the offender a place 
at a halfway house or with friends.

<p>
	The next step is to help the offender find stable employment, so he may again become a 
functional member of his community. This is also considered essential to rehabilitation, as the 
importance of societal acceptance is second only to that of acceptance by one's family. After a 
residence and a job have been secured, the volunteer officer continues to meet with his charge 
once or twice a month to provide counsel and to monitor his progress.
<p>
	An appointment as a volunteer probation or parole officer requires no special  training or 
background; candidates must simply be respected and financially stable. Volunteers come from a 
range of occupations, but more than half are fishermen or farmers, religious leaders, housewives, 
and retired people. Ninety percent of the volunteers are at least 50 years old and 80 percent are 
men.
<p>
	Once appointed by the Ministry of Justice, a volunteer's term of service is two years, but most 
are reappointed several times. Almost half serve at least 10 years.
<p>
	Japan formally authorized its system of suspended prosecution in 1924, and codified the 
network of volunteers upon which it depended in 1950. Research conducted by Japan's Ministry 
of Justice shows that the success of volunteer probation officers lies in the individual attention 
they are able to give each offender; they are often seen as friends or mentors rather than authority 
figures. Many convicts, moved by the fact that someone has taken an interest in their well-being, 
feel an obligation to work toward rehabilitation.
<p>
	Could such a system work in the United States? America would need more than 1.75 million 
volunteers to achieve the same 2:1 ratio as Japan. Still, small caseload ratios are key to the 
successful supervision of offenders. "Most criminal activity is preceded by a progression of 
inappropriate behaviors," Varnum says. "If an agent spends time with an offender and sees the 
environment the offender lives in, it will be much easier for the agent to recognize the 
inappropriate behaviors that may lead to the offender's participation in further criminal activity. 
The Japanese parole model serves that purpose of real time supervision."
<p>
	It's true that Japanese society, particularly the role of the family, is quite different. Sharing in 
the public control of behavior, of course, is not unique to Japan. Many U.S. cities have volunteer 
organizations whose members patrol their communities or teach conflict resolution and job skills. 
Churches and mosques have begun to welcome and find employment for former criminals. It's 
time to go further, and experiment with the Japanese volunteer model.

<h2>Salvatori Prize</h2>

	Beginning in 1996, The Heritage Foundation will give an annual Salvatori Prize for American 
Citizenship.
<P>
	Endowed by a generous gift from the Henry Salvatori Foundation of Los Angeles, the 
Salvatori Prize for American Citizenship will recognize and reward extraordinary efforts by 
American citizens who help their communities solve problems the government has been unable 
or unwilling to solve. In the words of Heritage President <a 
href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner Jr.</a>, "The conservative revolution has two 
parts. Everyone understands that part one is to reduce the size and power of the federal 
government. Part two is to return responsibility to American citizens to solve local problems. We 
need to get government out of the way if this is to happen, but we also need to show people how 
to solve their own problems."
<p>
	The Salvatori Prize, Feulner said, is intended to do just that. "We will highlight the success 
stories, and encourage more successes, while promoting the kind of American citizenship 
envisioned by our Founding Fathers." The winner of the annual Salvatori Prize will receive a 
$25,000 cash award.
<p>
<h2>Reforms to Speed Adoption
</h2>

	This nation's $10-billion-per-year foster-care system keeps thousands of children from being 
united with loving parents," writes FitzGerald Senior Fellow <a 
href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a>, a former family therapist and clinical 
psychologist. "The anti-adoption bias of the current public-sector welfare bureaucracy has 
resulted in an adoption process with too many built-in obstacles. These obstacles feed children 
into the foster-care system and keep them there, ensuring a larger clientele for public agencies, at 
a staggering emotional cost," he says. "The quickest, simplest solution is for states, which have 
primary responsibility for regulating adoption, to place the job of finding suitable parents in the 
hands of private adoption services."
<p>
	Only 1 percent of women choose adoption as a solution to their unwanted pregnancies. "Some 
40 percent of pregnancy counselors don't even raise the issue of adoption with pregnant clients; 
another 40 percent provide incomplete or inaccurate information about adoption," Fagan says. 
Yet when adoption is mentioned, 38 percent choose it over alternatives like abortion.
Race is another barrier in the adoption system, Fagan says. A higher proportion of black than 
white children are available to adopt, and many white parents would like to adopt black children. 
Yet the welfare bureaucracy is dedicated to a policy of "race matching," which delays adoption 
for years. As a result, says Fagan, "black children typically wait two to three years longer than 
white children for adoptive homes." 
<p>
	To fix these and other problems, Fagan suggests a number of reforms. Besides privatizing all 
adoption services, he urges states to:
<p><ul>
<li> Remove obstacles to transracial adoptions.
<p>
<li> Enact a strict, 12-month timeline for working out the long-term parental status of any child 
in foster care.
<p>
<li> Separate the responsibility for protecting children from convicted abusive parents from that 
of preserving parental rights for families that can be helped. "Professionals should not be trapped 
between simultaneous demands to reunite every family and to protect every child," Fagan says. 
"When these duties are separated, both goals are better served." 
<p>
<li> Prohibit the removal of a child from foster parents willing to adopt, except when the child is 
being returned to its legal parents.
</ul>
<P>
	Fagan says Congress should:
<p><ul> 	
<li> Enact a means-tested, fully refundable, inflation-adjusted tax credit of up to $5,000 to help 
pay the substantial one-time costs incurred by adopting parents. 
<p>
<li> Require hospitals and clinics receiving federal aid to provide timely and accurate adoption 
information to all mothers who give birth out of wedlock.
<p>
<li> Prohibit the use of race or ethnicity to deny or delay placement of a child in foster care or 
adoption.
</ul><P>
<h2>"Trillion-Dollar Tax Hike"
</h2>

	The tax burden will rise by more than a trillion dollars over the next five years without 
Medicare reform, write Heritage analysts Robert Moffit, John Liu, and David Winston.
<p>
	"The Congressional Budget Office already projects that during the next five years, Medicare 
Part B, which covers doctors' fees and other services, will need an estimated $370.5 billion in 
general taxes," they write in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/fyi62.html">recent report</a>. 
<p>
	On top of that, if Congress resorts to an increase in the payroll tax to save Medicare Part A, 
the hospitalization program trust fund, this will require an estimated 3.5 percent hike on top of 
the current level of 2.9 percent, or $711 billion in new revenue over the next five years. "Right 
now, when you look at the combined level of taxation needed to save Medicare, the amount is 
almost triple President Clinton's 1993 tax hike, which ranks as the largest in U.S. history."

<h2>Clara's Heart</h2>
<b>by Laura Morrow</b></center>
<p>
	Clara Barton struggled with bureaucratic insensitivity all her life. Her biggest problem was 
getting official permission to do good.
<p>
	Born Christmas Day, 1821, Barton showed a talent for organizing charity when she 
established the first free public school in Bordentown, New Jersey. After enrollments soared, the 
local school board pushed her aside.
<p>
	When the Civil War erupted, she felt driven to help. After learning that soldiers from her 
home state of Massachusetts were quartered in the U.S. Senate chambers without beds or 
supplies, she brought items from her home and, with her own money, purchased and prepared 
food for them.
<p>
	Barton discovered that ambulances, medical supplies, and hospital construction were not high 
priorities for the Union military bureaucracy. Henry Halleck, the Army's general-in-chief, 
dismissed them as "effeminating comforts." (He felt the same about shoes and shirts.) Union 
soldiers commonly died on the battlefield waiting for treatment, yet the Medical Department, 
valuing bureaucratic ritual over need, refused to change policy. Frustrated, Barton collected 
supplies and personally arranged their distribution.
<p>
	Barton eventually accumulated three warehousefuls of supplies and persuaded the Army to 
help distribute them at the front. At great personal risk -- a bullet ripped through her sleeve at 
Antietam and killed the injured soldier she was aiding -- Barton fed troops and helped evacuate 
the wounded. Nearly two years into the war, the Army finally agreed to contribute supplies to her 
volunteer efforts. She devised a plan for each state to establish a distribution agency where it had 
a substantial regimental presence.
<p>
	Barton encountered bureaucratic resistance everywhere. When the War Department ignored a 
sergeant's requests for a furlough -- despite the fact that both of his arms had been blown off in 
battle -- an outraged Barton escorted him to the office of Massachusetts senator Henry Wilson. 
She then explained that his furlough request was being disregarded and handed the senator the 
necessary paperwork. When Wilson extended his welcome, Barton commented, "You will 
pardon the sergeant for not offering you a hand -- he has none." The soldier left on furlough the 
following day. 
<p>
Exhausted by such struggles, Barton sought rest in Europe. In 1870, the Grand Duchess of Baden 
enlisted her help with the International Red Cross's relief effort for civilian refugees and 
wounded soldiers in the Franco-Prussian War. Admiring the systematic organization and 
efficiency of the institution, Barton undertook a one-woman effort to found an American chapter 
of the Red Cross. She sought congressional approval for the organization's involvement in 
wartime humanitarian aid, but was initially thwarted by fears of foreign entanglements.
<p>
	To make the organization more attractive to an isolationist Congress, Barton expanded its 
proposed focus to include domestic peacetime disaster relief, an expansion later adopted by the 
International Red Cross under the "American Amendment." Finally, in 1881, Barton founded the 
American Association of the Red Cross in Washington, D.C. She was elected its first president.
<p>
	Barton kept the American Red Cross decentralized, giving hands-on authority to local 
chapters. Journalist Joel Chandler Harris (of Uncle Remus fame) praised the charity's efficiency: 
"There are no exhibitions of self-importance. . . . The perfection of its machinery is shown by the 
apparent absence of machinery." 
<p>
	Nevertheless, in 1904, at 81, Barton was maneuvered out of the presidency by socialite Mabel 
Thorp Boardman, who wanted to transform the Red Cross into a more centralized administrative 
structure based on new theories of "scientific management." After leading a failed coup against 
Barton, she vengefully instigated a congressional investigation into the organization. Once the 
investigation vindicated her, Barton resigned.
<p>
	For her life's work, Barton received the German Iron Cross, the Red Cross of Geneva, and the 
Empress Augusta medal, among other honors. "They do brighten up an old dress," she joked. 
She spent her last years caring for relatives, occasionally pinning her medals on her dress before 
going out to milk the cows. She died at 91, in Glen Echo, Maryland.
<p>
	Today, Barton's organization remains volunteer-oriented and decentralized; its ratio of 
volunteers to paid workers is about 50:1. In addition to collecting 6 million units of blood (nearly 
half the nation's entire clinical blood supply) each year, the Red Cross provides aid after natural 
disasters, processes emergency communications between military personnel and their families, 
and offers first aid and medical training.
<p>
	Barton learned early on that charities attract two kinds of people: those concerned with doing 
good and those concerned with looking good. The former want to help; the latter are primarily 
interested in social engineering and self-aggrandizement. Her persistence and character 
ultimately triumphed over bureaucratic interference, making the Red Cross an effective force for 
good -- and one worthy of the memory of Clara Barton.

<h2>WHY "KING COTTON" IS TRASHING FARM REFORM</h2>
By John Frydenlund<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
9/21/95
<br>
<hr width=50%>
</center><p>
	While most folks in Washington fled the summer heat and humidity for the August recess,  a little-known special interest stayed behind to plot strategy. And so far it's working like gangbusters.
<p>	The National Cotton Council of America lobbies on behalf of cotton producers, ginners, warehousemen, merchants, crushers, cooperatives and manufacturers. During the recess, "King Cotton" declared war on Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture. And last week, it paid off.
<p>	The Council's efforts were instrumental in defeating in committee Roberts' attempt to end 60 years of failed New Deal agriculture policies. His farm-reform bill, the "Freedom to Farm Act of 1995," would have ended a special deal cotton producers enjoy. By allowing them to receive federal crop-support payments as three separate entities -- as individuals, corporations and partnerships, for example -- a mile-wide loophole in the current farm program lets cotton producers pull down two-and-a-half times the national average per-capita income. 
<p>	Roberts' plan was simple: Get the U.S. Department of Agriculture out of the business of deciding what farmers grow on their farms, and instead let individual farmers decide what they want to plant based on what they think they can grow profitably for markets around the world. The bill also would have eliminated the various government-reserve programs that encourage farmers to idle potentially productive farm land.
<P>	Of course, since the Roberts bill would have cut off the money spigot for the Cotton Council, an army of lobbyists descended on the capitol. The Council insisted that nothing less than keeping the status quo was "acceptable." In a recent "Action Request," the Council urged its members to tell their congressmen that Roberts' bill "abandons U.S. agriculture, will depress land values and will discourage new investment."
<p>	In fact, the American Farm Bureau Federation estimates farmers would have actually gained more than $7 billion extra over seven years as a result of the Roberts bill than they would under the current farm program. This is because the Roberts plan would have provided generous transition payments to help farmers switch from the current system to a free market, and because of  increased sales as farmers were freed from federal limits on how much they can plant.
<p>	Of course, the battle isn't over -- the House Budget Committee may take up farm reform next. It's members should be interested in a report released earlier this year by the General Accounting Office (GAO), which characterized the cotton program as a costly, complex maze of domestic and international price supports that benefit a small group of wealthy cotton producers. Cost to the taxpayers: more than $12 billion since 1986.
<p>	A privileged 300 cotton producers received between $250,000 and $1 million apiece in taxpayer dollars in 1993, and about 2,000 got between $100,000 and $250,000, thanks to the cotton loophole, according to GAO. The rest of the cotton industry's 95,000 participants have little to show from this sweetheart deal with Washington.
<p>	In fact, if the majority of America's cotton farmers knew the truth, they would be outraged. It so happens that of the 35 board members who attended the Council's June meeting in Charlotte, N.C. --  the group pushing hardest for the status quo -- only five actually were cotton farmers. The rest were ginners, warehousemen, merchants, crushers, heads of cooperatives, and manufacturers. In other words, 86 percent of the Cotton Council's top leaders don't even grow cotton. The processors and marketers who fill the majority of the board's seats want to keep nearly $1 billion in payments the Roberts bill would give to actual cotton growers to help them transition to a free market.<p>
	A simple question needs to be asked: Why does the government even have a price-support program for cotton at all? The argument typically put forward for having agricultural price-support programs is so that America will have "a stable food supply." But cotton isn't food. Besides, worldwide demand for cotton is at record levels. Cotton prices are higher than they have been at any time since the Civil War. 
<p>	Like so many government programs, the cotton subsidy, originally intended to help small farmers, has turned into another special-interest boondoggle. Pat Roberts took a courageous stand against corporate special interests who have wrapped themselves over the years in federal largesse, and lost. 
<p>	Now the House Republican leadership should give the Budget Committee a shot at deciding whether American farmers will be set free to compete in world markets, or stay chained to the special interests.

<P>
INTRODUCTION
<P>
     Congress is expected soon to consider legislation to implement
the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT), the multilateral trade talks concluded successfully last
December. Among other provisions, the new pact for the first time
subjects trade in farm products to GATT's international trading rules.
(For a full discussion of the provisions of the Agriculture Agreement,
see Joe Cobb, "A Guide to the New GATT Agreement," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No. 985, May 5, 1994.) 
<P>
     This means that U.S. farmers will face substantially lower trade
barriers when trying to export their products. Under the agreement,
the signatories agreed that all existing non-tariff barriers
(including import quotas) must be converted to tariffs, and every
agricultural product must be allowed at least some minimum level of
access to their domestic markets under low or minimal tariff rates.
Countries that export farm products will be required to reduce the
volume of subsidized exports by 21 percent and the amount of the
subsidy by 36 percent over six years. The agreement also calls for
reduction of all domestic agricultural subsidies (such as U.S. farm
subsidies) tied to production of commodities and significant reduction
of all existing direct agricultural export subsidies. (Specific
changes in U.S. law required by the GATT agreement will have to be
made in the implementing legislation. Section 22 of the Agricultural
Adjustment Act, which provides authority to impose quotas if imports
are undercutting price support programs, will be repealed and replaced
with authority for tariff rate quotas. The implementing legislation
similarly curtails restrictions on imported peanuts, in addition to
limiting subsidized exports of government-held dairy stocks and
repealing the Meat Import Act.)
<P>
     Along with the new regional market opened up by the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the prospect of expanding
free trade arrangements involving the United States, (See Michael G.
Wilson, "Building on the NAFTA: Forging a Free Trade Agreement with
Chile," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 991, June 27, 1994.)
ratification of GATT will open up a potential marketplace of six
billion customers for U.S. farmers -- compared with the U.S. domestic
market of only 250 million people. 
<P>
     The ability of American farmers to seize the opportunity provided
by this vast new market, however, will depend upon changes in U.S.
farm policy. America possesses the most productive land resources and
advanced agricultural infrastructure in the world, yet U.S. farmers
have been unable to capitalize on these advantages. Even though world
consumption of food and agricultural products has increased
substantially since 1981, U.S. agricultural exports have decreased
overall, and exports of unprocessed agricultural commodities have
fallen (see chart on page 3).
<P>
     One obstacle that must be removed if U.S. farmers are to take
advantage of GATT is supply-control policies, specifically the annual
acreage reduction programs (ARPs) and the Conservation Reserve Program
(CRP). These programs have removed on average over 15 percent of U.S.
acreage from production annually and thus limited the opportunity of
farmers to export. To appreciate what this means, it is as though
government policies had shut down 15 percent of the U.S. computer
industry while the international market for computers is booming.
Meanwhile, agricultural producers in the rest of the world have
increased their production to fill the void created by reduced U.S.
production. These foreign producers have sold their products at a
lower price, thereby making the United States the "residual supplier,"
or the last seller to be chosen in most markets.
<P>
     Another obstacle that stands in the way of farmers taking
advantage of GATT is the Export Enhancement Program (EEP), which
subsidizes the dumping of U.S. agricultural products on the world
market. Although EEP was intended to make U.S. farm products more
competitive, the program is counterproductive. In fact, U.S. export
subsidies depress world prices while domestic prices remain high,
creating a price differential that has made the United States an
importer of some agricultural products. (This was demonstrated earlier
this year when U.S. supply control programs contributed to a short
supply of durum wheat -- a specialty crop used in making pasta
products -- leading to increased imports of Canadian wheat in order to
supply U.S. pastamakers.)
<P>
     The United States has an opportunity to reverse these policies
and restore the competitive position of American agriculture when
Congress considers the 1995 farm bill. Because farm policy is
reauthorized only every four or five years in the farm bill, next
year's bill will be the first opportunity to revise these policies to
take advantage of GATT.
<P>
     For U.S. farmers to benefit from the world market opened up by
GATT, Congress needs to incorporate the following changes in farm
legislation: (Additional changes needed in U.S. agricultural policy
will be addressed in future papers.)
<P>
Eliminate all acreage reduction or set-aside programs.
<P>
Modify the Conservation Reserve Program to include only highly
erodible acres.
<P>
Eliminate the Export Enhancement Program.
<P>
     The U.S. policy of unilaterally idling massive land resources
already has led to a significant loss in America's share of the
expanding world market. This has shrunk farmers' ability to earn
income from the marketplace, held back the development of agribusiness
infrastructure, and caused economic problems for many rural areas. By
eliminating acreage reduction programs and modifying the Conservation
Reserve Program, Congress could make sure that U.S. agriculture once
again becomes the leading force in the world export market by enabling
U.S. farmers to take advantage of the promised benefits of GATT's
trade liberalization and reform. And by eliminating the Export
Enhancement Program, the U.S. will no longer be employing a trade-
distorting practice that actually undermines the potential of certain
export markets.
<P>
     The enormous export potential of American agriculture has been
held back for years by federal policies that largely ignore the huge
world market. GATT makes that world market potentially even larger and
attractive to U.S. farmers. If the 1995 farm bill revamps policies so
that farmers can make full use of agriculture's productive capacity to
compete in the world's market, U.S. farm income will increase and the
rural economy will receive an enormous boost, creating jobs, producing
greater prosperity, and reinvigorating distressed communities. But if
the farm programs are not revised, rural America will stagnate while
other countries exploit the new markets opened up by GATT.
<P>
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR U.S. AGRICULTURE
<P>
     Implementing GATT will mark the beginning of a new era for world
agriculture and agricultural trade. Before the diplomatic breakthrough
which made the GATT agricultural agreement possible, trade
protectionism in agriculture was practiced throughout the world,
especially by such developed countries as the United States and the
nations of the European Union.
<P>
     This protectionism has not helped domestic producers, even in
developed countries. Explicit import restrictions, including quotas
and tariffs, and non-tariff trade barriers, such as unwarranted food
safety and quality regulations, merely have hindered the ability of
developing countries to penetrate the developed countries' markets. At
the same time, the United States and the European Union have been
waging a mutually destructive and trade-distorting bidding war, using
export subsidies to finance underpriced sales into the developing
countries. The costs of such distortions to agricultural production
and trade have been rising steadily while U.S. market share has
declined, as demonstrated in the chart on the preceeding page. The
GATT Uruguay Round agreement is significant because it reverses this
trend and reopens competition for markets based on productivity, not
protectionist policies.
<P>
     GATT will open up marketing opportunities for U.S. livestock
products throughout the world, including Japan and Europe (where
import barriers have been particularly restrictive). More
significantly, GATT will raise the incomes and standards of living in
the developing world because global economic expansion (the GATT
agreement is expected to expand the world economy by $6 trillion by
the turn of the century) will stimulate growth throughout the world.
This will lead in turn to more demand for higher-protein sources of
food. This trend is likely to be most pronounced in the fastest-
growing countries of Asia, Latin America, and Africa, where half the
population is under 15 years of age and the nutritional requirements
are greater than in older populations. By the end of this century, 60
percent of the world's population will be living in Asia, where
incomes are rising dramatically. And before the year 2050, it is
expected that world population will double and that, due to rising
standards of living, world food needs will triple. (Dennis T. Avery,
"Saving the Planet with High-Yield Farming," paper presented at The
Heritage Foundation's Agricultural Policy Roundtable, May 23, 1994.)  
<P>
     For U.S. farmers, this translates into an extraordinary
opportunity to increase the export of many agricultural commodities,
especially corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, rice, and livestock
products. There are also indirect opportunities due to a larger world
market. For instance, the new access into the fast-growing Asian
market for beef, pork, and poultry will mean increased domestic
consumption of grains by U.S. livestock. Thus, the U.S. grain sector
will benefit not only from direct sales of grain, but also from
greater sales of grain-fed livestock.
<P>
     Since U.S. agricultural productivity is rising faster than
domestic food demand, agriculture's well-being depends heavily on
international trade. If U.S. farmers manage to regain the competitive
edge internationally, the share of overall U.S. production going to
export will increase significantly; but if this historic opportunity
is lost because domestic farm policies hold back potential exports,
farming communities will suffer greatly.
<P>
     Existing U.S. agricultural policies already have hastened the
loss of much of the agricultural market in Western Europe. Rather than
concentrate their efforts on the daunting task of trying to regain
limited markets already lost, however, U.S. farmers stand to gain much
more from looking to the growing markets of the future. For instance,
farmers need to develop the Asian and Latin American markets and be
poised to move into Africa as that market awakens. U.S. agriculture is
now at a crossroads where it must use its advantageous position to
capture a greater share of these expanding markets stimulated by the
rising food needs of a growing population.
<P>
DOMESTIC BENEFITS OF GROWTH-ORIENTED PRODUCTION AND EXPORT POLICIES
<P>
     American farmers have much to gain if policies are amended to
take full advantage of GATT. First, however, U.S. policies will have
to be changed to raise output rather than curb it and to make prices
more competitive. U.S. farm programs today use non-recourse loans,
target prices, and deficiency payments to stabilize the income of
farmers producing certain commodities. "Non-recourse" means a farmer
can borrow money from the government on his harvested crop and then
either repay the loan and sell the crop or default on the loan and
forfeit the crop to the government. The farmer's credit rating is not
affected by his default, and the loan in reality is a minimum
guaranteed income from his crop. If a target price is established for
a particular commodity, the government pays the farmer a "deficiency
payment" (the difference between the target price and the average
market price) if the market price falls below that target. Again, this
means the farmer has a minimum guaranteed income.
<P>
     The loan rates also establish a floor under the commodity price
and signal to the rest of the world what a foreign producer must
charge for his product to beat the American price. Because the U. S.
product is usually the higher-priced product in the international
export market, buyers often turn to the U.S. market only after first
exhausting the supplies offered by other exporters.
<P>
     Increasing Farm Incomes. Periods of export growth historically
have been periods of large income gain for U.S. farmers. In the early
1970s, for example, U.S. grain exports doubled in just four years.
According to J.B. Penn, then Deputy Administrator for Economics at the
U.S. Department of Agriculture, "net farm income reached the highest
level since World War II and parts of the agricultural sector enjoyed
nearly unparalleled prosperity." (D. Gale Johnson, ed., "Food and
Agricultural Policy for the 1980's," American Enterprise Institute for
Public Policy Research, 1981.)
<P>
     In the 1980s, on the other hand, the United States priced itself
out of international markets by setting too high a floor under
commodity prices in the 1981 farm bill. That legislation provided
automatic increases in loan rates to reflect the double-digit
inflation the country was experiencing at the time. These rigid
minimum loan rates effectively established a minimum export price.
(Farm legislation sets loan rates for major commodities which
establish a floor under the commodity price by allowing the producer
to choose to sell his crop and repay the loan or forfeit his crop to
the government and keep the money. The 1981 farm bill established
these loan rates with automatic escalators, which ultimately exceeded
the inflation rate. Rather than selling their crop which conceivably
could then have found their way to an export outlet, most producers
forfeited their crops to the government and kept the government loan,
which was higher than the prevailing world market prices.) Foreign
competitors undersold these artificially high prices, and U.S. exports
fell. 
<P>
     Domestic commodity prices fell even lower because the resulting
stockpile of surplus commodities continued to depress the markets.
Recognizing that the automatically escalating loan rates in the 1981
farm bill priced American agricultural producers out of the export
market, Congress provided flexibility to decrease loan rates in the
1985 farm bill. 
<P>
     Unfortunately, new mistakes were made in the 1985 farm bill.
Target prices were kept relatively high, which meant that U.S. farmers
became dependent on the federal government for an even greater share
of income. Rather than dealing with this budget concern directly, the
1985 farm bill called for a greater reliance on the use of acreage
reduction programs to control costs and created the Conservation
Reserve Program (CRP), also intended to reduce production available
for program eligibility, despite the fact that attempting to bolster
domestic farm prices by restricting supply severely limits the export
potential of U.S. farmers. Thus, after gaining a growing share of
world grain usage in the 1970s, U.S. farmers saw that share fall
significantly after the return to supply management policies in the
early 1980s.
<P>
     As in any other sector of the economy, a farm policy designed to
raise farm incomes should promote growth in world consumption and try
to capture a larger share of that consumption for U.S. exporters.
Fuller and more efficient use of production resources is the key to
this since it lowers unit costs and increases export revenues. In
short, greater and more efficient production increases total volume
and widens the margin of profit.
<P>
     A recent study commissioned by the National Grain and Feed
Foundation indicates that returning 38 million idled acres to
production could increase gross farm revenue by $8 billion and net
farm income by $4 billion. (Abel, Daft and Earley, an economic
analysis consulting firm, located in Alexandria, Virginia, conducted a
study on behalf of the U.S. Agriculture 20/20 Project of The National
Grain and Feed Foundation. The study "Large-Scale Land Idling Has
Retarded Growth of U.S. Agriculture," was released in May 1994.)
Taxpayers also would benefit from such increased production because
farmers would receive a greater share of their income from the
marketplace rather than from the federal government -- which for the
last 10 years has spent an average of some $14 billion annually on
commodity programs (see the above chart).
<P>
     Reinvigorating the Rural Economy. The federal government's supply
control policies have a widespread impact on the entire U.S. economy.
Stagnant economic activity in the U.S. agricultural sector leads to a
loss of jobs not just in farming, but also in the supply, processing,
and marketing industries. In addition, agribusinesses reduce their
investments of capital needed to replace obsolete equipment and fully
utilize technological advancements. This hits major businesses
producing such items as heavy farm equipment. Moreover, without
capital investment, the United States cannot be a dominant force in
processing and selling agricultural products internationally. 
<P>
     Changes in U.S. agricultural policy that stimulate greater
output, on the other hand, will give agribusiness the incentive to
invest in greater economic efficiency. Such a growth-oriented policy
would restore the United States as the world's premier farm producer
and exporter. It also would revive the vast and valuable agricultural
infrastructure, much of which -- though still surpassing that of other
countries -- has been allowed to deteriorate during the past decade. A
free market revolution thus would bring economic growth to rural
communities, generating jobs in businesses that provide inputs to
farmers and that process and market their crops. This expanded
economic activity could generate hundreds of thousands of jobs,
providing a much-needed boost to the rural economy.
<P>
     Increasing agricultural production also would have an impact on
the rest of the American economy. A multiplier effect would spread the
benefits of increased production from producers to processors and
distributors and would include the seed, fertilizer, chemical,
transportation, equipment manufacturing and construction industries.
Thus, the study commissioned by the National Grain and Feed Foundation
concludes that returning 38 million acres to production would not
merely boost farm income by $4 billion, but could "increase national
income by $28.9 billion annually and generate over 225,000 more full-
time jobs." (Ibid.)
<P>
A PRO-GROWTH FARM BILL IN 1995
<P>
     Ten years ago, the one significant reform in the 1985 farm bill
was based on a recognition that the United States, if it was to be a
successful agriculture exporter, had to allow farm prices to be
competitive. The 1995 farm bill could build on this by enabling
farmers to capture the benefits of agricultural trade reform.
<P>
     In order to capitalize on the future expansion of world trade,
the 1995 farm bill must promote and reward growth. The United States
produces more agricultural products than it can consume domestically,
and the gap between its production potential and its domestic demand
base is widening. Agricultural productivity will continue to advance
because of biotechnological breakthroughs and the use of such new
technologies as "site specific production." (When site-specific
production becomes available for commercial use, producers will be
able to use this satellite technology to maximize production by
applying the optimum amount of seed, fertilizer, and nutrients per
acre of cultivation.) 
<P>
     The first goal of the 1995 farm bill thus must be to enhance U.S.
agriculture's position as a competitive exporter. In an increasingly
competitive market, it is the low-cost producer that will capture new
markets and the resultant income. But supply controls and export
subsidies inhibit U.S. agriculture's ability to exploit its
competitive position. Specifically, in order to achieve a pro-growth
agricultural policy and realize the benefits that will flow from such
a policy, the following actions must be taken in the 1995 farm bill:
<P>
Eliminate all acreage reduction (ARP) or set-aside programs. 
<P>
     U.S. agricultural policy uses subsidy programs that rely
generally on supply control mechanisms instead of the market to
maintain farm income. For most of this decade, the United States has
been the only major farm producer to follow a policy of deliberately
idling productive land. More recently, the U.S. has persuaded the
European Union to begin similar supply control policies. This policy
does more than physically limit the amount of product available for
export, it also undermines the competitiveness of U.S. farm products
overseas because fixed production costs are spread across fewer
producing acres. This raises the farmer's cost of production per
bushel and leaves the established network of agricultural supply,
servicing, and processing industries to operate at a reduced capacity,
which raises handling costs and discourages maintenance and
reinvestment. Moreover, land idling tends to reduce demand for -- and
lower the prices of -- such things as seeds and fertilizers. When
these are exported because of limits on domestic production, the
result is lower production costs for America's competitors, who wisely
do not limit production.
<P>
Modify the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). 
<P>
     The CRP, authorized by the 1985 farm bill, was intended to target
erodible croplands for removal from production and to encourage
conservation. It now includes over 36 million acres on which
landowners receive rental payments under ten-year contracts in return
for removing the land from production. Much of this acreage actually
is highly productive land that, through utilization of readily
available conservation practices, is not vulnerable to unacceptable
erosion. The CRP contracts will begin to expire in 1995, and about
two-thirds will expire by 1997. A modified CRP should include only
highly erodible acres. Based upon USDA's land capability
classification system, about 22 million of the acres enrolled in the
CRP are in the top land capability classes with relatively low
erodibility. Only 4 million are highly erodible, while the remaining
10 million are of debatable erodibility.
<P>
     In the last twelve years, acreage reduction programs and the
Conservation Reserve Program have removed a total of almost 650
million acres from production. This would cover an area about four
times the size of Texas and is some 45 percent greater than the total
area of U.S. cropland annually under production, which is
approximately 450 million acreas (see the chart on the preceeding
page).
<P>
Eliminate the Export Enhancement Program (EEP). 
<P>
     The EEP pays exporters to dump agricultural products on the world
market at discounted prices by providing the exporter a dollar subsidy
price for specified quantities of commodities to be exported. Since
its inception, the EEP has been used primarily on grains. Previously,
the EEP was provided in the form of bonus commodities from CCC stocks.
Then, at least, the program added to exportable supplies. Now, even
that marginal benefit has disappeared.
<P>
     Such a program cannot be justified in a post-Uruguay Round world.
For one thing, the GATT agreement requires governments to cut back
such subsidies. For another, because export subsidies tend to
encourage sales of certain commodities by making the purchase of those
commodities relatively attractive, regardless of actual demand, they
distort markets to the disadvantage of the exporter with the greatest
growth potential, which is the United States. Because the EEP allows
the United States to continue temporarily to export products based on
an artificial stimulus rather than on real demand, it makes the U.S.
agricultural system sluggish and unresponsive and wastes resources
that could be used better elsewhere. 
<P>
     Continued use of export subsidies will serve only to depress
world grain and oilseed prices while distorting buyer-seller
relationships between countries. The elimination of export subsidies
on grain in particular would improve the global competitiveness not
only of grain, but also of oilseeds and livestock produced in the
United States.
<P>
     If these changes in U.S. farm policy are made, U.S. producers
will be the best positioned to serve growing world demand. By using
the natural advantages that enable it to be the low-cost producer, the
United States once again can become a successful exporter of
agricultural products.
<P>
OBSTACLES TO REFORM
<P>
     These reforms will not happen automatically, however. Certain
sectors of U.S. agriculture, such as the National Association of Wheat
Growers, National Cotton Council, and National Farmers Union, do not
seem to recognize the economic and job-creating opportunities created
by the new global marketplace. They believe that GATT will make U.S.
farmers more vulnerable to competition from imports. In fact, in
hearings held this past summer, a number of commodity and farm groups
claimed that GATT reforms will make it even more important to keep
present farm programs with little or no change in order to protect
U.S. agriculture from competition. (The House Agriculture Subcommittee
on General Farm Commodities held hearings in June and July of 1994 to
review the general outlook for the farm economy and commodity
programs.)
<P>
     Such reluctance to change is natural, since very few farmers have
ever known anything other than a system of subsidies and supply
controls. But if this siege mentality prevails, it will condemn U.S.
agriculture to stagnation while other countries enjoy the fruits of
new markets. Fortunately, in a recent survey of readers conducted by
Top Producer magazine, when asked their opinion of a proposal to
reform farm programs that would eliminate deficiency payments and set-
asides, 26 percent responded favorably. Although 31 percent were
opposed, 34 percent were interested but said they needed more
information. (Top Producer, opinion survey, conducted in February and
March 1994.) Some farmers evidently recognize that dependence on
government subsidies also subjects them to a lackluster future.
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     Entrepreneurial farmers and agricultural groups should join
forces with those agribusiness concerns that led the fight for NAFTA
and GATT. Much of agribusiness understands the economic benefits of
agricultural trade liberalization and reform. Through past experience
with short supply situations, they have learned that supply controls
and export subsidies undermine their ability to do business, both here
and abroad, and to provide jobs and prosperity in rural America. 
<P>
     A strong voice for a future based on opportunity, not
protectionism, is needed now more than ever. U.S. agriculture faces an
historic opportunity, as a result of NAFTA and GATT reforms, to
reestablish its preeminence in the world export market. If Congress
takes the actions necessary to establish America's position as the
world leader in meeting the growing demands of this new market, the
result will be decades of prosperity ahead for farmers and greater
economic growth and stability in rural America. 
<P>
     The 1995 farm bill provides the opportunity to make the necessary
changes in agricultural policy. Four or five more years likely will
pass before farm legislation is considered again. By then, farmers in
the rest of the world already will have taken advantage of the
opportunity to meet the demands of the global marketplace. Thus, if
this opportunity is missed, rural America will face a future of
continued economic stagnation.

<P>
CONGRESS DECIDING FUTURE OF AMERICA'S FARMERS
<P>
By John Frydenlund
<P>
 
<P>
 Everyone who buys food or pays federal taxes should be interested
in the coming congressional battle over the 1995 farm bill. The
issue is simple: Whether Congress will unleash the unrivaled productive
power of U.S. agriculture or keep U.S. farmers plodding along
under a tired, worn-out farm program created during the Great
Depression.
<P>
 The right decision could produce significant savings for both
consumers and taxpayers, while producing an estimated $35 billion
windfall for rural America.
<P>
 Gradually doing away with the current farm program over a five
year period -- and letting farmers produce for customers around
the world without interference from Washington -- is the way to
get there. The farm bill is the place to start.
<P>
 The prospect of generating $35 billion worth of new farm income
ought to be a powerful incentive for Congress to act, especially
considering how the new prosperity would be spread throughout
the country, according to a detailed computer model we put together
at The Heritage Foundation to measure the impact of phasing out
the farm program.
<P>
 While all states would benefit in the long-run, from California
to Florida, the greatest short-term benefits would be seen in
the midwest farm belt.  Five heartland states -- Colorado, Kansas,
 Missouri, Nebraska, and South Dakota -- would receive a healthy
$5.7 billion chunk of the increased farm income. This is after
factoring in added production costs and decreased &quot;deficiency
payments&quot; in which the government pays farmers the difference
between the market price and a government-imposed &quot;target
price&quot; or loan rate, whichever is smaller. By the way, the
following figures are for net income after the end of all federal
deficiency payments:
<P>
 * Colorado -- The Centennial State's wheat and corn producers
would see an $82 million increase by 2000, and a total of $1.05
billion more by 2005.
<P>
 * Kansas -- The Jayhawk State's wheat, corn, oats, barley and
soybean growers would receive $158 million in added net income
by the year 2000, and a cumulative total of more than $2.5 billion
by 2005.
<P>
 * Missouri -- Thanks to increased farm production nationwide,
the Show Me State's food processors, as well as Missourians growing
corn, soybeans and wheat, would enjoy $43 million in added net
income in five years, and $709 million by 2005.
<P>
 * Nebraska -- Farm machinery producers would share $25 million
in added net income by 2000 with ranchers and grain producers
in the Cornhusker State. By 2005, the state's farm sector  would
have received nearly $1 billion in increased income.
<P>
 * South Dakota -- Oat, flax seed, sunflower seed and rye growers
here would receive $21 million in added net income by 2000, and
more than $546 million total by 2005.
<P>
 Texas is another big winner. By 2000, the Lone Star State's wheat,
cotton, rice and peanut producers would see a $13 million increase,
but by 2005 the total would skyrocket to $1.08 billion.
<P>
 With such a cornucopia available, one naturally wonders why farmers
failed to reap such benefits before now? The answer is because
the United States has never weaned itself off the current system,
which was created in the 1930s to protect farmers from the volatility
of a Depression-era marketplace.
<P>
 Reform opponents are defending a costly, bureaucratic maze of
special interest subsidies, deficiency payments, price supports,
acreage allotments and red tape. Everybody but the politicians,
Department of Agriculture bureaucrats and a few richly favored
farmers will be big losers if Congress protects this creaky relic.
<P>
 This is because under the current farm program 65 percent of
all federal farm payments go to a mere 16 percent of farmers,
those with gross annual sales of $100,000 or more. Small farmers
-- those who sell less than $10,000 worth of farm products each
year -- receive only 5 percent of the payments.
<P>
  Worst of all, the current system forces farmers to plan, invest
and plant as if their only customers are the 250 million consumers
here in America, thus ignoring a growing worldwide food market
of 6 billion hungry people beyond the United States.
<P>
 If our farmers were instead free to plan for the near doubling
population and rising living standards in Asia, Africa and Latin
America in coming years -- where demand for food is expected to
triple -- there is no telling how much prosperity could be ahead.
<P>
 Members of Congress should understand that, if the 1995 farm
bill begins the process of eliminating government subsidies and
controls, America's farmers will be able to out-produce and outsell
the rest of the world, with the expanded production fueling tremendous
increases in farm income and in farm-related businesses. If Congress
keeps the subsidies and controls, farm prosperity will wither
on the vine for years to come.

<hr>
<h2>Abolishing the Department of Education In Order to Liberate Parents and Schools</h2><p>
<h3>A Joint Statement by Former Secretaries of Education</h3><br>
<h3>Lamar Alexander and William J. Bennett</h3><p>
<i><b>Delivered before the House Economic and Educational 
Opportunities Committee, Subcommittee on Oversight and 
Investigation</i></b><br>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: <p>
 
It is a particular pleasure for us to address this Committee with its 
new name, new majority and new chairman. Thank you for the 
opportunity to set forth our views on the federal role in education. 
You have an extraordinary opportunity to change the course of 
history in this domain. <p>
 
In this statement we outline a fundamental transformation; namely, 
reversing the direction of a mighty river that, for the past thirty 
years, has flowed in the direction of Washington, D.C. We have 
long been convinced that this river -- of responsibility, authority and 
accountability for American education -- should instead flow 
toward our families, schools, communities and states we sketch in 
this statement, and the principles on which they rest, are not new 
for us, for the Presidents we have served, or for many more of our 
fellow Republicans. What has changed is that it is finally within the 
capacity of the Congress to put them into action. <p>
 

<center><h3>What's Gone Wrong </h3></center><p>
 
The federal education apparatus illustrates what has gone awry in 
Washington over the past several decades. The national government 
has become meddlesome, intrusive and bullying. It now impedes 
more than it fosters. Much of what it mandates or encourages is 
misguided. It keeps people from doing what they know is right for 
their children, communities and states. It substitutes the rules of 
distant bureaucrats for the on-site knowledge of parents and 
teachers. And, particularly in the last several years, it has begun to 
lift from our communities the sense that they are responsible for the 
renewal and reform of American education and to suggest, instead, 
that Washington knows best and is taking charge. <p>
 
We and Presidents Reagan and Bush did all we could to reverse the 
flow, place the emphasis on states and communities, promote 
flexibility and choice, forge a true partnership with the governors, 
end discrimination against individuals without preferential treatment 
for any group, and halt Washington's growing regulatory apparatus. 
But every such effort was rebuffed by the Democratic Congress -- 
now aided and abetted by the Clinton administration -- which has 
pressed relentlessly in the opposite direction, encouraged in this 
endeavor by education's myriad special interest groups. <p>
 
To anyone who thinks we exaggerate, we recommend reading the 
full texts of Goals 2000 and "H.R.6", the administration's two main 
education bills -- particularly as these were finally enacted by the 
103rd Congress. Especially when they are taken in combination, it 
becomes plain that their authors 'want to substitute decisions made 
in Washington for decisions made by individual households and 
communities. They transform what had been a national movement 
into a federal program. They create new governance structures and 
regulatory mechanisms at both national and state levels. They use 
federal funding in a deceptive way that is designed to elicit the 
behaviors that other parts of the legislation declare to be 
"voluntary". They throw obstacles onto such promising reform 
pathways as school choice and private management of public 
schools. They strip the bi-partisan National Assessment Governing 
Board of much of its independence. And they do all this while pretending otherwise, by wrapping themselves in rhetoric of 
"helping" education and pasting friendly-sounding titles on the 
cover (H.R.6 was dubbed the "Improving America's Schools Act") 
while in reality their contents were written by and for lobbyists and 
interest groups to whom the skills and knowledge of children are 
not the top priority. <p>
 
Federal education policy has been moving in this direction since 
1965. It took a breather, at least within the executive branch 
between 1981 and 1992, but the past two years have seen the pent-
up "governmentalism" of that decade unleashed upon the land. For 
a time we supposed that it was possible to have a national 
education reform project that worked like a true and durable 
partnership and did not evolve into another rule-bound federal 
program. The last two years have proven us wrong. In addition to 
Goals 2000 and H.R.6, we have seen the executive branch give 
blanket endorsement to scholarships based on race; take the heat 
off those who would use "diversity" as a criterion for accreditation; 
propose the race-norming of state assessment results; and persecute 
states that employ test-based standards for high school graduation. 
It's now clear that the federal government will eventually break 
whatever it touches. Rather than tinker around the margins, 
therefore, the time has come for a great and thorough change. <p>
 

<center><h3>A Different Philosophy </center></h3><p>
 
The essential part of our proposal is not its particulars but the four 
principles on which it rests. It is these, above all, that we commend 
to the Committee's consideration. One can adjust the details that 
follow. Any comprehensive overhaul based on these principles, 
however, will represent fundamental redirection -- and an historic 
accomplishment, worth the new Congress. <p>
 
First, education in America is the constitutional responsibility of the 
states the social responsibility of communities, and the moral 
responsibility of families. <p>
 
Second, except when the civil rights of individuals are menaced, the 
federal government should never impede the capacity of families, 
teachers, communities and states to decide how best to provide 
education to their children, and should never substitute its judgment 
for theirs. <p>
 
Third, goals, standards, assessments, the dissemination of 
information and ideas, and the encouragement of bold innovation 
are legitimate leadership and "bully pulpit" activities of national 
officials, but they must always be truly voluntary on the part of 
states and communities. Nor should federal funds be used as 
"carrots" or "sticks" in ways that effectively diminish state and local 
control. <p>


Fourth, insofar as the federal government is engaged at all in the 
field of education, it should dedicate itself to (a) fostering family 
responsibility and local control; (b) assisting states to fulfill their 
responsibilities as they see fit; (c) providing sound statistics, prompt 
and accurate assessment results and other information; and (d) 
safeguarding individuals from illegal discrimination. <p>
 

<center><h3>Repairing Recent Damage </center></h3><p>

In the 1,200 or so pages of the Goals 2000 and H.R.6 legislation 
enacted last year is considerable mischief that should immediately 
be defunded and then repealed. Ten leading candidates include: <p>
 
1. The National Education Standards and Improvement Council -- 
the "national school board" that is so vivid a symbol of education 
wrong-think in Washington, and the new state panels mandated by 
Goals 2000. Our states and communities have all the governments 
they need; they don't need new decision-making structures designed 
in Washington. <p>
 
2. Federal ''certification'' of national and state education standards 
and federal approval of state and local education reform plans. 
Those controversial new standards should make their own way 
through the marketplace of ideas without any federal "seal of 
approval." Nor do federal bureaucrats have any business second-
guessing state and local priorities for school reform. <p>
 
3. Prohibitions and disincentives for state/local testing programs 
and accountability systems. Among the most dismaying features of 
Goals 2000 (and recent actions by the Office for Civil Rights) is the 
effort to discourage the very tests that might actually encourage our 
students to learn more -- and give parents and taxpayers better 
information. <p>
4. New "gender equity" programs. The last thing we need is the 
federal government telling America's 15,000 communities how to 
teach little boys and little girls about one another -- or mandating 
how teachers are to handle such matters. Nor do we need a new 
"special assistant for gender equity" to enforce such mandates. <p>
 
5. Federal regulation of schools' weapons policies and sex 
education. That's why we have parents, teachers, principals and 
school boards. <p>
 
6. All references to "opportunity to learn" standards. If the 
experience of American education these past thirty years has taught 
us anything, it's the importance of maintaining a laser-like focus on 
student achievement and of creating accountability systems that are 
based on school results. The recent legislation deflects attention 
back toward such "inputs" as spending levels, class size, and 
degrees conferred by colleges of education -- and invites even more 
litigation based on such spurious gauges while discouraging true 
accountability for schools, teachers and students. <p>


7. Disincentives for states and localities that want to try such 
reforms as vouchers, charter schools and privatization. If we are 
ever to transform American education, we must give families -- 
especially poor families -- the right to choose their children's 
schools from among all the schools in their communities; give 
communities opportunities to create "break the mold schools" that 
are not regulated to death by the bureaucracy; and invite the private 
sector to help interested communities create the best schools in the 
world. Yet the recent legislation places obstacles in the path of 
states and communities that want to try such things. -What sort of 
choice program allows the sending" school to deny children the 
right to leave? The sort enacted in H.R.6. <p>
 
8. Extension of Davis-Bacon provisions to school construction and 
renovation. That means a principal in Moline who wants to hire a 
contractor to rewire his school for new computers must pay the 
prevailing union wage rather than getting the job done for the 
lowest cost. It's a big favor for the unions, but no favor at all for 
schools, efficiency or economy. <p>
 
9. The addition of two more national goals to the original six. 
Parent involvement and teacher training are fine, but goals should 
be limited to specific, measurable results, such as President Bush 
and the Governors (including then-governor Bill Clinton) 
established in Charlottesville. <p>
 
10. Weakening the National Assessment Governing Board. Our 
best source of reliable student achievement data at the national and 
state levels is the National Assessment of Educational Progress, the 
integrity of which depends on the absolute independence and 
complete policy control of its Governing Board. H.R.6 undermined 
that board, giving greater influence to education interest groups and 
to a sluggish federal bureaucracy that is easily politicized. <p>
 

<center><h3>Reasons for Devolution</center></h3><p>
 
Mr. Chairman, here is the heart of our proposal for the long term: 
the Congress should take every single activity currently housed in 
the Department of Education and do one of three things with it: (a) 
send it home to the states and communities; (b) entrust it to another 
federal agency that is suited to conduct it in harmony with related 
activities; or (c) abolish it on grounds that the federal government 
can no longer afford to spend money on programs that have 
outlived their usefulness or that can be handled satisfactorily by 
others. We will not endeavor here to fill in every detail or answer 
each question that might be asked about this far-reaching 
recommendation, but the examples that follow indicate its main 
features. <p>
 
<center><h3>Sending responsibility home </center></h3><p>
 
* Virtually all major programs assisting elementary/secondary 
education should be combined into a "block" and returned to the 
states and communities. This can be accomplished in several ways: 
the best, in our judgment, is a "responsibility swap" whereby the 
states assume full responsibility for education in return for federal 
assumption of other burdens now borne by the states; or a resource 
base transfer in which some federal tax is reduced by an amount 
equivalent to the programs in question, thereby leaving it to state 
and communities to raise and deploy these revenues as they see fit. 
A third approach is a no-strings "block grant" of federal fund to the 
state, though we like this least because of the well-known tendency 
of block grants to grow strings as time passes. <p>
 
The core of this block are programs under the headings of 
"education reform" (including goals 2000), school improvement, 
education for the disadvantaged, bilingual education, and vocational 
and adult education -- approximately $10 billion in all. That means 
upwards of a billion dollars a year for a big state like California and 
about $200 million for a smaller one like Tennessee, funds that the 
state and its communities would be free to spend it for any 
educational purpose, including such innovations as charter schools 
and vouchers. (The distribution formula can retain the equity-
conscious fiscal effects of today's programs.) The federal 
government would no longer define legitimate education reform, 
nor would states and communities have to submit their plans to 
Washington for approval. <p>
 
We will leave it to the budget-and-appropriations process to 
determine whether the block should equal the sum of its antecedent 
programs, but we note that a number of governors have made clear 
their willingness to endure a funding reduction in return for the 
freedom to deploy the remainder as their states see fit. We also note 
that eliminating the heavy overhead and "middleman" costs of 
current categorical programs (at both federal and state levels) will 
concentrate more resources on teaching and learning. <p>
 
A block grant to the states should also combine a number of the 
smaller higher education programs, with the exception of the main 
student financial aid programs. These deserve serious consultation 
with the governors and persons knowledgeable about higher 
education and finance. Today, one out of two college students in 
America has a federal grant or loan, and helping needy students 
attend college is a national function worth preserving. But these 
programs are poorly managed, needlessly costly, and full of 
middlemen, each of which takes its cut. In the near term, we 
recommend transferring the main student aid programs to a federal 
agency with greater competence in handling complex financial 
transactions with millions of individuals (and in collecting what is 
owed the government). An obvious candidate is the Treasury 
Department, with its Internal Revenue Service. Over the longer 
term, additional student aid strategies should be fully explored, 
including devolution to the states and privatization. <p>
 
* Special education and rehabilitation services also warrant 
consultation with the governors. This is by far the largest 
"unfunded" education mandate, i.e. federal regulations require the 
expenditure by states and localities of many billions more than the 
federal aid provided. It would, therefore, be reasonable to 
incorporate these programs into the main elementary/secondary 
block grant. Alternatively, they could become a smaller block grant 
of their own. (Total current value: approximately $5.7 billion.) Or 
these programs could be transferred to the Department of Health 
and Human Services. <p>


We want to be clear on this point: protection of the civil rights of 
disabled individuals would remain a federal responsibility, to be 
carried out by the Justice Department. <p>
 

<center><h3>Transfers </center></h3><p>
 
* All civil rights enforcement would move to the Justice 
Department, with the admonition that it be vigorously carried out 
when discrimination against individuals is involved, but not used as 
a tool for granting or withholding rights and benefits on the basis of 
group membership. <p>
 
The gathering, analysis and reporting of education statistics would 
be placed under the jurisdiction of the National Education Goals 
Panel, consisting of governors, legislators, members of Congress 
and senior officials of the executive branch. Assessment of student 
achievement at the international, national and state levels would 
become the unambiguous responsibility of a rehabilitated National 
Assessment Governing Board, overseen in turn by the Goals Panel. <p>
 
* As noted above, any student aid programs not devolved to the 
states would move to a fiscal agency such as the Treasury 
Department, while any special education and rehabilitation 
programs not turned over to the states would move to the 
Department of Health and Human Services. <p>
 
* Indian education programs would be transferred to the Interior 
Department. <p>
 
A small number of federal programs that assist specialized 
institutions (e.g. Gallaudet College, Howard University) and are 
now the responsibility of the Education Department deserve 
scrutiny to see whether the present subsidy arrangements should 
continue. Insofar as they do, any of a number of executive branch 
agencies can oversee future resource transfers. <p>
 
<center><h3>Abolition </center></h3><p>
 
The Education Department currently manages about 250 separate 
programs. Perhaps fifty of these have entirely outlived their 
usefulness, or support activities that the federal government could 
beneficially stop subsidizing, or provide marginal aid for activities 
that are fundamentally the responsibility of others but have been 
maintained as federal "categorical" programs due to the strength of 
special interest lobbies. Such programs should be abolished or "de-
funded" and the savings returned to federal taxpayers. (We estimate 
these at $2 to 3 billion annually, i.e. as much as $15 billion over five 
years.) We will not here provide a complete list, but illustrative 
examples include federal technical assistance centers of several 
kinds, regional "educational laboratories," library support programs, 
literacy programs for prisoners, women's educational equity, law 
school clinical experience, Olympic scholarships and "star schools." <p>


Savings would also result from dismantling the regulatory 
infrastructure, including most of the costs of Education Department 
management (about $444 million) and the National Education 
Standards and Improvement Council. <p>
 

<center><h3>Structural Implications </center></h3><p>
 
Inasmuch as adoption of our substantive recommendations would 
leave  The Department of Education with nothing to do, there 
would be no need to retain it. <p>
 
Although any "news" coming out of our testimony may be that 
"two former education secretaries urge abolition of department they 
once headed," let us be clear that we did not come before the 
Committee to recommend a label change or symbolic beheading. <p>
 
Today's Department of Education has two essential failings. First, it 
has come to contain bad ideas, harmful practices, needless 
expenditures, obsolete programs, dysfunctional regulations and the 
depredations of special interests that care more about the well-
being of education's "producers" than for its "consumers." <p>
 
Second, it has an irresistible and uncontrollable impulse to stick its 
nose into areas where it has no proper business. Most of what it 
does today is no legitimate affair of the federal government. The 
Education Department operates from the deeply erroneous belief 
that American parents, teachers, communities and states are too 
stupid to raise their own children, run their own schools and make 
their own decisions. <p> 
Abolishing the Department will accomplish little if its meddlesome 
ways are transferred intact to another federal bureaucracy. Indeed, 
such a shift could even be harmful to the extent that it serves to 
"hide" those activities in less visible locations. In our view, the way 
to think about the Education Department is first in terms of what it 
does, then in terms of its structure and status. <p>
 
Because we believe that each of the Department's activities that is 
worth preserving in some form could better be handled elsewhere, 
we see no need for a separate federal education agency of any kind. <p>
 
Our purpose is not to reduce the attention that the nation pays to 
education. Indeed, there's never been a time in our history when 
education was more important -- or more in need of a complete 
overhaul. Whether one is concerned with developing virtue in the 
young, preparing tomorrow's adults for life in the information age, 
widening the shared core knowledge base of a diverse population, 
strengthening our economic competitiveness or enabling poor 
people to move from the back of the line to the front, we have few 
assets of greater value than effective education. <p>


"National leadership" can be helpful in focusing people on problems 
and opportunities. We look to the President, with the help of an 
education advisor housed in the White House, to the National 
Education Goals Panel to ensure that the national project of 
educational renewal continues apace. But true leadership means 
energizing people and communities change, not shackling them with 
mandates and regulations -- and calling it leadership. We do not 
need a raft of federal programs. We do not need a giant 
bureaucracy. We do not need a federal department. What we need 
is a national movement. We are convinced that the-- prospects for 
such a movement -- and for real educational renewal in America -- 
will be far brighter when the Congress signals unmistakably and 
irrevocably that responsibility rests with teachers and parents, with 
communities and states, not with federal bureaucrats. <p>
 
Reversing the flow of this river is no small undertaking. But it 
would do immeasurable good for our children, our schools, our 
communities and our future. <p>

<TITLE> Candidates for Rescission in the FY 1995 Education Budget  -- Heritage </TITLE>

        A Special Report to the Appropriations Committees
<P>
<H3> CANDIDATES FOR RESCISSION IN THE FY 1995              
            EDUCATION BUDGET
</H3>

Committee Brief #7<br>
          (published at 3 pages, February 24, 1995)
<P>
</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>

 
     We are here today to determine ways to cut the 1995 education
budget. Let me say at the outset that, despite rhetoric to the contrary, only
a very small percentage of the over $31 billion the federal government
spends on education ever actually makes it into America's classrooms. Most
of the Department of Education's budget and programs go to fund technical
assistance, clearinghouses, information, and specific programs that educators
in our states and communities neither need nor want. I spend a good amount
of my time working with educators in these states and communities. When
asked what the federal government and the U.S. Congress can do to improve
their schools, they overwhelmingly reply, "Leave us alone!"
<P>
     Federal funding for education has tripled in constant dollars from
1965 to the present. Student performance, by contrast, has declined over the
same period. Clearly, additional federal spending on education is not the
answer. Yet, the Clinton Administration, in its 1995 budget, sought $26.1
billion in discretionary budget authority, a $1.7 billion increase over last
year. Similarly, the Administration sought $5.6 billion for mandatory
programs, an increase of $1.1 billion over the $4.5 billion spent in 1994.
They sought a total increase in budget authority from $28.8 billion to $31.7
billion, an increase of $2.8 billion or 9.9 percent.
<P>
     The appropriation for the Department of Education has more than
doubled in the last fourteen years from around $15 billion to over $31
billion. From 1981-1992, the amount the U.S. Congress appropriated for the
Department of Education was actually greater than the amounts that
Presidents Reagan and Bush requested in their budgets every single year.
Since President Clinton has taken office, the President's request for the
Department of Education has exceeded the appropriation. It is also
interesting to note that the amount spent by the Department of Education for
post-secondary education (programs that include student loans, Pell Grants,
research grants, etc.) was greater than the amount spent on elementary and
secondary education from 1981-1990. This was because the original role of
the federal government in education was to ensure access to post-secondary
education and to fund research programs. The Clinton Administration has
reversed this historical breakdown and now spends more on elementary and
secondary education than on post-secondary education. This is unfortunate
since a greater percentage of federal spending on post-secondary education
actually helps individual students gain access to education. By contrast, most
of the federal money spent on elementary and secondary education goes to
fund the education bureaucracies and comes with burdensome mandates to
the state and local education agencies. Students benefit only from a very
small percentage of federal government spending on elementary and
secondary education.
<P>
     The goal of the 104th Congress, both in rescissions for the 1995
budget and in authorizations for future years, must be to evaluate each and
every one of the over 240 Department of Education categorical programs
(up from 140 programs in 1980) and determine whether these programs
actually improve the education of our children. The Congress also must
consolidate effective programs, eliminate ineffective programs, and stop
funding programs that benefit bureaucracies. To meet these ends, Congress
should make the following specific reforms:
<P>
End Several Programs. The Clinton Administration proposed cutting 34
categorical programs from the Department of Education. The 103rd
Congress cut only 13 of the programs. The 104th Congress should start by
rescinding funding for the remaining programs, including: the Ellender
Fellowships (Close-Up Foundation), Education for Native Hawaiians,
Foreign Language Assistance, Consumer and Homemaking Education, State
Student Incentive Grants, the Dwight D. Eisenhower Leadership Program,
Cooperative Education, Assistance to Guam, College Housing and Academic
Facilities Loan Program, Public Library Construction, Library Literacy
Programs, Library Education and Training, Library Research and
Demonstrations, Foreign Periodicals Program, Impact Aid 3(b) Payments,
Educational Partnerships Program, Immigrant Education, Dropout Prevention
Demonstrations, Vocational Education Community Based Organizations, and
Civics Education.
<P>
Change Recently Enacted Programs. There were four major education
programs either created or reauthorized in 1993 and 1994. All of these
programs, including Goals 2000: Educate America Act, reauthorization of
federal elementary and secondary programs in the Improving America's
Schools Act, the Federal Direct Student Loan program, and the National
Service Trust Act of 1993 should be revisited.
<P>
Goals 2000: Educate America Act
President Clinton proposed spending $700 million in 1995 for Goals 2000,
an increase of $595 million over the 1994 level. He called for $1 billion a
year for this program, to continue indefinitely, beginning in fiscal year 1996.
Congress appropriated $403.4 million, up 298.4 percent from the $105
million appropriated in 1994. The Clinton Administration claims that states
must distribute 85 percent of their Goals 2000 grants to local educational
agencies which must then use the money to "create and implement content,
performance, and opportunity-to-learn standards in academic areas, improve
professional development and licensure, and improve curricula and teaching
practices in individual schools." Goals 2000 funds go to three new
educational bureaucracies: the National Education Goals Panel, the National
Education Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC), and a National
Skills Standards Board. None of these activities, despite rhetoric to the
contrary, will improve local schools. Many of these activities are merely
new mandates put on the states and localities. This ineffective program will
become much larger, more bureaucratic, and more expensive unless it is
downsized and eventually eliminated through the appropriations process.
<P>
Reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Schools Act
 <P>    There are many areas in which funding can be cut and rescinded in
this expansive program. President Clinton requested $10.281 billion in his
1995 budget, and Congress appropriated $9.94 billion, a $475 million
increase from 1994. Much of this money goes to fund bureaucracies and
should be cut, including: the Eisenhower Professional Development
Program, Arts in Education, Eisenhower Professional Development Federal
Activities, Women's Educational Equity Fund for Improvement of
Education, Indian Elementary and Secondary Education, and the Ready to
Learn Act, among others. Congress should also alter the expansive Title I
program, perhaps giving the money directly to poor parents in the form of
educational vouchers that they can then use at the school of their choice.
<P>
The Federal Direct Student Loan Program
<P>     This act has done nothing to reduce the complexity of administering
student loans, eliminate unnecessary costs, and provide better service to
students and schools. Despite rhetoric to the contrary, the Department of
Education has hired 600 new employees to administer the direct loan
programs and anticipates hiring 20,000 contract employees when the phase-
in of the program is completed. Congress should cap this program, which
has gone from being an "experimental" program when passed to a
"transitional" program. All new funding for this program should be
rescinded.
<P>
 The National Service Trust Act of 1993<P>
This act created a new bureaucracy, the Corporation for National and
Community Service, and a new entitlement for middle-class students. In
1995, Congress appropriated $575 million for National Service activities,
included in eight programs. This is an increase of $205 million from the
1994 appropriation. These numbers do not include the $791.8 million
appropriated in 1995 for the five programs operating under the Corporation
for National and Community Service. This amount is an increase of $216.4
million from the $575.4 million appropriated in 1994. These funds should
either be eliminated through rescission or merged into means-tested work
study and Pell Grant programs.<P>
Eliminate Institutional Aid. There are currently seven programs, totaling
$229.7 million, that aid specific institutions. Congress increased the
authorization for these institutions by $16.7 million in 1995. These programs
should be eliminated. Similarly, Congress currently appropriates $193
million to Howard University for the endowment and research programs. No
other university in this country receives such a high level of federal support.
The appropriations for Howard should be rescinded and eliminated, and the
university should rely on private sector support as do all other major private
universities.
<P>
     It is impossible, given the time constraints, to go into all of the other
programs that should be merged, eliminated, or rescinded. However, the
104th Congress should consider merging the many higher education grant
and campus-based programs into one grant, one loan, and one work study
program. It should reevaluate many of the programs falling under the
category of "Educational Research and Improvement" since many of these
programs do little to help educate children. It should privatize the student
loan collection program; revisit, eliminate, and consolidate many Chapter 2
block grant programs; and review and cut many of the categorical programs.
The appropriations committees will ultimately make many of the decisions
on which programs to eliminate. This subcommittee has the power actually
to improve American public education by eliminating many of the programs
containing the mandates and regulations that have strangled innovation for
the past 15 years.

<h2>Education Reform: Putting Power in Parents</h2>
<i><b>A column by Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin</i></b> 
</center>
<hr>
<br> 
As parents and members of a community, one of the greatest  
responsibilities we have is to educate our children. <p>
As the proverb goes, "It takes an entire village to raise a child." And there  
is perhaps no greater duty for that "village" than to make sure its children  
gain the knowledge, skills and confidence to succeed as adults and  
contribute to their community. <p>
Yet as parents and as a community, we have surprisingly little control 
over how our children are educated. Parents and communities are not 
given the tools or the authority they need to make sure their children are 
succeeding in the classroom. <p>
Currently the power and control over educating our children rests in  
Madison. We have an antiquated, centralized system of education where  
faceless bureaucrats decide how your child should be taught, then place a  
plethora of mandates on local school districts. These mandates tie the  
bands of parents and community leaders who want to have a real voice in  
the education of their children, and they stifle innovation and creativity in  
the classroom. <p> 
In short, the current education system trusts government more than it  
trusts parents and communities. <p> 
Somewhere along the way, government responsibility replaced parental  
responsibility. Somewhere along the way, the bureaucracy became more  
important than the children. Somewhere along the way, defending the  
status quo took precedence over pursuing innovation and improvement. <p> 
No more. The challenge now facing our state is to make the needed  
changes to our education system to put power back into the hands of  
parents, school boards, classroom  teachers and local taxpayers. <p> 
We need to put our trust back into the "village," empowering our parents  
and communities to decide what is best for our children's education.  
trusting parents -- what a radical idea. <p> 
If Thorpe is facing a problem with its schools, I trust that the people of  
Thorpe are best equipped to resolve that problem, not a group of  
bureaucrats in Madison. <p> 
When it comes to education, one size does not fit all. We must give local  
communities the flexibility to meet the unique needs of their children. <p> 
My budget provides an array of initiatives that will facilitate the shift in  
power over education from Madison to our local communities. This starts  
with building a new education structure for the state. The current  
bureaucracy is too mired in the past to change and too self-serving to  
seriously pursue a better way.  <p> 
The new Department of Education proposal in the budget will serve as a  
catalyst for change to a system that cares more about the future of our  
children than about the future of bureaucratic jobs -- a system that trusts  
parents, not government. <p> 
The Department of Education's role will be clear: serve the public. The  
department will help set educational standards for the state and make sure  
our children are meeting those standards (via testing, etc.), but otherwise  
it will step aside and give local communities the flexibility to teach their  
children as they see fit. <p> 
Parents, school boards, teachers, community leaders and local  
taxpayers will work together to chart the best course for their children to  
meet the state's educational standards. The Department of Education  
will serve as a resource center, there to help communities when asked. <p> 
The budget also includes unique programs that meet the same goal of  
giving more control over education to the local community. <p> 
The charter schools initiative gives every community in the state the  
ultimate in flexibility to design schools to meet their unique needs. This  
initiative allows -- and encourages - communities to be innovative and  
visionary in meeting its children's needs. <p>
The public school choice proposal would allow every parent the choice of  
which public school to send their child. If a parent is unhappy with their  
child's school, they would now have a choice. There's no doubt that this  
will help improve the overall quality of all our public schools. <p> 
For Milwaukee only, we would allow low-income parents to send their  
child to a private school if they so choose. With nearly half of the  
students in Milwaukee Public Schools failing to graduate we need to try  
radical ideas that empower parents, particularly poor, minority parents.  
Remember, we all pay the consequences when a young man or woman  
fails to graduate and subsequently falls into a life of government  
dependence. <p> 
This budget is dedicatcd to the pursuit of excellence in education. making  
sure our children can compete -- and win -- in the global marketplace. <p> 
We need to restore some common sense to our education system, and that  
begins with returning power to parents and communities. <p>
When Milwaukee Public Schools Superintendent Howard Fuller resigned  
recently, he recited the words of William Daggett, who I believe puts our  
education priorities in the proper perspective.  <p> 
Daggett said, "We must love our children's hopes, dreams and prayers  
more than we love the institutional heritage of the school system." <p> 
In short, we need to return power to the village so its people can  
properly raise our children. We need to trust parents and communities,  
not government. <p>

<h3>Getting Government Out of Higher Education</h3>
<p>
By Jon Westling
Provost and President-elect, Boston University, delivered May 3, 1995
<p>

One of the pleasures of visiting Washington is the sense of reassurance which gleams from the limestone and marble buildings, the Capitol dome, and the sober monuments. Those of us who live and work far outside the Beltway sometimes need that reassurance, which is a little like the need parents feel when leaving a son or daughter in the safekeeping of a university. After eighteen years of the hard and loving work of raising a child, parents rightly expect a college to be vigilant, caring, and prudent. Nonetheless, as the station wagon pulls away from the curb in front of the dormitory, many a parent suppresses a shudder at what may actually lie ahead.<p>
That feeling is particularly familiar to me because less than a week ago, Boston University submitted an important set of forms to the Department of Education:  our application for continued certification to participate in "Title IV Student Financial Aid Programs."  Except in certain government agencies, of course, eight or nine pounds of paperwork is not the equivalent of a child, but I do feel a certain parental responsibility to this certification homunculus. Boston University labored over it for fourteen weeks and spent about 2,700 hours of employee time feeding it data. We stayed up nights when it had the colic, and we even changed it frequently, as we found that the bureaucrats at DOE who devised the 26 separate schedules hadn't bothered to consult over definitions such as what constitutes an "academic program." <p>

 Anyway, we have now entrusted our little bundle to the DOE and, like the parents in the station wagon, are putting a brave face on our fears. We have confidence that those DOE people are scrupulous and that it was somehow our own fault that it took 2,700 hours --       almost 1 1/2 man-years -- to complete the form, since those scrupulous DOE folk say right on page three of the instructions, "the estimated time to complete the application is three hours." <p>

 The instructions also say, "Most institutions will have the information required for the  application readily available."  This, I admit, is a little more worrisome. I grant that my experience as a university administrator is limited entirely to twenty years at Boston University, so it may be that other colleges and universities routinely permute data on admissions and financial aid according to six or seven disparate formulas. We don't, but Boston University will be able to catch up now that DOE has shown us this remarkable productivity-enhancing tool. <p>

Filling in this application helped Boston University accomplish one of the goals of education:  It made us a little more self-aware. We now know, for example, that of the 35,979 students who enrolled in at least one Boston University course in 1994, precisely ten did not possess a high school diploma. Thanks to the DOE, our cup runneth over with such factoids -- although, I admit, we are not entirely sure what most of them have to do with our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. One would think DOE would observe that our default rate on guaranteed student loans is 4.7 percent, which is 21.3 percent below the so-called "cohort-default rate threshold," and that would be that. <p>

The United States is, by any account, the world's leader in higher education. It has achieved that status by building in the last two hundred years a tremendously diverse array of independent colleges and universities which grew up with distinct educational philosophies and missions. Many were begun by religious denominations, others by self-educated visionaries, some by businessmen and entrepreneurs concerned with the need for educated workers. Typically, they adopted the form that Thomas Jefferson gave to the University of Virginia:  They were governed by boards of trustees charged with making sure the institution lived up to its educational mission. <p>

A lot has changed, little of it for the better. Higher education today is beset with self-inflicted problems. The wrenching of curricula to fit the bizarre doctrines of multiculturalism has left a dislocated and miseducated generation of college graduates. At all-too-many     supposedly elite campuses, students imbibe the theory of writing but can't write beyond a junior high school level. At more than a few universities, we have the shameful spectacle of students -- and faculty members -- shouting down speakers whose views they find exceptionable. Faculty unions, tenured layabouts, charging grant overhead for floral arrangements -- the sweet whiff of corruption -- all these derelictions of responsibility are now well-known, especially to this audience. Tempting as it is, however, I have not come here today to bury these faults deeper in obloquy. <p>

For, in addition to the self-inflicted wounds, higher education bears some other bruises. I draw your attention to the Good Samaritan who thrashes us with a club each time one of us staggers to his feet. I refer, of course, to the federal government and its handy cudgel, the Department of Education. <p>

The DOE no doubt means well. Congress has asked it to fix the problem of soaring default rates in the federally insured student loan program. The problem itself is not intractable, but the combination of experts and tools and instructions which Congress and DOE have assembled is cause for some apprehension. Imagine balancing your checkbook with the aid of three economists, a socket wrench, a can of spray paint, and a copy of Black's Law Dictionary, and you will have some sense of the situation. I'll come to the details in a minute. If matters proceed in this fashion, we still will not have a balanced checkbook, but government bureaucrats will be in charge of virtually every detail of what colleges and universities do. <p>

In speaking of threats, I do not mean to sound like the moping owl in the ivy-mantled tower who "does to the moon complain."  Along with the threats, there are some great opportunities, and this is an occasion to point those out too. If we can pull back from the brink, we will find that American higher education still has tremendous potential to contribute to the vigor, the intellectual and spiritual richness, and the prosperity of American life. <p>

But the brink is real. American higher education is on the verge of losing its most precious asset. It is abandoning or being forced to abandon its robust independence, and it will fade into something worse than mediocrity if the government's regulatory assault is not stopped. <p>

Before describing that regulatory rampage, I should say a word or two about my perspective. "Never confess, never, never confess," says Joseph Conrad's deeply observant man of the sea, Marlowe. I will nonetheless divulge that I was a civil rights protester in the early 1960s. I retain a strong conviction that society can change for the better and that government has an important part to play in that process. I agree with Edmund Burke that, "A state without the means of some change is without the means of its conservation," and that to criticize is one thing, but "at once to preserve and to reform is quite another." <p>

Until the 1960s, the federal government intruded very little into university management. The GI Bill and the research funding that followed World War Two were accompanied by surprisingly little red tape. Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, however, changed this. By     establishing numerous programs designed to expand access to higher education, the federal government became enmeshed in the attempt to re-shape higher education. <p>

Many of these programs had broad bipartisan and public support. At first, the reams of new government regulations seemed a harmless enough price for programs that promised to benefit everyone, including colleges and universities. Few had the foresight to see that, over the next thirty years, Congress would transform programs meant to open doors to educational opportunities into welfare systems. <p>

Federally insured student loans, for example, were designed with the help of conservative legislators as a means of providing greater access to higher education with a minimum of government involvement. Initially, they expanded opportunity on an equal basis, assisting anyone who met the usual criteria for getting into college. Over these thirty years, however, they have been increasingly used by the government as a low-visibility way to  subsidize selected institutions. <p>

The program began with default rates comparable to those accepted by commercial    lenders. In 1972, the government lifted the ceiling beyond what any commercial lender would tolerate -- and, finding it was good, lifted it again in 1976, in 1978, and in 1983. It is now 25 percent for most institutions and more for "historically black colleges and universities [and] tribally-controlled community colleges."  The average default rate at proprietary schools is over 30 percent. <p>

At the same time, the government began lowering the minimum academic standards   necessary to qualify for loans. Today, neither a high school diploma nor equivalency exam is required for taking out a federally guaranteed loan for what is called "post-secondary" education. Finally, the default rates have soared partly because the government is unwilling to require "disadvantaged" members of society to pay back the loans. <p>

In short, today's student loan crisis is largely the result of permitted defaults by unqualified students who borrowed money to attend vocational schools which provided inadequate education and few job prospects. <p>

Neither universities nor private lenders would have, on their own, permitted the student loan crisis. The key ingredient was Congress, which insisted that the real decisions about who would receive the student loans would be made by the federal government. This is one instance of how the federal government's attempts to direct higher education have gone awry. I do not have time to present anything like a systematic account of the destruction Congress has wrought in this area in the last three decades, but I will try to give you a Cook's tour of the most monumental follies. Our first stop has been the Great Converge,  formerly known as the Great Divide. Rivers once flowed east and west from this point. Institutions, ideas, and people went their separate ways. But Congress, through some elegant diversions, has now ensured that everything flows to Washington. <p>

I should also like to suggest some ways in which these monuments to folly can be replaced with the verdant fields and pleasant vistas of good sense. In the case of federally insured student loan programs, good sense points in one clear direction. The programs should again be made commercially viable. The exemptions for those institutions which are allowed to exceed the 25 percent default rate should be abolished, and the tolerated default rate should be lowered to a commercially acceptable level. No student who is not a high school graduate or who has not passed a high school equivalency examination should be  considered qualified for federally insured student loans. <p>

New educational institutions or ones which have exceeded the default rate threshold should be required to put up an insurance bond to protect against future loan defaults. I would add to this that tuition refund regulations should be clearly defined; the current state of confusing formulae leads to abuse. <p>

We should take a close look at the patterns of abuse and respond accordingly. Physicians, for example, are close to the top in the rankings of those who default on student loans. This could be corrected almost overnight by barring Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements to doctors who default on their student loans and who fail to make amends within one year. That principle can be extended. Loan recipients who default and fail to make amends within one year should be barred from receiving any federal funds or contracts. <p>

These initiatives will return student loan programs to what was originally intended:  expanded educational opportunity at modest cost. In 1970, the taxpayer's bill for guaranteed student loans was $2.3 million on a volume of $770 million. In 1993, the bill had grown to $5 billion on a volume of $18 billion. Adjusted to 1993 dollars, the cost to taxpayers per  dollar loaned has risen from about .28 cents in 1970 to 28 cents in 1993. That is a 9,900 percent increase. <p>

If we knew then what we know now, or if the clock could be turned back thirty years,  perhaps we would not choose to go down the road of federally insured student loans. In that case, there would be far fewer colleges and universities, and there would be far fewer students at those which remained. But this is like wishing for a United States with an agrarian economy. We can't undo the past. This society has made a commitment to mass higher education. The attempt to reel in the percentage of the young who attend college to a European or Japanese level is not politically feasible, even in the unlikely event that we   decided it would be a good idea. <p>

Besides, as we have seen, there are simple ways in which the federally insured student loan crisis can be -- and should have been -- solved. Unfortunately, Congress and the Department of Education had an entirely different idea. They responded by adding yet more bureaucratic regulation and by making the programs even less commercially viable. The most intrusive part of this misguided response involves university and college accreditation. <p>


I approach this topic with a little trepidation. H.L. Mencken once called the Bible Belt "the Sahara of the Beaux Arts."  Accreditation is something like the Death Valley of the life of the mind. It is a dusty plain, leagues below the sea level of normal human cogitation, inhabited by scorpions and sidewinders. I could tell tales of college administrators stranded in this desperate landscape and languishing after mirage oases labeled "the assessment movement" and "teaching portfolios."  But that's for another time. What I am concerned with now is the invasion of the dirt-bikers. <p>

Accreditation at its best puts quacks out of business, but it is more typically a technique used by professional interests to feather their own nests. The most egregious example is the American Bar Association, which has a stranglehold on American legal education. Many of the ABA accreditation rules have only gossamer connections to the quality of legal education, but all of them have a laser-like focus on the perquisites of being a law professor -- down to specifying the number of square feet in each faculty member's office. You can get a fair picture of the world of specialized accreditation by imagining 250 or so would-be ABAs, each carping for a finer grade of ivory in its part of the tower. <p>

When all is said and done, however, we university administrators have a certain grudging respect for the specialized accreditors. Some know their business, and at worst they are driven by old-fashioned greed. In any case, specialized accreditors do not come close to the other great branch of academic accreditation, the regional accreditation agencies, for exemplifying lassitude, incompetence, and day-to-day bewilderment, combined with a solemn sense of rectitude and, of course, a desire to augment their authority. I realize that that description could apply rather well to several government agencies, but the regional accreditation agencies are not -- or not quite -- part of government. They are part of that shadowy world of quasi-governmental agencies which enjoy governmental authority but are largely unaccountable. <p>

The six regional accreditation agencies, which accredit whole institutions rather than   specific programs, gain their prominence from the stipulation that only accredited colleges and universities can participate in federal financial aid programs, including the Title IV    student loan programs. <p>

In 1992, when Congress recognized that default rates had gotten out of hand, it observed, correctly, that some of the worst offenders were schools that it had exempted from the   loan-default rate ceilings, along with a small number of proprietary schools. You and I could probably think of several solutions to this problem. I've sketched some of those earlier. But it's unlikely that in our most demented fantasies we would come up with the particular answer that Congress wrote into the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1992. Instead of merely shutting off the spigot to the offending institutions, Congress decided to turn the      regional accreditation agencies into an enforcement wing of the Department of Education. <p>

Instead of isolating problem institutions and kicking them out of the program, it told accreditation agencies that they would be responsible for fixing the problem, on pain of losing their ability to operate. This brings us to our current pass, in which the Department of Education and several of the accreditation agencies, operating under the curious but imposing title "The National Policy Board," have developed a proposal to nationalize accreditation. <p>

The arid landscape of accreditation is now roaring with joy-riding regulators, the dirt-bikers of Death Valley. Again, the solution is common sense. Congress must intervene to keep government from taking over accreditation. The linkage between accreditation and the    Department of Education must be broken, and the government-mandated monopoly of    accreditation agencies should be abolished. <p>

I can think of several very concrete things Congress could do to bring some sanity back to this process. First, Congress should change the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1992 to eliminate the requirement that higher education accrediting agencies themselves be accredited. This requirement is at the bottom of DOE's attempt to take over accreditation and of the National Policy Board's attempt to nationalize the system. <p>

Accreditation agencies should be, in effect, accredited by their customers. If they have anything worthwhile to offer colleges and universities, colleges and universities will pay them for it. Generally, colleges and universities will pay to be reviewed by the agency which has the strictest standards that the institution thinks it can pass. A free market in accreditation agencies will quickly stratify, with the toughest agencies attracting the best colleges and universities. The public will benefit from a genuine ranking system. <p>

Congress should eliminate the link between accreditation and eligibility for federal funds, including federally guaranteed student loans (Title IV). Accreditation should be about the quality of academic programs, not about the rate at which students default on government-backed loans. <p>

Congress should also stipulate that the Department of Education has no role to play in   accrediting institutions of higher education. The DOE has made clear that it is not a good judge on issues of academic quality, and the prospect of its telling others how to promote academic quality is grimly amusing. <p>

Let us leave Death Valley. I have a great deal of hope that the current Congress will undo the mischief of years past, but it is a vast and bleak landscape, and relief is long overdue. The next stop on this tour is the Old Growth Forest, a place of deep calm, even torpor, where the government has decided there will be no harvesting of even the most mature trees. The Old Growth Forest lies in pleasant Tenure County. The deep calm exists because those who live there know that no matter how feeble their performance, how desultory their efforts to keep up with the times, and how pressing the need to start new seedlings, Congress has determined they can stay put so long as they can breathe. <p>

As of January 1994, universities and colleges are no longer permitted to have a mandatory retirement age for faculty. This intrusion into the terms of faculty employment nominally makes professors like workers in any other sector of the economy. But in reality, it does nothing of the kind, because no other part of the economy is encumbered with the tenure system. This law has effectively given tenured faculty a lifetime appointment. <p>

The problem clearly has two sides. Universities and colleges should be seeking ways to  reform or abolish tenure. The traditional legs on which tenure stands are economic security and academic freedom. Economic security is a fine thing, but in universities it should never trump competence. And the major threats to academic freedom today come not from a repressive society but from repressive ideologies espoused mostly by those who live under the cover of tenure. Boston University successfully abolished tenure in its Medical and  Dental Schools in 1973, and we have been making some inroads in other areas since, most recently by offering some faculty members long-term contracts instead of tenure. It is,   however, a hard nut to crack. A single institution has to have powerful attractions to recruit individuals who have the possibility of guaranteed lifetime employment at a competing institution. <p>

By outlawing mandatory retirement for faculty, the government is making the effort to eliminate tenure even more difficult, and it is -- inadvertently -- closing opportunities for many other people. The life of most senior faculty members is generally not so strenuous. Many faculty members are willing to keep going in the absence of a stick or a carrot that gives them some incentive to stop. The result is that there is less turnover and fewer positions for faculty members who are attempting to establish their careers. <p>

 The Old Growth Forest is getting older. Congress must repeal the law which prohibits universities and colleges from setting mandatory retirement ages for faculty. <p>

The enxt stop on our tour is the High Plateau, the setting for a wonderful new institution, Learning Disabled University. LDU got its start from laws designed to prohibit discrimination against the handicapped. The Americans With Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act are being used -- perhaps contrary to legislative intention, but nonetheless -- to force colleges and universities to lower academic standards. <p>

Children are now reaching college having been swaddled for years in the comforting illusions of learning disabled theory. Enormous numbers of students in grade school and high school have been diagnosed "learning disabled."  In Massachusetts, almost one in five      students is crammed into this category. The national average is twelve percent. Are we in the midst of a silent genetic catastrophe? <p>

LDU is trying to keep LD philosophy students safe from the perplexities of Aristotle, to accommodate foreign language majors who have foreign language phobia, and to comfort physics students who suffer from dyscalculia, which is, of course, the particular learning   disablement that prevents one from learning math. <p>

I do not wish to imply that Boston University has escaped all the moonbeams illuminating campuses coast to coast. A month or so ago, I discovered that our Office of Disability Services had, without permission, begun issuing exemptions from the language and math  requirements on precisely the bases I described. I put a stop to it, and now I await as intrepidly as a brewer of hot coffee the lawsuits that are sure to follow. I think, for example, of the suit against Tufts University, filed by a student who claimed that Tufts was required  under the ADA to accommodate her psychological disability, which consisted of an aversion to taking tests. <p>

Nor do I wish to mislead you by suggesting that Learning Disabled University is entirely the province of students and their LD counselors. I think, for example, of the former philosophy professor that Boston University fired after finding him guilty of sexually assaulting another faculty member and of forcing his attentions on three undergraduate students. He responded with the novel defense that his lecherous behavior was the result of a disability:  namely, inhibitions chronically lowered by his ingestion of prescription drugs. He is now   suing Boston University, claiming that his behavior was protected by the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. I wish I were making this up, but I'm not. <p>

The disability laws are sacred cows, but they must at the very least be tethered so that they cannot be used to force universities to lower academic and other standards. <p>

My tour of follies in higher education has concentrated on sites that have benefited, so to speak, from Congress's helping hand. The Great Converge of student loan programs, the Death Valley of accreditation, the Old Growth Forest of mandatory retirement, and the High Plateau, home to Learning Disabled University, could not have become what they are without the wise counsel of Congresses past. <p>

I am conscious that in this speech I have been finding a great deal of fault with existing  arrangements. Burke, whom I referred to before, also observed that "those who are habitually employed in finding and displaying faults are unqualified for the work of reformation.... By hating vices too much, they come to love men too little."  In fact, I do not think I am    habitually employed in finding fault; this is a rather special occasion. <p>

Also, by concentrating on the evils brought on higher education by the government, I do not mean to suggest that only government can solve the problems it has created. Boston University, for example, has a number of initiatives which show how universities can help get government off the back of higher education. <p>

We have sought to lessen our dependence on federal research funding through Boston University's Community Technology Foundation, a venture capital fund established to develop the commercial potential of the work of our own researchers. We have invested about $60 million in Seragen, Inc., a start-up biotechnology company based on a breakthrough by a researcher in our Medical School. Seragen is currently in Stage III Clinical   Trials for a promising treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. <p>

Disregarding Conrad's advice yet again, I must also note that Boston University has received several large federal grants -- earmarked funds, if you will -- which paid part of the costs of very expensive science and engineering facilities on our campus. The Heritage Foundation is a place where one does not expect such a statement to be met with resounding applause, but I mention it for good reason. Our nation's universities are one of its major sources of commercially developable ideas and patents. The nation as a whole stands to gain a great deal economically and in other ways by treating some universities, in some respects, like venture capital firms. The public should invest in those who have the energy, the  know-how, and the overall promise to deliver -- and then wait and see. Government micromanagement of research grants is wasteful. Perhaps paradoxically, and certainly contrary to the assumptions of many, pork barrel projects often give the public its best return. <p>

That's my apostasy for the day. Boston University has taken some other steps that I am more confident you will agree are in the right direction. We have shown it isn't necessary to take a laissez-faire attitude toward drugs, toward uncivilized behavior in the dorms, and     toward bully-boy political behavior on the streets in order to attract students. <p>

We have shown that it is still possible to have a university that isn't kidding when it says that its principal mission is the pursuit of truth. <p>

I observed at the outset that leaving a child at college for the first time leaves a parent with some anxiety. I rather facetiously compared that to the anxiety a university administrator feels entrusting to the DOE the mounds of make-work the federal government now demands of us. There is, however, a more serious side to this anxiety. Most children learn to live responsibly with the freedom of campus life as a prelude to the responsibilities of full adulthood. With some trepidation, parents grant their children the independence to live up to the challenges. <p>

We'd like a government that has at least that much faith in its citizens. American higher education is one of this country's most outstanding accomplishments. A federal government that is prudently supportive is all we need. Most things we can do better on our own. <p>

Aside from a handful of federal responsibilities, most criminal justice issues are a local matter and the Congress in Washington should let state and local governments deal with them.  If the Congress wants to do more about crime, it should lift the federal tax burden on the states and let them raise money for law enforcement and prisons.  I'm in favor of truth-in-sentencing, but I think John Engler, Tommy Thompson, Bill Weld, and the other governors can run their own prison systems.  If Members of Congress want to set the length of state prison sentences, they ought to resign and run for state legislator.

The last thing we should do is make drugs legal.  That would only make them more available, dramatically increase the number of babies born having been exposed to drugs when their mothers were pregnant, increase the number of children and coworkers who use drugs, and make it almost impossible for addicts to quit.  We made great strides in the late 1980s in reducing drug use and we should keep at it.

<B><FONT SIZE=5>Education:  America 2000 v. Goals 2000:</B></FONT><P>
We need to send education back to states, communities and families -- where it belongs.  That was the idea behind America 2000.  The Clinton Administration's Goals 2000 goes in exactly the opposite direction.  They've turned a national movement into a federal program.<P> 
	* America 2000 was all about encouraging high standards in the core academic subjects.  Goals 2000 is about how much is spent on education.<P> 
	* America 2000 was about making schools more accountable for their performance.  Goals 2000 makes it harder to know how well schools are doing.<P>
	* America 2000 sought to give all families more choices of all schools.  Goals 2000 creates more obstacles for choice.<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=5>Education:  The Federal Role:</B></FONT><P>
Abolish the Department of Education in order to liberate parents and schools.  On January 26, I testified before the U.S. Congress and argued that it should take each activity currently housed in the Department of Education and do one of three things with it: (a) send it home to states and communities; (b) entrust it to another federal agency; or (c) terminate it and return the money to the taxpayers.  I've been looking at this issue for more than 15 years and I am convinced that the people in a position to know what is best for education are those closest to the child.  Education policy should be geared toward giving parents and teachers more control over what goes on in the classroom.

I have never thought gun control equalled crime control.  If we are really interested in controlling crimes involving guns, we should have stricter penalties against those who commit the crimes.

<B><FONT SIZE=5>Health Care Reform:</B></FONT><P>
Our health care system is still in need of repair.  When President Clinton tried to fix it last year, he went in exactly the wrong direction:  a "one size fits all" plan, run by Washington, D.C., full of new rules, mandates, and penalties.  We shouldn't repeat his mistakes.  We need to involve all 50 governors to help advance some important reforms state-by-state.  A few basic insurance reforms would make health insurance more flexible and easier to keep when we change jobs or move.  We should also amend the tax code so that individuals who buy health insurance get the same break that companies and their employees now receive.  It is also time we started looking at medical IRAs, the most direct way of giving individuals control over their own health care costs.

<B><FONT SIZE=5>History Curriculum Standards Sponsored by the Administration:</B></FONT><P>
They are not standards Lynne Cheney and I had in mind when we encouraged school boards to adopt voluntary educational standards. The history panel ended up presenting a warped view of our nation's past.  President Clinton should condemn these standards and make sure they are not promulgated or endorsed by the federal government.

<B><FONT SIZE=5>Medicaid:</B></FONT><P>
We would save money -- and deliver better medical care to the poor -- if we capped the growth of spending but gave governors the power to run Medicaid as they see fit.
<BR>
<BR>
The best way to reform Medicaid is the welfare "swap."  President Reagan tried a version of this in the early 1980s. The first step is to give the states complete responsibility  for welfare in exchange for the federal government picking up a comparable portion of state Medicaid expenditures.  The second step is to delegate responsibility for administering the program back to the states without the mandates from Washington.

<B><FONT SIZE=5>School Prayer:</B></FONT><P>
I signed a bill permitting a moment of silence in schools in 1981 and I would sign one again today.  We should remember that on the first day of the very first session of Congress, the House and the Senate adopted the Bill of Rights.  On the second day, they adopted a national day of prayer called "Thanksgiving."
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Welfare:</B></FONT><P>
Instead of fixing welfare in Washington for the sixth time, we should end welfare reform in Washington. Let's end welfare as a federal program and send responsibility for it back to the states, communities, and private agencies.  States are way ahead of Washington on this one.  Michigan requires all welfare recipients to get a job, go to school, or do volunteer community service.  Wisconsin says two years and you're out.  Massachusetts says 60 days.  California docks welfare checks when kids don't go to school.  New Jersey doesn't pay more to mothers on welfare who have more children.  I would add:  no marriage penalty, no added benefits for children born to unmarried mothers on welfare, a certain end to payments to able-bodied adults after a set time, jail time for deadbeat dads, no payment to anyone who commits a crime while on welfare, reduction of welfare for parents whose children quit school, privatize job finding programs.

<b>Policy Review</b><br>
<i>Fall 1995, Number74</i></center><p>
	Recent revelations in <i>U.S. News and World Report</i>'s annual college guide that the cost of a top undergraduate degree now exceeds $100,000 may represent a watershed. At more than $25,000 a year, many students and their families will have to think hard about whether an Ivy-League education is worth the expense. For some parents, the answer will be to send their capable child to a less prestigious university or college for about $50,000 less. Most parents, however, will decide to scrimp, save, and sacrifice -- and perhaps take out a second mortgage on their home -- rather than turn down that rare admission offer from a Harvard, Yale, Brown, or Duke.<p>	By no means unrepresentative of what is meant by a "prestige" school is Stanford University, consistently ranked in the top five in <i>U.S. News</i>'s survey and privileged by an ideal climate, sumptuous facilities, and a $2-billion endowment. The yearly competition for admission reflects this status: More than 15,000 applicants vie for 1,600 places in the freshman class. A year there does not come cheaply: $25,749 for tuition, room, and board -- about the cost of a new BMW 325i.<p>	For almost every year in the last two decades, Stanford's tuition increases have outpaced inflation and, more importantly, the rate of personal income growth in the United States. The increases primarily fund what Gerhard Casper, Stanford's president, has called a "mini-welfare state" -- an ever-expanding range of student services and new programs centered around the university's multicultural "experiment." In the 1980s, then-president Donald Kennedy declared that Stanford's multicultural venture was "a bold experiment that must succeed," and the university began spending with a vengeance to make sure it did.<p>	To administer its great experiment, Stanford employs nearly 7,000 staffmore than one bureaucrat for every undergraduate -- including a $50,000-a-year "Multicultural Educator." (By contrast, there are only 1,400 faculty members.) And there is a large assortment of new m
ulticultural departments (feminist studies, African-American studies, Chicano studies, Asian-American studies, Native-American studies), ethnic centers, "residential education" (which receives more than $3 million a year), and new classes and conferences. In 1991, the university established an Office for Multicultural Development as a cabinet-level department and invested it with sweeping powers to ensure the university's "transformation."<p>	You can't achieve transformation on the cheap. Stanford raised tuition by 5 percent this year, 7.5 percent a year ago, and a whopping 9.5 percent for the 1992-93 school year. A record two-thirds of undergraduates (and an even higher percentage of graduate students) now receive some form of financial aid. However generous this aid, the squeeze invariably falls on parents or the students themselves. And much of it is unnecessary: Last year, the <i>Stanford Review</i> examined the 1993-94 university budget for ways to cut costs and reduce tuition. The <i>Review</i> identified $10 million in savings by merging scaled-back gender- and race-studies departments with other programs. The paper saved an additional $1 million by eliminating "multicultural dorm programming." All told, the Review produced a plan to reduce Stanford's tuition by about 14 percent by trimming multicultural programs.<p>It would be welcome. Explains Patrick Callahan, executive director of the California Higher Education Policy Center, "There is close to a middle-class panic in this country from increases in tuition by private and public institutions."<p>Such fear is hardly overblown. In the trendy world of academia, which covets the latest politically correct program like a shiny new hood ornament, there is competition to keep up with the Stanfords. Yet Stanford's tuition ranks only 41st of 106 private colleges and universities surveyed by Cambridge Associates. <p>Many parents may be shocked to learn that the extra expense has not increased the quality of a undergraduate degree at Stanford, but rather ha
s undermined it. Students can still receive first-rate training in engineering, the sciences, and economics, where results are more testable. But many humanities and social science students will find themselves awash in courses that trivialize logical thinking and seem incapable of taking history, ideas, or truth seriously.<p>The curriculum boasts of literature courses that filter Shakespeare through the lens of lesbianism, American history courses that find no time to teach about the Constitution, English classes that require students to write grant proposals for environmental groups, and psychology courses that give high marks for finding "gender discrepancies" in pizza parlors. In short, much of the undergraduate humanities curricula has been transformed into a vehicle for shameless politicization and indoctrination. Parents of these youngsters may begin to wonder why they didn't just keep the money and open up their very own McDonald's franchise.<p><b>The New Classics</b><p>With the now-notorious chant "hey hey, ho ho, Western Culture's got to go," Stanford's activists demanded in 1987 that the core reading list be dumped in order to make room for a new curriculum. Ever since the university capitulated to these demands, the humanities have been undergoing a quiet revolution. As a start, consider the multiple-track "Cultures, Ideas, and Values" (CIV) program, the relativist 15-unit requirement (about $8,000 per student) that replaced the Western Culture core:<p><ul>
<li>Required reading in the Philosophy CIV track includes works by Chief Seattlethe 19th-century Indian leader whose alleged writings were later judged to be just of a pale face. Although the instructors have retained Plato and Aristotle, they primarily use them to contrast the "logocentrism" of Western philosophers with the more holistic approach of Australian Aborigines (whose unwritten "philosophy" is explained by Western anthropologists). One of the class's feminist instructors, Carol Delaney, teaches that the American role in World War II is "phallocentric" because men invented the atomic bomb without women. She compares the Manhattan Project to Frankenstein, both evil attempts to thwart women's role in the reproductive process.<p><li>The Bible is still read in all the CIV tracks, but many classes teach that Genesis is rife with sexism, and some sections even make the Apostle Paul politically correct by saying he may have been homosexual. Shakespeare is also still studied in all the tracks, but <i>The Tempest</i> is now viewed from a "slave perspective" and is made to serve as a case study in Western imperialism.</ul><p>
	Although CIV is perhaps the single biggest waste of student tuition, it represents just the tip of the scandal. Multiculturalism has overrun most of the major humanities and social-sciences departments. The cumulative effect has been a kind of institutionalized silliness. Consider just some of the more blatant examples:<ul>
<p><li>"Black Hair as Culture and History," one of the new multicultural history seminars, addressed how black hair "has interacted with the black presence in this country, and how it has played a role in the evolution of black society." Lectures included "The Rise of the Afro" and "Fade-O-Rama, Braiding and Dreadlocks," and local hair stylists were brought in for a week of discussions. Enrolled students viewed the 1960s musical <i>Hair</i> and read the lyrics to Michael Jackson's hit single "Man in the Mirror." "I couldn't have taught this class 10 years ago," Kennell Jackson explains. "But people don't look at me like I'm crazy anymore. What history does has broadened considerably."<p>
<li>History 267, "The History of Rights in the United States," was so busy extolling 1960s protest ("rights") movements that the class never even studied the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution.<p>
<li>"19th-Century American History," taught by Estelle Freedman, devoted half of class time to a study of women, because they had constituted half the U.S. population during that time. As a result of these priorities, the class did not have enough time to learn about the War of 1812. <p><li>"Religions in America," a religious-studies class that can satisfy three different graduation requirements, devoted whole lectures to Shamanism, the peyote cult, and the Kodiak sect, but not one to the Catholic Church. When discussed at all, Christianity was viewed from a feminist or gay "perspective" through such works as <i>Jesus Acted Up: A Gay and Lesbian Manifesto</i>, <i>A Second Coming Out</i>, and <i>Beyond the Father: Towards a Philosophy of Women's Liberation</i>.<p>
<li>Anthropology 1 (which can also fulfill three different graduation requirements) devoted lectures to "language imperialism" and criticized CNN for the phenomenon because the network broadcasts in English to non-English-speaking countries.<p><li>In Psychology 167D, students received academic credit for becoming "contraceptive peer counselors" and for demonstrating these skills by placing condoms on a plastic penis at dorm meetings. <p>
<li>In Stanford's mandatory freshman English classes, students are required to write grant proposals for their professors' favorite community-service agencies, including homeless advocacy projects, AIDS support groups, and environmental action leagues. Instead of focusing on reading and writing skills, these classes revolve around the "Community Service Writing Project," which assigns freshmen to such activities as answering telephones at Stanford's Center for Public Service and visiting East Palo Alto elementary schools. <p><li>Enrolling more than 100 students each quarter, Linguistics 73 is one of the most heavily subscribed courses fulfilling Stanford's new race-studies requirement. Entitled "African-American Vernacular English," the premise of the class is that inner-city slang (of the type heard in rap songs) is a legitimate dialect of the English language deserving scholarly attention.<p>
<li>"Interdisciplinary" courses provide the opportunity for politicization along several vectors. One example is "Peace Studies," taught by faculty from the departments of sociology, political science, psychology, history, and education. The class begins by defining "peace" as "collaborative well-being," a euphemism for a smorgasbord of the lecturers' pet policy choices -- nationalized health care, government-guaranteed employment, transfer payments to inner cities, radical feminism, and so forth -- all taught under the rubric of "peace." Meanwhile, the curriculum completely omitted the study of the origins of World War I, World War II, the War for Independence, or any other significant historical conflagrations. The Vietnam War and Gulf War were reviewed briefly, but only as they related to the "peace movement" and its (often unpacific) protests. The class's final lecture was entitled "Peace and You," in which the course's lecturers fondly recounted their own 1960s activism and exhorted students to join the "peace movement" and "to act responsibly and effectively on behalf of peace."<p><li>Comparative Literature 189, "Representing Sappho: the Literature of Lesbianism," sought, in the words of Terry Castle, "to resexualize lesbian history." Shakespeare's <i>As You Like It</i> was identified as a "<i>locus classicus</i> of lesbianism," and the remainder of the course readings -- books both new and old -- were probed for "male and female representations of lesbian desire" and for "lesbianism as 'symbolist,' 'decadent,' 'modernist,' and 'utopian' literary motif."</ul><p>Other courses addressing human sexuality:<p>
<ul>
<li>Feminist Studies 295, "How Tasty Were My French Sisters"; Comparative Literature 110, "The Politics of Desire: Representations of Gay and Lesbian Sexuality"; and Law 587, "The History and Politics of Sexual Orientation: Cross-Disciplinary Perspectives."<p>
<li>"Representing Sexualities: Whitman to AIDS" (English 187D) is another of Stanford's X-rated English classes. The course syllabus warns that "sexually explicit materials, both hetero- and homoerotic, may be viewed and discussed in this class." Readings included articles entitled "A Posttranssexual Manifesto," "Capitalism and Gay Identity," "From Thoreau to Queer Politics," and "How to Bring Your Kids up Gay," in addition to two videos, "Voices from the Front," by the militant homosexual group ACT-UP, and "Tongues Untied," a pornographic gay film. Jay Grossman spent his first class session presenting an episode of the television comedy <i>Cheers</i> and then deconstructing the show as "homophobic." His first reading assignment was several weeks of a cartoon strip in which a teenage character reveals that he is gay. In Stanford's English department, if the material is trendy enough, it does not even have to be literature.<p>
<li>Psychology 116, "The Psychology of Gender," is based on the premise that gender discrimination is everywhere, and so, not surprisingly, the class tends to find it everywhere. In her Spring 1994 class, Laura Carstenson required students to complete a group research project. Her favorite project was entitled "Gender Discrepancies in Pizza Consumption." The student authors first conducted their laborious research by "observing couples eating at a local pizza restaurant and recording the number of slices each individual consumed," and concluded that "gender discrepancies exist not only in quantity, but also in rate of consumption." Because this class meets the new feminist-studies requirement, it is heavily enrolled each quarter; hundreds of students are enlisted in this kind of inane multicultural research. </ul><p>
Such anecdotes do not simply exist on the fringes of an otherwise terrific Stanford education. Many involve core classes that fulfill graduation requirements, subjects at the heart of a liberal-arts education. All students must take CIV and Freshman English. In addition, the university has imposed a number of "distribution requirements" (DRs) which can only be fulfilled by classes in certain areas. While there is no requirement in American History, for instance, all students -- including science majors -- are now required to take at least one course in feminist studies, one course on race theory, and one course on Third World cultures. There are three additional social-studies requirements, usually satisfied by classes from such departments as anthropology, English, and sociology where the multicultural revolution has been pushed furthest. "Psychology of Gender," "African-American Vernacular English," Anthropology 1, and "Religions in America" are all classes that fulfill Drs.<p>
	The DR system limits the flexibility of conscientious students who wish to avoid swallowing large quantities of academic junk food. Of the 180 units necessary for graduation, distribution requirements in new or revamped subjects like CIV, Freshman English, race studies, feminist studies, and multicultural social studies now constitute almost 60 units. As a result, even those students who pursue majors in economics, physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, or engineering will spend close to one-third of their four years at Stanford -- at a cost of about $25,000 per year -- studying thoroughly politicized multicultural requirements.<P>Just in case these requirements do not suffice, however, Stanford's multiculturalists provide powerful incentives to take their electives. The average grade in Stanford's humanities departments is above an A-. Many of the most radical multiculturalists are also radical egalitarians who give everyone As, so from a student's point of view their classes are not necessarily the ones to avoid. What student wouldn't be attracted to a class like Peace Studies, where a "take-home" midterm and an "open-book" final exam guarantee an easy A? Science majors are particularly prone to building "trophy transcripts" by taking multicultural courses whenever possible, because they face the stiffest competition in admission to graduate programs and medical schools. <p>For those students pursuing a degree in the humanities or social sciences, there are even fewer options. The numerous examples already mentioned -- all fairly indicative -- represent just the beginning of an indoctrination into New Age thinking. For these hapless students, being principled or conscientious about course selection simply does not make much difference: Instead of "Black Hair" or Feminist Studies 101, such a student might find himself in "19th-Century American History" or "History of Rights," where the course title falsely advertises the subject matter. While there are, of course, still many solid courses (and good teac
hers) at Stanford, especially in engineering and the hard sciences, Stanford's activists have largely succeeded in killing the core undergraduate humanities curriculum. <p><b>The Multicultural Waste Land</b><p>The death of the humanities at Stanford does not imply that institutions like it will serve no function whatsoever. In the hard sciences, economics, and engineering, our top colleges and universities will graduate people who have amassed an impressive array of scientific knowledge and technical skills. At the same time, business, law, and medical schools will continue to churn out trained professionals. From the outside perspective of companies seeking to hire new computer engineers, biochemists, or investment bankers, everything will continue as before.	<p>	But in the process, Stanford risks becoming a technical school, along the lines of MIT or Caltech -- highly esteemed in narrow areas of expertise and not much more. Behind the facade of normalcy, much may be lost. The university may be transformed into a multiversity, no longer capable of providing a universal framework for students to integrate a wide assortment of knowledge into a coherent whole. That kind of framework, so essential for thinking about the larger problems facing individuals and societies, simply cannot be provided by science; it must be gleaned from the humanities, and can be reached only after rigorous study -- in philosophy, literature, and history. <p>	Most students have only the vaguest notion of what some of the alternatives might be -- what Socrates, Jesus, or Jefferson said that might be relevant to the contemporary situation. They have only a minimal understanding even of the ideas that built the American regime. Most have not read John Locke or Adam Smith, much less <i>The Federalist Papers</i>, Alexis de Tocqueville, or Abraham Lincoln. Though the loss of this framework cannot readily be translated into dollars and cents, it will be felt keenly nonetheless, by a generation of students increasingly alienated from an inc
oherent and senseless world, unable even to diagnose the source of their troubles.<p>The scope of this loss has been hinted at, indirectly, by one of Casper's most sweeping proposals. He has suggested replacing the four-year undergraduate degree with a three-year degree. His proposal is particularly heretical, because it suggests that students are not getting much added value out of a fourth year at Stanford and that the university's distribution requirements might need to be scrapped. "If resources were available, I'd say four years are wonderful, the more the better," he says. "On a cost-benefit analysis, there will be more questions as to whether these four years are sustainable in the long run." <p>In a narrow sense, Casper was clearly right: If there was no real humanities program left, then a three-year professional education would represent a sensible change. At the same time, however, the call for such a drastic remedy indicated how much had been lost and how little else could be done about this loss.<p>If higher education in America is not altogether finished, then perhaps it is in the midst of a massive and unprecedented displacement. An intellectual renaissance in our traditional centers of higher learning may be a long time coming, but this does not necessarily imply that people simply will stop thinking in the intervening years. To the extent that it continues, intellectual life will likely shift from elite universities to historically less significant colleges that have survived the multicultural transformation, or move altogether outside the academic context.<p>New educational venues may arise and meet demands no longer being satisfied by existing institutions. One promising area involves new computer networks in which people connect with one another from all parts of the country to discuss matters of common interest. Not surprisingly, a number of these networks focus on areas that no longer have much of a place in the multicultural academy, such as free-market economics or Thomistic theology
. Because learning need not take place in the classroom, this sort of technological breakthrough may in time undermine the near-monopoly on higher education currently enjoyed by America's elite universities.<p>Admittedly, that distant prospect offers small solace to students who are eager to attend prestigious schools like Stanford, but are hard pressed to find there academic mentors to guide them toward answers to ancient and modern questions: What constitutes justice, rather than political propaganda about the size of welfare payments; what the Bible teaches about man's political nature, rather than radical speculation about the Apostle Paul's sexual orientation; or the Founders' view of slavery and race relations, instead of courses on hairstyles. At $100,000 for a degree, is that really asking too much?

<H2>NATIONAL HISTORY STANDARDS:  <BR>
 CLINTONITES MISS THE MOON</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>

<I> Gary L. Bauer</I></CENTER>
<P>
When Americans look back on the twentieth century, they may well
view the landing on the moon as <I>the</I> most significant event
of our time.  So said historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. 
<P>
Not if they are taught U.S. history according to the National
History Standards.  That's because, incredibly, the team that
labored for two years and spent $2 million in federal grants to
come up with &quot;world class&quot; standards completely missed
the moon.  They include references to &quot;Soviet advances in
space&quot; and to the <I>Challenger</I> disaster, but neglect
to mention that the United States won the space race.
<P>
Hardly an American has been unaffected by the U.S. landing on
the moon.  Thousands of us are alive today because of advances
in medical technology that are a &quot;spinoff&quot; of the space
program.  The computer revolution and the development of worldwide
communications networks are a direct result of the massive U.S.
drive to reach the moon.  Schlesinger is clearly right to signal
its importance.  And it is ironic that the national history standards,
rightly assailed by conservatives as &quot;politically correct,&quot;
should have effaced the memory of Jack Kennedy's most enduring
accomplishment.
<P>
It is hard to overstate the magnitude of the failure.  For the
Department of Education, this embarrassing public fiasco is indisputable
evidence of bureaucratic ineptitude.  If we adopt these amnesiac
history standards, we will succumb to a kind of national identity
crisis.  We will cease to remember who we are and why it matters
that there is an America.
<P>
This gaffe is almost unbelievable.  I say <I>almost</I> because
as Undersecretary in the U.S. Department of Education under President
Reagan, I gained an appreciation for how bureaucracies work. 
And I learned why we can never have national standards in education
determined by political bodies.  However well intended, the Goals
2000 legislation, which drives national standards, is deeply flawed.
 The attempt to have government determine &quot;official knowledge&quot;
in this country cannot help but become a political football. 
What George Will has called a &quot;cranky anti-Americanism&quot;
has come to dominate too many professional historians' worldview.
 That's why their depiction of America's &quot;war of vengeance&quot;
against Japan forced the Smithsonian's <I>Enola Gay</I> exhibit
to be cancelled. 

<P>
The Clinton administration's national history standards project
did not just miss the moon.  Major U.S. advances in medicine have
been lost as well, such as the development of anesthesia, the
conquest of Yellow Fever, and the discovery of the polio vaccine.
 Similarly, there is an anti-free enterprise bias to the history
standards.  Students are encouraged to put John D. Rockefeller
on trial for his sharp business tactics.  But where do the standards
lead young Americans to an understanding of the most productive
and free economic system in history?  Nowhere.
<P>
Defenders of the history standards complain that the criticisms
are all coming from conservatives, from the angry white male caucus.
 Well, the history standards' dismissal of Paul Revere and Robert
E. Lee, Thomas Edison and Albert Einstein would appear to fit
this category.  But how can these apologists explain the omission
of leading black Americans like Thurgood Marshall, Gen. Colin
Powell, Gen. Benjamin O. Davis, Ralph Bunche, Roy Wilkins and
the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy?  And how to explain the cultural
importance the history standards give to &quot;Madonna&quot; and
Roseanne, while pushing Leontyne Price and Marian Anderson off
the bus?  Further, how do historians who gave us six references
to the Seneca Falls Convention on women's rights explain their
failure to include Sen. Margaret Chase Smith and Ambassador Claire
Booth Luce?  These influential women were Republican leaders and
early advocates of the E.R.A. Was their adherence to the E.R.A.
<I>and </I>the GOP offensive to the panel?  Whatever became of
the big tent?  
<P>
It goes without saying that the history standards' emphasis on
race, gender, and class forces young Americans to accept a secular
world view.  But for millions of us, our religous ties are more
important than ethnicity, gender and geography.  The history standards
panel clearly failed to comprehend the influence of religion in
American life.  How else to explain the fact that they consistently
employ the term &quot;fundamentalists,&quot; a term generally
viewed as pejorative.  Some 30 million Evangelicals, recognized
even by <I>TIME </I>and <I>Newsweek</I>, receive no mention. 
Some groups seem more equal than others.  Catholic Americans will
find it odd that their children will learn of Mother Jones, but
never hear about Mother Seton.  Father Coughlin gets in, but Bishop
Fulton J. Sheen is an &quot;unperson.&quot;  Jewish Americans
will find a similar skittishness about recognizing the accomplishments
of Jews as Jews.  Interestingly, too, for a document that emphasizes
group experience and all claims of victimhood, the national history
standards are strangely silent about America's role in four Arab-Israeli
wars.  
<P>
Tocqueville recognized that centralization of administration was
always the enemy of excellence because it enervates local initiative.
 Not only will national standards in education, bureaucratically
derived and politically driven, fail to overcome a rising tide
of mediocrity, they will become a part of it.  As President Kennedy
often said: &quot;We can do better.&quot;

<title>EDUCATION DEBATE NEEDS TO FOCUS ON THE FAMILY</title>
<body>

<h2>EDUCATION DEBATE NEEDS TO<br>
FOCUS ON THE FAMILY</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>William R. Mattox, Jr.</i></center>
<p>
The U.S. Department of Education recently launched a series of
events to encourage greater family and community involvement in
learning.  While it is surely odd for an Administration that opposes
parental choice in education to lead such an effort, this public
relations blitz -- or at least the research that undergirds it
-- truly deserves wide attention.
<p>
Families exert far more influence over their children's intellectual
development than is commonly realized.  In fact, more than three
decades of research shows that families have greater influence
over a child's academic performance than any other factor -- including
schools.
<p>
In the mid-1960s, University of Chicago sociologist James Coleman
led a major research study which found a &quot;powerful relation
of the child's own family background characteristics to his achievement,
a relation stronger than that of any school factors.&quot;  Coleman's
research spawned a number of studies replicating his work and
building upon it.  These studies consistently confirmed Coleman's
chief finding that families exert considerable influence over
student achievement.
<p>
What is especially important about this body of research is that
it consistently shows that what families <I>do</I> really matters.
 That is, differences in student learning are not determined simply
by the quality of one's gene pool or by which side of the tracks
one lives on.  Instead, differences stem significantly from the
values, habits, and relational dynamics at work within the household.
<p>
Take, for example, family meals together.  While some might consider
this a rather trivial family ritual, several studies have found
the frequency of family meals together to be a strong predictor
of student test scores.  In explaining this high positive correlation,
 Chester Finn of the Hudson Institute says that consistent mealtimes
give parents regular opportunities to ask questions about what
kids are doing in school.  Mealtimes also give 
parents regular opportunities to broaden children's educational
horizons.  For example, Theodore Roosevelt's interest in public
affairs is said to have been cultivated by the rich dinnertime
discussions his family regularly enjoyed when he was a boy.
<p>
Just as family interactions around the dinner table pay surprising
dividends, the number and variety of learning tools (books, tapes,
puzzles, encyclopedias, computers, and the like) in the home have
a profound effect on children's learning, especially when these
materials are used in direct parent-child interaction.  For example,
a 1985 report from the National Academy of Education found that
the single most important activity for building the knowledge
required for eventual success in reading is reading aloud to children.
 Moreover, a 1992 study at the City University of New York found
that average IQ scores of low-income preschoolers are boosted
by nearly seven percentage points for each day of the week that
their mother reads to them.
<p>
The benefits of parent-child verbal interaction can also be seen
in recent research showing preschoolers placed in full-time day
care settings often lag behind their home-reared peers in language
development.  What is the primary reason for the difference? Young
children at home spend much of their day interacting verbally
with people (particularly Mom) whose language skills are more
advanced, whereas kids in day care spend most of their day interacting
verbally with peers whose language skills are no more developed
than their own.
<p>
Given the extraordinary influence families have over their children's
learning, it is curious that almost all public discussion about
improving education in this country centers around school-based
reforms of one kind or another.  While no one would deny many
school-based reforms are needed, Seattle public schoolteacher
David Guterson believes the promise of such reforms is often overblown.
 &quot;We should think clearly about the problems of schools and
ask ourselves why every attempt to correct them seems doomed to
fail,&quot; Guterson writes.  &quot;We should recognize that schools
will never solve the bedrock problems of education.&quot;  
<p>
Only families can.  Only families will.
<p>
Unless and until our education debate begins to focus on the family,
significantly improving student performance in America is likely
to remain an elusive goal.

<title>Time To Permit Oil Drilling In the Arctic Refuge</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><i>TIME TO PERMIT OIL DRILLING IN THE ARCTIC REFUGE</i></h3>
By John Shanahan<br>
Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 432<br>
October 17, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>

	The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska is the subject of heated debate as some Members of Congress, led by Senators Frank Murkowski (R-AK) and Ted Stevens (R-AK) and Representative Don Young (R-AK), attempt to open a small fraction of the area to oil exploration and production. A provision included in the budget reconciliation would open the Coastal Plain area of ANWR. This effort is a sensible approach that could dramatically expand much-needed domestic oil production with negligible impact on the environment.
<p>
	ANWR is an enormous area of land located in the Northeast corner of Alaska within the Arctic Circle. Contrary to the image evoked by opponents of oil production, that ANWR is the last small pristine area left in Alaska, the state has an abundance of hardy ecosystems. In addition to the healthy ecosystems existing on millions of acres of private and state land, the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) of 1980 set aside 100 million acres of land as parks, refuges, and preserves, including 57 million acres of wilderness. ANWR itself covers 19.8 million acres. While eight million acres of ANWR were set aside as wilderness, 1.5 million acres were designated for review by the Department of Interior (DOI) to recommend future management of high potential oil resources. In 1987, DOI recommended that this 1.5 million acres, known as the Coastal Plain, be leased for oil and gas exploration and production in an environmentally sensitive manner.
<p>
	The provision in the budget reconciliation bill would implement DOI's recommendation. But only a tiny fraction -- far less than one percent -- of the Coastal Plain area would be affected. Advancing technology over the last 20 years has reduced the necessary size or "footprint" of drilling operations to less than one-fifth of what was required, say, at Prudhoe Bay. So exploration and production would affect only about 2,000 acres. To put this in perspective, that is an area about one-sixth the size of Dulles Airport near Washington, D.C., and about 0.01 percent of the total area of ANWR. Even in this very limited area, modern sophisticated operations adopt many environmentally sensitive methods which further limit any ecological impact.
<p>
	Expanded oil production is badly needed. The United States currently imports more than half its oil consumption, and reliance on foreign oil is growing. That raises national security concerns and is an unwelcome factor in foreign policy considerations. This reliance caused a $51 billion oil trade deficit last year -- roughly equivalent to the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. Foreign energy dependence would be eased considerably if the Coastal Plain produced oil. The area potentially could produce 1.5 million barrels of oil per day for at least a quarter of a century, thereby increasing domestic production by almost 25 percent. Allowing limited drilling in ANWR also would reduce the trade deficit by about $14 billion per year. Further, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that federal revenues from lease sales would be $1.3 billion over the next seven years, helping to trim the budget deficit.
<p>
	Alaska's residents would be big beneficiaries of lease sales. Alaska has agreed to split the estimated $2.6 billion revenue from lease sales evenly with the federal government (rather than take the 90 percent to which the state otherwise would be entitled), so the state still will receive $1.3 billion. This partially explains why three-quarters of Alaskans support the plan.
<p>
	Not only will Alaskans and the federal treasury benefit from increased oil production, but an estimated 222,000-732,000 jobs will be created throughout the country. There will be new hires in the oil industry and manufacturers, suppliers, and transporters of oil-related equipment will increase hiring dramatically, with fully 98 percent of these jobs in the lower 48 states. Based on a mid-range estimate of job creation, this one action would drop the unemployment rate by 0.36 percentage points.1
<p>
	The only potentially legitimate objection to opening the Coastal Plain of ANWR to oil drilling would be on environmental grounds. But these concerns are without merit because of the very limited impact of modern drilling and production techniques. Even the "pro-environment" native Inupiat Eskimos, who live in or near the Coastal Plain and opposed oil drilling in Prudhoe Bay 60 miles away, support onshore oil development in the area. As Inupiat Mayor George Ahmagak of the North Slope Borough wrote last June, "Our whalers and hunters make maximum use of our few resources, always taking care not to harm the land so their grandchildren may in turn carry on their culture.... As Mayor, I can state unequivocally that the people of the North Slope Borough enthusiastically support the presence of the oil industry in our land.... The wisdom of our Elders teaches us the value of hunting where game is most plentiful. Likewise, it makes sense for our nation to seek oil in an area that even [DOI] has identified as the country's best prospect for new petroleum deposits."2
<p>
	Exploration is opposed by the Gwich'in Indians, who live 120 miles south and have strong ties to the environmental lobby. They are concerned about protecting their hunt of 300-350 animals from the 152,000 porcupine caribou. While the herd size has fallen from its high of 180,000 a few years ago, oil drilling is unlikely to have any negative impact. One reason for this confidence is that the Central Arctic caribou herd living in the Prudhoe Bay area already has increased its population over sevenfold since oil production began 20 years ago, despite dire warnings at the time that the herd would decline sharply if oil drilling was permitted. In fact, the second-largest oil field in the U.S. is the favorite place for caribou to give birth. 
<p>
	 The facts are clear. Permitting oil production in ANWR would spur economic growth, cut the trade deficit, and ease national security concerns. Moreover, it poses virtually no threat to the environment. It is time for Congress to give the green light to limited exploration and production.

INTRODUCTION

<P>   After eighteen high-level hearings, and a review of 29,000 pages
of written material and hundreds of proposals, the Energy Department
earlier this year released its National Energy Strategy. Known as the
NES, this is a wide-ranging list of particular recommendations for
every type of energy and just about every energy issue.
<P>   The report comes at a time of much confusion about America's
energy situation and the policies that will best guarantee America's
energy security. For example, figures recently released by the Energy
Department show the country's oil imports dropping by around 1 million
barrels per day or 12 percent of the country's total use. While some
observers might thus assume that there is no energy problem, in the
long term America's energy needs will increase. More energy will have
to be produced domestically or imported from overseas. In addition,
Congress is considering a higher gas tax. Such a tax would increase
costs for consumers and businesses, reducing American competitiveness
and lowering American living standards. At the levels of taxes being
discussed, perhaps ten cents per gallon, oil consumption would not be
significantly reduced. A tax of, say, 50 cents per gallon would reduce
consumption dramatically -- by bringing the American economy to a
halt. This is hardly a result acceptable to most policy makers.

<P> Sound Recommendations. On the whole, the report is well balanced
and its recommendations sound. Its major dual message is the need to
reduce or eliminate government regulations that discourage energy
production and the need to free entrepreneurs to meet America's energy
needs. 

<P> As important as what the NES does, however, is what the NES does
not do. In particular, it avoids many of the disastrous errors of the
1970s, when the federal government believed that it could control
America's energy supply and demand. The results of this are well
known: soaring energy prices, block-long gas lines, and uncertainty
about America's energy and economic future. To be sure, there are
shortcomings. The NES does tend to call for government research in
energy areas that might best be left to the private sector. And in
some cases the report could be more emphatic about the need for market
reforms. But if policy makers do follow the NES roadmap, in general
they will be taking America down the path to energy security.

<P> Among NES topics and recommendations:

<P> Energy Production and Efficiency. To promote both production and
efficiency, the NES suggests more deregulation of local electrical
monopolies, strict market pricing for electricity, and federal
government purchases of natural gas vehicles.

<P> Domestic Oil. To increase the domestic oil supply, the NES
recommends opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Outer
Continental Shelf to oil exploration.

<P> Western Hemisphere Energy Security. To reduce America's reliance
on oil from the politically unstable Middle East without raising costs
to consumers, the NES emphasizes negotiating freer energy trade and
investment in the Western Hemisphere.

<P> Natural Gas. To make maximum use of this clean energy source,
found in abundance in America, the NES suggests, among other things,
deregulating pipeline construction and pricing and removing
restrictions on imports and exports of natural gas.

<P> Domestic Coal. To make better use of this resource, also found
in abundance in America, the NES recommends a consistent and
predictable, rather than arbitrary, application of environmental laws,
using coal slurry pipelines and preventing the Environmental
Protection Agency from mandating specific technology and production
methods for coal plants.

<P> Nuclear Energy. The NES points out that this is a safe, non-
polluting energy source, and suggests research to develop better
designs for nuclear plants, to reform licensing procedures, and to
increase the potential sites for nuclear waste disposal.

<P> Renewable Energy and Electricity. The NES recommends removing
licensing restrictions on hydroelectric plants and continuing research
into nuclear fusion.
<P> A major NES failing is the scant attention that it gives some
key issues. For one thing, tax policy needs an overhaul. While the NES
suggests modest changes in the tax code, what is needed is a
restoration of all those tax code pressures dealing with the energy
industry that Congress has eliminated since 1969.

<P> For another thing, the NES should be more emphatic about
developing a Western Hemisphere common market for energy to diversify
supplies and reduce dependence on the Middle East. 

<P> These deficiencies, however, are dwarfed by the achievement of
the NES in presenting, for the first time, a comprehensive review of
America's energy situation and in offering many market-oriented
proposals for America's future energy security. 

<P> The NES already is prompting action on Capitol Hill. On June 4
the Senate Energy Committee approved S.1220, the National Energy
Security Act, co-sponsored by Bennett Johnston, the Louisiana
Democrat, and Malcolm Wallop, the Wyoming Republican. Essentially
similar to the Bush Administration's NES, the bill faces an uncertain
fate. Many amendments could be added to it that would make America
less energy secure. The House of Representatives is working on its own
version of a comprehensive energy bill. 

<P> The Free Market Acts. When Saddam Hussein overran Kuwait about a
year ago, crude oil prices shot to record levels. Some lawmakers urged
a return to the interventionist energy policies of the 1970s. The Bush
Administration wisely resisted this. Although the Iraqi crisis reduced
world crude oil production by 4.1 million barrels per day, roughly the
same as the 1973 Arab oil boycott and 1979 Iranian oil embargo, thanks
to the Bush Administration's response, the results were entirely
different. In both 1973 and 1979, emergency government controls
greatly aggravated the effects of the disruption. In 1990, the
Administration allowed the market to operate freely. As a result, the
oil price rise was brief, peaking last October. By this February oil
prices fell to below prewar levels. There were no 1970s-style gas
lines.

<P> History demonstrates that the best government role in the energy
sector is to assure that markets operate without hindrance. Markets,
as even East European leaders now recognize, are the most efficient
means of allocating resources. Yet federal government restrictions
continue to impede the market's function in energy. Removing these
obstacles deserves a high priority if America is to achieve energy
security. 
<P>
AMERICA'S ENERGY SITUATION

<P> The United States is a country rich in energy. Domestic coal,
natural gas, and oil are pillars of America's energy base. Still,
current patterns of production and consumption will have to change in
the future as known resources are exhausted. 

<P> Fossil fuels account for 89.2 percent of all energy used in the
U.S. Oil is America's most important energy source. Last year, oil
accounted for some 40 percent of American energy use. Next came
natural gas, accounting for 24 percent of consumption, followed by
coal at 23.3 percent. Nuclear energy contributed 7 percent of
America's needs, with the rest coming from hydroelectric dams, and
alternative energy sources. 

<P> Even these figures, though, understate the importance of oil.
Some 97 percent of all transportation energy comes from petroleum.
While alternative fuels have made modest inroads in the transportation
market, it will be a decade or more before they can offset oil
consumption significantly.

<P> This May, Americans used an average of 15,844,000 barrels per
day (b/d) of oil, roughly one million less than in 1990. During this
period, America's oil imports fell by 7.2 percent, from 8,649,000 b/d
to 8,027,000 b/d. Still, America relies on foreign oil for more than
half of its needs. More disturbing, America's oil production fell from
around nine million b/d in 1985 to roughly 7.3 million b/d in 1990, a
decline of almost 19 percent. 

<P> Though the Persian Gulf crisis spurred higher American oil
output, the boost was small and as it turns out, temporary. Of more
fundamental importance is the fact that America's "proved reserves" --
essentially the oil that America has on the shelf -- have declined by
over 27 percent since the 1973 Arab oil embargo.

<P> That America imports great quantities of oil is not, in itself,
a problem. The real concern is whether the level of imports leaves
America vulnerable to severe economic dislocation should foreign oil
supplies suddenly be disrupted. This was the case in the 1970s, when
two sudden and sharp price hikes rocked the American economy. When all
factors are taken into account, the combined effects of the 1973 Arab
oil embargo, and 1979 Iranian oil boycott cost America an astounding
$1.5 trillion between 1974 and 1984. 

<P> And the 1970s oil shocks occurred when U.S. oil imports were far
lower than they are today. America now imports over half its oil
compared with 34.8 percent in 1973. Some 27 percent of imports, or
11.8 percent of American consumption, comes from the Persian Gulf,
primarily from Saudi Arabia. The price hike that followed the invasion
of Kuwait cost American consumers nearly $39 billion in higher oil
prices. 

<P> To hedge against abrupt interruptions of oil supplies from
abroad, the U.S. government maintains 587.5 million barrels of crude
oil stored in its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). If all imports
from all sources were cut off, the SPR would last about 75 days at
current rates of consumption. Not much more oil could be obtained at
short notice from American sources. The Energy Department estimates
that even under the most favorable circumstances domestic oil
production in the past year could have been increased by only about
100,000 b/d -- and this would have taken about a year. 

<P> Thus security of supply is a fundamental consideration in
American energy policy. This is recognized by NES. Its recommendations
aim at a secure energy future achieved through market-based actions
that improve efficiency, enhance security of supply, assure a clean
environment, and fortify the foundations of America's energy economy. 
<P>
INCREASING ENERGY AND ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY

<P> The NES devotes 42 of its 189 pages to energy conservation,
attained by boosting energy efficiency. While it is true that the
document does not call for the sorts of mandates, regulations, and
subsidies that were in favor during the 1970s, the dismal failure of
those measures readily justifies their absence. Instead, the NES makes
concrete suggestions for energy efficiency improvements for
electricity generation, residential and commercial buildings use,
industrial use, and transportation.
<P>
** Electricity

<P> Most electricity is generated by utility companies, which are
local monopolies closely regulated by state and federal authorities.
This system stifles competition and is inefficient. The NES addresses
these shortcomings by seeking increased competition within the
electricity market. To do this, the NES proposes amending the 56-year-
old Public Utility Holding Company Act to permit utilities to build,
own, and operate power plants outside their traditional service area.
The NES also would eliminate size restrictions on so-called
Independent Power Producers (IPPs) -- firms that are not part of a
public utility, but that build and operate plants that sell
electricity to utilities. Current size restrictions prevent IPPs from
competing with traditional utilities for the construction of new
generating capacity. 

<P> The NES also supports efforts by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) to allow IPPs to use existing electricity
transmission lines owned by local electric utility monopolies.
Currently, local monopolies need not permit IPPs access to such lines.
To expand operations, IPPs must have access to transmission
facilities.

<P> The NES also recommends eliminating subsidies to the federal
Power Marketing Authorities -- or PMAs. Established in 1906 to
distribute the electricity generated by federal water projects, the
PMAs sell power to their customers at prices below market cost; the
taxpayer absorbs the difference. To date, PMAs have cost the Treasury
$4 billion. As a result, PMA customers predictably waste "inexpensive"
electricity. Phasing out the huge subsidies to PMAs would encourage
conservation and promote general economic efficiency, ending the waste
of taxpayer dollars. 
<P>
** Commercial and Residential Energy Efficiency

<P> Residential use accounts for around 20 percent of American
energy consumption. Each year, 90 million American households spend
around $100 billion for heating, lighting, cooking, and other uses.
Commercial buildings account for about 15 percent of total energy
consumption, and about $70 billion in annual outlays.

<P> Residential use of energy dropped by about one-third between
1962 and 1986 because of efficiency improvements in appliances, and
investments by homeowners in energy-saving measures. Yet the use of
the various kinds of fuel consumed to generate power for homeowners
increased as they shifted away from oil and coal for space heating and
water heating. The fastest growing end users of primary energy,
meanwhile, are commercial buildings, as a result of the spread of air-
conditioning and the proliferation of computers, copiers, printers,
and other office equipment.

<P> A main obstacle identified by the NES to improving residential
and commercial energy efficiency are government regulations that
prevent energy prices from reflecting fully the real costs of
generating the energy. Another obstacle is that government-owned
housing is insulated from market forces and public housing authorities
feel no competitive need to increase energy efficiency. 

<P> NES recommendations for commercial and residential energy mainly
aim to spur research and development and education. The NES recognizes
that conservation must be market-driven. One flaw in the NES
recommendation, however, is the call for government efficiency
standards for residences and commercial buildings. Mandating
efficiency in buildings was attempted in the 1970s without success. 
<P>
** Industrial Energy Efficiency

<P> The industrial sector accounts for about one-quarter of American
energy consumption. Industrial energy conservation as a response to
market forces is one of the great success stories of the American
energy economy. Between 1973 and 1989, the value of goods and services
produced in America rose by 50 percent in real terms; the amount of
energy required to produce these actually fell by 6 percent. Private
industry reflexively responded to high energy prices by conserving
energy. 

<P> The NES's primary recommendation to improve industrial energy
efficiency is additional funding for research and development to help
firms find new ways to use waste as a fuel. Yet industries already
spend an estimated $46 billion annually for pollution control. Thus
industry already has a strong financial incentive to find ways to use
waste as a fuel. This is because the process of using waste products
to generate energy consumes many pollutants. NES also recommends
increased use of energy audits by industry. Such audits permit firms
to identify areas in which they can reduce energy consumption and thus
save money with existing technologies. The federal Department of
Energy's help in this is particularly important for small - and
medium-sized firms, which often lack the technical capability to
perform such audits themselves. 
<P>
** Transportation Energy Use

<P> The greatest opportunity for improving American energy
efficiency is in transportation. Last year Americans spent $200
billion on transportation fuels, accounting for two-thirds of
petroleum use and one-fourth of total energy consumption. Since 1976,
the amount of oil consumed by transportation has exceeded American
domestic production. Petroleum use for transportation is expected to
continue growing, rising to more than 42 percent of total energy use
by 2010, and to 66 percent by 2030.

<P> For transportation, the most important NES recommendation
encourages the use of alternative fuels. In principle this is sound.
Yet the NES shies away from evaluating specific alternative fuels. The
only exception is the NES recommendation to extend an already existing
tax credit to oil companies for using ethanol. Because of this tax
break, "gasohol," a blend of 10 percent ethanol/90 percent gasoline,
accounts for about 10 percent of the gasoline supply. This means that
ethanol is replacing about 1 percent of the gasoline, a very tiny
amount. The NES should have evaluated the merits of alternative fuels.
Had it done so, it probably would have concluded that natural gas is
the most promising alternative.
<P>
FLEET CONVERSION TO NATURAL GAS

<P> For America, natural gas is a good substitute for gasoline for
transportation. First, America has an abundance of natural gas. Were
it used in place of oil in all domestic fleet vehicles, current levels
of consumption could be maintained for more than a half-century.
Second, natural gas is clean burning and, as a gasoline substitute,
would reduce air pollution. 

<P> Natural gas would be best suited as a gasoline substitute in
fleet vehicles operated by a single owner such as a taxi company, a
delivery service, or a local government. Although comprising 6.5
percent of the total vehicle population, fleet vehicles consume
approximately 10 percent of all motor fuel. The $2,000 to $3,000 cost
for converting an engine to burn natural gas is currently a deterrent
to fleet use of this fuel. Were there greater demand, however,
vehicles could be equipped at the factory to use natural gas. This
would cut costs from 50 percent to 70 percent. Chrysler Corporation
and General Motors plan to establish experimental production lines for
alternative fueled cars and trucks. United Parcel Service and other
firms are converting part of their fleets. Local governments too may
want to buy natural gas vehicles to help meet air quality regulations.
Even at the current prices, the cost of converting fleets to natural
gas, the amount can be recovered in slightly over three years thanks
to lower fuel and operating costs. 

<P> Fueling Federal Fleets. The NES wisely calls for more public
education on the benefits of alternative fuel vehicles. Better still
is the NES suggestion that the federal government buy natural gas
vehicles for its fleets. The federal government owns more than 200,000
motor vehicles, and in fiscal 1990 alone purchased 49,188 civilian
vehicles. Federal purchases of natural gas vehicles would create
enough demand to justify the mass production lines that significantly
reduce costs. 

<P> This April 17, George Bush issued an Executive Order requiring
federal agencies to purchase as many alternative-fuel vehicles as
possible, and to compute cost/benefit ratios for the purchases on a
"lifecycle costing" basis. This means that the total cost of owning
and operating the vehicle over its useful life, rather than just its
purchase price, will be how a vehicle's cost is reckoned.

<P> Local governments, meanwhile, also could spur use of natural gas
by permitting gas utilities to supply natural gas for the vehicle fuel
market. Such sales would be part of what is termed a utility's "non-
core" business, which is not regulated because it is not part of a
utility's local monopoly. Allowing utilities to sell natural gas for
vehicles would introduce new competition and reduce fuel costs. 

<P> Increased demand for natural gas as a fuel for vehicles will cut
the prices of all aspects of this market. Example: It now costs from
$2,500 to $3,500 to buy a home compressor which can be attached to a
residential natural gas line to fuel a natural gas vehicle. If mass-
produced, the price could drop to under $1,000. A gas utility could
install such a unit and recover its cost over, say, five years through
fuel sales. As the number of natural gas vehicles increased, utilities
could also install natural gas compressors at gasoline filling
stations. Several already exist in the Washington, D.C., area. To do
this, however, utilities must be allowed to sell natural gas fuel as a
non-core business.
<P>
DOMESTIC OIL SECURITY

<P> The principal problems addressed by the NES are the potential
dangers to America's energy supplies. Oil is the most important
component of the U.S. energy mix, accounting for 42 percent of all
energy consumed and more than 97 percent of all transportation fuel.
Last year Americans consumed an average of 17 million b/d. U.S.
domestic production, however, has been falling, from just under 9
million b/d in 1985 to 7.3 million b/d in 1990. This is roughly 19
percent in domestic oil production. As a result, last year Americans
paid some $55 billion for net oil imports. This figure could rise to
$200 billion by 2010 according to Energy Department statistics. In the
first half of the year oil imports actually fell by one million b/d,
or about 12 percent of the total from the previous year. But this was
due to factors other than a change in America's long-term energy
production and consumption trends. First, due to uncertainty over the
situation in the Persian Gulf, American oil companies drew on their
own stored supplies and therefore required less imports. And second,
the recession dampened oil consumption, thereby reducing some of the
need for imported and domestically produced oil. The NES recommends
reducing U.S. vulnerability to oil "shocks" by encouraging increased
domestic oil production.
<P>
** The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge

<P> The NES recommends opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
(ANWR) to oil exploration. Originally established in 1980 under
Section 1002 of the Alaskan National Interest Lands Conservation Act,
ANWR covers 19 million acres of Alaska's northernmost territory. About
8 percent of this area holds high promise for petroleum exploration.
According to the Energy Department, it may contain more oil than
Alaska's Prudhoe Bay, the largest North American oil field discovered
to date. 

<P> Opponents of exploration in ANWR claim that development would
harm wildlife. Yet more than a decade of experience at Prudhoe Bay,
which steadily produces an average of 1.8 million b/d of oil,
demonstrates that oil can be extracted in the Arctic without damaging
the environment. The 1990 Exxon Valdez spill occurred because of
deficiencies in the transportation system, not in drilling. 

<P> Oil output from production in Prudhoe Bay soon will begin
declining. Unless ANWR is developed, output from Alaska will steadily
fall. With ANWR, however, Alaska could keep pumping around 1.8 million
b/d or even more. The NES conservatively estimates ANWR's potential
output at 870,000 b/d by the year 2005. Oil from ANWR also would
extend the life of the Prudhoe Bay field. This is because without
ANWR, the volume of oil from Prudhoe Bay eventually will fall below
the level required to operate the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. 
<P>
** The Outer Continental Shelf

<P> The NES also recommends expanded drilling for new oil on the
Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), a portion of the Continental Plate
extending underneath the ocean's surface. The OCS is believed to
contain 7.5 billion barrels of oil and 9.4 trillion cubic feet of
natural gas; this would be 26 percent of America's undiscovered oil
and natural resources.    The Reagan Administration proposed orderly
development of OCS oil and gas resources in a way that would protect
the environment. This was blocked by a series of lawsuits and
congressional actions. Development of the OCS was further delayed when
the Bush Administration halted leasing in several OCS areas including
the coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington, the North Atlantic
coast, and a portion of the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. This leaves only
portions of the Gulf of Mexico and Mid and South Atlantic available
for development. The freeze on new leases apparently remains in force
for most of these areas until 1996, ostensibly to allow environmental
and economic studies. Some OCS areas off California, however, will not
be available for leasing until the year 2000. 

<P> Environmental concerns obviously are important. But so is
American energy security. The two do not exclude each other.
Technological advances in recent years have reduced significantly the
chances of spills from offshore drilling. In fact, there have been no
major spills at U.S. offshore facilities since 1969 when a well off
the coast of Santa Barbara, California, blew out, fouling miles of
beach. Safety measures developed as a result of this spill make a re-
occurrence unlikely. Today, indeed, there is far less environmental
risk from drilling offshore wells and transporting oil to shore by
pipeline than there is from transporting oil from other nations by
tankers. 

<P> The NES recommends that those areas in which leasing has been
halted be considered for inclusion in a five-year leasing plan being
drafted by the Department of the Interior. The NES also suggests that
Congress ban none of the new areas under consideration for the five-
year leasing plan until a study is completed that weighs resource
potential and environmental effects of energy development.
<P>
** The Tax Problem

<P> For more than two decades, unfavorable tax treatment of the oil
industry has contributed significantly to the decline of American
domestic oil production. Addressing this, the NES recommends some tax
code changes. These would give somewhat more favorable tax treatment
to so-called "marginal oil production." This is the output from wells
that are nearly exhausted. The NES also calls for better tax treatment
for "unconventional" natural gas production, such as that from coal
seams. 

<P> In its proposed tax changes, the NES stops far short of what is
needed to remove the tax code's penalties on domestic oil production.
The oil industry is treated more harshly by the tax code than any
other sector of the economy. Since 1969, for example, most oil
producers have lost what is knowm as "the depletion allowance." This
is the accounting mechanism that recognizes that as oil is extracted
from the ground, the oil company's capital is depleted -- just as a
manufacturing firm's capital would be depleted as machinery
deteriorated. The depletion allowance for mineral development is the
equivalent of depreciation for a manufacturing business. It is an
allowance that is used as a deduction from taxable income. Loss of the
depletion allowance of course drives up the cost of oil production in
America.

<P> Also driving up the cost is the 1976 law, enacted by Congress
and approved by Gerald Ford, that imposes a minimum tax on what it
called "intangible drilling costs." These typically are the costs of
building roads to oil well sites, of the "muds" used to lubricate the
rotating shaft of an oil rig, and of the energy used to operate the
rig. Such costs from 1976 to last year were taxed at 10 percent of
their value. Last year's tax hike package boosted this tax to 24
percent. The tiny tax credit given to the oil industry last year
offers little real relief. Why drilling costs themselves should be
taxed is, of course, the question. In every other industry these would
be treated as normal business expenses to be deducted from revenues.
Yet for oil drillers they are effectively treated as income.

<P> Further adding to the burden on the oil industry is the 1980
special tax on oil companies to finance the Superfund, the federal
program to clean hazardous waste sites. Other taxes harm the oil
industry as well. Taxes on refined petroleum products were increased
several times for such diverse reasons as to fund mass transit and
help reduce the deficit. These taxes are imposed specifically on the
oil industry; other industries do not pay them.    A 1987 Energy
Department report on energy security concludes that American oil
production would be increased were the full depletion allowance
restored. The report also calls for a 5 percent tax credit for oil
exploration and development costs and for the removal of tax penalties
on the industry. Taken together, these changes would add 1,233,000 b/d
to domestic production within a decade. While the 1987 report also
found that these changes would reduce Treasury revenues by $7.622
billion over roughly the same period, it failed to take into account
the new revenues that would be received by the Treasury from wages
paid to workers employed to develop the new oil, and from royalties on
oil and gas produced on federal lands. With these new revenues, the
Treasury would collect an extra $40 billion over the decade.
<P>
WESTERN HEMISPHERIC ENERGY SECURITY

<P> The NES strongly supports developing non-Persian Gulf oil
supplies. The NES specifically targets Eastern Europe and the Western
Hemisphere for development. The NES also urges a review of U.S. laws
to ensure they do not discourage energy development. If production
outside the Persian Gulf is not encouraged, 41 percent of world oil
supplies will come from that region by the year 2010. Known oil
reserves outside the Persian Gulf total about 337 billion barrels;
this is about half the 654 billion barrel reserve in the Persian Gulf.

<P> The greatest opportunity for expanding secure production outside
the Persian Gulf is in the Western Hemisphere. The nations of North
and South America have proved oil reserves of over 156 billion barrels
and natural gas reserves of over 518 trillion cubic feet. The
hemisphere also has 30 percent of the world's coal reserves and 42
percent of its hydroelectric power capacity. 

<P> Latin American countries, of course, generally are more
politically stable and friendlier to the U.S. than are Middle Eastern
countries. 

<P> To increase use of the Western Hemisphere's energy resources,
energy trade should be allowed to flow freely across the borders of
all nations in the Americas through the creation of a common market
for energy. The Western Hemisphere readily could meet its own energy
needs, and even export energy. Latin America could produce as much as
3.5 million more b/d. 

<P> For Latin America, increased energy trade with the U.S. could
help reduce the enormous Latin American foreign debt. For the U.S.,
increased reliance on hemispheric energy sources would improve energy
security. To increase cooperation on energy trade within the
hemisphere, a number of steps must be taken. One of the most important
is the elimination of barriers to foreign investment common in Latin
America. 

<P> The U.S. and Canada made a good start towards a hemispheric
common market in energy with their 1988 Free Trade Area agreement. It
provides for unrestricted oil and electricity trade across borders.
Natural gas so far is not covered by the agreement, since it is highly
regulated in both countries. 

<P> A key element to an energy free trade area would be the
reduction and eventual elimination of laws, especially in Mexico and
the Latin American countries, that prohibit foreign investment in
resource development, or set confiscatory tax rates on profits from
such investments.
<P>
** The Venezuelan Example

<P> A promising development is the proposed Cristobal/Colon joint
venture in Venezuela. The project involves the export of liquefied
natural gas (LNG) from Venezuela to the U.S. The partners include
Exxon Corporation, Royal Dutch/Shell Group, Mitsubishi Corporation,
and a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela, the Venezuelan National
Oil Company. This is the first time in decades that Venezuela is
permitting foreign participation in an energy project. Venezuela is
expected soon to revise its tax laws to make the Cristobal/Colon
project economically viable. A successful Cristobal/Colon project
could serve as a model for cooperation throughout the Hemisphere. The
government of Argentina, meanwhile, is privatizing its oil industry,
one of the most inefficient in the Hemisphere. This should increase
production and foreign participation and give Argentina an incentive
to seek freer energy trade in the Hemisphere. Though Mexico still
resists privatizing its oil industry or allowing foreign companies to
own equity shares in the industry, this will be addressed in the
current U.S.-Mexico free trade area talks.
<P>
DOMESTIC NATURAL GAS

<P> Natural gas accounts for more than one-fifth of America's
primary energy, and is used to heat nearly half of all homes. The NES
cites natural gas as one of the most promising alternatives to oil,
suggesting that it could replace up to 600,000 b/d of oil use by 1995,
and 1.7 million b/d by 2000. 

<P> Natural gas when burned as fuel produces less air pollution than
oil or coal, and the technology to convert from oil to natural gas is
well established. Most important, America has natural gas in vast
quantities.

<P> Natural gas competes directly with oil in the industrial boiler
fuel market, with natural gas accounting for 37 percent and oil only
36 percent of all industrial energy used in 1989. Coal accounts for
most of the balance. Virtually all of the oil burned in industrial
boilers, or roughly 24.7 percent of total American oil consumption,
could be replaced by natural gas. Many boilers are designed to use
either fuel and can be switched back and forth in response to the
relative price of the two fuels. 
<P>
** Pipeline Construction Barriers

<P> The NES finds that statutory and regulatory impediments are
reducing American natural gas usage by 1 trillion cubic feet per year.
This amount could displace 470,000 b/d of oil. In some cases,
particularly in the Northeast, industrial boilers cannot use natural
gas because there are no pipelines to deliver it. Pipeline
construction often is stymied by a federal regulatory approval process
which can take five times as long as it does for the actual pipeline
to be built. 

<P> The cumbersome regulatory system was designed in the days when
some pipeline firms enjoyed near monopoly power in some regions.
Today, with over 1.3 million miles of pipeline and a choice of routes
available in most cases, monopoly no longer is a problem. Yet the
antiquated approval process remains, hurting rather than protecting
the consumer. Reducing regulations would speed pipeline construction,
significantly lower transportation costs, and make natural gas more
attractive as a fuel.

<P> The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the body that
oversees approval of interstate natural gas pipelines and regulates
their rates, recognizes the problem and is trying to reform its
procedures administratively with the support of the Bush White House.
The NES endorses this and suggests clarifying confusing provisions of
the 1938 Natural Gas Policy Act. It recommends that pipeline companies
be allowed to proceed without federal certification if they forego the
right to exercise federal eminent domain in obtaining the private
property needed for the pipeline. Under current regulations, federal
certification of a pipeline entitles the pipeline company to invoke
eminent domain.
<P>
** Natural Gas Pipeline Pricing

<P> The price that natural gas pipelines charge for their services
has been regulated by Washington since the Natural Gas Act of 1938.
The NES calls for a reversal of this and for deregulation of pipeline
prices so long as pipeline customers have access to alternative
sources of energy supplies. Today, pipeline companies can refuse to
transport natural gas for producers not affiliated with them. But
because these companies usually enjoy a monopoly in their service
areas, such refusals restrict competition. Requiring pipeline
companies with local, government-supported monopolies to transport
natural gas for other companies would improve competition.

<P> The NES recommends reforming the pipeline rate structure to
encourage efficient use. Current rules often force pipeline owners to
charge higher prices for their services during periods of low use, to
cover the pipeline costs even though demand is low. Conversely, during
periods of peak use, pipeline owners are forced to underprice their
services to avoid making profits higher than those allowed by the
regulators. The NES suggests that FERC permit pipeline owners to sell
their excess capacity during periods of low use, and to buy additional
capacity from other pipelines during peak periods. This would help
even out the pipeline transportation load and increase efficiency. 
<P>
** Regulation of Gas Imports and Exports

<P> Natural gas imports and exports are regulated by the Department
of Energy. America last year imported about 8 percent of its natural
gas, primarily from Canada. By the year 2000, American natural gas
imports are expected to rise to around 12 percent of natural gas
consumption, and by 2010 to 14 percent. The U.S exports a small amount
of liquefied natural gas to Japan. Vast amounts of Alaskan natural gas
could be sold to Japan were it not for the federal limits on exports.
The NES recommends ending the Energy Department's authority over gas
import and export transactions. 

<P>
DOMESTIC COAL

<P> Coal is America's most abundant fuel, accounting for 90 percent
of American energy resources. Coal use has grown sharply in recent
years. In 1970, for example, the U.S. consumed 523.2 million tons of
coal, in 1980, 702.7 million tons, and in 1990, 894.6 million tons,
accounting for 23 percent of American energy needs. By 2010, American
coal use could rise to 1.6 billion tons. Coal also is a major export,
with more than 100 million tons sold last year. Increased use of coal,
however, could be hindered by the tightened environmental regulations
in the Clean Air Act of 1990. The NES cites the Energy Department's
Clean Coal Technology (CCT) program, initiated in 1986, as a way to
permit increased coal use and still protect the environment. To
accelerate the CCT program, the NES recommends reforming federal coal
leasing policies, reforming regulations concerning coal mining safety
and health, and encouraging greater use of coal slurry pipelines. 
<P>
** Promoting Coal Production

<P> The Clean Coal Technology Program aims at developing new
technologies to burn coal cleaner, with less pollution. For the CCT to
succeed, sufficient quantities of low-sulfur coal must be burned. Much
of this type of coal is on federal land. The NES recommends that the
Department of Interior's Federal Coal Leasing Program insure that
adequate low-sulfur coal areas are offered for lease. At the same
time, NES calls on the Bureau of Mines to continue research and
development on technologies to address environmental concerns about
underground coal mining. It also calls for continued tax credits for
extracting the marketable methane gas found in the underground coal
beds. 
<P>
** Regulatory Reform 

<P> The NES stresses the need to eliminate the uncertainty about the
kind of environmental regulations that are to be imposed under the
1977 Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. This act has been
inconsistently applied. Reform is especially important to low-sulfur
coal production, most of which is extracted from surface mines.

<P> The NES also calls for performance-based standards for mine
safety and health regulations. Adopting performance-based standards,
where results, rather than specific federally-imposed methods, are
used to measure compliance, will permit a more rapid introduction of
technological improvements and improve worker safety.
<P>
** Coal Slurry Pipelines

<P> Coal slurry pipelines, in which pulverized coal mixed with water
is transported as a liquid, reduce coal transportation costs. Since
almost all prospective slurry pipeline routes will cross over or under
highways, rail lines, and other private property, slurry pipelines
require that government exercise the right of eminent domain to obtain
the right-of-way for the pipelines. This is done for right-of-way for
electric wires, roads, and rails. Because slurry pipelines use large
amounts of water, there has been great opposition to granting pipeline
builders eminent domain in Western states where water is scarce. Yet
large deposits of low-sulfur coal are in the West, and rail transport
of the coal to Eastern markets is much more costly than transport by
slurry pipelines. The NES correctly supports granting eminent domain
to slurry pipeline builders once all questions concerning water rights
and usage have been satisfied.
<P>
** Clean Air Act Amendments

<P> The Clean Air Act of 1990 mandates that annual emissions of
sulfur dioxide in the U.S. by the year 2000 will be at least 10
million tons below the 1980 level. The act further decrees that the
emissions level reached in the year 2000 will never be exceeded. The
act requires existing coal-burning electric utility plants to install
expensive devices to control emissions of nitrogen oxides. 

<P> These new requirements could seriously constrain American coal
use. While accepting the clean air goal set by the 1990 act, the NES
stresses that the goal can be met by accelerating the Clean Coal
Technology Program. This would be much less costly to the economy than
the devices called for by the Clean Air Act.
<P>
** The WEPCO Decision

<P> When the first Clean Air Act was passed in 1970, most existing
electrical generating plants were exempted from the new air quality
rules. At the time it was assumed that existing plants soon would be
replaced by new facilities that would be subject to the law. Yet, as
the expense and difficulties associated with building new electrical
generating plants increased, utilities typically decided to refurbish
existing plants rather than build new ones. In 1988, a decision by the
Environmental Protection Agency involving a plant refurbished by the
Wisconsin Electric Power Company (WEPCO) held that when a utility
makes "non-routine" changes in the operation, repair, or maintenance
of a unit, the plant may become subject to air quality rules. This
meant that the utility was required to install specific pollution
control devices mandated by regulations.

<P> Skyrocketing Cost. The effect of this decision on the WEPCO
plant was enormous. The capital cost for refurbishment jumped from $80
million to $120 million. It became necessary to cut the plant's size
from 400 megawatts to 320 megawatts. As a result, the cost of re-
outfitting the WEPCO plant rose by 87.5 percent overall. Worse still,
the EPA indicated that it will determine what constitutes a "non-
routine" refurbishment case by case. As a result, utilities deciding
how to meet future power requirements must assume that any
refurbishment will fall under the WEPCO precedent. 

<P> The WEPCO decision illustrates the uncertainties that the
inconsistent and unpredictable application of regulations can
introduce into the market. The NES correctly suggests that the Energy
Department work with the EPA to identify the areas of regulation that
create planning uncertainties for electric utilities with older
plants, and strive to make the revisions necessary to clarify them. A
more basic question, however, as with the WEPCO decision, is whether
the EPA will continue to resist performance-based standards for public
utilities. Unlike the more traditional command and control "cookbook"
approach, such standards emphasize results. If EPA resists this
approach, the Administration should take direct action against EPA to
assure the adoption of such sound policy.
<P>
NUCLEAR POWER

<P> Although nuclear plants generate around 20 percent of American
electricity, for all practical purposes American nuclear energy
development is at a standstill. Because of public opposition and
excessive regulation, no new nuclear plants have been ordered in
America since 1978; only three remain scheduled for construction. More
than 100 orders have been cancelled or deferred. 

<P> Still, nuclear energy remains an attractive way to generate
electricity. It is clean and relatively safe. America has huge
deposits of uranium, the source of nuclear fuel. The NES estimates
that America will need from 190 gigawatts to 275 gigawatts of new
electrical generation capacity by the year 2010 (a gigawatt is one
billion watts). Currently it takes two coal-fired plants or one
nuclear plant to produce a gigawatt. Most of America's added energy
will be generated by large, centralized plants, known as "base load
generation." These are best suited to nuclear power.

<P> To give nuclear energy a new chance, the NES addresses several
important issues.
<P>
** Advanced Powerplant Designs

<P> The accidents at the Three Mile Island nuclear facility in
Pennsylvania in 1979 and at the Chernobyl facility in Ukraine in 1986
heightened public concern over plant safety. Since 1979, the
Department of Energy has been researching advanced light-water
reactors (ALWRs), which will be safer than current designs. By 1995,
the ALWR design should be complete and a prototype could be operating
by 2000. Other advanced designs are also being developed. Among the
most promising is the Modular High-Temperature Gas Reactor. With it,
if all external power systems were to fail, the reactor would simply
shut itself down. The NES endorses these research and development
efforts.
<P>
** Licensing Reform and Design Standardization

<P> Delays encountered in licensing nuclear power plants long have
been among the nuclear industry's greatest problems. The licensing
process in America can take up to fifteen years compared to less than
five years in Japan or France. Unlike other governments, Washington
reserves key licensing approvals until after a plant is built. As a
result, a utility can have a completed plant costing a billion dollars
sitting idle because of a regulatory delay.

<P> This process is complicated further by the tendency of electric
utilities to order unique designs for each plant. This subjects each
plant to its own exhaustive review process. In France and Japan, by
contrast, it has long been the practice to use standardized models for
nuclear plants. Besides reducing licensing delays, standardization is
believed to improve safety by reducing the number of new and untried
components. The NES agrees that power plant designs should be
standardized so that reviews need take place only once. 
<P>
** Managing High-Level Nuclear Waste

<P> Another major problem facing the nuclear industry is the growing
backlog of undisposed high-level nuclear waste, that is, highly
radioactive byproducts of nuclear power production that require
special disposal. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 directs the
Department of Energy to establish a permanent repository for such
waste, and a monitored retrievable storage facility (MRS) to hold the
waste prior to permanent disposal. Yet just about all localities
strongly oppose being the site of these repositories. As with other
problems facing the nuclear industry, establishing these repositories
is as much a matter of public perception as of technology. Although
the NES suggests that Congress establish disposal sites, the political
battle surrounding such decisions will result in further delays.
<P>
RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES

<P> Renewable energy sources are those that are not depleted. The
three principal renewable sources in America are hydroelectric power,
geothermal power, and ethanol, produced from corn, grains, and other
biological material. Solar power is a much less important renewable
source. In 1990, renewable energy supplied 8 percent of American
energy needs. Of this, about 47 percent came from hydroelectric dams.
Solar power of all types accounted for under 6 percent of all
renewable energy and less than one half of one percent of American
energy needs. Renewable energy sources other than hydroelectric power
or wood have grown in importance significantly since 1970, when they
were virtually nonexistent. The NES strongly endorses the use of
renewable energy, and calls for continued research and development in
this area. 
<P>
** Renewable Energy and Electricity

<P> The NES recommends removing from the Public Utility Regulatory
Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) restrictions on the size of renewable
energy plants. These restrictions are a holdover from the Carter
Administration's emphasis on so-called "soft-path" energy schemes,
which emphasized small-scale plants. These provisions made neither
economic nor technological sense.

<P> All hydro-electric plants are licensed by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, and the licenses periodically must be renewed.
The licensing process has become extremely cumbersome. The NES
suggests exempting very small hydro projects from FERC regulation, and
streamlining the licensing process for all other plants.
<P>
** Ethanol

<P> In 1978, Congress allowed a five-cent per gallon exemption from
the federal gasoline tax for motor fuels blended with ethanol. And in
1980, the federal government granted a tax credit for refiners
producing gasoline blended with ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE), an
ethanol-based gasoline additive. Because ethanol is more expensive
than gasoline, its advocates believe a tax credit is warranted to
allow ethanol to compete with gasoline. A look at the performance of
ethanol in the market, however, suggests that such a credit is not
needed. With around 10 percent of all gasoline being blended with
ethanol or ETBE the need for the subsidy has passed. Ethanol is well
established in the market and now competes with gasoline additives in
about the same price range, rather than with gasoline. Clean Air Act
of 1990 regulations effectively require many motorists in urban areas
to use gasoline with ethanol, ETBE, or some similar additive. The NES
thus errs in recommending that the ethanol tax credit continue.
Instead, the subsidies for ethanol and ETBE should be eliminated. 
<P>
** Fusion

<P> Fusion long has held out the promise of tapping a virtually
inexhaustible supply of energy without endangering the environment and
without producing hazardous wastes. The NES calls for continued
support of fusion energy research. This is wise, yet too much should
not be expected of fusion soon. Under the most optimistic assessments,
the first practical fusion energy plants will not be available until
the year 2035. 
<P>
IMPROVING ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY

<P> The needs to make America more energy secure and to protect the
environment too often have been in conflict. Measures designed to
protect the environment often wasted energy or restricted the use of
such plentiful sources as coal. 

<P> The NES emphasizes the need to clarify uncertainties about some
environmental issues that have impeded energy development. Typical of
these issues are the claims about global climate change. NES stresses
that research on these issues is essential before imposing regulations
that could have disastrous economic consequences for American
industries. The NES does call for measures to reduce the emission of
"greenhouse gases," which may contribute to atmospheric warming, while
the global warming issue is being studied. But NES specifies that
these measures be limited to those justified for reasons other than
potential global climate change.

<P> The NES wisely rejects the notion of a so-called "carbon tax" to
discourage fossil fuel use. Some environmentalists call for a $135-
per-ton tax on the carbon content of fuels. This would damage the
American economy enormously. 
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P> In the past, talk in Washington of an "energy policy" has meant
cumbersome regulations, expensive new bureaucracies, and costly
"conservation" programs and gas lines. How much energy, if any, is
saved by these measures is debatable. What is not debatable is the
enormous economic pain inflicted on Americans. A sound energy policy
is not built on more regulations. A sound policy rather should remove
impediments to the energy market, eliminate barriers to energy
production, and facilitate innovation. This is what the National
Energy Strategy recommends. America's level of foreign oil imports is
too high -- not because oil imports are "bad" for America but because
dependence on oil from unfriendly and insecure parts of the world
carries the risk of future damaging economic shocks. 

<P> Removing Tax Bias. America can increase domestic energy
production and increase exploration to find new reserves if Congress
and the White house amend the tax code to remove the bias against
firms taking the risks necessary to find new energy supplies, if
Congress and the White House allow exploration in the most promising
areas for new oil discoveries, if Congress and the White House remove
the regulatory impediments now discouraging gas producers and
utilities from fostering greater use of natural gas, and if Congress
and the White House encourage conservation by permitting the market to
reflect the true cost of energy. 

<P> Americans, too, could move closer to secure foreign sources of
supply if the U.S. were to negotiate a common market for energy
throughout the Western Hemisphere.

<P> Core Strategy. Americans enjoy one of the world's highest
standards of living in large part because they have had ready access
to abundant, inexpensive sources of energy. Continued access to
abundant energy is essential to America's economic future, and history
teaches that the best way to achieve this access is to permit markets
to operate. Reliance on markets assures both abundant supplies and
judicious use. As such, above all else, the core of any national
energy strategy must be to permit markets to operate.

<title>Lugar Plan To Replace the Income Tax With a National Sales Tax</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<br>
<br>
<center>
<h3>Lugar Plan To Replace the Income Tax With A National Sales Tax</h3>
</center>
<br>
<br>
This proposal is aimed at addressing the basic problems afflicting the U.S. economy, as well as liberating Americans from the intrusive burden of the income tax.<p>
We cannot raise wages, create new jobs, or eliminate our national debt if the American economydoes not grow.  Nothing short of sustained economic growth will solve these problems and create opportunity for all Americans.<p>
Economists agree on a few things, but the vast majority agree that we will not grow if we do not save more and invest more.  Tinkering wiht the income tax system is not the answer.  Last year's reforms are reversed the following year.  This year's complexity is made more complex next year.  All the while, no significant improvement is achieved in the U.S. savings rate, and Americans struggle on with a needlessly complex and intrusive tax system.<p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>OUTLINE OF THE LUGAR PLAN</h4>
<br>
<br>
A National Sales Tax (NST) on goods and services would replace the federal personal and corporate income taxes.  The capital gains tax and the estate tax would be eliminated as well.<p>
Economists who have studied the national sales tax estimate that the NST rate of about 17% would replace the revenue generated by our current tax system.  The rate would be somewhat higher or lower depending on exemptions, although exemptions should be minimized.<p>
The federal government should work with the states to collect the national sales tax.  The federal government should ensure that it is done without extra cost to the states.  Most states already have sales tax collection systems in place.<p>
Social Security taxes and payment benefits would not be affected by this proposal, except that no
social security benefits would be taxed.<p>
The IRS would be eliminated.  A vastly smaller office or agency would be required to administer the national slaes tax and the FICA tax.  For most Americans, tax record keeping, audits, and filing of forms would be things of the past.<p>
Legislation to implement a national sales tax would have to reflect choices on a number of issues, including the methods used to prevent regressivity.  Any system of taxation requires such decisions.  Like the income tax, a national sales tax can be designed so that it is not regressive.<p>
As increased savings and investment fuels more economic growth, the sales tax should be lowered.<p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Advantages of the National Sales Tax</h3>
An NST will leave more money in American paychecks.  Because the government would no longer withold income taxes from paychecks, citizens would decide how much of their total income to save and how much to subject to taxation through purchases. <p> 
The NST would be a powerful incentive for savings in America.  Currently the United States has one of the lowest savings rates of any industiralized country.  According to a study by economist Laurence Kotlikoff, an NST would increase the savings rate from roughly 2% to about 7.6% in the first year.  Increasing the U.S. savings rate is a key to achieving strong economic growth, lower interests rates, improvements in real wages, and the expansion of revenue necessary to balance the budget.<p>
The national sales tax would allow for the dismantling of the current IRS and the intrusive, inefficient and costly enforcement of the current tax code.  Estimates of uncollected income tax range as hight as $150 billion per year.<p>
Businesses and individuals devote billions of man hours each year to comply with the tax code.  Under an NST, that time could be spent more productively on other activities.<p>
The simplicity of the NST and the absence of the IRS would have the effect of discouraging frequent tinkering with the tax code which complicates business activities, leads to loopholes for special interests, abd creates uncertainties for many Americans.  Thirty-one tax reforms have been enacted in the last 41 years.<p>
The NST, unlike the income tax or a value added tax (VAT), is transparent.  Individuals will know what they are paying to the government in taxes.  A transparent tax would contribute greatly to achieving the national political will to curb spending and balance the budget.<p>
Most states already have mechanisms in place to enforce a sales tax, and most taxpayers already understand how sales taxes work.  Therefore the establishment of a national sales tax could be achieved with a minimum of expense and confusion.<p>
American exports would no longer be put at a competitive disadvantage by the income tax.  Under our current system, the costs of corporate income taxes are built into the price of goods.  This raises the price of exports and make them less competitive overseas.  The NST would helpus export, thereby reducing the trade deficit and creating more jobs.  Economists estimate that for every additional $1 billion in exports, 20,000 jobs are created.  Imports, on the other hand, would be taxed at the time of sale, like all other goods.<p>
Under the NST, drug dealers and other criminals who currently escape or evade the income tax would pay the national sales tax like any other consumer.<p>
Because companies will not have to add the costs of the income tax to their products, the underlying price of most goods and services will be lower under and NST.<p>
An NST would end intrusive enforcement of the tax coe , which harms personal privacy.  It also would eliminate the ambiguity of the income tax, which causes many conscientious Americans to live in anxiety over the possibility of mistakes that could lead to penalties or charges.<p>
Although a flat tax would be a step in the right direction, an NST is preferable because the flat tax would retain many of the complexities of the current income tax system.  The IRS income tax collection aparatus would continue to exist.  Furthermore, the flat tax retains the corporate tax and the complexities involved in its calculation.  Also tinkering with the flat tax would be a constant temptation.  Many would seek to amend the tax code to promote special interests or social agendas.  The history of revisions to the 1986 Tax Reform Act demonstrates that the government  will always be tempted to ament the income tax code.<p>

<title>Testimony by Senator Richard Lugar

<center>
<h3>Testimony by Senator Richard Lugar<br>
In Front of the House Ways and Means Committee<br>
 June 8, 1995</h3>
</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Mister Chairman, I thank you for your strong leadership in the area of tax reform.  Your oft quoted comment that our current tax system should be "pulled out by the roots" has been an inspiration as I have traveled the country advocating the elimination of the federal income tax.<p>
What I have found during my travels is that American families are frustrated, and even angry, with their economic predicament.  They feel like they are running on a treadmill and that treadmill is winning 
The problem is that rnany Americans suspect there is diminishing hope for a better future. 
The economic facts justify these beliefs.  From 1950 through 1973, hourly compensation including both wages and benefits increased an average of 3.0 percent per year.  Since 1973, the average wage mcrease has been less than one half of one percent.  During the past two decades, economic growth has been cut in half averaging only 2.4 percent annually. And if this isn't depressing enough for the average American family, limiting growth to 2.5 percent is the stated economic policy of the Federal Reserve Board.<p>
This we must chance. The American public is demanding it.<p>
The cause of America's economic doldrums is twofold: the huge federal budget deficit that robs us of the capital we need to grow, and a federal tax stystem that not only discourages, but confiscates our savings and investment.<p>
Our net national savings rate has reached alarmingly low levels. After averaging close to 9.0 percent in the 1960's, we recemty saw our nation's savings rate bottom out at 1.1 percent in 1992.  Because of this low rate of savings, capital to fuel our economy has become increasingly scarce. As a result, our annual productivity gain has averaged just 1.1 percent from 1974 to 1994. The Concord Coaltion estimates that had our productivity held its pre 1974 annual rate of 2.9 percent, the median family income would now be $5O,000 a year instead of the current level of  S35,000 a year.<p>
Americans celebrate that both houses of Congress have now passed budget resolutions that will bring us to balance in seven years. We now face the more difficult task of actually implementing this budget guide m our spending measures. We must be resolute m this endeavor and not fall victim to buiness as usual in Washington.<p>
As part of the effort to balance the budget, I support providing the American public with tax relief But I strongly believe it is time to stop working around the edges of the tax code We must transform It completely.<p>
The federal income tax system is inherently flawed. By taxing savings and investment at least twice, it has become the biggest impediment to economic growth in tbe country. It represents the worst form of big govemment intrusion into the lives of all Americans. Each year it costs Americans morr than 5 billion hours of time to comply with it. That is equal to the tolal worker output of my state of Indiana.  It is unfair.  It is riddled with loopholes. It has been changed 31 times in the past 41 years. And finally, it doesn't work.<p>
By its own admission, the Internal Revenue Service fails to collect from nearly 10 million taxpayers, worth an estimated $127 billion in uncollected taxes annually.<p>
Anything this bad, this broken and this ineffective should be ended decisively, and that is what I propose. I want to scrap the income tax completely and replace it with a national sales tax.<p>
Mr. Chairman, you have outlined the criteria for evaluating an effective tax system. It must be: (1) simple, (2) the least intrusive (3) fair, (4) border adustable, and (5) friendly to savings and investment.  I have added that it also must be transparent.  I have studied all the recent tax proposals with these six factors in mind.  Many are better than the current tax systesm.  But f we are going to overhaul our tax system we should choose the one that meets these criteria.  I have concluded that a national sales tax is the best alternative.<p>
The first factor in choosing an effective tax system is its simplicity.  Under a national sales tax, tbe burden of complying with the income tax would be lifted.  There would be no records to keep or audits to fear.  The money a person makes is his or her own. You don't have to report it. You don't have to hide it. You may decide if you want to save it, mvest it, or give it to your children. It is only when you buy something that you pay a tax.  Although I applaud the efforts of  flat tax advocates to simplify tax forms, nothing could be more simple than no forms at all.<p>
The national sales tax is tbe least intrusive of the tax proposals. The IRS would be substantially dismantled under ny proposal.  The IRS would no longer look over the shoulders of every American.  There wil be no audits. Americans would not waste time and effort worrymg about record keeping, deductions or exemptions that are part of the current tax code. Although the flat tax proposals tax consumption, they do so by giving the income tax a facelift and leaving the IRS largely intact You have stated, Mr. Chairman, "If the roots remain, the tree will grow back"<p>
The national sales tax is the fairest. Everyone pays the tax including wealthy individuals, criminals illegal aliens, and others who currently avoid taxation.  Wealthy Americans who consume more would pay higher taxes under the national sales tax.  Individual who save and invest their money will pay less.  Gone are the loopholes and the deductions.<p>
The national sales tax would also tax the underground economy. When criminals and illegal aliens consume the proceeds of their activities, they will pay a tax. Foreign tourists will pay the tax.  Tax systems that rely on reporting will never collect any of this revenue.<p>
Of course, the fairness test must likewise consider those with limited means to pay taxes. An integral part of my plan is protection for Amencans who need it -- senior citzens, the unemployed, and Americans with low paying jobs.<p>
One strategy for addressing this problem would exempt a threshold level of goods and services
consumed from each American from the national slaes tax.  Each citizen who has a social security number will receive this exemption.  For example, if the exemption level were $5000, a family of four would have its first $20,0000 exempt from the sales tax.  This figure is approximately 33 percent above the 1994 poverty threshold for a family of four.<p>
Another strategy might be the exempting of items such as housing and medicine.  This is the method the majority of states have chosen and the one advocated by this committee's chairman.  Americans understand and are comfortable with this practice.  In the end it will be up to this committee and the Finance Committee in the Senate to decide the desirable path.<p>
The national sales tax is the most transparent of the tax reform proposals. A federal tax that is evident to everyone would bolster effiorts in Congress to achieve prudence m federal spending. There should be no hidden corporate taxes that are passed on to consumers or with holding mechanisms that mask the amount we pay in taxes.  Every year the public and Congress should openly debate the tax rate necessary for federal government to meet its obligations.  If average Americans are paying that rate everyday, they will make sure that Congress spends public funds wisely.<p>
American exports would also benefit from the enactment of a national sales tax.  In January, the United States registered one of tbe largest trade deficits in our nation's history. We must adopt a tax system that encourages exports. Most of our trading partners have tax systems that are border adjustable.  They are able to strip out their tax when they are exporting goods. In comparison the  income tax, and for that matter the flat tax, are not border adjustable.   American goods that are sent overseas are taxed twice -- once by the income tax and once when they reach their destination.  In comparison, the national sales tax would not be levied on exports.  It would level the playing field with our trading patners.  And best of all foreign imports would be taxed when they are consumed in the United States.<p>
Mr. Chairman, the last and most imperitive reason for replacing tbe income tax with a national sales tax is that it would liberate our economy by encouraging savings. For the first time in the modern era, the next generation of Americans may be worse off than the previous one.  Despite robust economic growth over the past several years, the average income of families has fallen.  They feel trapped in a box with diminishing hop of escaping.<p>
The bottom line is that as a nation, we do not save enough.  Savings are vital because they are
the source of all investment and productivity gains  -- savings supply the capital for buying anew machine, developing a new product or service, or employing an extra worker.  According to a recent poll, seventy two percent of Americans realize that they are not saving enough for the future.  Our net national savings rate in the 1990's has been 1.8 percent of GDP compared with a rate of 8.1 percent in the 1960's, 7.2 percent in the 1970's, and 3.7 in the 1980's.<p>
The Japanese save at a rate nine times greater than Americans greater than Americans and the Germans save five times as much as we do.  Today, many believe that Americans inherently consume beyond their means and cannot save enough for the future.  Few realize that before WWII, before the income tax reached its present form, Americans saved a larger portion of their earnings than the Japanese.<p>
A national sales tax would reeverse this trend by directly taxing consuption and leaving savings and investment untaxed.  Economists agree that a broad based consumption tax would increase our savings rate substantially.  Economist Laurence Kottlikoff of Boston University estimates that our savings rate would more than triple in the first year.  The implementation of a national sales tax is expected to create one million new jobs over a ten year period and a three percent rise in wages over that same period of time.  Economist Dale Jorgenson of Harvard Universityhas concluded that had a consumption tax like the national sales tax been put into place in 1986 instead of the current system, The U.S. would have experienced one trillion dollars in additional economic rowth.  Mr. Chairman, our citizens and our economy cannot afford to wait any longer.<p>
As I have outlined here today, I believe the national sales tax is the best tax system to replace the income tax.  It is simple.  It protects privacy.  It is fair and transparent.  And it promotes economically beneficial behavior.  For these reasons, I encourage it enactment.<p>

When July comes to mind one conjures up visions of backyard barbecues, sipping iced-tea on the
front porch, long weekends at the beach, or  Independence Day.  Summer is often thought of as a
less strenuous time, a time when "every night is a Saturday night," a time when Americans can
relax and escape from the burdens of everyday life.  Americans work all year so that in the
summer they may enjoy the fruits of their labor.  However, the reality is that this year the average
American had to work past Independence Day to pay their taxes.  Thus, from New years Eve to
July ninth Americans are working for the government -- that is 190 days out of the year.<p> 

There is little disagreement that our current tax system, in which the average American sends
40% of what they earn to the government, is severely flawed and must change. In describing our
current tax system, Grover G. Norquist, President of Americans For Tax Reform wrote that our
current system, "...favors consumption over investment, short term over long term horizons, debt
over equity, and service over manufacturing industry.."  Mr. Norquist continues by pronouncing
that: "The current tax code is a crazy hodge-podge of conflicting features for a single reason:
Once politicians get hold of a tax, they just can't let go.  As a result, minor fixes that could make
the current tax code much less a barrier to long-term growth just don't get made."  The numbers
back-up Mr. Norquist's claims.  A report on the IRS shows that over the past 10 years some 2000
tax code provisions have been released and the agency has doubled in size.<p> 

 Fortunately, the November elections have brought the tax debate to the forefront of political
discourse for the first time in thirty years.  Today, most politicians agree that the tax code is very
much in need of reform.  However, there is enormous disagreement on how this change should
be orchestrated.  Whether a conservative Republican or liberal Democrat, chances are you have a
plan to reform the tax code.<p>

From House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt who has attempted to bring the Democrats into
the great tax debate with his 10% progressive tax plan to House majority leader Dick Armey who
has spearheaded the tax debate by giving life to what has been dubbed the "Flat Tax," the
leadership of  both parties in the House are responding to the cries of the American people who
are demanding a fairer tax code.  Presidential hopeful Richard Lugar has also joined the debate,
coming out in support of House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer's National Sales Tax
proposal.  Whatever the plan may be one thing Washington can certainly agree on, whether for
philosophical or political reasons, is that Americans are demanding a new tax code, one that
allows them to work most of the year for themselves and their families.<p>  

Here are three of the most talked about plans.  Judge for yourself, the merits, (or lack- there-of)
for each, and then go to the Cyber Personality Forum to let people know what you think.  We
promise it won't be too "taxing."<p>

<TITLE>MAKING THE HOME OFFICE TAX DEDUCTION MORE AVAILABLE TO PARENTS</TITLE>

<H2>MAKING THE HOME OFFICE <BR>
TAX DEDUCTION MORE AVAILABLE TO PARENTS </H2>

<P>
People who do paid work from home so that they can care for their
children are presently in most cases denied any meaningful deduction
for their legitimate home-office expenses under the Internal Revenue
Code. Not only is this result inequitable for these taxpayers,
but it also puts them at a competitive disadvantage with their
colleagues who rent or own workspace away from home. Furthermore,
it discourages people who want to spend more time with their children
from establishing home-based businesses or from making a home-based
work arrangement with their employer.
<P>
Taxpayers who conduct a home business while caring for dependents,
particularly small children, often fail to qualify for the home-office
deduction under Section 280A of the Code, because it requires
that the space used for a home business to be used exclusively
for such purpose. The home-based businesswoman needing to keep
an eye on small children or struggling with one income needs to
be physically proximate to her children and may not be able to
afford a separate room or space used for no other purpose. In
either instance, no deduction is allowed for depreciation, rent
(if the taxpayer doesn't own his or her home), maintenance, utilities
and insurance expenses allocable to the home office space if,
for instance, the work room is used also as a family room or guest
bedroom.
<P>
In another related development, the IRS has taken the position
that day care providers (presently, the only home-based businesses
that are not required to satisfy the &quot;exclusive use&quot;
rule) must keep elaborate records on the time any room is used
for personal and business purposes. This recordkeeping requirement
would presumably apply to any future exceptions to the &quot;exclusive
use&quot; rule such as taxpayers who operate home businesses while
caring for dependents. It imposes an unworkable burden on the
home-based business not required of their non home-based competitors.
<P>
Moreover, the value of a new exception to the &quot;exclusive
use&quot; rule would be minimal unless the existing rule for allocating
time of use was amended.  Applying the existing allocation rule to a home-based business
where there is mixed use of space, even if the business were operating a full
40 hours per week, results in a deduction worth only 25 percent
of the amount a competitor in an office receives for the same
expenses.
<P>
Finally, employees who are &quot;telecommuters&quot; and who would
otherwise qualify for the deduction for home-office expenses under Section 280A's
&quot;exclusive use&quot; test, are often denied the deduction under Section 67
enacted in 1986. Section 67 disallows home-office expenses of
an employee to the extent that such expenses along with other
certain &quot;miscellaneous itemized deductions&quot; do not,
in the aggregate, exceed two percent of the taxpayer's adjusted
gross income. Such other deductions are defined sufficiently broadly
that it would be the rare case where the two percent floor was
exceeded, and then, only the excess of expenses above the floor
is deductible.
<P>
<B>Suggested Solutions</B>:
<P>
Consequently, in order to provide the growing number of home-based
employees and business owners proper tax treatment that recognizes
legitimate business expenses in a way that is comparable to their
competitors and colleagues who are not home-based, the following
amendments to the Internal Revenue Code are needed:
<UL>
(1) Amend Section 280A(c)(1) to allow an exception to the &quot;exclusive
use&quot; rule permitting mixed use of space for business and
personal purposes in the case of taxpayers who conduct home-based
businesses while caring for dependents. Dependents should be defined
to include not only children, but also elderly parents or a sick
spouse.
<P>
(2) Amend Section 280A(c)(4)(C) to revise the allocation rule
for mixed uses to only compare only the amount of time a room
is in fact used for a business or personal purpose and not count
the time a room is used for no purpose at all (e.g., nighttime).
This would eliminate the reduction in the deductions for business
use for the time the mixed use room is used for no purpose and
put home-based taxpayers on a par with non-home-based taxpayers
who do not suffer a loss in deductions for their office space
when the office is closed.
<P>
(3) Provide some statutory &quot;safe harbors&quot; in Section
280A(c)(4) on calculating the mixed use of space for home day
care providers and, if the amendment suggested in (1) above is
enacted, for taxpayers with home-based businesses caring for dependents
to eliminate, in most cases, a burdensome recordkeeping requirement.
<P>
(4) Amend Section 67 to exclude home-office expenses of employees
from the miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the two
percent floor.

<title>Income Tax vs. Sales Tax -- PFF</title>

<h2>Income Tax vs. Sales Tax</h2>
<P>
By Grover G. Norquist
</center>
<P>
<p>
<p>
 The political class is approaching a consensus long held by the
American people: The federal income tax system is economically
destructive, overly intrusive, unfair and far too complicated.
<P>
 Historians will marvel at how quickly Members of Congress shifted
from Bill Clinton's view, as expressed in his $200 billion dollar
tax hike in the summer of 1993, that the only problem with the
income tax was that it did not tax successful wealth creation
at high enough rates.  We now confront the present debate between
moving to a flat rate "consumed income tax" or scrapping
the income tax completely and replacing it with a national sales
tax.
<P>
 Dick Armey, the House Majority Leader and a former economics
professor, has been the leading proponent of moving to a flat
tax that would tax all income once at a flat rate of 17 percent
after a personal exemption for a married couple of $23,000 and
of $36,000 for a family of four.  Should an American save and
invest any portion of his income during the year that money saved
would be exempt from tax. In effect, every American would have
an Individual Retirement Account with no limit on how much one
can save, no requirement that the money stay in the IRA until
retirement and no tax upon withdrawal. In effect this creates
a super turbo- charged Individual Retirement Account.
<P>
 Congressman Bill Archer and Senator Dick Lugar have proposed
replacing the present income tax with a consumption tax or a national
retail sales tax respectively.
<P>
 Michael Rothschild has criticized Mr. Armey and all advocates
of the flat tax for missing what he sees as a golden political
opportunity and advocating reforming the present system rather
than uprooting the IRS and moving to a national sales tax.
<P>
 Rothschild is correct in his criticisms of the present income
tax system, although he could have gone further.   But is he correct
that the sales tax would be a long-term improvement over Armey's
flat tax?  For political as well as economic reasons the answer
is no.
<P>
 The great strength of the flat tax is that it treats all American
citizens equally. This is a central tenet of American civilization.
Dividing citizens by income class is a European affliction that
Americans have rejected in most areas of civic life.  We are outraged
by the implication that a persons income would affect his standing
in court. We would not permit wealth or income to determine whether
one could vote, serve on a jury, attend public school, or engage
in freedom of speech and religion.
<P>
 The demagogic politicians who would exploit class divisions in
America are of a cloth with those who would divide Americans by
race for their own political gain.  It is not by accident that
the move towards a flat tax comes at the same time as the nation
is rejecting affirmative action, quotas and racial preferences
of all kinds.  We are Americans and we cannot allow the politicians
to continue to divide us against each other.
<P>
 For this same reason the flat tax is difficult to increase. 
In 1993, Bill Clinton told Americans to pay no attention to  his
1993 tax-and-spend budget increase as only "the rich"
would pay more.  Then, when the tax hike on "the rich"
was locked in, he moved to then tax only "social security
recipients" and only "small businesses that file as
subchapter S corporations" and then "only" those
who buy gasoline for their cars.  In Massachusetts the pro spending
interests --government workers unions -- have tried five times
through the initiative and referendum process to change the state's
present constitutional requirement for a flat tax to allow graduated
rates. Five times voters have publicly rejected this "populist"
measure despite assurances that "only the rich" would
be targeted. Voters recognized that once income groups were divided
they would be attacked one by one and divided against each other
until they fell.
<P>
 It is important to Americans that they have the same relationship
to the state as all other Americans. Equality before the law is
central to American life. It is also the best protection against
attempts to raise taxes.  An increase in a flat tax is opposed
by all taxpayers. A cut in a flat tax benefits all taxpayers.
 What a change that would make in the dynamics of the politics
of taxes.
<P>
 Mr. Rothschild overstates the virtues and understates the sad
history of national sales taxes in other nations.  First, sales
taxes are shot full of loopholes and gradations around the world
and in the 50 states.  Every year lobbyists swarm state capitols
asking that their product be exempt from sales taxes as a necessity.
California just went through the debate about the snack tax, which
included defining what a snack is.
<P>
 But a sales tax to replace the income tax -- and the social security
tax and inheritance tax and gift taxes if we are to be rid of
the Internal revenue service that enforces all these taxes --
is not a real option.  As economist Bruce Bartlett has calculated,
any sales tax would have to be 13.3 percent  to replace the income
tax, another 13.6 percent to replace the social security tax,
and another 3.3 percent to replace the corporate income tax. A
sales tax this high would be forced to be collected as a Value
Added Tax or VAT at every level of production.  No one would buy
retail. As in every European nation the sales tax would almost
immediately become a Value Added Tax which taxes goods and services
at every level of production. VAT's like income taxes are very,
very intrusive in the lives of businessmen and women, just like
the hated income tax.
<P>
 Worse, advocating a sales tax to replace the income tax could
well lead to the imposition of a sales tax/VAT in addition to
the present income taxes.  Every nation in Europe that has a VAT
also has a personal income tax and a corporate income tax as well
as wage taxes like social security.
<P>
 Americans of good will should work together to support the present
strategy of the House Republican leadership; to match spending
reduction with tax cuts that move us toward a flat tax.  The tax
cuts passed by the House include moving toward eliminating all
taxes on savings and investment and toward a larger personal and
dependent exemption.  Tax cuts alongside spending reductions makes
it clear that the purpose of reducing federal spending is not
simply to get Washington's sorry budget in order, but to protect
the American family's budget which has the first claim to money
it earns.
<P>
 And while it is important to move to a flat tax  on consumed
income to simplify the code, reduce the destruction American savings
and investment and treat all citizens equally -- without risking
burdening the people with an additional sales tax -- the true
challenge for Americans is to reduce the total size, scope and
power of the central government. Ultimately there is no nice,
pleasant, non destructive way to wrest 20 to 25 percent of the
total economy away from those who create wealth and distribute
it to the political class.  The total tax burden must be reduced
while we work to minimize the costs of the tax system upon our
freedoms, our families and our civil society. 
<P>

Grover G. Norquist is president of Americans for Tax Reform.

<h3>COMMENTS ON DEPLOYMENT OF 25,000 U.S. FORCES<br> 

IN BOSNIA HERZEGOVINA</h3> 
<P>
<B>TESTIMONY OF JEANE J. KIRKPATRICK</B> 
<P>
<B>before</B> 
<P>
<B>THE NATIONAL SECURITY COMMITTEE</B><br> 
<B>UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</B> 
<P><i>NOVEMBER 15, 1995</i> </center>
<P><hr><P>
<B>Introduction</B> 
<P>
I thank the Committee on National Security for inviting me to
testify today on this important subject. I will try to restrict
my remarks to subjects directly relevant to the Committee's concerns.
<P>
I welcome the Committee's hearings on U.S. troop deployment. Obviously
it is difficult no, impossible for the Committee or its witnesses
to decide whether it will be necessary or desirable to support
and to implement an agreement which does not exist, whose terms
are unknown, and about which there remain large differences among
the parties.
<P>
We do not know whether defensible borders will be drawn for Bosnia
Herzegovina, whether the arms embargo will be lifted and a Bosnian
army trained to defend its country from well-armed neighbors.
We do not know who else will be participating in a multinational
peace force, nor how they will be integrated and commanded, nor
under what rules of engagement they will operate, nor what kind
of exit strategy is planned.
<P>
It is impossible, therefore to decide now that the United States
should or should not participate in a hypothetical force to defend
a hypothetical agreement, but it is possible to address questions
relevant to the deployment.
<P>
<B>II. United States National Interests in Bosnia</B> 
<P>
The Committee asks: Are there important national interests at
stake in Bosnia? My answer to this question is yes, Americans
have many important interests in this conflict.
<P>
I have believed from the onset of the war in former Yugoslavia
that important moral, political and strategic interests are at
stake in the Balkans. Recall that two world wars have spread from
the Balkan tinder box wars which engulfed the European continent
and eventually involved the United States as well. Because we
are a part of the Western world, we cannot be indifferent to brutal
aggression and mass murder in the heart of Europe.
<P>
More than two and one half million Bosnians have been displaced
from their homes in this war, more than 200,000 killed. Concentration
camps, torture, mass rape and mass murder have become familiar
again in the region. The methods used against the people of Bosnia
slaughter, starvation, forced population transfers and other instruments
of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; dehumanize the victims. Indifference
to these dehumanizes us.
<P>
The Committee requests a description of the &quot;precise connection&quot;
between stability in Bosnia, the Balkan peninsula and the balance
of power in Europe. But &quot;precise connections&quot; are known
only after events have developed. Often they come as a surprise.
<P>
But we know violence is contagious. And that conquest is contagious
as well. Former Yugoslavia is centrally, strategically located.
Location is not everything in international affairs, but the centrality
and ethnic-diversification of former Yugoslavia give developments
there greater geostrategic significance than if those countries
were more isolated or remote. Moreover, the countries of Central
Europe recently released from the Soviet Empire have new regimes
and new borders which leave them more susceptible to destabilization
than established regimes.
<P>
In the current conflict, violence sponsored by the Serbian government
has already spread from Kosovo to Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia Herzegovina.
It has already extended across Macedonia's borders. We cannot
know where it might end if permitted to continue. Russia, too,
has a stake in the region, and Ukraine, Hungary, Bulgaria, Albania,
Greece, Turkey, Italy.
<P>
We should not forget that Benito Mussolini and his Black Shirts
inspired Adolf Hitler and others, nor that Mussolini's aggression
against Ethiopia presented the League of Nations and its members
a challenge they could not meet and the League collapsed, that
Hitler was encouraged by the Italian's success to consolidate
his own powers, and that Hitler's success in occupying the Rhineland
encouraged him to move again into Austria, Czechoslovakia and
beyond, to the ovens of Auschwitz and the graveyards of Normandy.
<P>
Through it all, our European Allies watched, never dreaming that
Hitler's appetite would extend so far or with such consequences.
They had vital interests and no prescience. Much the same combination
has guided the European response to Serb expansion.
<P>
The harm done by violent tyrants in this century always comes
as a surprise.
<P>
The United States and the whole of democratic Europe have a large
stake in ensuring that extreme nationalism, instability, xenophobia
and Serb conquests do not whet the savage appetites of would-be
tyrants and conquerors in the Balkans and among their neighbors.
<P>
<B>III. The Proposed Deployment: Is it Necessary?</B> 
<P>
To say the United States has an interest in ending violence and
conquest in Bosnia and an interest in promoting and preserving
stability and democracy in the region is not to say we must send
25,000 U.S. troops to take part in a 60,000 man peace operation
much less that such an operation would succeed.
<P>
No new style peacekeeping operation undertaken by the United Nations
and the Clinton Administration in an area of conflict has secured
peace. U.N. peace operations conducted in Somalia and Bosnia over
the last three years have achieved virtually none of their goals
although Phase I of the Somalia operation, undertaken by President
George Bush, succeeded in delivering large quantities of food
to prevent mass starvation in Somalia.
<P>
These &quot;peace operations&quot; have suffered from disorganization
and disagreement among participants, lack of coordination and
political will, military incompetence and ineffectiveness. Some
of their shortcomings were a consequence of the United Nation's
lack of skill and experience. Some were a consequence of the diverse
interests, priorities, goals and perspectives of participants
which are common to multilateral operations.
<P>
But it is not clear that a multinational operation involving many
governments, languages and organizational habits can succeed in
coping with difficult military problems. Clearly, however, an
operation under NATO command has a better chance of success than
one under U.N. command. That is what is now proposed.
<P>
A) Does American credibility requires 25,000 U.S. troops on the
ground?
<P>
U.S. credibility is at stake only if the Clinton Administration
made commitments to supply such a force without consultation or
consent of the Congress. But America's allies understand that
the Congress plays an important constitutional role in U.S. foreign
policy. Failure to provide ground troops might do superficial
damage to America's credibility, but committing troops and failing
to achieve our goal would constitute a devastating blow to the
credibility of the U.S. government at home and abroad. <I>The
worst outcome would be an effort that first committed U.S. forces
to the task and then failed as in Vietnam and Somalia.</I> 
<P>
Moreover, it is not clear that the Clinton Administration understands
how to use force and the threat of force to establish and maintain
credibility, and achieve goals.
<P>
B) Is deployment of U.S. troops necessary to preserve NATO? We
do not know what kind of commitment was made by the Administration
to NATO. Neither do we know how many NATO countries have committed
to participate, nor on what terms.
<P>
Several NATO countries Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Turkey,
the United States and France (the French are still not members
of NATO) have had troops in and around former Yugoslavia for two
or three years operating as part of a United Nations force, under
U.N. command and as part of a NATO force as well. Much effort
and billions of dollars have achieved almost nothing.
<P>
U.S. forces have participated in the conflict in Bosnia through
air and sea missions conducted under the auspices of NATO. U.S.
ships have monitored enforcement of economic and arms embargoes.
U.S. planes and pilots have relieved pressure on UNPROFOR forces
under attack, carried out air drops of food and medicine to populations
under siege, monitored the &quot;no fly&quot; zones established
in U.N. Security Council Resolution 781, monitored the installation
by Serb forces of air defenses, rescued Capt. Scott O'Grady, conducted
the first non-lethal air strikes ever, and provided high altitude
surveillance of Serb activities including confirmation of the
movement of Serb tanks across the border to participate in the
assault on Srebrenica and of mass murder of Bosnian males following
the fall of Srebrenica last July.
<P>
Until now NATO's participation in former Yugoslavia has been carried
out under a &quot;double key&quot; command system which requires
United Nations' authorization for each operation authorization
that was granted slowly and with reluctance.
<P>
NATO air power has not been used effectively and has not been
successful. More serious is the fact that these arrangements have
reflected the preferences of the United States' NATO allies.
<P>
<I>Our NATO allies</I> the British, Dutch, Belgians and French
(the French are still not members of NATO) <I>preferred peacekeeping
under U.N command.</I> The United States, stung from the Somalia
experience, did not place U.S. forces directly under U.N. command
in former Yugoslavia, but closely coordinated U.S. and NATO operations
with and recognized the authority of the U.N. Secretary General
and his Representative over NATO operations. <I>The result was
to undermine NATO's credibility and effectiveness.</I> 
<P>
So, is it true that U.S. refusal to participate with ground troops
in a new phase of peacekeeping in Bosnia would weaken NATO? I
find it unpersuasive that U.S. refusal to send 25,000 ground troops
for peacekeeping duties on the ground would further weaken an
already weakened NATO.
<P>
Deployment of 60,000 troops may simply bring inside NATO disagreements
among allies on tactics that have so far taken place outside the
NATO framework.
<P>
<B>IV. Taking into account these factors, should the United States deploy 25,000 troops in former Yugoslavia?</B> 
<P>
Not unless President Clinton makes a persuasive case for this
deployment.
<P>
Not if there are alternative strategies that could contain aggression.
<P>
So far the alternatives have not been authoritatively tried or
even considered at least publicly. They should be. Bill Clinton
should make his case to the people and take his case to the Congress.
<P>
Not unless there is clear understanding and agreement among NATO
members concerning command it should be an American and rules
of engagement they should authorize the use of overwhelming force
in response to attacks on people.
<P>
Not unless there is a realistic prospect that the peace in the
region can be maintained after the departure of U.S. troops.
<P>
That requires 1) <I>defensible borders for Bosnia Herzegovina</I>,
and 2) <I>lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia Herzegovina
and helping equip and train Bosnian armed forces</I> so that they
can defend themselves as Croatia can now defend itself.
<P>
I continue to believe that there is promise in a &quot;lift and
strike&quot; policy in which the United States (and NATO if so
inclined) accepts responsibility for the arming and training of
Bosnian military forces. I think such a policy could prevent recurrence
of aggression and the spread of war if it were reinforced by an
active American diplomacy and a substantial U.S. presence in the
area.
<P>
I do not know why the Clinton Administration has not tried a &quot;lift
and strike&quot; strategy to create a peace which could last.
I suspect it is because of the reluctance of our allies to &quot;take
sides.&quot; But only a policy which faces facts, takes sides,
punishes aggressors, and leaves defensible borders can meet American
standards and American goals.
<P>
I fear the same reluctance of the same Allies may encourage the
Administration to design a strategy that does not provide a solution,
but requires 25,000 U.S. ground troops. That would be a great
mistake.
<P>
We need realistic plans, realistic means, and goals consistent
with our ideals.

<title>Clinton Fails to Make Case for American Troops -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>

<h3>CLINTON FAILS TO MAKE THE CASE FOR AMERICAN TROOPS IN BOSNIA</h3>

By John Hillen<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 437<br>
October 23, 1995<br>
<hr size=3 width=50%></center><p>

	The Clinton Administration's plan to use 25,000 American troops to implement a Bosnian peace accord is being exposed as a haphazard and risky enterprise.  In hearings on Capitol Hill last week, members of the Senate and House questioned the political and military rationale behind the Bosnia peace plan deployment.  These questions focused on the mission's political goals, its military objectives, the probability of success, the risks entailed, and the support of the American people.  Robert McNamara recently noted in his memoirs that the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations failed to address these fundamental issues in the early debates over Vietnam.  It appears that the Clinton Administration is ready to fall into the same trap.
<p>
	The Clinton plan puts the cart before the horse.  Instead of making a troop commitment that is tailored to support a specific and workable peace accord, President Clinton made a commitment for 25,000 U.S. ground troops before he knew what the peace accord would entail -- an arbitrary pledge over two years ago. This backwards strategy forces a political plan onto an abstract military force requirement.  Members of Congress were correct to question why the Administration is attempting to force 25,000 U.S. ground troops onto a plan that does not yet exist.  In addition, the congressional hearings last week made it clear that the Clinton troop request is a mission looking for a purpose.  These hearings raised many prescient questions and issues that remain neither answered nor resolved:
<p>
	<b>1)  What are the objectives, and how does America know when they have been achieved?</b>  The American "Implementation Force" has no clearly defined and attainable military goals and no specific criteria by which the U.S. commanders can measure their success.  The Clinton plan fails to address military objectives and commits American forces to static picket duty in an interpositional buffer zone.  The American forces are supposed to sit there and "monitor" infractions of the peace accord.  General Lewis MacKenzie, a Canadian who commanded the first United Nations troops in Sarajevo, told Members of Congress last week that, of all the various national contingents, U.S. troops would be the primary targets for disgruntled belligerents.  He also told the House National Security Committee that while the Administration may try to portray the Implementation Force as a neutral "peacekeeping" presence, the United States will be perceived as the enemy by one side in the conflict.  He re-emphasized the danger to U.S. forces by adding that if he were an American military officer, he "wouldn't touch this mission with a ten-foot pole." 
<p>	<b>2) There is no exit strategy.</b>  Precisely because American forces do not have well-defined and achievable military goals, "mission creep" is inherent in the Clinton peace plan.  With the Administration under enormous pressure to succeed after deploying 25,000 troops, President Clinton will be sorely tempted to escalate American military efforts when faced with the inevitable resistance of the warring factions. To forestall this, the Administration plan calls for a time-driven scenario in which the American forces will be pulled out in twelve months.  Almost all the Members of Congress recognized that this is a purely political decision and were extremely skeptical when General John Shalikashvili defended this timetable for unexplained "operational reasons."  This is shameless political grandstanding on the part of President Clinton, and Congress rightly called his bluff.  As former Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle testified, "An exit date is not an exit strategy."
<P>	<b>3) The Clinton team has anticipated and planned for a best-case scenario.</b>  Military planning, down to the lowest levels, always takes into account worst-case scenarios.  Military leaders must plan for what to do when anything and everything goes wrong.  Because this plan represents an ill-defined mission taking place in the volatile Balkans, there is every reason to believe that unexpected events will be a fixture. Senators were rightly astounded when Secretary of Defense William Perry stated that he "could not conceive of circumstances where troops would stay longer" than the one-year target date. This comment exposed the political and military naivet that permeates the Clinton Administration. There are no contingency plans to address a scenario other than the fanciful best-case scenario anticipated by the Administration.  Should there be anything less than cooperation by the Bosnian parties, America would be forced either to cut and run or to reinforce troops in Bosnia and escalate military efforts to make the peace plan succeed.  The testimony of General MacKenzie made it clear that, despite Secretary Perry's optimism, American troops will have a rough time of it in Bosnia.
<p>	The Administration plan to deploy American ground forces has much to answer for, especially in regard to the fundamental questions that policymakers must address when contemplating the deployment of American combat troops into dangerous environments.  The Clinton team did not provide satisfactory answers to Congress, either on these fundamental issues or on a host of other questions about the mission.  The Administration has not clearly articulated its political and military goals in Bosnia. As Secretary of State Warren Christopher himself admitted after the hearings, "No, we haven't yet made the case." Most important, the Administration has not explained why the U.S. needs to send 25,000 ground troops to Bosnia and how a 12-month deployment can make a decisive contribution to a lasting peace in Bosnia.

<title>Conditions for Sending U.S. Troops to Bosnia -- Heritage Foundation</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><i><h3>CONDITIONS FOR SENDING U.S. TROOPS TO BOSNIA</h3></i>

By John Hillen, Policy Analyst <br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 66<br>
October 11, 1995<br></center>
<p>

	The President has promised to send 25,000 U.S. troops to Bosnia to police a peace settlement. He should not do so without the approval of Congress. Any operation as risky and potentially long-reaching as this one demands the full participation and approval of the House and Senate, and Congress should ensure that certain conditions are met before American troops are sent to Bosnia. While affirming the principle that all American forces, including ground troops, can be used in lesser regional conflicts and peacekeeping operations in Europe, Congress also should note the special risks and dangers associated with the Bosnian peace plan and ensure that specific criteria are met before American troops are deployed.
<p>
	As Congress debates whether U.S. troops should be committed in Bosnia, it should remember that:
<p><ul>
<li>America must lead in NATO, but sound leadership demands that the U.S. question a mission with ambiguous goals and ill-defined objectives. Washington should commit to NATO operations in principle but should not support losing propositions.
<p>
<li>The promised 25,000 American troops would cost two to three times more than the $1 billion - $2 billion estimated by the Clinton Administration.
<p>
<li>The Administration has not spelled out a coherent military plan that specifies the exact mission of the troops, the criteria to determine the success of that mission, timetables, rules of engagement, or command and control arrangements (especially concerning Russian participation).
<p>
<li>The plan to send 50,000 - 70,000 heavily armed NATO troops is clear evidence that this mission is an exercise in peace-enforcement, not peacekeeping, as the Administration claims. NATO troops will be authorized to undertake limited offensive operations against warring factions that violate the conditions of the peace accord. 
<p>
<li>Because of this, "mission creep," the unintentional acceptance of new missions and mandates, is built into this plan. As in Somalia, there will be pressure to increase operations and reinforce troops in order to "succeed."
<p>
<li>U.S. forces will not be accepted as impartial peacekeepers. The U.S. recently launched a comprehensive air campaign against the Bosnian Serbs and announced plans to train the Bosnian Muslim Army during the Bosnian deployment. The U.S. is no longer neutral in this conflict. This phenomenon also occurred in Lebanon in 1983 and Somalia in 1993, where the lives of American Marines and soldiers were needlessly lost because America failed to appreciate that belligerents viewed the U.S. as a combatant.</ul><p>

<b>THE ROLE OF CONGRESS</b>
<p>
The Congress should:<p><ul>

<li>Insist on full congressional approval for any deployment of U.S. troops to Bosnia;
<p>
<li>Hold hearings to determine the feasibility of U.S. participation in a Bosnian peace force; and
<p>
<li>Insist that the President meet the following conditions prior to any deployment of U.S. forces:
<p>
<li>Establish that U.S. national interests are threatened in Bosnia-Herzegovina;
<p>
<li>Publicize exactly what military commitments the Administration has made to both NATO and the Bosnian government;
<p>
<li>Establish that the peace accord is not merely another transient cease-fire, but a politically sustainable agreement;
<p>
<li>Confirm that all parties have withdrawn to clearly recognizable lines of demarcation that can be policed efficiently by a NATO force;
<p>
<li>State strategic and operational objectives for the U.S. force that are clearly defined, attainable, and sustainable; 
<p>
<li>Describe the exit strategy and clear criteria for determining mission success, including an "escape clause" in case the peace accord proves ephemeral;
<p>
<li>State the deployment, rotation, and redeployment timetables, as well as whether they are event-driven or time-driven;
<p>
<li>State clearly the mission cost and the effect on U.S. strategic readiness posture;
<p>
<li>Present a well-defined command and control structure that clearly addresses the role of Russian forces;
<p>
<li>Ensure that there is no overlap of responsibility and authority with the United Nations Protection Force, which should be entirely separate from the NATO chain of command;
<p>
<li>Present contingency plans for various scenarios that realistically address additional resources, cost, and operational feasibility;
<p>
<li>Submit a multinational force structure and command and control plan that ensures unity of command and effort among the many nations taking part; 
<p>
<li>Demonstrate that there are clear rules of engagement that are compatible with U.S. training and doctrine, with American forces not to be given static and passive missions that allow them only to react to initiatives of the warring belligerents;
<p>
<li>Ensure that U.S. troops will be deployed in sufficient strength to guarantee force protection and fully supported operations (no "token" force should be deployed in a dangerous theater); and
<p>
<li>Explain how past U.S. actions in Bosnia are consistent with a "peacekeeping" role.	   
</ul><P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
There is clear evidence that American ground troops could imperil a Bosnian peace force by discrediting its impartial standing. Instead of committing large numbers of ground forces, the U.S. should play to its strengths by supporting this mission with capabilities that only the U.S. can contribute. These include strategic airlift, logistics, intelligence, and combat air support if necessary. American ground troops offer no tactical or operational advantage to a Bosnian peace force. They offer only political advantage for reluctant European allies.
<p>
	The U.S. should agree, in principle, to deploy its military forces (including ground troops) to assist in peacekeeping operations in Europe. But the Bosnian peace plan is not peacekeeping; it is peace enforcement. As yet, there is no reliable or sustainable peace settlement in Bosnia. When there is, the U.S. should consider sending in any forces necessary, but only if the foregoing conditions are met.

<title>The Risks of Clinton's Bosnia Peace Plan -- Heritage Foundation</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<i><h3>THE RISKS OF CLINTON'S BOSNIA PEACE PLAN</h3></i>
By John Hillen, Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder Update No. 262<br>
October 10, 1995<br>
(Updating <i>Backgrounder Update</i> No. 250, "Clinton's Bosnia Folly," June 2, 1995, and <i>Backgrounder</i> No. 1012, "Don't Let Bosnia Destroy NATO," December 28, 1994.)
<hr size=3 width=50%></center>
<p>
	The impending diplomatic breakthrough in the Balkans has raised the prospect of a substantial American and allied military operation to police a Bosnian peace accord. Such an operation undoubtedly would entail an exercise in "peace-enforcement," with United States and allied troops using limited and selective enforcement measures to ensure the compliance of warring factions. 
<p>
	Knowing that this will not present U.S. forces either with a clearly defined, attainable military mission or with a decisive political objective, the Clinton Administration will try to sell the plan as a temporary and innocuous "peacekeeping" operation. The Administration maintains that this would involve only the limited deployment of approximately 25,000 American troops at a cost of $1 billion. But some experts have concluded that the operation would cost two or three times this much and that it probably would involve more than 25,000 American troops over a period of several years. 
<p>
	In much the same way, the Bush Administration tried to sell the Somalia operation as a limited humanitarian enterprise. In fact, the Administration's initial pronouncements even suggested that the troops would be home in seven weeks, by Inauguration Day. But American troops did not leave Somalia until some 16 months later, their good work obscured by the Ranger debacle in Mogadishu, the incoherence of a United Nations-managed peace-enforcement operation, and the renewal of clan warfare in Somalia. The Clinton Administration's planned deployment of American troops to Bosnia is fraught with much greater danger than was faced in Somalia and raises several strategic dilemmas. Some of these, concerning mission objectives, timetables, command and control, and rules of engagement, have been raised by GOP leaders in Congress. Others still need to be addressed:
<p>
<b>NATO Involvement.</b> Because of a rash promise by President Clinton, the U.S. is committed to a major role in implementing a Bosnian peace plan. This in itself should spark a major debate. How did NATO, America's principal security alliance, become a back-door conduit for heavy ground involvement in a conflict of marginal interest to U.S. security concerns? 
<p>
	In 1992, the world heard that this was the "hour of Europe"; in 1995, the U.S. hears once again that its European allies are leery of decisive commitments in the absence of American leadership. The U.S. obviously must lead NATO, but saying no to an ill-conceived peace-enforcement mission with vague and undefined objectives is clearer evidence of leadership than throwing troops into a losing cause. Significant U.S. participation in any NATO enterprise should be contingent on two things:  a clear and present danger to the security and stability of Europe, and a mission with clearly defined political and military goals.
<p>
	Is NATO the proper vehicle for a Bosnian peace force?  Should an alliance starved of credibility and uncertain of its future structure tackle internecine, ethnic conflict in Bosnia?  A NATO Balkan peace-enforcement force could have several unfortunate consequences. For example, it could unleash dissension at the very time NATO is trying to expand. Much as Somalia split the U.N. coalition, the ups and downs of the Bosnian mission could split the European alliance. Faced with the demonstrated intransigence of the belligerents, NATO could experience a resumption of the divergent approaches and internal squabbling that plagued its response to Bosnia in 1993-1994. A Bosnian peace force, under current circumstances, has precious little to offer NATO during a critical phase in its evolution. NATO should not allow a poorly crafted, self-fulfilling prophesy to lure it into accepting this mission.  
<p>
<b>U.S. Troops as "Peacekeepers."</b>  Peacekeeping is an exercise in which the peacekeepers are accepted as honest brokers, neutral and impartial. Because peacekeepers are deployed after an accord has been reached, they operate only in a supervisory role and are forced to rely on the good will and cooperation of the belligerents. President Clinton claims that the U.S. force would be structured for a "peaceful" and "uneventful" mission. 
<p>
	But as currently planned, this would not be a classic peacekeeping operation. So far in Bosnia there is no peace to keep. If U.S. ground troops are sent into Bosnia without a firm peace settlement, they will not be going in as neutrals. The United States, for better or for worse, has just completed a sustained air offensive against one side in the Bosnian conflict. While America may see itself as the impartial hand that "leveled the playing field," the Bosnian Serbs most certainly do not. They were on the receiving end of hundreds of airstrikes from NATO aircraft and American cruise missiles. In addition, the Clinton Administration plans to train the Bosnian Muslim forces while simultaneously acting as peacekeepers. Does the Administration really think the Serbs will accept American ground troops as impartial and neutral peacekeepers? 
<p>
	The U.S. has made this hazardous assumption twice before in recent years:  In Lebanon, in 1983, U.S. air and naval forces attacked Druze and Shiite militia positions while maintaining a "neutral" peacekeeping force in Beirut. Within days of the strikes, over 240 U.S. Marines were dead after a terrorist suicide strike against their barracks. 
<p>
	In Somalia, the U.S. also chose to attack one belligerent party while professing neutrality. The actions against Mohammed Aideed's party drew American troops into the conflict as if they were yet another local faction -- the only one without the political will to slug it out in the bloody back streets of Mogadishu.
<p>
<b>"Mission Creep."</b> Mission creep, the unintentional acceptance of new missions and mandates, is built into the Clinton plan for a Bosnian peace force. A force of 25,000 American soldiers is the absolute minimum needed to give the U.S. the security it needs to operate in Bosnia. A smaller force would be hopelessly exposed and unable to accomplish much of anything.  
<p>
	Since 25,000 troops are the minimum for protection alone, the question becomes how a peace plan will be imposed on the belligerents. The answer could be:  Call for more troops. This is exactly what happened in Somalia after the street battles of October 3, 1993. Within weeks, Clinton was forced to deploy an additional 15,000 troops to Somalia to ensure the security of a few thousand American soldiers operating with the U.N. mission. A force of 25,000 American troops for Bosnia anticipates a best-case scenario. Any deterioration of this scenario must lead to greater American participation. 
<p>


<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
	The President's idea of peacekeeping in Bosnia would not be peacekeeping at all.  As yet, there is no peace to keep. The Clinton plan amounts to peace-enforcement in a dangerous and hostile environment. This is why NATO is planning for 50,000-70,000 heavily armed combat troops and not the lightly armed observers more common to peacekeeping missions. 
<p>
	Should a truly conclusive peace settlement be reached in Bosnia, and peacekeeping become possible, America should support a NATO peace force with strategic airlift, logistics, intelligence, and -- in the case of extreme emergency -- combat air support and possibly some ground troops. There is nothing to gain, either for America or for the peacekeeping force, by deploying substantial American ground forces in this risky adventure. American ground troops offer no operational advantage to the force. They are merely a political backstop for reluctant European allies. Based upon America's experiences in Lebanon and Somalia, it is obvious that participation by American ground troops could damage mission credibility and undermine the peace America and its allies are attempting to preserve. 
<p>
	While the U.S. should agree in principle to support NATO peace-enforcement operations when they make sense -- in other words, when the mission and political objectives are clear -- it should not commit itself to a deal that is bound to fail. In order to honor U.S. security commitments, America should be willing to deploy troops for lesser regional conflicts, and even for peacekeeping. However, it should do so only in cases where the benefits of success outweigh the risks of failure. The Clinton "peacekeeping" plan is not one of those cases.

<h2>
Empower America <i>Highlights</i>
</h2>
<h2>Empower America Forges Ahead</h2>
</center><br>
<i>At a press conference on November 13, 1996, Empower America Co-Directors Vin Weber, Jeane Kirkpatrick, William Bennett, Lamar Alexander and Board of Directors member Donald Rumsfeld discussed the future of Empower America.  The following are excerpts from their remarks.</i>
<p>
<b>VIN WEBER:</b>  We've spent the last days assessing what happened in the last elections, the state of the debate and dialogue in the country, the state of our organization, what may have been accomplished, and where we're going from here.  In summary, we're very upbeat, positive, and optimistic about what has happened in the country, but certainly there are challenges ahead of us.  The election, and the debate in the election  and it's reflected in both parties  indicates the triumph or at least the progress of many of the ideas that we believe in and that this organization cares about.
<p>
There was no discussion in this campaign by any candidate about a bigger government, about higher taxes.  The debate was how best to restrain the size of government, what is the best path to reducing the scope of government, or what combination of  tax cuts  targeted or across-the-board  shall we employ.
<p>
There was no talk in this campaign about building new bureaucracies in Washington.  There was talk about various options for empowering individuals and decentralizing power out of Washington.  Some things probably were not talked about as much as they ought to be, such as national security policy and various social issues that Bill Bennett and others have been most prominent in talking about.
<p>
And there's a big agenda yet to be fulfilled over the course of the next 4 years.  But the good news is the debate has shifted dramatically in what we think is the right direction.  And we look forward to contributing to the debate and dialogue and trying to have an impact on the newly reelected Republican Congress as well as the Clinton Administration over the course of the next 4 years.
<p>
<b>JEANE KIRKPATRICK:</b>  We feel that the outcome of the election was very gratifying  The issues with which we have been preoccupied from our founding  served to refuel the discussion in political campaigns and the discussion between the parties.  The outcome is very positive from our perspective.  The new Congress is overwhelmingly committed to the principles and ideas that Empower America has been purveying and working on, reflecting on, and discussing and debating from our founding.  We think that this is missed to some extent by many of the people who have been discussing the election outcome, because there were so many predictions that the Congressional class of '94, with its emphasis on reducing and limiting the size of government, would be repudiated.
<p>
There were so many predictions of that outcome that many people didn't notice it didn't happen.  A good many people have spoken and written almost as if it had happened, as if there had been a repudiation of the class of '94.  In fact, what did happen was precisely an affirmation of those fundamental principles of the class of '94, including the multiple initiatives to reduce the size of government and its share of our lives and resources.  Since we're an organization concerned above all with policy and principles, and those principles were affirmed by the American electorate, we feel very good about it.  
<p>
<b>LAMAR ALEXANDER:</b>  My own view is that the voters knew exactly what they were doing last week.  I think they were saying to the Democrats, to President Clinton, we heard you say the era of big government was over and we agree with that.  But just in case you have a memory lapse, after you get back in, we're going to give you a Republican Congress to make sure you don't slip in more big government on us.
<p>
And I think the voters were saying to the Republican Congress, we know you believe in the end of the era of big government and you're going in the direction generally we think the country ought to go.  But until you can learn to tell us what's at the other end of that bridge to the future if you're totally in charge, we're not going to go with you.  I believe we'll never have an end to the era of big government until we have a Republican President to go with a Republican Congress.  And I believe there will never be a Republican President until Republicans learn to say what they're for, until they do a better job of explaining how tomorrow will be better than today if they are in charge of the government.
<p>
And that is also the mission of Empower America, I believe, to help paint a picture of our future, to look ahead, and say:  what will the post-big government era look like?  It's really not enough to say we're for abolishing the U.S. Department of Education and for home schooling, both of which I'm for.  There's something in between that affects about 90 percent of the American people.  So, our objective is how do we have the best schools in the world with less governmentwith a government that gives us tools and requires more from ourselves.
<p>
So, we've got some work to do.  We need choir practice, I think, on the conservative side.  And we need to paint a picture of what America would be like if the end of the era of big government comes.  That should be our mission.
<p>
<b>WILLIAM BENNETT:</b>  Let me talk about some of the issues I think we ought to address and that we  will address.  I believe below the presidential level the most important result of the elections was Prop 209 in California.  California, the country's most populous state and most culturally and ethnically diverse state, voted  by ballot referendum  to end preference and discrimination by race and gender.  It is a very interesting thing.  We will now have an argument about this issue in the courts and elsewhere.  To my point of view this was the right thing to do, a very momentous result.
<p>
Second, the courts.  In general, I don't think we give enough attention or pay enough attention to what is going on in the courts.  There is a very real risk, at least on a large number of issues, that the courts are abrogating the rights of a democratic people.  They are entering into areas where the people should decide:  Romer v. Colorado and doctor-assisted suicide, for example.  We'll see what happens with same-sex marriage.  These are areas where I think the democracy should work, people should weigh in on what they think.  The courts should not lift these things from the democratic process, arrogate them to themselves, and tell democracy that it's not fit to decide these important matters.
<p>
Third, there has been a lot of talk in the Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns about big government, the end of the era of big government, too much government, and the devolution of government.  I think we've got some homework to do, and Empower America will try to do it.  Somebody needs to sit down and say:  Well, do we want a national weather service, do we want a drug czar, do we want a Bureau of the Budget, do we want HHS?   Why?  By what criteria?  By what principles?  Do we start with Lincoln?  Should government do those things which the people may not do so well for themselves?  This is analytic work.  We should be specific.  I think this would be a challenge to both Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals.
<p>
Finally, I'll continue work in the area with Sam Nunn and Joe Lieberman and colleagues at Empower America, such as Dennis Prager and others, on this whole area called the culture, which I think central to the future of this country.  If we are the world's most important country, most powerful country, most affluent country, most envied country, we are also the country that leads the industrialized world in murder, violent crime, in juvenile crime, in cocaine consumption, in pornography production, in pornography consumption, in abortion, in divorce, in teenage suicide, and a host of other things.  
<p>
Some of us think these are problems that we need to address.  We think that the whole area has now opened up.  The President has addressed these issues as well, such as what he did the other day on liquor ads, of television, television advertising, the movies, sports, and I imagine he will continue to discuss these.  These are legitimate issues of public inquiry and public policy debate, but not necessarily government regulation, by any means.  Because these things shape our country and our culture and our children, Empower America will continue to work in this area.
The final point.  Some of us are concerned that this "vital center" that's being talked about doesn't become a kind of national hugging fest and that it doesn't become a kind of diffident or dormant middle.
<p>
There are important issues before us.  There are important differences.  Let me pick the hardest one, right now.  It is the ethical matters raised about the President's conduct of office, the abuse of power.  Many of these issues are in the hands of the independent counsel.  But not all of them, and not all of the responsibility is there.  Congressional oversight is required, and it is dictated by law.  We have been through this before, and congressional oversight must not go by the boards.  I think the people at Empower America feel very strongly that we should encourage our friends on the Hill to exercise that responsibility if that is needed.

<H2>Welcome Back, Jack!</H2>
</center>
Co-Director Jack Kemp has returned to Empower America after a leave of absence since mid-August to run for Vice President of the United States.  The former Congressman and Housing Secretary is a Founding Co-Director of Empower America.  Throughout the campaign, Secretary Kemp espoused many of the ideas he developed while at Empower America.  Tax cuts, the need for a fair, flat tax, indexing capital gains and cuts in capital gain taxes, and fairness and equal opportunity for all Americans regardless of race are among the central issues with which Mr. Kemp has long been associated.
<p>
	Secretary Kemp ran on the Republican ticket with Senator Bob Dole.  Empower America, an issue advocacy organization, does not endorse political candidates for any offices at the local, state, or federal levels.  However, it is with a great deal of pride that the Empower America family welcomes back Jack Kemp.

<H2>Chairman's Letter</H2>
</center><p><br>
DEAR EMPOWER AMERICA ASSOCIATE:
<p>
          The political process by which America selects elected representatives is now over.  While Empower America does not endorse candidates, we were nonetheless thrilled that one of our Founding Co-Directors, Jack Kemp, was selected to be a Vice Presidential candidate.  After a vigorous and arduous campaign, Jack has returned to Empower America.  On behalf of the Board of Directors, Co-Directors, staff, and Empower America associates, supporters, and friends, I congratulate Jack for his distinguished contributions to our country and welcome him back.
<p>
          I hope this edition of Empower America Highlights conveys to you the sense of renewed vigor and commitment all of us feel to continue to advance the purposes of this organization.  I hope as well that you will recognize the extent to which the ideas and issues we have developed over the last four years did become agenda setters for the political debate which just occurred.  Most interesting, and gratifying, to us was the adoption of many Empower America positions by both major political parties.  I hope you feel as committed as we are to continue to shape the political debate and to experience the satisfaction of seeing ideas become actual policies.  That is our goal, and all of us at Empower America deeply appreciate your participation and support.
<p>
					Sincerely,
<p>

					Thom Weisel<br>
					Chairman

<H2>Crime Council Issues New Report</H2>
<p>
<b><i>Bennett, DiIulio and Walters Release New Book</b></i><p>
</center>
The Council on Crime in America, co-chaired by Empower America Co-Director William Bennett and Carter Administration Attorney General Griffin Bell, plans to release its second and final report this winter.    This report will provide wide-ranging recommendations on policies and initiatives that public officials, citizen-based groups, and individuals can take to reduce, control, and prevent crime in their neighborhoods.  
<p>
The Council on Crime in America was established in November 1995 to examine violent crime, crime prevention, and law enforcement efforts across the nation.  Earlier this year, the Council released its first report, which provided a comprehensive description of the extent and nature of crime in America.   The report argued that effective crime-fighting strategies must address three distinct challenges:  preventing violent crime, protecting the citizenry from violence, and restraining convicted violent criminals.   Effectively restraining violent criminals is necessary not only to  effectively address the first two challenges, but also to restore public trust in a criminal justice system that has functioned largely as a revolving door for predators -- releasing them back to the streets faster than they can be apprehended. 
<p>
Since then, the Council, led by co-chairs Bennett and Bell, has sponsored grassroots crime hearings across the nation to better assess public attitudes toward crime and explore community-based crime-fighting initiatives.   The publication of the final report will represent the culmination of the Council's research and findings and will highlight the most effective strategies and policies in America's on-going fight against crime.
<p>
<i>Body Count:  Moral Poverty...And How To Win America's War Against Crime and Drugs</i> is a new book by Empower America's William J. Bennett, and crime/drug experts John J. Dilulio, Jr., and John P. Walters in which the authors warn of ever increasing rates of crime and violence in the next decade, especially from a new generation of "super-predators."  <i>Body Count</i> contains a wealth of data and statistics that illuminate the depth of current and future crime waves, as well as the counterproductive operations of the nation's criminal justice system.  In a review of the book in the October 23, 1996 <i>Washington Times</i>, Gene Koprowski writes that "these disarming trends in demographics and drug use must be dealt with by attacking the cause, rather than the symptoms, of the problem. and that is, the [authors] say, the simple abdication of our institutionsfrom the family and the clergy to the entertainment industry and the federal governmentof their role as moral leaders."  As Bennett, Dilulio and Walters argue, "Many people have ignored or forgotten something that almost everybody once knew:  the good requires constant reinforcement and the bad needs only permission."  <i>Body Count</i> can be purchased at most bookstores.

<H2>CCRI WINS</H2>
</center>

<b>Proposition 209:  "The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin..."</b>
<p>
<p>
In an important vote with national significance, the citizens of California chose overwhelmingly to end decades-long practices of legally mandated racial and gender preferences that had come to be known as "affirmative action."  Empower America supported the passage of the California Civil Rights Initiative (C.C.R.I.), stating that "it is the first step in the necessary elimination of discriminatory and divisive practices."
<p>
Empower America Co-Director William Bennett commented, "C.C.R.I. will put us back on the path of the U.S. Constitution and Martin Luther King  the moral path."  C.C.R.I. reestablishes the spirit of the civil rights movement and the original intent of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that "no person...shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation, or be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance."
<p>
The term "affirmative action," as originally conceived by the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations, was a moral injunction to reach out to the best-qualified people  regardless of race  and provide all people with equal opportunities.  However, during the past 30 years, well-intentioned but misguided efforts to address genuine racial inequalities have led to policies of racial discrimination because policies which mandated preferences on the basis on race shifted the emphasis from equality of opportunity to equality of results, and from individual rights to group entitlements.  The result was a divided America:  those who could legally be favored under the law, and those who could be legally discriminated against under the law. 
<p>
Martin Luther King's dream to judge Americans by "the content of their character" and not "the color of their skin" was embraced by C.C.R.I. chairman Ward Connerly, who led the successful effort to pass Proposition 209.  Empower America believes that the long civil rights crusade is embodied today not in racial preferences, but in school choice, lower taxes, economic growth, an end to rampant drug use and crime, and policies which emphasize opportunity over preference.  The California vote has opened the door for America to embark on an important national debate.  In that debate, Empower America will have a strong voice in favor of increased opportunity for all and equal treatment of every citizen under the law.

<H2>New EA Study Highlights Military Contribution of Immigrants</H2>
</center>
<p>
On the eve of Veterans Day, Empower America held a press conference with several leading immigration and veterans groups to release a study on the military contributions of immigrants to the United States.  The conference was held on Capitol Hill on November 7. 
<p>
Participating in the conference were Empower America Co-Director William J. Bennett, Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI), Alfred Rascon, a Mexican-born immigrant hero from the Vietnam War, and representatives from some of America's leading think tanks and veterans organizations, including the American Immigration Law Foundation, the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the U.S., the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, Heroes and Heritage, and the Japanese American Veterans Association.
<p>
The study, entitled <i>In Defense of a Nation: The Military Contributions of Immigrants</i>, was written by immigration expert Stuart Anderson, the director of trade and immigration studies at the Cato Institute.  It is a comprehensive historical account of the willingness of immigrants to participate in the defense of their new homeland and of the significant military contributions immigrants have made in areas such as weapons development.
<p>
The report tells the stories of numerous acts of bravery performed by American immigrants.  For instance, a special regimental combat team made up of the sons of Japanese immigrants was the most decorated of its size during World War II, even though the immigrant families of many of these men were interned by U.S. government authorities.  The study reports that more than 20 percent of Congressional Medal of Honor recipients in U.S. wars have been immigrants.
<p>
An immigrant war hero born in Mexico, Alfred Rascon, whose courage in Vietnam is described in the study, spoke at the press conference about the allegiance of immigrant soldiers.  As reported in the <i>Washington Post</i>, Rascon's "immigration status and ethnicity were not issues in the military.  'When you're wearing a uniform, everybody's green,' he said."  "I was always an American in my heart."
<p>
Empower America Co-Director William J. Bennett said one of the purposes of the study was to acknowledge the "courage and patriotism" of immigrant soldiers, and, as the Roman poet Virgil said, "to give the honorable their due."  As a <i>Wall Street Journal</i> editorial pointed out, "in an era where anti-immigration sentiment seems to focus on what benefits immigrants take away from this country, it seems worth it to recall their contributions to the nation's survival."
<p>
Copies of the report can be obtained by sending a check for $7.95 made payable to Empower America, to our address: 1776 I Street, NW, #890, Washington, D.C. 20006.

<H2>Rumsfeld on How Washington Has Changed</H2>
</center>
<p>
<br>
<b><i>Rumsfeld has been a member of Empower America's Board of Directors since its founding.  His distinguished public service includes four terms in the U.S. Congress, a Cabinet member during President Richard Nixon's first term, U.S. Ambassador to NATO, President Ford's Chief-of-Staff and Secretary of Defense.  Mr. Rumsfeld left Washington, D.C. in 1977 for a successful career in the private sector.  Senator Bob Dole brought him into his presidential campaign as a senior policy advisor and then chairman.  We found Mr. Rumsfeld's observations, made at Empower America's November 13 press conference, about how politics in Washington, DC has changed over the last 20 years insightful and instructive:</b></i>
<p>
As a non-Washingtonian, and a businessman from Chicago, I have several quick observations about how things have changed over the last couple of decades in this city.  
<p>
One change that struck me involves political polls; specifically the extent to which public opinion polling has seemingly almost taken over the political process, the proliferation of polls and the dominance they seem to have in the media's eyes.  I suppose that reporting on a poll is a relatively easy story to write.  It doesn't take a lot of legwork or thought to report on a poll.  I was also struck by the fact that the polls on the 1996 campaign were so wrong, for what I believe to be most of the campaign.  I think the final polls, the bulk of them, were in the 12 to 18 percent range in terms of the differential that they projected between President Clinton and Senator Dole.  It turned out to be 8 percent.  I should add that there were two polls that were quite close, Reuters and <i>Hotline</i>.
<p>
The effect of these polls on the campaign was not trivial.  A great many people were predicting and assuming that the campaign was over in May, and June, and July, which affected human behavior adversely from the standpoint of the Dole effort.
<p>
A second observation is the extent to which focus groups seem to have taken over the political process.  I had not been aware of it.  I watched some of these politicians stand up and in just a few sentences use the word "extremism," six, eight, ten times.  Over and over and over again, they did it.  I watched Mr. Gephardt on MEET THE PRESS just last week, even though the campaign is over, use "extremism" two or three times in the first few minutes.  No one ever stopped him and asked him, "What is extreme?  What are you talking about?  What do you mean?  Why is that word appropriate?"  No one in the media ever seems to call them on it.  
<p>
The phrase "risky tax scheme" obviously had been favorably focus-group tested.  It also was used over and over in the campaign.  If it hadn't worked so well, it would have been amusing.  What is a scheme?  A scheme is when somebody is tricked, in this context, out of their money.  It is when you promise a tax cut, come into office and impose a tax increase instead.  That's a scheme.  Leaving money in someone's pocket, as Senator Dole suggested, is not a scheme.  And yet no one ever called them on it.  I was intrigued; I have to admit it, it worked.  It dumbfounds me the extent to which there was a conscious attempt to manipulate the voters.  The politicians seemed to look for a word that's ugly and then used it repeatedly, and no one said, "Wait a minute, what do you mean?" 
<p>
I don't want to be judgmental about these things, because I am still trying to absorb it all.
<p>
The third thing that struck me, after being out of this town almost twenty years, is the extent to which politicians and the media spend enormous amounts of time not as politicians and not as journalists, but as "stars"  "media stars."  Putting on makeup, and taking off makeup.  Hustling from one event to another, where the basic task is to communicate through the media.
<p>
That seems to have led to a situation where the staff members in this town, in a sense, have begun serving as the politicians.  Now, I don't know that that's a fair comment, but I believe it is true to a much greater extent than was the case when I came here in the late 1950s as an assistant to a Congressman, and then served in the Congress in the '60s and the executive branch in the '70s.  It is a changed situation, regarding the roles that people are playing.  Remember the way the country evolved.  Members of the House and Senate under the Constitution were intended to be the human link between their constituency and their government.  And to do that, one has to actually think, to talk to constituents, participate in the legislative process, synthesize things, and be a true link.  
<p>
The roles have so shifted that, to a major extent, the people that are serving that role of link are young people, very bright, very talented staff people, who in many cases have never been in their bosses' states or districts, don't have the backgrounds of their principals, don't have the knowledge that theoretically their bosses were elected to bring to Washington, D.C., and to contribute to the legislative process.

<h2>The Media on the Media, the Elections, Liberals, Conservatives, Etc...</h2>
</center><br>
<i>At a panel discussion on November 19, 1996, hosted by Empower America, four highly regarded journalists analyzed the recent elections.  Selections from their remarks follow.</i>
<p>
<b>MICHAEL BARONE,<i>  U.S. News & World Report</b></i><br>
	This election was a pretty good election for conservative causes, but not entirely.  First, the country didn't move left, Clinton moved to the right.  Here you have a Democratic president who felt obliged to say the era of big government is over and attempted to campaign by moving sharply to the right on issue after issue...The Congress stayed Republican despite the $35 million labor expenditure; despite the Medicare issue which used be one of the third rails of American politics; despite a generally biased press and particularly a tough negative press which advocated and assumed the defeat of the Republican Congress for [many] months before the election...The country is in a very different placeDemocrats have 12 fewer senators, 60 fewer congressmen, 11 fewer governors, 500 fewer state legislatorsthan where it was when Bill Clinton was elected 4 years ago.
<p>
	The second point is on the level of government.  Four years ago, Democrats and liberals had several projects underway.  They wanted to increase tax levels...because they felt government should have more revenue.  They wanted to federalize health care.  They wanted to change the welfare programs but in ways that would be more centralized and federalized.  The Democrats did get their tax increase in 1993, but they got it at a ruinous political cost and also governmental cost, which is that taxes are completely off the table.  You can search this country very hard and not find a politician advocating more new taxes...The country made a decision...to keep health care reform devolved, and that decision is really not up for appeal.  Welfare...started partly as an attempt by House Republican leaders to bring up the welfare bill for the third time after Clinton had vetoed it twice.  But in fact he signed the [third] bill, [and we] are now having the defederalization of welfare...You don't see Democratic candidates running saying let's federalize welfare.
<p>
	The third point I would make is that to a very considerable extent, international markets are playing an important role in American politics and in politics all over the world.  And that is affecting the debate in a couple of places that tend to tilt conservative.  First, Clinton has made the most important appointment of his second term, and that's Alan Greenspan as Chairman of the Federal Reserve.  Why is Clinton talking about doing something about Medicare and producing the same kinds of cuts and slashes that he attacked during the campaign?  The answer is that when you look at the budget, [Medicare is] where the money is, and the international marketplace is looking at the budget and the marketplace is telling him he has no choice but to do this.  	
<p>
	My last point is on cultural issues.  I think the verdict is a very mixed one from either a conservative or liberal point of view.  Our politics, it seems to me, is very often an argument between discipline and therapy...Discipline won with the Congress, with Proposition 209 on racial quotas and preferences in California, won in the South and Rocky Mountains.  The therapy approach won with Clinton, some key state legislatures going Democratic (California and Michigan), in New England and the Metroliner corridor, which voted quite strongly for the Democrats this time, and in the general tone of the campaign...I think those fights, those cultural wars as Pat Buchanan called them, are very likely to continue with the resolution unclear or mixed.
<p>
<b>RON BROWNSTEIN, <i>Los Angeles Times</b></i><br>
	Turbulence has been the defining characteristic of American politics over the last 6 years.  We've had three successive sharp swings in voter opinion:   George Bush goes from a high 90% approval rating in the wake of the Gulf War, to his repudiation in 1992 in which he suffered the fourth largest decline in the share of the vote won by an incumbent from election to election in American history.  Then, Bill Clinton comes in on a wave of good feeling and in the first 6 months he sees his approval rating drop faster than any new incoming President in the history of Gallop polling.  Clinton's approval rating then goes up and down, recovers a little bit in the fall of '93, but suffers another sharp decline in '94, resulting in the Republican Congressional landslide in '94, which was a landslide of truly historic proportions.  
<p>
	But in '95, the cycle kept rolling.  Newt Gingrich, having a sort of odd baby boomer competition with Bill Clinton, takes it to a new level by driving down the approval rating of the Republican Congress almost as fast as Clinton drove down his own approval ratings in '93.  When you get to the fall of '95, you see as clearly as public opinion can ever show you, an unequivocal pivot in the way Americans looked at Bill Clinton.  Up until then, most of the time his approval rating was under 50%...more months than not.
<p>
	Every incumbent president we've had with an approval rating over 50% in an election year wins easily.  Those under 50% have had tumultuous races in which the incumbents lose:  Eisenhower '56, Nixon '72, Reagan '84 in the first group; Ford '76, Carter '80, Bush '92 in the second group.  I believe the incumbent president's approval rating is the single most important predictor of where a presidential race is going to go.  
<p>
	In the crucible of the budget fight, Bill Clinton regains his footing and is, I think, redefined for Americans in two ways:  he goes from being weak and liberal...to being strong and moderate...[We then] seemed to be poised for a third collapse, the absolute failure of the Republican majority to win reelection.  We don't get that.  In the summer of '96, they regain their footing in Congress...the late sag in Clinton support...around new ethics allegations...pushes him down and Republicans hold on to Congress even as Clinton wins victory in '96, which was unimaginable in '94.  Almost every time in American history that a party that wins as many seats in the mid-term elections as the Republicans did in '94, they win the White House 2 year later:  1890, 1910, 1930 with the Democrats; 1958 with the Democrats; 1966 with Republicans; 1974 with Democrats.  It usually is a precursor of a turnover, so Clinton's turnaround should not be minimized.
<p>
	I think we are moving now from turmoil and turbulence to uneasy equilibrium [stemming from a] partisan standoff between two plurality coalitions that are almost demographic and geographic mirror images of each other:  a Democratic coalition that is heavily based on the support of women and a Republican coalition that is heavily based on the support of men; a  Republican coalition that is centered in the South and the Mountain West and the Plains States, and a Democratic coalition that is moving toward a realignment of the Northeast, dominance of the northern tier states and the West Coast...
<p>
	If you average Bush and Dole's share of the popular vote, it was the lowest for Republicans in any consecutive election since the first two Franklin Roosevelt elections.  On the other hand, in Congress, the solidification of Republican control over the South is bolstering them in the same way that the one-party South helped the Democrats for so long.  The Republicans also show that they can convert majority into money, into advantage, in close races as Democrats were able to do.  Republican candidates showed a great deal of skill in tailoring themselves to local conditions.
<p>
<b>JOSETTE SHINER, <i>The Washington Times</b></i><br>
	I am an ardent defender of the free press and of the American press, and all it takes is a few trips abroad to understand just how fine our media is...[However,] there is a bias in the media;  the polls and surveys that have been taken tell the story.  Eighty-nine percent of the bureau chiefs and reporters in the Washington press voted for Clinton, more than 50% describe themselves as left-of-center, and only less than 5% describe themselves as right-of-center.  But if you look at the Clinton vs. Dole coverage, you will not see bias there.
<p>
	I think the bias is far more profoundly felt in the sense that it is a whole paradigm, the whole view of the media of the debate in America today...For example, the debate over decentralized government, the size of government, has swept the globe.  You can't go to any capitol in the world where this isn't THE debate of our time.  It has been a debate throughout American history.  And yet the inclination on the part of the media is to either turn that into a debate over compassion versus greed, or into a debate over who really cares about poor people.  Simplifying that debate, rather than honoring it for how profound it is, has affected this election tremendously.  
<p>
	When you are dealing with a paradigm like that you have to start with the basics and say, we are not talking about who are good people or who are bad people.  We're talking about a legitimate debate to see if we have found the exactly perfect size of government...The debate over what our society upholds as the standard of behavior is also a legitimate debate and is not about who is mean spirited or who is generous spirited...
<p>
	I think the other problem in the media is a ever-growing desire to be players in the political process.  This is reflected in a quote by Sydney Blumenthal [a journalist]:  "I'm not a reporter.  I don't believe that the accumulation of isolated fact upon fact yields some sort of pure Truth."  When asked about telling the truth about Clinton, he said, "I've urged other reporters to desist from writing anything that could jeopardize Mr. Clinton's chances."  He was then asked, "Well, don't you have to tell the truth?"  He said, "It doesn't matter.  This is too important."  Blumenthal is a caricature of the reporter who wants to [be a player].  
<p>
	More important is the ill-advised experiment of the newspapers in North Carolina.  I'm going to read from a <i>New York Times</i> story:  "Several of this state's major newspapers and television and radio stations have agreed on the real concerns for residents this year, and working together are trying to force candidates to address them.  Among the newspapers, the coordination is so tight that they've begun publishing virtually identical stories by the same reporters each Sunday.  The reports describe the presidential and statewide candidates' stands on issues like crime and taxes which residents said were important when polled by news organizations two months ago."...The candidates in North Carolina were tremendously frustrated because they were not allowed to set the agenda.  I think three cheers for real old-fashioned journalism where we'd go in and don't feel that we need to define the process.  
<p>
	The third trend that I think is disturbing is this overreliance on polls...In the media, one of our sacred rules is when sources are discredited, you drop them.  The polls this year were almost all wrong, by a large margin.  And so this reliance in our coverage on polls throughout the process not only disempowers the voter, but it's misleading.  You'd think at some point, we in the media would say, we're going to make our own judgments and pull back to some degree from the polling, but I think the opposite trend is taking place.
<p>
<b>WILLIAM KRISTOL, <i>The Weekly Standard</b></i><br>
	The good news obviously is the Republicans holding Congress for the first time since 1928.  It means that '94 was a fundamentally important election, and if you talk to Republicans around town, they're pretty cocky.  There are 32 Republican governors.  Every time in this century there is an election in the sixth year of a presidency, the out party picks up seats.  So if things go normally in '98 Republicans will increase their majority in Congress.  There will be a fresh shot at the White House in 2000 without an incumbent Democrat and with a fresh crop of Republican contenders.  Ideologically, big government is discredited.  The exit polls in this election showed a strong plurality of conservatives over liberals in the American electorate.  And in the core issue of do you think government should be somewhat bigger and do more to solve our social problems or smaller, smaller beats bigger by about two to one.  So there is a fair amount of good news out there.
<p>
	...Now the bad news.  The fact that there is good news, that Congress was held, that Dole was a particularly weak presidential candidate, as was Bush in '92, has led to much too much complacency on the part of conservatives.  The fact is that the Republicans barely held Congress, and wouldn't have held it if the elections had been held 2 weeks or 10 days earlier.  They held it because of the Indonesian money scandal and because Clinton sat on his lead a little too comfortably.  If Clinton had come in at around 52, 53 percent, the Democrats would have, I think, taken back the House and the mood would have been very different.  So to sit back complacently because of an incredibly narrow margin in about 15 Congressional districts that the Republicans held, is, I think, foolish.  
<p>
	Young voters, always a leading indicator, who went big for Reagan in '80 and '84, went big for Clinton in '96.  That's a big problem.  Hispanics, all the Republican progress that was made in that group over the last 15 years was erased.  Some of the data isn't very encouraging.  Everyone is confident about '98, but as someone pointed out to me last week, every other rule of American politics has been broken in this decade, why shouldn't the rule that the out parties pick up lots of seats in the sixth year be broken? 
<p>
	The last two Republican presidential candidates got 38 and 41 percent of the vote.  Some people don't think Congress is more important than the presidency.  But I continue to believe if you really want to change American policies and public policy, you need the presidency.  If you think back to the history of the 20th century, we remember President Wilson, President Roosevelt, President Johnson, President Reagan.  You don't remember Speakers of the House or Majority Leaders in the Senate in those periods.  And there is a reason for that.  If you really want to change the country, you need the presidency and you need Congress and you need big majorities in both.  And 38 and 41 percent is a weak showing, very weak showing at the presidential level...
<p>
	The '96 election in retrospect will be viewed as the calm before the storm.  We have a good economy, the country has been at peace, the scandals haven't quite broken.  You could have a very choppy next couple of years and the electorate could break big one way or the other.  It's a great opportunity and risk.

Empower America <i>Highlights</i>
</h2>
<h2>From Newspaper Opinion Pages...</h2>
</center><br>
<p>
<b>About Foreign Policy</b><br>
"The campaign is already in the home stretch and Americans have heard little about what the presidential candidates think we should do in the world, or to the world....In this presidential campaign, no one is asking:  What are the nature and limits of our obligations to others?  Are they different than those to our countryman?...Most Americans think our government's foreign policy should serve the national interest, as it's commonly understood.  But at least among America's elites...a tendency has developed to see any one's problems as our problems and every one's interests as our own....The Clinton administration has been trying to do some of these things in Somalia, where it spoke of 'nation building,' in Haiti where it spoke of 'restoring democracy,' in the U.N., where it has emphasized the emergence of a New World Order...and no one has asked American voters if they are willing to see their hard-earned tax dollars spent for these purposes." <br>
		Jeane Kirkpatrick, <i>The Washington Post</i>, October 6, 1996
<p>
<b>About Welfare Reform</b><br>
"There is now a powerful consensus that the welfare system is ruinous and fundamentally flawed.  At the same time, there are different, compelling, but mostly untried, theories about what ought to replace it.  It is now time to try them....Welfare subsidizes and helps sustain illegitimacy....That is the area where I believe we ought to concentrate our reform efforts, as well as on promoting adoption and channeling more support to private and religious poverty-fighting charities....Others think that replacing welfare with public service jobs is the best way to go.  The only way to prove who is right and who is wrongor determine what is the best mixis to test these social theories against reality.  This is precisely why we need to allow the states to try different approaches.  Which is precisely what this welfare bill does." <br>
		William J. Bennett, <i>The Washington Post</i>, August 19, 1996
<p>
<b>About the Tax Code</b><br>
"We now have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to unleash our economy from 60 years of accumulated policy mistakes by throwing out the Internal Revenue Code and replacing it with a low, single-rate, simple tax system that is pro-growth and pro-family.  As was pointed out by the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform (TRC), which I had the privilege to chair, fundamental overhaul of the tax system would accelerate real economic expansion to at least 4 percent a year for five or six years.  Such an acceleration of growth would not be inflationary, because the expansion wouldn't be induced artificially by unwarranted monetary expansion at the Fed but rather would be generated by unleashing the pent-up productive capacity of the economy." <br>
		Jack Kemp, <i>The Washington Post</i>, August 2, 1996
<p>
<b>About Education Reform</b><br>
"...I think there are two very clear visions of what schools should look like in the new century.  Sen. Dole's view and the Republican view is of independent neighborhood schools, both public and private, that are safe and drug-free, that have high academic standards, and among which parents may choose the best one for their childrenhelped by vouchers to pay part of their tuition costs....President Clinton and the teachers unions by and large want schools with a new name, but schools that look a lot like what we have today....[this] vision means more government control, more union control, more court regulation, more federal programs." <br>
		Lamar Alexander, <i>USA Today</i>, October 30, 1996
<p>
<b>About Indexing Capital Gains</b><br>
"...a farm, home or business purchased 30 or 40 years ago for $20,000 and sold today for 10 times that amount would attract capital gains tax not on the difference between $200,000 and $20,000, but only of the real price increasethe value of the gain adjusted for inflation.  In many cases, nearly the entire tax liability would disappear....It is nothing short of confiscation for our national government to take 28% of the values of U.S. farms, ranches, mills, mines and shops when they are sold simply because a government regulationnot even an act of Congressdefines inflation as a capital "gain," when any fool knows it is not....What better example is there of the people's wisdom than the fact that they prefer not to sell their assets when they know the value will be decimated in the process?  It has nothing to do with the rich, but with the tens of millions of ordinary people who have to pay taxes on inflation rather than invest the proceeds in job-creating enterprises." <br>
		Theodore J. Forstmann, EA Founding Chairman, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, October 22, 1996
<p>
<b>About Tax Cuts</b><br>
"Tax cuts a 'free lunch'?  Who in the world does Mr. Clinton think created this lunch in the first place?  Mr. Clinton's alternative of 'targeted tax cuts?'  In effect, Mr. Clinton is saying Washington has to direct us how to spend our money.  Americans should be able to make their own decisions as to what best fits their needs." <br>
		Steve Forbes, EA Board of Directors, <i>The Washington Times</i>, August 15, 1996
<p>
<b>About the Federal Budget</b><br>
"For the record, both the administration budget and the one adopted by Congress in June...allocate exactly the same amount, year to year, for Social Security.  Adding in Medicare, Medicaid, welfare reform, the Earned Income Tax Credit and other social programs mandated by law, the difference in total spending between the two proposals amounts to less than 1.5% on nearly $6 trillion in projected government spending over the next six years....Critics insist the Dole plan's capital gains tax reduction is aimed at benefiting 'the rich,' yet Internal Revenue Service data for 1993 show that 57% of all tax returns reporting capital gains came from taxpayers with incomes below $50,000 per year....Keep in mind, though, the Dole plan is more than numbers and economic assumptions.  Its ultimate rationale is grounded in moral philosophythe recognition that individuals are entitled to the fruits of their labor." <br>
		Judy Shelton, EA Board of Directors, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, August 27, 1996
<p>
<b>About Economic Growth</b><br>
"Under a policy regime of higher taxes, more regulation and a bigger welfare state, President Clinton asserts that today's economy is the best in three decades....What does the historical record show about the economy's performance?....The 2.5 percent average gross domestic product (GDP) growth experienced during the Clinton expansion years is unusually weak by historical standards, almost two full percentage points lower than the average annual growth rate attained during the past five economic expansions." <br>
		Lawrence Hunter, EA Chief Economist, <i>The Washington Times</i>, October 14, 1996
<p>
<b>About Affirmative Action</b><br>
"Thirty years ago, the animating spirit of the civil rights movement was noble:  America as a colorblind society...true to the principle of equal justice.  The most eloquent embodiment of that movement was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., whose dream was an America that judged individuals by the 'content of their character' and not 'the color of their skin'....That dream has been deferred...[and] replaced by something ugly, narrow and pernicious:  a color-conscious society in which race-based discrimination has become the centerpiece of the liberal civil rights agenda." <br>
		William J. Bennett, <i>The Los Angeles Times</i>, August 12, 1996

<H2>Commentary About Empower America</H2>
</center><p><br>
<b><i>The Washington Times:</i></b>  Empower America Strategy, Stars Rise<br>
"In a town loaded with think tanks, Empower America is the think tank of the moment....At its inception, Empower America was considered a refuge for conservatives who where out of power...Now, Empower America is in the game." <br>
		Brian Blomquist, August 15, 1996
<p>
<b><i>The New York Times:</i></b>  Influential Group Brought Into Campaign by Kemp<br>
"Not long after Bill Clinotn defeated President Bush in 1992, Theodore J. Forstmann, a New York investment banker, sat down with Jack Kemp to discuss creating an organization in Washington to chart a new course of conservative causes, particularly Mr. Kemp's advocacy of stimulating growth by cutting taxes....The result was Empower America....Said Tex Lezar...who took over in May as chief executive of the organization, 'You could say it's been a shadow government.'"<br>
		Douglas Frantz, September 1, 1996
<p>
<b><i>U.S. News & World Report:</i></b>  A Conservatism of the Head<br>
"...the secret of the Dole campaign has been ideas.  The proximate source of these ideas was a small Washington think tank started four years ago as a home base for William Bennett and Jack Kemp, with Jeane Kirkpatrick, former Rep. Vin Weber, Steve Forbes and Lamar Alexander as principals.  Everyone played a key role in sculpting Dole's message." <br>
		Michael Barone, August 26, 1996
<p>
<b><i>Human Events:</i></b>  Conservative Spotlight<br>
"....[this] all-star lineup, according to Empower America President and CEO Tex Lezar, gives the organization both grassroots appeal and high-level visibility, which the group uses to promote conservative ideas in each codirector's area of expertise....Lezar said, Bill Bennett works as a proponent of 'tougher approaches on criminal justice and drug policy, the need for mediating institutions and personal responsibility to revitalize the culture.  Jack Kemp, of course, is the leading spokesman of what he calls "entrepreneurial capitalism" or pro-growth economics....[he] is also a proponent of a "conservative approach to do more for those who have been left behind by liberal, statist welfare policies"....Jeane Kirkpatrick [is] the foremost advocate "anywhere for a strong America and the use of America's military and diplomatic strength to advance America's interests"  Vin Weber's legislative background gives him a keen understanding of "where the political process and policy come together'"...Lamar Alexander focuses on education....In addition...[his] experience in running for President has made him very knowledgeable and very concerned about the issue of campaign finance reform.'"<br>
		Steve Schwalm, November 1, 1996
<p>
<b><i>The Minneapolis Star Tribune:</i></b>  Think Tank Spawned GOP Tax-Cut Plan<br>
"Not long after Bill Clinton won the presidency and ended a 12-year Republican reign in the White House, four leading conservatives formed a think tank in hopes of carrying forward their vision of lower taxes and less government....No one could have guessed that four years later the four Empower America founders and a cast of others from the organization would dominate Dole's campaign and help shape the tax cut that is its centerpiece.  Aside from Dole's selection of Kemp as his vice presidential running mater:   Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, an Empower America director and financial backer, is Dole's national campaign chairman.   Weber and Rumsfeld are the campaign's policy co-directors, and Weber picked the committee that crafted Dole's proposal for a 15 percent cut in income tax rates.   Empower America's co-founder Bill Bennett, who was education secretary in the Reagan administration, is a campaign co-chairman.... Co-founder Jeane Kirkpatrick, the former U.N. ambassador, is a Dole foreign policy adviser.   Ex-Empower America chairman Steve Forbes is a Dole economic adviser....[Weber] said the Dole camp turned to Empower America for 'intellectual horsepower.'"<br>
		Greg Gordon, October 28, 1996
<p>
<b><i>USA Today:</i></b>  Dole Gets Not Just Kemp, But His 'Brain Trust' Too<br>
"Empower America provided Kemp with an important political forum....and when he was named Dole's running mate, he arrived with a conservative brain trust...." <br>
		Judi Hasson, August 13. 1996
<p>
<b><i>Education Week:</i></b>  Empower America Cast in Key Role in Dole Campaign<br>
"In the past two months, perhaps no trio of Republicans has shared the spotlight with Bob Dole as much as Jack F. Kemp, William J. Bennett, and Lamar Alexander.  All three are influencing Mr. Dole's presidential campaign in different ways, yet they have something in common:  All have been waiting in the wings as co-directors of Empower America, the Washington think tank that promotes 'progressive conservative policies based on principles of economic growth, international leadership, and cultural renewal'....Voucher legislation first prepared in 1992 by Mr. Alexander, as secretary of education in the Bush administration, has been the basis for Mr. Dole's 'opportunity scholarship' proposal in an election in which voters say education is at the top of their agenda....And while the November election will render a verdict on Mr. Dole's agendaincluding its Empower America themesofficials at the organization plan to plow ahead with their efforts regardless of the election results." <br>
		Mark Pitsch, September 18, 1996

Empower America's <i>Highlights</i>

<p>
<H2>Bennett: Politics Aside</H2>
</center>
During the last three decades, America has experienced an unprecedented degree of social regression. If things continue the way they are going, we may well see the end of the American experiment in ordered liberty. To be more specific: if current trends in juvenile crime, illegitimacy, family disintegration, community breakup, education, and drug use continue, this experiment in self-government will end. This is a conclusion based on a disinterested analysis of social facts. After all, there is nothing inevitable about this experiment. Our system of ordered liberty was brought about by will and thought and reflection, not by chance. The Founders said that we would have to maintain certain efforts to keep it together. Some of those efforts are being maintained. But many are not.
<p>
During our Candidate School, you have heard from some people we regard as among the ablest and smartest around in various policy areas. Public policy is crucial; here at Empower America, we are trying to advance the most intelligent and thoughtful policies we can. But I believe the cultural arena is even more important. That is not to say that cultural ideas can't be significantly influenced by people in politics. Indeed, they can. But I have to say, I think it probably matters more for the cultural future of this country what happens in movies and television, and on the radio and in classrooms, than what happens on Capitol Hill.
<p>
Talk to a group of teenagers and tell me if they sound more to you like they're listening to C-Span or MTV. And I will tell you: they sound a lot more like MTV. This doesn't diminish the political task. It just makes it clear that there are other tasks as well. And of course the two are related.
<p>
I think that if the philosophy of life being promulgated in TV commercials, movies. television and other cultural media changed, it would probably bring about more of a positive change in American life than virtually any piece of legislation we can imagine.
<p>
There is the belief among many of the people who have the most power and influence to shape attitudes that the most important obligation in life is to yourself, that your duties are to yourself - not to God, not to country, not to work, or family, or wife, or children, but to self. And if self is not happy or satisfied. then it must take priority. This, in my view, is a social disaster and an invitation to barbarism. It is a dagger aimed at the heart of our society. But it prevails in many quarters . It has been given to us by some intellectuals. Much of Hollywood pushes that view. And it is central to much of contemporary liberalism. I think it is poisoning the moral environment of America.

Bad philosophy has destroyed the lives of many people in this country. It has destroyed many homes, many communities, and will continue to unless we confront it directly. If you do try to fight this thing by taking on its proponents, you will be in for one heck of a fight. But it is a fight worth having. Indeed, it is one of the fights that matters most.

Empower America's <i>Highlights</i>
</h2>
<H2>Kemp: Growth and Hope</H2>
</center>
Empower America was founded to present conservatism's positive face, on the premise that the instincts of the American people arc naturally optimistic and that their values are predicated upon the virtues of a Judeo-Christian society . We believe that conservatives should always be forward looking, not backward looking; optimistic, not pessimistic; confident, not timid; and inclusive, not exclusive.
<p>
You cannot lead anybody with pessimism. Can you imagine a quarterback going into the huddle and saying, "Gosh, it's hot out here. Wow, those guys are big over there. I know this play has never worked before, but I don't know what else to do. Let's try it again." No great adventure has ever been led by anybody who says it can't be done. Leadership has to be predicated upon confidence in one's own abilities as well as on a belief in the inevitability of ultimate victory.
<p>
Leadership should be centered around a world view of hope, optimism, confidence, and the ultimate achievement of victory - for the right reason. The Bible says overcome evil, overcome it with good. Conservatives are obligated morally, not only to indict darkness, but to also light candles; not only to be against that which is bad, but also to be for empowering and unleashing the potential of the human spirit.
<p>
A great conservative named Oswald Spengler wrote <i>Decline of the West</i> in 1931. He was pessimistic about democracy. He thought that democracy wouldn't survive against fascism and Nazism. One of the founders of <i>National Review</i>, James Burnham, wrote <i>Suicide of the West</i>. He said we were going to commit suicide because democracy wouldn't work. Jean Francois Ravel, another leading conservative, wrote a book in which he said democracy will turn out to be a parenthesis in the history of the world.
<p>
Unlike these men, I'm an optimist. I always knew we would win. Sometimes, however, it has been tough maintaining this positive outlook. I know there are problems. Human rights abuses continue in China, the Middle East, and Bosnia Despite these problems, democracy has defeated all of the "isms" of years past - absolutism, fascism, Nazism, and communism.
<p>
Socialism is dead intellectually. Isolated pockets remain in Cuba, North Korea, and in the economics departments of some of our Ivy League colleges, but very few people today talk about socialism as an answer to poverty. In my view, there is only one real answer to poverty: a system based on private property, limited government, the rule of law, and entrepreneurial capitalism. The Left has tried to make Americans feel guilty about this kind of a system - to envy the rich, to desire a redistribution of wealth, and to centralize power. Thanks to computers and the telecommunications revolution, much of the world now has instantaneous access to information. This revolution will be the ultimate undoing of modern liberalism's centralizing tendencies. Markets will be energized, unleashed, and individualized. In this new environment, mistakes in government policies can cause capital to flow out of a country as fast as it flows in. All of this means that governments cannot control commerce like they used to.
<p>
My entire political career has been dedicated to the proposition that conservatives should be positive and optimistic and demonstrate a concern for the underdogs in our society. It is outrageous that conservatives have allowed liberals to steal genuinely good words - welfare, for instance. Don't think of welfare in terms of what the Left has described. I care about the "welfare" of my family. Welfare is not a bad word. We have allowed it to become synonymous with government handouts . What welfare really means is the well-being of someone. Conservatives <i>should</i> care about the welfare of the American people. We <i>should</i> want everyone to be able to get a good education, get a job, get married, have children, and move up the economic ladder.
<p>
People don't care how much you know until they know that you care. That is why conservatives must be inclusive. We have got to show South Central Los Angeles that we care about them just as much as we care about Wall Street. If our policies will not work in East Saint Louis, how can we sell them to Russia or Eastern Europe?
<p>
I proposed the idea of free enterprise zones for the District of Columbia in order to enhance the city's ability to recover its middle class. Two hundred thousand families have moved out of D.C. over the past 15 years because of taxes, crime, and a lack of educational quality. I helped introduce a Hong Kong-like tax code for D.C. because we have to do something radical to save the nation's capital. Many liberals in Washington knocked my head off, saying, 'There goes Jack Kemp again, trying to help the rich, only thinking of himself." Recently, D.C.'s Delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton, introduced a Hong Kong-like tax code for the District of Columbia. A flat, 15 percent income tax for the whole city. She is an African-American and a liberal Democrat. She introduced my bill for D.C. within 24 hours. She called it "The Economic Recovery Act." With that kind of a strategy, how can the Left say that conservatives don't care about the welfare of the poorest among us?
<p>
Liberals have shown that they care by putting people on welfare. Conservatives have got to show people how to get off of it, and how to get into jobs and education and the type of opportunity for which we are working. Every single voter - regardless of color, regardless of residence - is a potential consumer you have to communicate with. If you understand your job, your product, and treat people with care and concern, even though they may not vote for you, you've done a service for conservatives. If we have a good product, conservatives ought to be able to sell it in any area and to anyone in the United States.
<p>
Conservatism and optimism are not mutually exclusive. I believe that successful candidates for public office in 1996 and beyond will be the ones who embrace policies and strategies that exhibit both of these qualities. It means advocating a message of hope and it means supporting ideas that will spur economic growth. How you execute your campaign, how you approach leadership, what your attitude is toward people is essential to the outcome. Does anybody doubt that? Whether it's a huddle, a home, a business, or politics, your attitude will determine the outcome of your endeavor. If you've got the right outlook, the willingness to succeed, and the love in your heart for this country, your message and the strength of your ideas will be more powerful than any army in the history of mankind.

Empower America's <i>Highlights</i>

<p>
<H2>Kirkpatrick: US Credibility</H2>
</center>
I am pleased to be at this Empower America event with all of you candidates who are running for office and hoping to turn good ideas into the policies of the United States, at the local, state and national level. I'm sure you're going to know what to do after you're elected: to implement the policies that create free people, that strengthen free people, that expand and protect freedom, and that encourage the ingenuity, enterprise and energy that free people apply in situations where initiative and enterprise are permitted to prevail.
<p>
Our foreign policy is - always and inevitably - an expression of our government and our society, our will and our purpose, as is every government's foreign policy an expression of the morality and purposes of that society and that government. Policies of a government are not likely to be much better than the quality of its government - at least not for long. This is especially so in national security matters, where credibility depends directly on the government's strength and also its will. I firmly believe that American credibility, and the appreciation of our strength and our purpose, is our most important asset in the conduct of foreign affairs and national security. I believe the Clinton Administration has been squandering American credibility, power, reputation and respect in the world. I think our credibility has declined along with our military strength. There is a very real correlation - it is an unfortunate correlation when you are weak, and a fortunate one when you are strong - between strength and respect. We have been the strongest government and country in the world. We probably still are the strongest country in the world, but we are a good deal less strong than we were four or five years ago. We are a good deal less strong than we were when the Berlin Wall came down. We are a good deal less strong than we were when Bill Clinton was inaugurated.
<p>
When our credibility suffers, those leaders contending for ultimate power, in, for example, China, are strengthened. Those most likely to use force, like firing missiles to threaten Taiwan, are strengthened. And when our credibility suffers, North Korean dictators, like Kim Jong II, are more likely to violate the demilitarized zone, and more likely to offer new challenges to South Korea and other neighbors. And when American credibility suffers, the governments of countries like Iran, Syria and Libya are greatly encouraged.
<p>
We are becoming less strong because our military - our forces and our weapons, our research and development - are being permitted to decline by the refocusing of attention and reallocation of resources in the Defense Department. Generals in the Defense Department are confessing, reluctantly, to committee chairmen in the House National Security Committee that the level and rate of procurement which the Administration is providing for our future is not adequate to provide for our future. The military will be short of a good many things that we need. Already training budgets have been displaced by what are thought to be more urgent needs. Our armed forces' spare parts budgets have been raided for what are thought to be more urgent needs. And our research and development is just simply neglected.
<p>
The Clinton Administration has doggedly declined to invest in a missile defense for the United States, not facing the fact that if we don't develop a missile defense, we will not be able to help anyone else defend themselves against missiles either. Apparently, it occurred to the President recently that Israel might need some help with missile defense, and announced that the United States would assume that responsibility. The fact that some systems exist for missile defense comes from the research and development that was undertaken in the Reagan Administration. This was for a much larger missile defense program, one which would be able to defend you and the citizens you hope will vote for you, one to protect and defend the whole country. Unfortunately, Bill Clinton has shut down almost all of this program in the last three years. One hopes that he will reconsider missile defense for the United States.
<p>
This President is not oriented toward thinking about defense. He is not oriented toward providing for American strength. He is, in fact, reluctant to think about strength. The whole Administration is reluctant to think about strength, including even the Defense Department, of all the places to be reluctant to think about strength. The President and the Administration, the Secretary of Defense, have gone forth into the world again and again, carrying a very large carrot to deal with very disagreeable dictators, like Kim Jong II of North Korea, like Syria's Assad, like Fidel Castro, like some of the Chinese some of the time.
<p>
I believe that the decline in our credibility has already produced unfortunate experiences, such as the shooting down of American planes and the murder of American pilots over international waters near Cuba. Even though our media kept talking about Cuban exiles, those were American citizens flying very small, unarmed, American planes, which were shot down near Cuba. And what happened after they were shot down, unprovoked, these unarmed planes which had done no harm to anyone? What happened? Actually what happened, of course, was nothing happened. Nothing at all, there was no retribution of any kind. I don't know what Ronald Reagan would have done in that situation. But the point is, we don't know because Fidel Castro wouldn't have done something like that when Ronald Reagan was president. Muammar Khaddafi did something like it when Ronald Reagan was President, and he found out what Ronald Reagan would have done. <p>
The fact is that when America is strong and America is purposeful, and we stand with democracies, and we stand with freedom, we strengthen peoples and countries who share our values. The whole world profits. When our strength declines, and our credibility, strength and purpose are questioned by thugs, the world becomes more dangerous.

<H2>Candidate School Sets Out Fall Course</H2>
</center>
The notion that "ideas have consequences" is central to the work and mission of Empower America, and was at the core of Empower America's 1996 Candidate School held on April 29th in Washington, D.C. Candidates and campaign strategists from local, state and national races in twenty-four states met with Empower America's Co-Directors and leading policy experts for a detailed discussion of the issues that are central to the 1996 elections.
<p>
In his welcoming remarks, Empower America Co-Director Vin Weber told the candidates, "Our organization was founded in order to bring important political ideas to the forefront of our national debate, where they can be vigorously deliberated and acted upon. Empower America's candidate training school and briefing book are just one part of that broad effort. Our intention is to reach beyond the necessary issues of campaign management (i.e., polling, fundraising, advertising and organization) to the <i>intellectual</i> content of the political process. Our ambitious goal is to help seed the national political debate with substantive thought. We believe it is that dedication to ideas and issues that distinguishes this instruction."
<p>
The seminar was opened by Empower America Co-Director Jack Kemp, who spoke of unleashing America's economic potential. The path to the American dream must be opened, said Kemp, by reforming the tax code; removing barriers to work, savings and investment; and by opening the possibilities for all citizens to gain access to capital and credit.
<p>
Jack Kemp's remarks were followed by a panel of economic policy experts discussing three of the most significant reforms necessary for economic growth. Dan Mitchell of the Heritage Foundation offered a detailed discussion of tax reform; Mike Horowitz of the Hudson Institute described the need for tort and regulatory reform; and John Goodman of the National Center for Policy Analysis (N.C.P.A.) addressed a topic that is about to become a leading economic and political issue: the privatization of Social Security.
<p>
A second panel, entitled <i>E Pluribus Unum</i>, tackled the fragmentation of American society. Stuart Anderson of the Cato Institute described the benefits of legal immigration and the unwise nature of current anti-immigration initiatives; David Murray of Statistical Assessment Service offered an excellent explanation of the true nature of American "oneness" and the pitfalls of "multiculturalism"; and Brian Jones of the Center for New Black Leadership spoke of the social harm produced by preferential policies based on race and gender.
<p>
Panel three turned its attention to devolution of societal responsibilities from government to civil society, and the need to rebuild and strengthen community institutions. The speakers were three leaders in that effort Adam Meyerson of the Heritage Foundation, editor of <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship;</i> Robert Woodson of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, a pioneer in community and individual self-help efforts; and Mike Gerson. policy director for Sen. Dan Coates, who spoke on behalf of the Senator's 19-point legislative program to strengthen civil society, the Project for American Renewal.
<p>
At lunch the candidates heard from former United Nations Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick discussing foreign policy and the erosion of America's hard-earned credibility and worldwide leadership during the Clinton presidency.
<p>
Two afternoon panels instructed the participants on a wide range of domestic issues. and on the experiences of the 104th Congress . Domestic issues were covered by five of the top thinkers in their fields. John J. DiIulio covered crime; former assistant Drug Czar John P. Walters discussed drugs; Chester E. Finn of the Hudson Institute spoke on education; Merrill Matthews of the N.C.P.A.'s Center for Health Policy Studies reviewed health care; and the former Director of the U.S. National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect, Douglas Besharov, spoke about welfare.
<p>
Three leaders of the Freshman class of the 104th Congress conducted a lively question and answer session during the final panel, informing the candidates from their own experience. Congresswoman Sue Myrick (9-NC), Congressman Sam Brownback (2-KS) and Congressman Dave McIntosh (2-IN) urged the attendees to join their "revolution" to reduce government and return power and responsibility to Americans.
<p>
The final remarks were delivered by Empower America Co-Director William J. Bennett. Dr. Bennett spoke of the need for cultural and societal renewal in America, and of the forces and policies that have weakened our culture. His address wrapped up a day that several candidates described as bringing focus and a winning edge into their strategy. "So much good information." said a candidate for U.S. Senate, "I'd do it again."

<H2>EA Releases Influential lmmigration Study</H2>
</center>
At a recent press conference in Washington, DC, William Bennett and Jack Kemp released a study sponsored by Empower America about employment-based immigration. The report, <i>Employment-Based Immigration and High Technology: Issues and Recommendations,</i> examines the impact on the wages and employment opportunities of native-born Americans produced by the employment of foreign-born engineers and scientists.
<p>
The author of the study, Stuart Anderson, a visiting scholar at the Cato Institute, compiled data from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and conducted interviews with engineering and computer industry corporate leaders to determine if immigrants hurt job opportunities for American engineers and scientists, as is commonly believed. The study concluded that U.S. high tech companies hire foreign-born engineers and scientists because, in these highly specialized industries, they frequently possess unique skills and fill key technical niches in the U.S. Iabor force.
<p>
Foreign born high-tech employees are not paid less than their U.S. counterparts, which is also commonly believed. Indeed, data from the NAS show that the median salaries of foreign-born engineers and scientists are significantly <i>higher</i>, not lower, than their native-born counterparts who completed their Ph.Ds in the same year. Furthermore, the study demonstrates more generally that foreign-born engineers and immigrants play a significant role in creating jobs in the high technology fields through entrepreneurship and innovation.
<p>
Calling the study a "wakeup call," Dr. Bennett and Secretary Kemp called the report "a warning specifically to those who believe that scaling back on legal immigration will help the American worker. Friends of the American worker are by necessity defenders of immigration, for immigrants serve as a catalyst for economic growth. This study dispels the myth that employing immigrants displaces American workers."
<p>
The study was distributed to all the members of the U.S. Congress as they considered legislation aimed at curbing legal immigration. Empower America's role in shaping the final outcome of this legislation was significant. Provisions aimed at reducing employment-based immigration were eliminated from the Senate bill; and, ultimately, the Senate voted to split their immigration reform bill by considering legal and illegal immigration separately. Similarly, the House passed a bill that cracks down on illegal immigration, but rejected provisions that would have reduced legal immigration by nearly one-third.

<H2>EA Announces New Leadership</H2>
</center>
The Board of Directors of Empower America has appointed Thomas W. Weisel as Chairman of the Board and Tex Lezar as President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Weisel served as Acting Chairman when Steve Forbes took a leave of absence as EA's Chairman to run for President in the Fall of 1995.
<p>
Weisel is founder, Chairman and CEO of Montgomery Securities in San Francisco one of the nation's leading securities firm. Under Weisel's leadership, Montgomery Securities' annual revenues have grown over the last 25 years to exceed $500 million. Weisel holds five National Master's titles in cycling and has served as Chairman of U.S. Skiing, the governing body of the U.S. ski team.
<p>
EA Co-Director Jack Kemp called Weisel, who specializes in taking smaller "growth" companies public, "the embodiment of the American dream." Kemp continued, "Thom has demonstrated in his professional life that entrepreneurial capitalism works. He has spent his life pushing entrepreneurs toward success. His real-world insight and world-class fundraising capabilities will continue to be of tremendous benefit to Empower America."
<p>
Empower America's new President and CEO, Tex Lezar, comes to the organization from Dallas, Texas, where he is engaged in private law practice. Lezar, who served as Assistant U.S. Attorney General under President Reagan and edited <i>Making Government Work A Conservative Agenda for the States</i>, has been a prominent litigator and appellate lawyer in Texas since 1977. In 1994, Lezar was the Republican nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Texas.
<p>
Bennett, Kemp, Kirkpatrick and Weber jointly said, "Tex Lezar comes from the school of Ronald Reagan and adheres to its credo - an optimistic faith in freedom, democratic capitalism, strong national defense and time-honored values. He has a sound knowledge of public policy and politics, and brings to Empower America the fruits of an impressive career in government, law, and politics. We are very pleased to have Tex aboard."
<p>
Steve Forbes will rejoin the Board of Directors and William Dal Col, Empower America's former President, will be working with Forbes while continuing to informally advise Empower America.
<p>
Nick Forstmann, Partner at Forstmann Little & Co., is Empower America's new Vice Chairman. He is a long-standing member of EA's Board of Directors.

<H2>Co-Directors Support Missile Defense</H2>
</center>
<i>The Defend America Act of 1996 (H.R. 3144) would mandate the development and deployment of a national missile defense by 2003 to protect all Americans against the threat of accidental or limited ballistic missile attack. Empower America Co-Directors Kirkpatrick, Kemp, Bennett, and Weber sent a letter to the entire House of Representatives urging that they vote in favor of this vital legislation. Excerpts from the letter follow:</i>
<p>
"Today, dozens of countries have or are seeking to acquire ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction. These include Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and Libya, to name a few. Incredibly, America still has no defense against this threat. Even a single missile launched at our nation - whether deliberately or by accident - would have tragic consequences, and, if it were armed with a nuclear, biological, or chemical warhead, the results would be catastrophic.
<p>
The technology exists today to move forward with a limited ballistic missile defense that is able to protect Americans in all 50 states - and to do so at an affordable cost. The Defend America Act would make it clear that Americans will no longer remain hostage to unlawful states and the decisions of their unpredictable rulers.
<p>
The Clinton Administration still refuses to take our vulnerability to a missile attack seriously. The Administration has said it does not foresee missile threats to the United States emerging in the next 15 years. They ignore the still formidable Russian and Chinese nuclear arsenals and place an historically unwarranted faith in the intelligence community's ability to recognize Third World missile threats in a timely manner - before they materialize. Our underestimation of the scope and magnitude of Iraq's missile program prior to the Gulf War is proof enough of this.
<p>
It is crucial to ensure that all Americans have the protection they deserve against threats to their security. But today, Americans have no protection against ballistic missile attack. We therefore urge you, in the strongest terms, to vote for the Defend America Act."

<H2>From Newspaper Opinion Pages...</H2>

<b>About "Same-Sex" Marriage </b><br>
"I believe that overall, allowing same-sex marriages would do significant, long-term social damage...Recognizing the legal union of gay and Iesbian couples would represent a profound change in the meaning and definition of marriage..Marriage is not an arbitrary construct; it is an 'honorable estate' based on the different, complementary nature of men and women - and how they refine, support, encourage and complete one another. To insist that we maintain this traditional understanding of marriage is not an attempt to:put others down. It is simply an acknowledgment and celebration of our most precious and important social act....It is exceedingly imprudent to conduct a radical, untested and inherently flawed social experiment on an institution that is the keystone in the arch of civilization. That we have to debate this issue at all tells us that the arch has slipped."<br>
      William J. Bennett, <i>Washington Post,</i> May 21, 1996<p>

<b>About Expanding NATO</b><br>
"Support for the admission to NATO of Eastern European democracies has been growing in Washington. A bill for which bipartisan support is expected has been drafted in the House International Relations Committee calling for NATO 'at early date' to include, at a minimum, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.... There is no spirit of Munich here. The bill's authors believe - as I believe - that it is about time that the new democracies begin to enjoy the full benefits of freedom, including credible security. Should such a bill be acted on before the Russian elections? Will it damage Yeltsin's chances - as some have argued? I think not. A weak, timid West would be far more damaging. Yeltsin and the Russian democrats will win if it is clear that the resurgent communist/fascist spirit cannot prevail. Enlarging NATO will send just that message."<br>
      Jeane Kirkpatrick, <i>New York Post,</i> April 10, 1996<p>

<b>About a Flat Tax for Washington, DC</b><br>
"Our nation's macro economy is a democratic-capitalist economy based on private property and rewards for productive human activity. However, we also have a concurrent, micro economy that is almost a Third World socialist welfare state...and nowhere is it better illustrated than in our nation's capital, Washington, DC.... Spending cuts and fiscal restraints must be an integral part of any plan to relieve the current financial burden and restore credibility to the nation's capital. But we believe the most important step is for the District government and Congress to fully embrace the proposal to reinvigorate the District announced last month by Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District's non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives. Norton has introduced the DC Economic Recovery Act, also known as a progressive flat tax plan, which will create much needed jobs, expand the tax base and serve as a great enticement to middle-class families to come back home to Washington."<br>
      Jack Kemp, with DC Council member Kevin P. Chavous, <i>Washington Post,</i> May 5, 1996
<p>
<b>About Stable Money</b><br>
"Businesses bringing their goods and services to the international market place should not have to contend with unpredictable exchange rate fluctuations that transform legitimately earned profits into currency losses. What is necessary in today's global economy is not a European Monetary Union so much as a viable plan for international monetary reform aimed at serving the needs of an open world economy dedicated to free trade."<br>
      Judy Shelton, EA Board Member, <i>Wall Street Journal Europe,</i> April 25, 1996
<p>
<b>About Tax Reform</b><br>
"What's truly driving voter frustration is a desire for clarity - for sharp-edge, distinct alternatives on how to move the country ahead...instead of beginning our debate by arguing over what appears on Page 6,743 of the tax code, why not begin on Page One? If we're sincere about wanting the public to participate in the debate over tax reform, shouldn't we start deciding whether we want to keep the current system we have?"<br>
      Theodore J. Forstmann, EA Founding Chairman and Member of the Tax Reform
      Commission, <i>Washington Times,</i> April 5, 1996
<p>
<b>About "Rap Rubbish"</b><br>
"A question for parents: What would you do if you discovered that someone was encouraging your sons to kill people indiscriminately, to find fun in beating and raping girls, and to use the word 'motherf---er' at least once in every sentence?" <br>
      William J. Bennett, Joe Lieberman and C. DeLores Tucker, <i>USA Today,</i> June
      6, 1996

<H2>Rapping Obscene Music, Empower America Launches "Round Two" in Values Campaign </H2>
</center>
On May 30, Empower America launched "Round Two" of the campaign against obscene and harmful music Iyrics being produced and marketed by major entertainment companies. Empower America Co-Director William J. Bennett announced the venture at a joint press conference in Washington, DC, with Senator Joe Lieberman (CT), and C. DeLores Tucker, Chair of the National Political Congress of Black Women.
<P>
In this second round of the ongoing campaign, Dr. Bennett, Senator Lieberman, Dr . Tucker and Senator Sam Nunn (GA) released a radio ad calling on five of the largest music companies to end their involvement with degrading and indefensible music Iyrics. The ad targets music that glorifies murder and drug use, and that celebrates the beating and raping of women. The companies named in the ad and at the press conference are Time Warner, as well as foreign-owned Sony of Japan, Thorn EMI of Great Britain, PolyGram (owned by Philips Electronics) of the Netherlands, and Bertelsmann of Germany. The ad is airing on both national and local talk shows.
<P>
Listeners who hear the ad are encouraged to call Empower America's hotline to add their names to a petition being sent to the companies. The goal is to reach as many people as possible, who will, in turn. contact these companies and ask them to reconsider their support for this music.
<P>
Time Warner, the target of Empower America's first campaign against obscene music,took a positive step with their sale of Interscope Records last September. However, since that time, they have not limited their production and distribution of offensive music on some of their other labels. As a result, Empower America is again calling on Time Warner, as well as the other four foreign-owned corporations, to refuse to sponsor this cultural rot.
<P>
Prior to the press conference announcing the campaign, letters were sent to the heads of the corporations, and to their American subsidiaries, asking them to "make normative judgments about what is acceptable to produce and market" and calling on the corporations to "refuse to sponsor this vicious, vulgar music."
<P>
Empower America plans to continue efforts to focus scrutiny on obscene music Iyrics, and to ask major corporations to refuse to sponsor garbage. Said Empower America Co-Director William J. Bennett, "We are going to continue to put the heat and light on these guys...We're in it for the duration."

<H2>Virtue on Public Television This Fall</H2>
</center>
William Bennett's highly acclaimed anthology, The Book of Virtues, is being brought to life in a new, fully animated television series: "Adventures from The Book of Virtues." The new television show will premier in the fall on PBS.
<P>
Produced by PorchLight Entertainment in association with KCET in Los Angeles, "Adventures from The Book of Virtues" will air during prime time on PBS stations nationwide for three consecutive evenings, beginning on Labor Day, 1996. The series draws its themes from Dr. Bennett's collection of classic American stories, Greek mythology, European fairy tales, African fables, Asian folk tales, Native American legends and Bible stories.
<P>
The characters and stories in each adventure will exemplify the traits of good character and depict the virtues illustrated in the The Book of Virtues, which has sold over two million copies. Many well-known Hollywood stars will be lending their voices to the heroic characters and villains in the series.
<P>
William Bennett has been highly critical of network programs aimed at our nation's youth and believes that the way to respond to poor television programming is either to turn the television off or to try to put something on that will lift up spirits and minds. Dr. Bennett is hopeful that "Adventures from The Book of Virtues" will add some much needed lift to family viewing time.
<P>
<B>Call your local PBS outlet for viewing times on Labor Day.</B>

<FONT SIZE=5>Bennett: Educating America on Crime<BR>
</center>
</FONT>
<P>
<blockquote>
<FONT SIZE=2>Empower America's William Bennett was recently named
co-chair of the bipartisan Council on Crime in America. The commission
will present hard data to educate both the public and the media
on the nature and extent of the crime problem in the United States,
and identify policies and initiatives that protect citizens and
promote justice. Dr. Bennett co-chairs the Council on Crime with
Griffin B. Bell, who was Attorney General in the Carter Administration.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The Council on Crime's first report, The State of
Violent Crime in America, generated widespread media attention.
It revealed that despite the recent drop in crime rates in certain
cities, the dangers law-abiding citizens face are near an all-time
high. These dangers are compounded by the reality of &quot;revolving
door&quot; justice which allows criminals to walk free on probation,
parole or pre-trial release. In fact, one out of every three convicted</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> criminals is under the &quot;supervision&quot; of
the justice system at the very time they commit more murders,
rapes and other violent crimes.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;This study paints a realistic and sobering
picture of violent crime in America,&quot; Bennett said, &quot;but
it is not without its rays of hope. If the success that cities
such as New York and Houston have had in reducing crime rates
teaches us anything, it is that the common sense of the American
people is right when it comes to crime: tough law enforcement
is a necessary part of the solution.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Council's report also corrects some of the misinformation
about criminal justice spread by the popular press. For example,
the widespread myth that too many people are imprisoned in America
is refuted by the Council' s finding that only one criminal for
every 100 violent crimes actually goes to jail. Evidence that
over 90 percent of all state prisoners have been violent criminals
or are recidivists dispell inaccurate reports that prisons are
populated with nonviolent offenders. And the report presents calculations
which demonstrate that imprisoning violent offenders saves dollars
as well as lives: a single rape costs its victim and society an
average of $87,000 - many times greater than the cost of
keeping a rapist in prison for a year.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;This is an important report,&quot; Bennett
noted, &quot;it is rigorous, toughminded, and common-sensical.
It provides important information on the nature of the crime problem
in the United States. But more importantly, it points to the problems
in the American justice system that can be fixed, and if fixed,
can and will save lives. I am convinced that the first and fundamental
responsibility of government is protecting the citizenry. It is
the key provision in the social contract. And there is simply
no way that civil society can flourish if there is lawlessness
in the streets.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Council on Crime will be holding several grassroots
hearings across the nation over the next several months to highlight
innovative policies and citizen initiatives to counteract crime.
The final report, which will offer policy prescriptions to cut
crime, increase the effectiveness and responsiveness of the criminal
justice system, and promote citizen safety will be issued in the
summer of 1996.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Along with Bennett and Bell, other Council members
include Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham, former U.
S. Attorney General William Barr, Florida Attorney General Robert
Butterworth, Princeton Professor John DiIulio, California Prison
Commissioner John Gillis, Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith
and Colorado Attorney General Gail Norton. H</FONT>

<p>
<FONT SIZE=3>Kemp: Flatter, Fairer Tax System Urged<BR>
</FONT>
</center>
<P>
<blockquote>
<FONT SIZE=2>In January of 1996, the National Commission on Economic
Growth and Tax Reform issued a comprehensive report to Congress
and the country. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and House Speaker
Newt Gingrich created the Commssion last year to analyze the current
system and develop proposals for an entirely new tax system. Empower
America Co-Director Jack Kemp was appointed Chairman of the Commission.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The &quot;Kemp Commisson&quot; held hearings throughout
the country to learn the views of the American people about the
current tax system and their ideas for a new tax system. The Kemp
Commission found that the current tax code is far too complex,
intrusive and unfair, and is, in effect, a dead weight on the
American economy. As stated in the report, <i>Unleashing America's
Potential: A Pro-Growth, Pro-Family Tax System for the 21st Century:</i>
&quot;We believe the current tax code cannot be revised, should
not be reinvented, and must not be retained. Therefore, the commission
is unanimous: It is time to throw out the seven-million word mess
of tax laws and regulations and begin a new.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Commissioners outlined six working principles
they believe a tax code must have to ensure that the system is
fair while accurately reflecting and fostering the high ideals
of the American democratic-republic.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> These principles include: <i><b>fairness</b></i>, treating citizens
equally before the law;<i> <b>simplicity</b></i>; making compliance as easy as possible;
<b><i>neutrality</i></b>, so that people and not government make the choices;
<b><i>
stability</b></i>, so that people can accurately plan for their futures;
and <b><i>visibility</b></i>, so citizens will have an honest sense of the true
cost of government. The Commission also stressed that <b><i>economic
growth</i></b> must not be inhibited by the tax code.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>With these firm principles anchoring the Commission's
vision, it offered recommendations for a new tax system to stimulate
a vigorous national debate about how best to change the current
system. The Commission proposed a low, single-rate of taxation
with a generous personal exemption&Ntilde;to remove those people
least able to bear a tax burden from the tax rolls. Such a system
would remove the biases against work, saving, and investment present
in the current system's double, triple, and quadruple taxation
of income.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Another major recommendation was to make payroll
taxes fully deductible for working men and women. And it recommended
abolishing separate taxation of capital gains.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Addressing the current pattern of a constantly changing
tax code, the Commission also strongly recommended a 2/3 super
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> majority vote in Congress be required to increase
tax rates in the future. This will provide a measure of stability
in the tax system so people and businesses can better plan future
savings and investment.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Secretary Kemp and other members of the Tax Reform
Commission recently testified before the Senate Finance Committee
where they outlined the very real and substantial problems with
the current system and strongly advocated the creation of a new
tax system for a new millennium, one that accomodates the new
information age and stimulates technological revolution.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Tax reform will be a key issue in the 1996 elections,
and many candidates have endorsed the single-rate model outlined
by the Kemp Commission. The dissatisfaction with the current code
is producing a groundswell of support for radical tax reform.
The Kemp Commission made a substantial contribution to this rising
tide of change by providing the philosophical justification for
a new, single-rate tax system for America's 21st century.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The fourteen Commissioners came from large and small
business sectors, academia, and the public sector. Empower America'
s Founding Chairman, Ted Forstmann, served as one of the Commissioners.

<FONT SIZE=3>Kirkpatrick: Facts on National Security<BR>
</FONT>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Empower America Co-Director and former US Ambassador
to the United Nations Jeane Kirkpatrick has taken issue with President
Bill Clinton's State of the Union (SOTU) assertion that his administration
has &quot;enhanced the security of the American people.&quot;
In a series of recent speeches and articles, Ambassador Kirkpatrick,
who is also a syndicated columnist, stated that &quot;almost everything
President Clinton said in his State of the Union address concerning
foreign policy is misleading, much simply untrue.&quot; Some major
national security issues which merit examination include:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><b>National Missile Defense</b><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>President Clinton's statement that &quot;for the
first time, since the dawn of the nuclear age, there are no Russian
missiles pointed at American children&quot; is misleading, as
it ignores the overwhelming need to defend the United States from
attack by ballistic missiles carrying weapons of mass destruction.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The evidence that rogue regimes hostile to the United
States - such as Iraq, Iran and North Korea - are undertaking
extraordinary efforts to acquire advanced missile and weapons
technology is overwhelming. Two years ago, then-CIA Director James
Woolsey testified to the Congress, &quot;More than twenty-five
countries, many of them hostile to the United States and our friends
and allies, may now have or are developing nuclear, biological
and chemical weapons, and the means to deliver them.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>President Clinton vetoed the Defense Bill on December
29, 1995, in large part because he objected to the Congressional
increase in ballistic defense program funding and mandate to deploy
the defense system by 2003. In his veto message, Mr. Clinton argued
that deploying this defense system would violate the 1972 Antiballistic
Missile Treaty (ABM) between the United States and the former
Soviet Union. As EA Co-Directors Jeane Kirkpatrick and Jack Kemp
wrote to Senator Strom Thurmond (R-SC), Chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, last fall: &quot;The ABM Treaty, designed
for a bipolar world, always had dubious value. It is now wholly
outdated .... It dismays us that instead of focusing on our current
needs, opponents of ballistic missile defense worry about outdated
arms control treaties with countries that no longer exist.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The development of missile defenses today is technologically
and economically feasible. We can speak and act with confidence
in the world only when we can defend ourselves.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is interesting to note that public opinion polling
and focus groups indicate that most Americans are unaware that
the United States is unprotected from ballistic missile attack,
and believe this capability already exists. When they learn this
is not the case, they support national missile defense. President
Clinton did not mention the need to develop this defense capability
in his State of the Union speech. But as Ambassador Kirkpatrick
has said repeatedly, &quot;This is the most important issue in
defense policy for our times.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><b>Bosnia</b><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As a candidate for the presidency more than three
years ago, Bill Clinton pledged to use air strikes and lift the
arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims so they could defend
themselves against Serb aggression. Instead, in recent testimony
before the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives,
Ambassador Kirkpatrick pointed out that &quot;more than two and
one half million have been displaced from their homes in this
war, more than 200,000 killed. Concentration camps, torture, mass
rape and mass murder have become familiar again in the region.&quot;
President Clinton's State of the Union assertion that &quot;we
stood for peace in Bosnia&quot; - while, as Ambassador
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> Kirkpatrick wrote, &quot;prisoners starved, young
men died, war and refugees spread across the country - is
shameless.&quot; Had President Clinton kept his campaign promise
to help the victims of aggression defend themselves, 25,000 U.S.
troops may not have had to spend this past Christmas enforcing
a tenuous peace agreement in Bosnia.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><b>Clinton's Use of Force</b><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>President Clinton said that he has kept our military
strong, and has used force &quot;only where we must.&quot; But
as Ambassador Kirkpatrick has written, &quot;In truth, the Clinton
administration has not used force only when it must.&quot; In
Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti, it used force when other policies would
have been equally or more effective, and the expressed goals for
these military interventions have not been achieved. &quot;A 'proud
nation' was not constructed in Somalia; 'democracy' was not restored
in Haiti; Bosnians were not protected from ethnic cleansing.&quot;
</FONT>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=2><b>
Neglecting Major Powers</b><BR> 
</FONT>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=2>Ambassador Kirkpatrick also cites the Clinton administration's
neglect of relations with major powers. &quot;Here,&quot; she
writes, &quot;there is a sad contrast to the Bush administration,
which focused on building and enhancing US relations with Western
Europe, Japan, China, Russia. All these relations have now deteriorated.
The President - off in pursuit of unconventional goals - is
neglecting the store.&quot; </FONT>

<FONT SIZE=3>EA Leads the Way at Freshman &quot;Advance&quot;
<BR>

<blockquote>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Empower America and the Heritage Foundation recently
co-hosted the 1996 &quot;Congressional Advance&quot; for many
conservative freshman Members of the House of Representatives.
The Congressional Advance, held on January 25-26 in Baltimore,
marked the one-year anniversary of last year's Congressional Retreat,
which introduced the new conservative Members of Congress to Capitol
Hill. The Congressional Advance, like the Retreat, provided an
important forum to help the freshman Members plan the enactment
of a conservative agenda. Empower America CoDirector William Bennett
delivered the keynote address entitled &quot;The Republican Revolution:
The Next Steps.&quot; The conference also included panels on &quot;Government
Downsizing,&quot; &quot;Empowering Citizens,&quot; and &quot;Strengthening
America' s Families and Culture.&quot; More than fifty Members
of Congress attended the Advance, including several sophomore
Members of Congress.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=3>Gallup Poll Finds Public Still Wants Tough Drug Control
Policy<BR>
</FONT>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><i>According to a recent Gallup Poll, Americans still
view drug abuse as one of the most serious issues facing the country
in spite of decreasing public discussion by the media about the
&quot;war on drugs.&quot; Fully 94 percent of poll respondents
ranked the drug problem second only to violent crime. William
Bennett, former director of the Office of National Drug Control
Policy (&quot;Drug Czar&quot;) under President George Bush, was
invited by the Gallup organization to review the polling results
and comment on their implications for public policy. His remarks follow.</i>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<center><FONT SIZE=2>Statement by</FONT><br>
<FONT SIZE=2>WILLIAM J. BENNETT</FONT><br>
<FONT SIZE=2>to accompany the release of the Gallup Poll</FONT><br>
<FONT SIZE=2>A 1996 VIEW OF THE DRUG PROBLEM IN AMERICA</FONT><br>
<FONT SIZE=2>December 12, 1995<BR>
</FONT>
</center>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Toward the close of my tenure as Secretary of Education,
in a speech before the White House Conference on a Drug-Free 
America, I called for a &quot;transformation of government
policy to match, and build on, the transformation of public sentiment.&quot;
I was referring to the public' s recognition that drug use was
no longer considered harmless fun or mere self-indulgence, but
a personal, medical and economic catastrophe. That was in 1988,
and indeed we did continue to mount a strong offensive against
drugs throughout the Bush administration from 1989 to 1992 - with
real results. Since 1993, America has in large part abandoned
the drug war. But public sentiment, as this Gallup Poll attests,
has not changed. Americans still want a tough and decisive
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> drug control policy with the federal government rightfully
leading the fight.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is no surprise that Gallup found more than nine
in ten Americans seriously concerned about drug abuse, and that
the issue of drugs rates second only to violent crime in seriousness.
Americans should be concerned, because the news is bad; drug use
among adolescents is once again on the rise after the steady and
dramatic decline of the 1980s and early 1990s. According to the
Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University,
&quot;the jump in marijuana use among children 12 to 18 years...signals
that 820,000 more of these children will try cocaine in their
lifetime. Of that number, about
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> 58,000 will become regular cocaine users and addicts.&quot;
More bad news is that drug related hospital emergency-room cases -
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> dominated by aging, inner-city drug addicts - have
reached the highest levels since 1978. Cocaine, heroin and marijuana
cases all have increased sharply to record levels.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>What Americans have witnessed - and reacted
to in the Gallup Poll - is the result of a failure of public
policy brought about by a moral torpor on the drug issue. Policy
follows attitude. But the public' s attitude is not one of indifference
toward the scourge. When asked what they wanted to see <i>a lot more</i>
of, more than half of the Gallup respondents cited strict law
enforcement and education of the young, and <i>two-thirds</i> cited reduction
of the supply of drugs coming into the United States. By contrast,
<i>fewer than 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>half</i> - 43 percent - asked for more treatment
programs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The current policy of &quot;treatment on demand&quot;
presents a record of failure that is reflected in the weak support
it received in the Gallup Poll. Unlike the effective and modest
treatment programs sponsored by churches and using variants of
the 12-step method, thc government treatment bureaucracy is manifestly
wasteful and ineffective. From 1988 to 1994, federal drug treatment
spending almost tripled while the estimated number of treatment
slots actually declined. And the discouraging result is that overall
cocaine treatment is not significantly reducing the population
of hard core addicts. We must 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>turn our support toward the proven models of treatment,
while recognizing the harsh realities of cocaine and crack addiction
as yet one more compelling reason why preventing casual drug use
by the young - the first step on the path to addiction - is
so important.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Gallup Poll respondents put drug interdiction high
on their list - the percentage of those calling for increased
efforts to reduce the incoming supply of drugs into the U.S. was
88 percent. Those respondents are right - the government
should put the U.S. military in charge of stopping the flow of
illegal drugs from outside our borders and give the military control
over the entire interdiction</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> process. We know that strong interdiction works.
In 1989, the U.S. military followed Columbia's internal crack-down
on the cocaine cartels with the most extensive detection, tracking
and interdiction effort ever mounted against cocaine transit from
the Andean countries north. These events 
produced substantial disruption in the cocaine supply
to the U.S. between 1989 and 1991. Drugs were less available on
the streets; cocaine-related emergency room cases declined; reported
cocaine deaths decreased; the estimated number of heavy users
fell; and casual use dropped dramatically. Today, U.S. foreign
policy no longer takes the drug problem seriously, and the once strong
military interdiction role has been abdicated. We need now to
restore our interdiction efforts and to establish trade and diplomatic
sanctions and eliminate aid to cocaine source countries that fail
to reduce their production of cocaine.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>More law enforcement efforts to punish and convict
people for the use 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>and sale of illegal drugs were endorsed by 83 percent
of the Gallup respondents. Even more forcefully, by 85 percent,
those surveyed rejected the despairing proposal that drugs should
be legalized in America. The response is wise on both counts.
Law enforcement requires action at the federal, state and local
levels. The federal role requires 
the identification and dismantling of all major drug
trafficking organizations known to be operating in the U.S. Law
enforcement, drug treatment, and prevention education are state
and local responsibilities for which current federal aid should
be block granted without mandates.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The majority of respondents (85 percent) who oppose
legalization of drugs send a strong message to those who would
propose such an option. Drugs like heroin and cocaine are not
dangerous and threatening to society because they are illegal.
They are illegal because they are dangerous and threatening to
American society. Any relaxation 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>in standards of illegality would make drugs more
accessible, cheaper and morally permissible. On this issue there
has long been a great gap between a select few who favor legalization - and
the overwhelming body of the American people who reject such a
policy of despair. In the Gallup Poll, the people have again made
that point.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Success in the drug war depends above all on what
happens in America' s homes, classrooms, churches, voluntary associations,
television and movie screens, city streets and civic halls. It
depends on the efforts of parents, teachers, clergy, police chiefs,
judges and community leaders. When I was President Bush' s &quot;drug
czar,&quot; I visited more than 100 cities. I made a point to
go where the problem was the worst and to visit and learn from
the people who made things better. I saw extraordinary actions
and extraordinary achievements. The point is, we know what works.
The common denominators are almost always the same: civic concern,
moral seriousness, and toughminded and intelligent policies.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Gallup organization has given us <i>A 1996 View
of The Drug Problem in America</i>. That view clearly shows that the
American people also understand what needs to be done and are
ready to renew the fight.</font>

<p>
<FONT SIZE=3>EA to Host Spring Candidate School<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
</center>
<blockquote>
<FONT SIZE=2>Building on the success of EA's efforts in 1994 to
inform candidates for office about Empower America's political
message, EA Co-Directors Jack Kemp, William Bennett, and Jeane
Kirkpatrick invite 1996 candidates to join them in Washington,
DC on Monday, April 29 for Empower America's 1996 Candidate School.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Educating candidates for local, state and national
office is one of EA's most important functions. While most candidate
schools concentrate on the nuts and bolts of running for office,
Empower America's training is devoted entirely to a discussion
of issues and their philosophical and political foundations. The
EA messages of economic opportunity, cultural renewal and international
leadership are stressed.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>During the day-long event, a variety of political
instructors will address the attendees:
individual leaders, policy experts, political
analysts and elected officials. EA will bring together the best
thinkers and the best ideas to help each candidate form a solid
base of information and craft a winning message. Another valuable
component of the sessions is to learn from participating candidates
about issues and concerns being raised by citizens in their districts.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As in 1994, Empower America will prepare a detailed
candidate briefing book for all participants, and will make the
book available to candidates who are unable to attend.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In 1994 Empower America worked with candidates for
office ranging from local school boards to the U.S. Senate. &quot;Graduates&quot;
include some of the leading &quot;revolutionaries&quot; of the
104th Congress - Congressmen Joe Scarborough (FL), Bob Barr
(GA), Ron Lewis (KY), Dick Chrysler (MI), Phil English (PA) and
Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee. Jack Kemp, William Bennett
and Jean Kirkpatrick look forward to exchanging ideas with the
1996 candidates who want to become better informed about Empower
America' s policy agendas.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>For further information, write: Candidate School,
Empower America, 1776 I St., NW, Washington, DC 20006, or call
202-452-8200, or 1-800-761-2044. </FONT>

<FONT SIZE=3>Campaign Tackles Trash TVTalk Shows<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Ads aimed at shows' advertisers having effect<BR>
</FONT>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>For the past several months, Empower America Co-director
William Bennett has been involved in a public campaign with Senators
Joe Lieberman (D-CT) and Sam Nunn (D-GA) to focus scrutiny on
certain 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>daytime television talk shows. The campaign has resonated
strongly with the American people, many of whom have contacted
Empower America to express their relief that someone has finally
given voice to the concerns they have about the filth paraded
on television.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Consider the subjects discussed on a number of talk
shows during the past year, according to <i>Electronic Media </i>(April, 1995):
a l3 year old discussing her sexual experiences which began when
she was 10; a male guest admitting to sleeping with his girlfriend's
mother; a woman claiming to have been impregnated while making
a 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>pornographic movie; or the following titles: &quot;Sex
Caught on Tape,&quot; and &quot;I'm Marrying a 14-year Old Boy.&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Clearly, shows such as these cross the line of decency.
They celebrate the perverse, and they normalize trashy behavior.
The campaign against trash television is based on the premise
that companies should stop their support of this kind of demeaning,
degrading content. And if they continue their support, they should
be able to justify publicly what they are doing.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The campaign has had a number of different components.
Dr. Bennett and Senator Lieberman have written letters to the
heads of major corporations - Sony, Tribune, Time Warner,
National Amusements, King World, Gannett - which own the
companies that produce the shows, asking them to reconsider their
support of trash television, and questioning whether profits these
companies derive from such degrading, valueless products are really
worth it.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In addition, advertisers have been targeted
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>for their support of trash talk television.
On December 7, Dr. Bennett, Senators Lieberman and Nunn unveiled
a television ad calling on major advertisers to stop sponsoring
cultural rot, and asking them to reconsider
their support of these programs. There are
indications that some of them already have: Sears Roebuck, Unilever
NV, Procter &amp; Gamble, and Mars Inc. have said they are withdrawing
advertising from some of these programs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>And on January 22, Dr. Bennett, Senators Lieberman
and Nunn called on the owners of local stations to use their influence
to take the trash out of talk TV, with an open letter that ran
in the daily newsletter of the annual conference of the National
Association of Television Program Executives (NATPE).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Since the campaign began, we've had evidence from
a number of quarters that the tide is turning. Not only have some
advertisers pulled out, but a number of shows have been canceled.
Several station managers in 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>California and in Colorado have decided to discontinue
airing shows they deem unacceptable. And a January poll by <i>Broadcasting
&amp; Cable</i> of TV general managers shows that 83 percent agree
that talk shows are purveyors of &quot;sleazy, tasteless subject
matter with little if any redeeming value.&quot; And the new shows
being offered up for next year focus less on sensationalism.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Viewers also have a responsibility. Instead of simply
lamenting the debased state of our popular culture, citizens need
to take action. While turning off these shows, or requesting companies
to 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>stop producing this kind of material won't eradicate
all of the garbage on our television screens, it will make an
important step toward relegating this trash to the sidelines,
and out of the mainstream. And so the campaign continues to petition
men and women of good will - viewers, sponsors, producers - to
do something about it. </FONT>

a woman or man would face as they take the first two or three
rungs in the ladder. And we came out specifically for the deduction
of the payroll tax, which is a huge burden on working men and

<FONT SIZE=3>A Letter To Our Readers<BR>

<P>
</center>
<blockquote>
<FONT SIZE=2>Empower America is making an impact! In this important
political year, when American citizens and candidates will be
participating in the long process which will culminate in the
selection of America's president and Congress, Empower America's
ideas and issues have become an essential part of the debate.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Whether the issue is a flatter, fairer tax; crime,
drugs and television trash talk shows; or U.S. military forces
in Bosnia and the need for national missile defense - Empower
America's ideas are shaping the agenda. We urge Empower America
Associates to get even more involved in the days ahead. There
is so much to be done, and each of you has an important role to
play.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Re-ordering the size and scope of government in our
nation and in our lives is an immense project. By attending your
local town meetings, writing letters to your elected representatives
and the editor of your local newspaper, calling in on radio talk
shows, meeting with your neighbors and discussing the issues,
you can make sure that your concerns and your ideas are heard.
And by doing so, you demonstrate the most fundamental tenet of
our shared beliefs: that individual citizens, not government,
are responsible for setting the nation's priorities and deciding
how best they are met.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We have never been better positioned to make a difference.
In January 1996, Empower America celebrated its third birthday.
In this short time, we have established an organization unlike
any in Washington today. The energy, commitment and involvement
of Empower America's Co-Directors and grassroots Associates have
made us a formidable team. Like you, Bill Bennett, Jack Kemp and
Jeane Kirkpatnck share a positive vision of America's future.
Our shared belief in economic growth and opportunity, social and
cultural renewal, and strong international leadership can lead
a vibrant Amenca into the twenty-first century and the information
age.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Your continued involvement and commitment are essential.
and we are grateful for your support and activism.<BR>

<H3>"Beyond the Contract: The Next Steps"</H3>
Speech by Rep. Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House
</CENTER>
<p>
MAY 9,1995, WASHINGTON, DC-- This is V-E Day, and there is a parallel about which we need to be aware. Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that our generation has a rendezvous with destiny. He was referring to dealing with Italy, Japan and Germany. That generation ultimately, reluctantly, rose to that challenge, driven in part by Pearl Harbor, and ultimately succeeded.
<p>
We then had a rendezvous with destiny in containing the Soviet empire until it collapsed. For 45 years we did that. We led the largest worldwide coalition in history, and we sustained forces against the Soviet empire far longer than anybody thought a democracy could. So we've won two enormous victories on the world scene in the last two generations.
<p>
The surprising thing, I think, is that our current rendezvous with destiny is here at home. We have to renew American civilization because if it continues to decay, we will literally be incapable of being effectivein the world and the world market.
<p>
The situation is very grave. It is obvious to all of you if you watch any local television news anywhere in the country, that we have a level of violence, a level of decay, a level of brutality which is not sustainable in a free society. I've often said that you can't maintain civilization with 12-year-olds having babies, with 15-yearolds killing each other, with 17-year-olds dying of AIDS, with 18-yearolds getting diplomas they can't even read. And all four of those things are happening in our country.
<p>
There is much more to do. For starters, we will be building on the success of the Contract. We adopted the Contract last summer and fall. We stood on the Capitol steps in September and introduced it to the American people; then we based our campaigns on it. We ran a TV Guide ad that had no negatives, no attack on Bill Clinton and no antiDemocratic rhetoric. It just said, "Give us a chance, here's what we'll do," and outlined the Contract With America. We then got elected.
<p>
Starting the opening day, we kept our word. We passed nine reforms in a 14 hour opening day--the longest in United States history. We continued keeping our word. We brought up every item we said we would. We passed 30 out of 31 items. The only legislative item we lost from the Contract was term limits, where we got 85 percent voting "yes" from the Republican side, 82 percent voting "no" on the Democratic side, and because term limits require a Constitutional majority of 290, we couldn't get it to pass. In the first 93 days, we had a total of 302 recorded votes.
<p>
We're now looking at "where do we go from here?" I think the answer lies in three large projects at the vision level, and then, nine strategies. Let me very briefly run through these visions and strategies:
<p>
We have three major things we have to do. We've got to communicate to the American people that there is an American future that's better--better economic growth, better technology, better services, better opportunities, better safety--and we want to work with the American people to get to that better future.
<p>
Second, we have to have a dialogue. I think it's very important for us to go beyond just debating liberals. We have to have a dialogue with the American people. We have to get people engaged and talking about their future.
<p>
Out of that new vision of a successful America, and new dialogue with the American people, we want to establish a new partnership. Remember, this is not government-to-citizen, this is citizentocitizen. The Constitution begins, "We, the people of the United States," and what we've got to do is go back and reestablish that as a reality in everyone's life.
<p>
I also believe that if our children are going to compete in the world market they have to do a whole lot more homework than they've been doing. My guess is they've got to do probably two hours a night. I think we literally cheat them if they don't have enough homework to learn how to study, to acquire the information they must have in order to compete with Germany, Japan and China. However, I do not suggest that that means we need a "Federal Department of Homework Checkers." Instead, we need to reestablish a partnership where we expect parents to care about their children's education, and we make that a standard and a routine expectation.
<p>
This is why I believe that what we're doing is as much a cultural change as it is a political change. We are reasserting the core of American civilization. The road there is made up of nine strategies.
<p>
First, we have to renew American civilization. That means reasserting the work ethic, family, savings--all the core values that started with the notion that we're endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights. Remember that is the most radical statement of human rights in history--that power comes from God to you, and then you loan it to the government. The power doesn't come from God to the government.
<p>
Second, we need to be competitive in the world market. We get high economic growth by reestablishing a system in which entrepreneurs are encouraged to go out and compete, in which there are enough savings, and in which we're prepared to create American jobs through world sales. To do that we have to rethink litigation, regulation, taxation, education, the welfare system, and the bureaucratic structure of government, because we are not a competitive society today. If we want our children to have the best jobs on the planet with the highest take-home pay, it's going to take real effort.
<p>
Third, we have to accelerate moving into the information age. The fact is there are extraordinary opportunities out there, and we are doing too little to take advantage of them.
<p>
The fourth strategic change we need is to replace the welfare state with the opportunity society. We can design a volunteercentered, spiritually-centered replacement for the welfare state that dramatically improves the life of the poor. Every time you hear a liberal jump up to defend the current-system, just remember that what they're telling you is that they are prepared to use the children as the device to keep the bureaucracy. It is inexcusable what we do to poor children in the inner city. We have to replace the welfare state with an opportunity society.
<p>
Fifth, we have to decentralize power and disperse power. They are two different things. Decentralization gets it out of Washington; dispersing it gets it back to you. Ultimately, block grants are, in my mind, a first step toward a dramatic degovernmentalizing of America. One of the reasons we were so strongly for the $500 child tax credit was to make the flat assertion: "parents who earn it have a higher claim than bureaucrats who want to spend it," and that we want the money to stay with the parents, not go to a bureaucracy. That's a very different model of how you organize America.
<p>
Sixth, for the parts of government that we do keep, I think they should be the best in the world. I think our principle ought to be that if you're going to have a federal government it ought to be excellent. I am not anti-government. I think we need a lean, effective government. What we have today is a big, fat, sloppy, ineffective and weak government, incapable of setting priorities and incapable of doing well the things government should focus on.
<p>
Seventh, we should balance the budget. It is a practical matter, and I can give you the simple moral test. For most of American history we paid off the family mortgage and we left the children the farm. In this generation, we're gradually selling off the farm and leaving the children the mortgage. A child born this year will pay $187,000 in taxes in their lifetime, just to pay interest on the federal debt, that is $3,500 per working year just to pay interest. Interest on the debt will be larger than the cost of national security in 1997. That gives you some sense of scale. More and more, your taxes will go to pay interest to the bond-holders than will go to pay for the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, intelligence agencies, and defense bureaucracies combined. Now, that is not sustainable, which is why I think we do have a profound challenge to balance the budget.
<p>
In addition, Medicare has its own freestanding problems. The Clinton Administration's Medicare Trustees reported that Medicare literally runs out of money by 2002. And when you look further into the future to when the baby boomers retire, it's dramatically worse. We have the challenge to be prepared to implement the reforms that are necessary to save Medicare now, and then to have a commission which will look at how you save Medicare in the baby boom years, which is a massively bigger challenge than trying to save it now.
<p>
Eighth, I think we have to have a strategy of safety for the American people. If your government can't protect you, then you have no constitutional liberties. We have an obligation to reassert and reestablish the legitimate right of every citizen, that they ought to be able to live without fear in a safe country which loves its children enough to protect them from the predators who right now dominate all too many of our streets.
<p>
Lastly, we have to have a strategy for leading the planet. We are the only country large enough, complex enough and strong enough to lead the human race. If in fact we allow our culture to collapse and our economy to decay, there is nobody who can replace us. If we can't do the first eight things in order to set ourselves up to be able to lead, and we collapse as leaders, you will in fact, I think, leave your children a dark and bloody planet. In that sense I think Chechnya and Bosnia, Rwanda and Somalia are harbingers of the kind of future that could come if America grows weaker.
<p>
I think over the last couple of years that Empower America has been a very helpful part of this. I think that it really has given us a range of ideas. There is a whole series of things we've done over the last couple of years that I think have been very, very helpful. We can continue building this momentum; we need as many voices and as many systems out there as we can get that are educating, encouraging, and pushing in the same general direction. And so I appreciate very, very much the chance to be here with you today, and I thank you all very much for coming.

<H3>Empower America's Victory Against Time Warner</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Empower America has scored an important victory on the cultural front. For the past several months, William J. Bennett, Co-director of Empower America, and C. DeLores Tucker, Chair of the National Political Congress of Black Women, have been involved in a public campaign against offensive and misogynistic music Iyrics. They have targeted their efforts on Time Warner, one of the greatest perpetrators of this kind of cultural filth. This spring, Time Warner increased its investment in "gangsta rap" by expanding its stake to 50 percent of Interscope Records, the label behind such artists as Snoop Doggy Dogg, Dr. Dre, Nine Inch Nails, and Tupac Shakur. Such "artists" extol the rape, murder, and torture of women. Some of these Iyrics glorify sexual abuse and even celebrate the murder of police officers. Columnist John Leo called Time Warner's investment "the cultural equivalent of owning half the world's mustard gas factories."
<p>
As a result, Bennett and Tucker called on Time Warner's sense of corporate responsibility and citizenship to end their sDonsorshiD of such music. They asked Time Warner to stop producing music which was unworthy of human consumption or corporate support.
<p>
In May, Bennett and Tucker met with Time Warner executives to present their case. At that time, their appeal fell on deaf ears. Bennett and Tucker then expanded their efforts to include a television ad, press conferences in New York and Los Angeles, as well as radio and television programs. In addition, Dr. Bennett wrote to Gerald Levin, Chairman and CEO of Time Warner, and both Tucker and Bennett wrote letters to members of the Board of Directors of Time Warner, informing them of the kind of music Time Warner was involved in producing and distributing. In June, Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-CT) joined Tucker and Bennett in a radio ad and press conference calling on Time Warner to exercise corporate responsibility.
<p>
The campaign has had strong resonance with the American public. The New York Times, The Wall Street Joumal, The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, Time, and Newsweek have all covered the story. Political figures from both parties, including President Clinton, and Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader, have voiced their support for Empower America's efforts.
<p>
On September 27, Time Warner announced that it planned to sever its ties with Interscope Records, selling its 50% stake back to Interscope founders Ted Field and Jimmy Lovine--an indication that shame and a call to corporate responsibility do work. Dr. Bennett applauded Time Warner's decision, and said that the company was "acting like a leader" in its decision to sell Interscope. Said Bennett, "I congratulate them, they did the right thing. I hope this is a statement about a larger point--that there are some things so bad that no responsible company will market and sell them to our children."
<p>
Empower America will continue to monitor the fate of Interscope, to see which music company, if any decides to purchase it. If other major companies pick up Interscope, they will hear from us. We will continue to press our case against corporations which peddle filth as entertainment for children.

<H3>EA Letter To Our Readers</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
The level of change effected in the first session of the 104th Congress has been unprecedented. Members passed more bills and worked more hours than during any previous congress. The battle over the size of the federal budget and the scale of Washington's bureaucracy is being won by those who would cut the size and scope of government.
<p>
This coongress accomplished policy goals that the cynics and skeptics dismissed as impossible. Nine of the ten components of "The Contract with America" passed the House of Representatives during the first hundred days of the 104th Congress and were sent to the Senate for consideration. Many of those measures have now passed the
<p>
Senate, while others continue to move through the legislative process under the guidance of those who understand the rightful limits of federal power.
<p>
The majority of members elected in November, especially those serving their first term, are committed to the empowerment agenda. They believe that individuals --not the federal government--should make the choices that affect their own lives. They know that high taxes hurt families and businesses at all income levels.
<p>
We have many friends in Congress, but we must remain active. This puts us in a position to get things done. We are working with individuals who understand the ideas that are important to us and who can act to promote them.<p>

Continue to write your representatives in Congress. Attend local town meetings and other events that allow you to meet with your representatives and articulate your views on national issues. This focal point of American politics allows you to become active in the governing process at the grassroots level.
<p>
We greatly appreciate your continued support and activism.
<P>
Charles Kupperman
<br><i>Executive Director</i>

<H3>Empower America On The Hill</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Empower America's Co-directors and board members have-been busy and active with the new Congress. We have been working with the Congressional leadership since January of 1993 to advocate the principles we represent. The new 104th Congress has provided us with a heightened opportunity to work for change. Our Co-directors and board members have tes fied before numerous Congressional committees promoting the empowerment agenda. Following are some highlights from the testimonies of Jeanne Kirkpatrick, William Bennett, and Jack Kemp.
<p>
<b>Jeanne Kirkpatrick:</b>
<p>
Empower America Co-director Jeane Kirkpatrick spoke to the House Foreign Relations Committee on January 24, 1995 about "National Security and International Affairs in the Context of Cooperation and Limitation." She was one of the select foreign policy experts chosen to give remarks on stability and instability in the international arena, and policy directives America should pursue.
<p>
Dr. Kirkpatrick said, "I believe this Congress and the National Security Revitalization Act have arrived just in the nick of time. Our military forces are beginning to 'go hollow,' and are feeling the full impact of schedules and budgets which have left them over-deployed and undertrained, overworked and underpaid."
<p>
<b>William Bennett:</b>
<p>
Empower America Co-director William Bennett testified several times before the new Congress. Of particular interest were his remarks to the United States Senate Budget Committee on January 24, 1995. His testimony was in regard to the topic, "Governing in the 21st Century." The new Congress has the opportunity to change the role and enormous size of the federal government, which Dr. Bennett strongly advocates in part through a "radical devolution" of decision-making.
<p>
Dr. Bennett told the committee, ":..it is critical to take a step back and establish once again a clear delineation of government's role. We need to articulate once again the proper responsibilities and limits of government--things like providing for the defense of the nation, waging war, building infrastructure projects, administering transfer payments, keeping the streets safe, and the like."
<p>
<b>Jack Kemp:</b>
<p>
Jack Kemp testified before the Senate Small Business Committee on October 19th in support of Senators Abraham and Lieberman's enterprise zone bill. The bill, entitled "The Enhanced Enterprise Zone Act of 1995," is closely patterned after Kemp's -bill from the 80's.
<p>
i In his testimony, Kemp pointed out, "How can we possibly begin to address the problems of crime, drugs, and education without first recognizing that without jobs and opportunity, there is little hope and few reasons to graduate from school, stay off drugs, and resist the underground economy? Without the expectation that there is a good job waiting out of college or high school, there will be no link between effort and reward, and no way to address fully the social pathologies that are all too prevalent in our inner cities."
<p>
Kemp went on to say that "over the past several years, the federal government has created an economic climate in America that is indifferent at best, and hostile at worst, to the agents of economic growth. Washington now imposes a vast array of income taxes, corporate taxes, payroll taxes, regulations, and mandated benefits that encourage businesses to keep employees to an absolute minimum. Today, the combined tax and regulatory burden on risktaking-- the process by which new enterprises and jobs are created-- has climbed to the levels of the early 1980s."

<H3>Kemp Heads National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Empower America Co-director Jack Kemp was chosen to chair the newly formed <a href="http://www.townhall.com/taxcom/">National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform</a>. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich appointed Kemp to lead the eight member commission in proposing a new economic pratform.
<p>
The goals of the new commission are ambitious and sweeping. Senator Dole charged the commission with moving "beyond tax reform toward a complete overhaul of the entire tax system." He added, "that's why we have asked Jack to reexamine the entire 4,000 page federal tax code... to start with a blank piece of paper." Kemp promised that the commission will focus on "reforming our tax code, restoring incentives to entrepreneurial capitalism, lowering tax rates, helping create jobs, and assisting low-income persons escape the conditions of poverty and welfare dependency."
<p>
In this effort, the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform will design, and push for the passage of, an alternative tax system that is fairer, flatter, and simpler. Speaker Gingrich noted that Kemp and the commission will "reach out to all of the presidential candidates, to all of the Republican governors, to all of the members of the House and Senate, to corporate America, and to the American people to put together the kind of reforms that are vital."
<p>
Both Dole and Gingrich asserted that naming Kemp to chair the commission carried both symbolic and practical significance. Speaker Gingrich asserted that "it is clear that there is a yearning in America for a very profound rethinking of the tax code, and Jack Kemp is the one to provide that type of leadership, having given President Reagan the Kemp-Roth tax cut of 1981." Dole added, "For over two decades Jack has been one of our most innovative thinkers on economic policy. No one can speak to these issues more creatively and more credibly."
<p>
The commission will issue a final report at the end of 1995--in time for the 1996 presidential primaries.

<H3>A Fairer, Simpler 21st Century Single Tax Rate System</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Recent polling shows almost twothirds of all Americans are interested in replacing the current income tax system with a single rate tax system which would require all American citizens and businesses to pay one, simple, low tax rate--around 17 percent.
<p>
Today, American economic policy is a mess. The tax code is now more than 5 million words long, understood by few, and oppressive to all. Washington's 60,000 pages of federal regulations further stifle entrepreneurial spirit while government spending remains out of control. The bottom line is lethargic economic growth and the loss of opportunity for millions of Americans.
<p>
The tax increases in the budget acts of 1990 and 1993 reversed the trend toward lower tax rates and fewer federal regulations that spurred the unprecedented growth and job creation of the 1980s. To put the tax code in perspective, it is worthwhile to look at how much the average family of four pays in taxes. In 1950, the typical middleincome family paid about 2 percent of its income in federal taxes. By 1993, that amount had increased to about 24 percent of income.
<p>
The only thing more costly to America than its tax system is its system of federal regulations. Experts estimate that these regulations cost Americans nearly $1 trillion a year.
<p>
The U.S. spends more money on its federal government than all other countries, except Japan, spend on their entire economies. In 1950, federal spending was about 16 percent of total gross domestic output. Today it has ballooned to 23 percent of GDP.
<p>
Taxes, regulations, and spending have produced an economy with anemic growth, slow job creation, and hindered entrepreneurship, and one in which the American Dream is not yet secure for enough of our people. Since the current economic recovery began, GDP growth has averaged just 2.4 percent in real terms, less than half the 5 percent growth rate usually associated with recoveries.
<p>
Job creation has lagged even further behind, increasing by only 3 percent instead of the average 9 percent recovery.
<p>
There is a straightforward way to deal with taxes, regulations, and spending-- the single rate tax system. The need to address all of these concerns is precisely what has piqued the American public's and Congress' interest in this revolutionary idea.

<H3>EA Brochure Lets You Make Federal Budget Cuts</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Washington, DC--Empower America Co-director Jack Kemp, along with Rep. Steve Largent (R-OK) and other members of the House Budget Committee, unveiled Empower America's new brochure on the budget process, entitled "Your Turn to Balance the Federal Budget."
<p>
Described by Largent as "a great way for people to become better informed about the budget process and to see for themselves what it is like to balance the budget," the brochure includes a worksheet which outlines current budgetary expenditures. Readers are also invited to enter their own numbers in an effort to develop a balanced budget reflecting their priorities.
<p>
Both the House and Senate have passed plans that would bring the federal budget into balance over a seven-year period, by slowing the rate of growth in many federal programss and targeting many others for elimination--those that are outdated or duplicative.
<p>
The share of the federal debt held by every man woman and child today totals over $18,500. Without fundamental change, children born today will pay nearly $200,000 over their lifetime in taxes to sustain the interest on the debt, and face a total tax rate (for all local, state, and federal spending) of 84 percent of their earnings over their lifetime, according to calculations in President Clinton's own budget.
<p>
Once the federal budget is balanced, for the first time since 1969, the government will be able to pay off its debt, which has grown over the 219 years of our history to nearly $5 trillion this year.
<p>
If you are interested in receiving your own copy of Empower America' s brochure, "Your Turn to Balance the Federal Budget," to discover how the process works, and make your own choices, then please send your request to Empower America at 1776 I Street, NW, Suite 890, Washington, DC 20006.

<H3>EA Leadership Council's Conference Forum</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Empower America's Leadership Council held its second Conference Forum in early May. One hundred members attended the day and a half conference set against the backdrop of our nation's capitol. Focusing on the state of the 104th Congress, "The Contract with America," and the future of our government, the conference's main objectives were to inform, enlighten, and empower its participants.
<p>
Empower America Co-director Jeane Kirkpatrick kicked off the formal program with a dinner address titled, "Beyond the Contract: Foreign and Domestic." In her remarks, Ambassador Kirkpatrick outlined the position that the United States government has taken on several foreign policy issues, her thoughts on those policies, the future of our government, and the changes that are necessary to ensure maximum peace and protection for the world.
<p>
The next day was packed with various speeches and discussions. Breakfast keynote speaker Co-director Bill Bennett remarked on the cultural impact of "The Contract with America," as well as giving his thoughts on the upcoming presidential election. Following Dr. Bennett, Senators Connie Mack (R-FL) and John Ashcroft (R-MO), and Congressmen John Boehner (R-OH) and Chris Cox (R-CA) shared their experiences and insight on the phenomenal first one hundred days of the Senate and House. 
<p>Two freshmen members of the House, Sue Myrick (R-NC) and Sam Brownback (R-KS), spoke about being part of a freshman class which retains the same hope and enthusiasm that they had when the 104th session of Congress began. Perhaps the most anticipated speaker of the day was the Speaker of the House and Empower America Board Member, Newt Gingrich. Speaker Gingrich, introduced by Co-director Jack Kemp, eloquently argued that "our rendezvous with destiny is here at home." He illustrated this point with his three vision levels and nine strategies for Congress to follow up 'The Contract with America."
<p>
The sessions and speeches successfully wrapped up with an inside look at the work of pollsters and their influence on elections. As the day drew to a close, Council Members were invited for a private tour of the Capitol.

<H3>Empower America Pushes the Single Rate Tax System In New Hampshire</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Empower America continued its ad campaign advocating a low, single rate tax system by running radio spots in New Hampshire. Since the 1996 presidential race begins in New Hampshire, Empower America wanted to produce a radio spot that would influence the debate on the single rate system. William Bennett, Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and Vin Weber have been strong proponents of a low single rate, and hope their efforts will influence the 104th Congress, and the presidential hopefuls.
<p>
William Bennett was the voice behind the message Empower America sent to the people of New Hampshire. The 60 second radio ad ran 88 times on five news and talk radio stations in New Hampshire.

<H3>Empower America Launches Campaign
Against Daytime TV Talk Shows</H3>
<i>Statement by William J. Bennett 
<br> October 26, 1995</i></CENTER>
<p>
First, I want to express my thanks to Senator Joe Lieberman. Senator Lieberman is the father of this idea. It was his suggestion that we continue to bring pressure--public pressure--on the perpetrators of cultural rot by calling attention to these shows.
<p>
Earlier this year, Senator Lieberman joined C. DeLores Tucker of the National Political Congress of Black Women and me in our campaign to urge Time Warner to sell their stake in Interscope Records, Inc. Today, we turn our attention to television. Now these days there is a lot of criticism directed at television--the casual cruelty, the rampant promiscuity, the mindlessness of sit-coms and soap operas. Most of the criticisms are justified. But this is not the worst of it. The worst of television is the day-time television talk shows we have identified. In these shows, indecent exposure is celebrated as a virtue.
<p>
It is hard to remember now, but there was once a time when personal or marital failure, subliminal desires, and perverse taste were accompanied by guilt or embarrassment. But today, these conditions are a ticket to appear as a guest on the Sally Jessy Raphael show, the Ricki Lake show, the Jerry Springer show, or one of the dozen or so like them.
<p>
I asked my staff to provide me with a list of some of the shows of some recent day-time talk-show topics. The list included "A Mother Who Ran Off with Her Daughter's Fiance," "Women Who Marry Their Rapists," "I'm Marrying a 14-year-old Boy," a woman who claims she got pregnant while making a pornographic movie; a 13-year-old guest who was urged to share her sexual experiences which began when she was 10; a woman eight months pregnant who boasted of having eight sexual partners during her first two trimesters; a 17-year-old girl who boasted of having slept with over a hundred men--well, you get the idea.

<p>
It is important here to point out who we are not talking about. We are not talking about shows like Oprah, or Regis and Kathie Lee. The shows which are the object of our criticisms are not close calls; they go way over the line of decency. They are at the bottom of the television barrel. Instead of simply lamenting the state of our popular culture, we think it's a good idea to try and do something about it. So here we are.
<p>
Our objectives are these: to raise a hue and cry across the land; to cast some light on what's being produced and distributed --"Sunlight is the best disinfectant," Justice Brandeis once wrote--and to petition men and women of good will--producers, sponsors, advertisers, and viewers --to rethink their support and sponsorship, participation and promotion of these programs.
<p>
What exactly is the harm being done by these programs? In his "Letter from Birmingham City Jail," Martin Luther King, Jr. instructed us that that which "uplifts human personality" is just and that which "degrades human personality" is unjust. Can anybody doubt that these shows degrade human personality? Do the sponsors think not? If so, why not?
<p>
Let me try and put this campaign in a broader context of the state of our popular culture, our country, and our civilization.
<p>
What is happening today is the pollution of the human environment, a kind of tropism toward the sordid. This nation desperately needs more opportunities for moral uplift. We believe that progress can be made through moral suasion and justifiable public discontent.
<p>
In a fundamental way, that is what this effort and efforts like it are all about. So today we declare ourselves to be part of a Resistance, a Resistance Operation to the giant popular culture sleaze machine. We welcome more volunteers to our ranks.<p>

Let me conclude with a personal note. Joe Lieberman is a Jew. I am a Catholic. Like most Americans, we believe in God; we both believe men and women are His creation, made in His image. And so we believe that men and women should not be celebrated when they debase themselves. <P>

<li>"Early deployment of an anti-ballistic missile defense system ... is the only way the U.S. government can fulfill its constitutional obligation to provide for the common defense. If we start now, immediately, and work as rapidly and well as possible, we may achieve an operationally effective missile defense in time to prevent a tragedy." 
<br><b>Jeane Kirkpatrick,<br>

Defense Policy Forum, May 24, 1995</b>
<p>
<li>"I'm here to defend the idea that the [tax] rates ought to come down, that it will be flatter, fairer, simpler; they've got to be lower across the board on labor and capital, the factors of production, and we ought to raise revenue for government and not try to redistribute the wealth of America. I don't think that is the purpose of the tax code--the tax code from time immemorial was to raise revenue and reduce the burden on those least able to bear that burden. And frankly, all of our plans--or all of 'the' plans are going to be judged on that basis. Does it raise revenue? Is it efficient for the economy and does it remove the burden on those least able to bear that burden?"
<br>
<b>Jack Kemp,<br> 
CNBC Inside Opinion, July 20,1995</b>
<p>

<li>"Bill Bennett, former Secretary of Education and White House Drug Czar, may have just won his biggest political victory: According to The New York Times, Time Warner is trying to sell its 50 percent stake in Interscope Records, the home of socalled gangsta rap...."
<p>
He and Mrs. Tucker both took their concerns directly to Time Warner, where they argued that distributing albums that glorify violence, murder and the abuse of women is fundamentally immoral. Instead of wielding political power against Time Warner, Mr. Bennett and Ms. Tucker brought moral authority to bear: They sharned Time Warner executives, both in private and in public....
<p>
This success should be a paradigm for culture warriors.... Culture cannot be dictated from Washington, it is a matter of millions of personal choices made by millions of people every day. Moral persuasion can affect those personal choices in a way that laws and regulations can't. Snoop Doggy Dogg may not be particularly open to suasion, but if the corporation that made millions off of him is able to rethink its place in the market, and maybe figure out how to make millions of a less noxious product, there is hope.<br>

<b>"Culture War Victory"<br>

Washington Times, August 14,1995</b>

<p>
<li>"It is significant that today nobody--nobody--is willing to defend the current welfare system. And for good reason; it is a complete wreck. After thirty years, we have finally reached a consensus that much of the anti-poverty strategy of the 60s arid 70s has failed--and failed horribly. Poverty today is more widespread, more deeply entrenched and more pathological than it was three decades, and $5 trillion, ago.... It is time to encourage poverty fighting-efforts that are both compassionate and effective, rather than maintaining a system that is neither."<br>

<H3>The Battle for School Choice in Milwaukee</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Milwaukee has long been the standardbearer for the school choice movement. In 1990, the nation's only government-funded school choice program was enacted in Milwaukee. And in early 1995, Governor Tommy Thompson submitted an expansion plan of the program, which allowed students to redeem vouchers at religious as well as non-religious schools. The plan was approved and passed by the legislature as part of the 1995-97 state budget bill. However, on August 25, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin issued an injunction barring the state from paying tuition for students attending private religious schools until the court rules on whether it is constitutional. Several hundred children had already begun classes as participants in the voucher program. As a result, Partners Advancing Values in Education (PAVE) set up an emergency fund to provide funds for children for the school year.
<p>
Empower America Co-director William J. Bennett traveled to Milwaukee to affirm his support for school choice, and for a program that allows parents to choose either religious or non-religious private schools for their children. Said Dr. Bennett, "This moment in Milwaukee is probably the breakthrough point. This is the beachhead." Bennett toured St. Matthew's, an elementary school participating in the choice program, and was a guest on Charles Sykes' radio program on WTMJ-AM (620). Bennett was joined by Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson and by another former education secretary. They then held a press conference praising the expanded program at Messmer High School, an independent Catholic school. Dr. Bennett summed up the objective of the school choice movement: "This is not an anti-public school effort. This is a pro-good school effort ... Good public schools have nothing to fear from school choice."

<H3>Empower America Sets Conservative Agenda</H3>
<P>
<I>Baltimore Conference Launches 104th Congress</I>
<P>
BALTIMORE, MD: In this city, an hour's drive north of Washington,
DC, three&#171;busy days of seminars, workshops, discussion sessions
(and a bit of speechmaking) in early December brought home the
latest example of how the political landscape of America has changed.
<P>
Previously, under the control of the Democrat House leadership,
only one institution, the Kennedy School of Government in Boston,
had run freshman orientation for incoming members of Congress.
This monopoly had lasted for over
 twenty years. New members would 
have to travel to Massachusetts to actually I 
participate, and topics were often narrow 
and unambitious.
<P>
But in 1994, the Boston organization had to cancel its program
due to lack of interest, since the vast majority of newly-elected 
House freshmen chose to attend an orientation program organized
by Empower America and the Heritage Foundation.
<P>
Held December 811 at the Radisson Plaza in Baltimore, MD, the
conference drew 
a majority of the Republican members- elect, as well as a couple
of their Democrat counterparts. This high energy gathering demonstrated
that the incoming Republican majority plans to hit the ground
running to deliver the real change America endorsed on November
8.
<P>
The days were packed with programs and presentations designed
to supplement incoming members' knowledge of issues they'll face
in the 104th Congress, as well as highlighting dramatic, conservative
alternatives to 30 years of Great Society philosophy. Nearly 50
conservative experts in all major issues of domestic and foreign
policy attended.
<P>
New members took the lead in debating innovative alternatives
on issues such as welfare reform, crime, defense and farm policy.
They also worked to plan legislative strategy and tactics on reforming
Congress, strengthening America's health care system, tackling
the over regulation that the Federal government imposes on states
and individuals, and limiting congressional terms.
<P>
They discussed how to draw on the new conservative majority in
the country to construct coalitions necessary to effect change
in Washington. And how to balance their professional obligations
with the needs of their families, so that families will always
come first.
<P>
All five of Empower America's co-directors, Lamar Alexander, Bill
Bennett, Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber spoke at the
conference and participated in smallgroup meetings, sharing advice
and insights which they hoped would be valuable to the attendees,
both personally and professionally.
<P>
One of the orientation's highlights came at its conclusion, with
an address by radio/TV talkshow host Rush Limbaugh- whom many
of the freshman credit, in part, with their victory. According
to Bill Bennett, Limbaugh is &quot;a symbol of encouragement.
He's a pretty reasonable read on what a lot of America thinks.
Rush is a way conservatives know that they're not idiosyncratic.&quot;
To express their appreciation, the freshmen voted to make Limbaugh
an honorary member of their incoming class.
<P>
Limbaugh was quick to return the compliment. 
 &quot;I am in awe of you,&quot; Limbaugh told them, &quot;You took the risks.
You are the ones who engaged the opposition ... You actually went
out and did the work.

<P>
<H3>Grassroots, With Message of Change, Made Difference at Ballot Box</H3>
<P>


Political observers are calling what happened on November 8th
a &quot;tsunami.&quot;
<P>
In Japan, that' s the word for tidal wave. In America, that's
the term for the overwhelming victory conservatives gained at
the federal, state, and local level in 1994's midterm elections.
<P>
Beginning in January, Republicans will control both Houses of
Congress for the first time since 1954. In the U.S. Senate, the
margin will be 5347, a gain of nine seats. All 11 Senate freshmen
will be Republicans. In the U.S. House, Republicans picked up
52 seats, for a 230-204 edge, with one independent. Of the 86-member
freshman class, 73 are Republicans.
<P>
For the first time since 1970, Republicans also have the lion's
share of governors' mansions. They'll control 30 governorships,
in states with 70 percent of the U.S. population.
<P>
But the victories weren't just wide, they were deep. Republicans
now control both houses of 19 state legislatures, while Democrats
control 18.
<P>
In the South, for the first time since Reconstruction, a state
legislative body will be led lay Republicans. The South Carolina
House, which went Republican, hasn't had a GOP majority since
1886. Down the ballot, at all levels, candidates
supporting a powerful and vigorous conservative message won election.
<P>
Keeping this in mind, Empower America Codirector Jack Kemp observes,
&quot;The 1994 elections rivaled Ronald Reagan's 1980 victory
in its importance to the conservative movement.&quot;
<P>
What made the difference in the 1994 election was the dedicated
effort of grassroots activists, who constructed a network of information
and support that bypassed both the media and, in many cases, the
established political parties. Compared to previous midterm elections,
turnout was up. Polling data indicates that many of those who
voted intended to send a message for conservative change. This
turnout was the key difference in many close races - the defeat
of House Speaker Tom Foley, House Judiciary Committee chairman
Jack Brooks, and Senate Budget Committee Chairman (and
likely next Senate Democrat leader) Jim Sasser.
<P>
So dramatic was the mandate for change voiced in November that
no less than the <I>Washington Post's </I>David Broder, dean of
the Washington pundits, saw in the results the evidence for a
massive political realignment - a return to the political landscape
as it looked before the New Deal.
<P>
However, to make re-alignment a reality requires even more effort
in 1995 and 1996, to make sure the 104th Congress delivers on
the change its leaders promised. According to a recent Times-Mirror
poll, 52 percent of Americans approve of the GOP's plans for the
future. Reducing crime, reforming welfare, cutting the deficit,
cutting middle class taxes, and a balanced budget amendment are

<H3>A Letter from the President</H3>
<P>
<I>Dear Empower America Members: </I>
<P>
Our hard work during the last two years has definitely paid off!
Because of your dedication to ideals and policies that empower
individuals and families, our country has witnessed one of the
most historic elections of our time. As a result, we have elected
a new Congress committed to the empowerment agenda.
<P>
Through our candidate schools, issue briefs, radio actualities,
newspaper editorials and numerous other media opportunities, Empower
America has been pleased to play its role in the 1994 elections.
We look forward to the months and years ahead as a continuation
of our responsibility to help shape the conservative future of
America.
<P>
Therefore, this is not a time to rest. We must remain an active
voice in all the debates on policy that affect our daily lives.
This is an opportunity for us to propose progressive ideas for
the future of our country and our children. The days of the tax
and spend liberals controlling the agenda and our pocket books
are over!
<P>
It is because of concerned citizens like yourself, the ones that
only want a strong and stable country for our children, that this
Congress is like no other one before. It is
important that you remain in the fight. We will need you for every
battle that comes up on Capitol Hill. This new Congress must know
what the American people need and want from their government.
You are the only way they will know.
<P>
Thank you for your support of Empower America.
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>
<B>Bill Dal Col</B>
<P>
<I>President</I>

<H3>Kirkpatrick Unveils Foreign Policy Critique</H3>

<P>

WASHINGTON, D.C.: On the fifty-third anniversary of Pearl Harbor
Day, Dr. Jeane J. Kirkpatrick released a new Empower America publication
entitled <I>Security and Insecurity: A Critique of Clinton Policy
at MidTerm </I>at a crowded, well-attended press conference at
the Willard Hotel.
<P>
Dr. Kirkpatrick said that given the &quot;major events through
which we are living ... responses that would be required are much
stronger than have been given. And the leadership that is needed
is much stronger, more purposeful, serious leadership than has
been available. And the strength that is needed, both I think,
moral, political and strategic, of the United States is greater
than has been available.&quot;
<P>
In opening remarks, Empower America Chairman Malcolm S. Forbes,
Jr. said that &quot;We believe that the midpoint of this 
Administration - the
two year mark - is a good time to do a thorough examination
of its foreign and defense policies. A variety of experts were
brought together by Jeane to do this book.&quot;
<P>
But the volume is not just limited to criticism. In an article
entitled &quot;U.S. Security Policy for the Nineties&quot;, Dr.
Kirkpatrick outlines what Mr. Forbes described as &quot;Empower
America's foreign policy approach . . . pro-democracy, pro-growth,
pro-opportunity.&quot;
<P>
Calling Dr. Kirkpatrick &quot;perhaps the seminal thinker of America's
role in this emerging world,&quot; EA Codirector Jack Kemp said
that one of &quot;lessons of the 20th century is that weakness
is provocative,&quot; and while &quot;foreign policy, trade policy,
defense policy have been bipartisan in support .. . we at EA have
been quite moderate in our critique of the first two years of
the Clinton administration.&quot;
<P>
Twenty-one of the more than thirty experts who contributed essays
to <I>Security and Insecurity </I>attended the press conference.
The book offers a comprehensive analysis of the Clinton national
security record, including foreign, defense, intelligence, information,
international economic, regional and countryspecific analyses.
It is available by sending $3.00 to Empower America, 81776 I Street,
NW, Suite 890, Washington, DC 20006.

<H3>EA Ads Tout Flat Tax</H3>

<I>Radio and Television Campaign for Reform</I>
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC: Moving the empowerment agenda forward, Empower
America began airing a new radio ad the week of January 9th. The
60second spot advocates replacing the current variablerate tax
system with a flat tax.
<P>
The ad, the first in an advertising campaign supporting the flat
tax, will be heard on news and talk radio stations in Iowa, New
Hampshire and Arizona. Empower America Codirector Jack Kemp set
the stage for the flat tax with an advertisement, run last month,
calling for lower acrosstheboard taxes, cutting and indexing capital
gains taxes, and raising the personal exemption for all families.
This generated considerable support.
<P>
The ad's text is as follows:
<P>
<B>Announcer</B>
<P>
<I>
Two years ago, President Clinton raised
taxes by over 250 billion dollars.
Now Clinton says he wants to cut taxes by
just 60 billion dollars. It's not enough. 
Clinton's high taxes, big spending, and
soaring interest rates are a blueprint for 
recession. To get the economy going, we need 
a real tax cut. It' s called the flat tax - 
and it' s one low rate of 17 percent will 
really cut taxes, while needy and working 
families will pay even less. The flat tax will
eliminate taxes on interest, dividends, and 
capital gains - encouraging savings, invest-
ment, and new jobs. Tax cuts worked for 
President Kennedy; they worked for President 
Reagan. What' s more, Americans could file 
their income taxes on a post card. 

To tell Bill Clinton you want a real tax cut, 
join the fight for the flat tax by calling 
Empower America at 1-800-332-2000.
</I>
<P>
Striking these same themes, Kemp along with Co-director Bill Bennett
delivered a one minute message on national CNN just prior to President
Clinton's January 24 State of the Union address.
<P>
The time, purchased by Empower America, criticized the Clinton
tax proposals and offered an economic vision for America's future,
renewing the call for a flat tax that will bring jobs and tax
relief for America's families.
<P>
The television spot, promoted by radio spots on January 23 and
24, reached a large and politically diverse audience. Empower
America hopes that such widespread exposure to these views will
encourage national discussion.
<P>
Congress is receptive to dramatically changing the tax system,
and both the House and Senate will be holding hearings during
the next several months to examine ways to reform the system,
simplify tax collection, and reduce tax rates. Empower America
will work energetically over the next several months to keep its
members informed and involved, to organize grassroots efforts
supporting the flat tax, and to let Congress know that Americans
support a flat tax.
<P>

<H3>Empower America Interview: Michael Harrison</H3>

<P>
<I>Michael Harrison is the editor and publisher of </I><B>TALKERS
Magazine, </B><I>the major trade publication in the talk radio
industry. As such, he presides over the nation's largest data
base about the medium in addition to researching the opinions
expressed by hosts and callers. In this role, Mr. Harrison has
emerged as the leading spokesman for talk radio and what he refers
to as the &quot;new media&quot; and is one of the most sought
after analysts of American public opinion. Mr. Harrison is a regular
guest on radio talk shows and network television in addition to
being constantly quoted in most of the nation's major news publications.
He also hosts </I><B>TALKERS Magazine's </B><I>nationally syndicated
weekly program, &quot;The Talk Radio Countdown Show,&quot; which
overviews the hottest topics of theweek on talk radio, and continues
to guesthost local talk shows whenever he has the time regularly
filling in on WRC Radio during his many visits to the nation's
capital</I>
<P>
<I>EMPOWER AMERICA:</I> What impact did talk radio have on the 1994 elections?
<P>
<I>MICHAEL HARRISON: </I>First of all, talk radio proved to be
an accurate bellwether of American public opinion foretelling
the results of the election as early as two years ago. As a spokesman
for the field, I've had to defend the accuracy of talk radio to
the mainstream press more than a hundred times during the past
couple of years. TV news and many of the daily papers would downplay
the sentiment expressed by both hosts and callers on talk radio
as representing a &quot;small but vocal&quot; segment of the population
of reflecting a &quot;conservative Republican bias.&quot; Or worse,
they denigrated it as playing to a &quot;radical fringe.&quot;
The point is, talk radio did not cause the election to happen
the way it did. Talk radio forecasted it. As such, talk radio
has shown itself to be more in touch with the American people
than any other of today's mass media. In doing so, it provided
the people of this nation with the opportunity to discuss the
real issues of the day and exchange populist views. It is only
in that context that talk radio impacted the election. It provided
a vehicle for public opinion which
already existed to play itself out and reach some sort of collective
resolution.
<P>
<I>EA:</I> Will there be an increase in &quot;liberal&quot; talk
radio as a result of the 1994 election?
<P>
<I>MH:</I> Only if the newly elected politicians who call themselves
&quot;conservatives&quot; are ineffective, corrupt, arrogant and
elitist and besmirch the concept of popular conservatism. You
see, I don't believe that the ever-growing talk radio audience
is inherently Democrat or Republican in a partisan sense. Nor
are they unilaterally liberal or conservative. I think the average
thinking American here at the end of the Twentieth Century is
more prone to be an active Independent. At the moment, the conservatives
are more accurately addressing these concerns than the liberals.
But actions speak louder than words and more and more, the American
public is able to perceive the difference between talk and deed.
The biggest mistake politicians on both sides of the fence can
make is to think that the electorate is primarily composed of
party faithful. In the old days the term &quot;independent&quot;
was usually associated with &quot;apathetic.&quot; Today, however,
the independent voter is more likely the most active. That's today's
gigantic difference.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>What will the state of the industry be two years from
now, during the 1996 elections? What role will talk radio have
on the next election cycle?
<P>
<I>MH:</I> Talk radio will set the pace for the entire mass media. Now
that the mainstream media, particularly the press, have caught
wind of talk radio's position in the political scheme of things,
its proclivity to play the leader, will insure this prediction
coming true. The 1996 election will be played out on talk radio
and that ensuing scenario will be amplified and cemented in the
mainstream media. As far as the details of the next election are
concerned, I'm not an astrologer&#151;but I can give you this
insight, this hint: Talk radio does not choose its good guys and
bad guys simply based on party line or academic political ideology.
It bases these things on personality, character and the handling
of &quot;people&quot; concerns on an issue to issue basis. Look
what's going on in Massachusetts. The same hosts who beat the
daylights out of Dukakis for his ultraliberalism have just turned
like vicious dogs on the conservative William Weld for supporting
a 55 percent legislative pay raise on the heels of the election.
<P>
EA: Do you consider talk radio to have more entertainment, news
or education value?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>Ah, now that's the question talk radio programmers
are constantly wrestling with. Finding the perfect balance between
information and entertainment. This is not a media characteristic
peculiar to talk radio. Television news, newspapers, even Presidential
campaigns are preoccupied with capturing attention and developing
interest. Or to put it another way, to avoid being boring at all
costs&#151;even if it means leaving out important information
or glossing over serious, complex issues. Fortunately, we live
at a time when a growing portion of the American public finds
news and public affairs entertaining. The problem is when the
public expects and demands that it be entertaining first and foremost.
Remember during the Persian Gulf War when people talked about
going home at night to &quot;watch&quot; the war on CNN and began
to complain when it started to get &quot;boring?&quot; At least
half the audience viewed it as just another miniseries. So yes,
talk radio is entertainment. . . but so is Connie Chung. And so
are political debates. And so are political conventions. That's
why the networks no longer cover then gavel to gavel. Shakespeare
understood this hundreds of years ago.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>What is the proper role for talk radio in the political
debate?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>To create an environment that will draw a large audience
while maintaining a fair and even playing field. That's the ideal.
Uq,fortunately, the fair and even playing field often suffers
in the process of drawing the large audience. I only hope that
the bean counters who ultimately control talk radio&#151; or at
least will gain more control over the medium as it continues to
show itself to be a potential moneymaker&#151;don't overresearch
and package it to the point that it loses the rough edges and
accessibility to the people that I believe is at the core of its
impact.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>What new technologies can we expect from talk radio,
such as interaction with online computer services, etc.?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>Fifty years from now, today's talk radio will be looked
back upon as the
<P>
primitive public address system of the emerging 21st century electric
age democracy. As far as the present is concerned, talk radio
makes maximum effective use of existing technologies to make twoway
mass communications fantastically accessible and immediate&#151;
telephony, satellites, and digital transmission technology make
talk radio amazingly flexible and ubiquitous. The next step is
universal interaction with online computer services. <I>TALKERS
Magazine is </I>about to go online with CompuServe. The relationship
between talk radio and online services, the Internet, will be
close.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>Why has there been a recent resurgence in interest
in talk radio, and when did it begin to come into its own?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>Talk radio's been around for ages, but I trace the
real beginning of the modern era of talk radio to the removal
of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987 which opened
<P>
the door up to stations feeling free to tackle controversial issues.
Prior to that, the Fairness Doctrine actually had a chilling effect
on the discussion of public policy in the electric media. But
that's just one factor. In the late eighties, you had all these
AM stations being beaten up by FM music stations so they turned
to talk which sounds just fine on AM. Also, talk radio addressed
issues and reflected public opinion in a way that was largely
ignored by the mainstream press and media, so it filled a massive
void and garnered tremendous public support. Other factors that
contributed to talk radio's growth have been the changing demographics
of the nation&#151;boomers are extremely interested in public
policy&#151;as well as the fact that talk radio is great company.
People are lonely and talk radio provides a sense of community
that's missing in the modern world. Then there's the advertising
aspect of talk radio. It's a powerful advertising medium <B>because
</B>it has such an active and interested audience.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>Are stations moving away from locally produced talk
shows to carry more nationally syndicated shows, or are they still
cultivating local talent?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>Both! The average talk station in America is a blend
of the two - and both have proven to be a vital part of the
programming success of talk radio. The networks are providing
local stations with the chance to get into the talk radio business
and provide a solid, national product. That, in turn, creates
the need to supplement the network stuff with a local perspective.
For every job that Rush Limbaugh has taken away, he's created
the need for two.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>Do you see any future Rush Limbaughs on the horizon?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>Yes and no. Yes, I do see tons of new and exciting
talents up and coming in talk radio and I find that very exciting.
But no, I don't think we'll see another &quot;Rush Limbaugh,&quot;
per se. He's one of a kind phenomenon that is actually historical.
If talk radio were rock and roll, then Rush Limbaugh is Elvis
Presley. Of course, as we know, there was only one king of rock
and roll - but that didn't stop him from self-destructing, and
the medium was certainly able to thrive without him.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>How can the public and grassroots organizations best
utilize the power of talk radio?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>The key is to tap into its accessibility without abusing
it. The public, of course can always listen. Callers should avoid
overdoing it as &quot;regular&quot; callers. No one wants to hear
the same person whining on and on using talk radio as a personal
soap box. Organizations should maintain the same rule. Be in touch
with the stations and hosts. Give them information that they want
and believe the public will be interested in. Do not flood them
with self-serving hype and minutia. Remember, talk radio is a business.
Put yourself in its shoes and it'll respond much more readily.

VOL. 3 NO. 1 
<P>
<H3>The Republican Agenda in the 104th Congress</H3>

<P>
<I>Now in control of both the House and Senate for the first time
in four decades, Republicans face the challenge of legislative
leadership. Fortunately, preparation for this welcome challenge
began during the campaign season when Republicans gathered on
the steps of the Capitol to sign their </I>Contract With America.
<I>This contract lays out the blueprint for thefirst 100 days
of the 104th Congress. The ten points of the </I>Contract <I>are
as follows.</I>
<P>
<B>Fiscal Responsibility Act</B>
<P>
Under this Act, Congress will vote on a balanced budget amendment
and the line item veto. The aim of this legislation is to force
Congress to live within its means and to restore financial accountability
to the budget.
<P>
<B>Taking Back Our Streets Act</B>
<P>
This provision takes a get tough approach to crime fighting;
calling for stiffer punishment, placing more police on the street,
and implementing truthinsentencing legislation that requires convicted
criminals to serve their full sentences.
<P>
<B>Personal Responsibility Act (Welfare Reform)</B>
<P>
The focus of this Act is twofold: (1) to encourage people to work,
and (2) to discourage people from having children out of wedlock.
Most Americans agree that the welfare system is seriously flawed
and must be dramatically reformed. Dramatic reform is what the
Republican leadership hopes to achieve through this legislation.
<P>
<B>Family Reinforcement Act of 1995</B>
<P>
The federal government has, in the past two decades, intruded
upon the parent/child relationship. This provision seeks to reverse
that trend by placing control of a child back where it belongs - with
the parents. The Act would also strengthen penalties for child
pornographers, and create tax breaks for those who adopt a child.
<P>
<B>The American Dream Restoration Act</B>
<P>
This Act provides a tax credit for families, reforms the &quot;marriage
penalty,&quot; and improves the tax treatment of IRAs. Beginning
in 1996, the bill would allow a $500 per child tax credit for
families with annual incomes up to $200,000. In addition, Americans
would be allowed to contribute up to $2,000 a year into an American
Dream Savings Account (ADSA).
<P>
<B>The National Security Restoration Act</B>
<P>
This provision would reform the Department of Defense by placing
an emphasis on a strong national defense through ensured funding.
It would also ensure that U.S. troops are only deployed to support
missions in the U.S.'s national security interests.
<P>
<B>Senior Citizens' Equity Act</B>
<P>
The senior citizens' earning limit would be raised. This would
end age discrimination for those who choose to work after a certain
age.
<P>
<B>The Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act</B>
<P>
Rolling back government regulation has long been a priority for
Republicans; this Act would slash many burdensome regulations
that strangle small businesses, thus making it easier for investment
and job creation.
<P>
<B>The Common Sense Legal Reforms Act</B>
<P>
This Act will curb excessive lawsuits and limit abuses of the
legal system by overzealous lawyers. This type of reform is crucial
to American competitiveness.
<P>
<B>Citizen Legislature Act</B>
<P>
This Act would force a vote on the issue of term limits for Senators
and House members. This would help put an end to career politicians
and give the American people a citizen legislature.
<P>
<I>These 10 points represent the backbone of the legislative agenda
for the 104th Congress. Empower America will work closely with
Congressional leaders to go forward with these initiatives endorsed
by the American peoples ' vote in November. Empower America 's
Codirector William J. Bennett is fond of telling audiences that
this is a </I>Contract With America, <I>it is not a handshake
with America. It is in this spirit that Empower America will continue
the fight for true reform in the days to come. </I>

<DD>&quot;Bennett, the former education secretary who took to the
campaign trail this year for an array of candidates, said he was
utterly clear on the meaning of this election. 'It was about limited
government, about the end of the nanny state,' he says. It was
about beginning to reverse 'the discharge of responsibilities
from families and communities and local government onto the federal
government,' and reviving personal responsibility.&quot;

&quot;As opposed to Bill Clinton's effort to 'reinvent government,'
Alexander wants to dismantle it. One problem lies in making sure
someone else&#151;individuals, community groups or local entities&#151;does
the work that federal agencies have been doing for decades.
Alexander's first effort to deal with these and other questions
will come at a &quot;Send Washington Home&quot; conference November

<H3>New York Gala Honors Innovative Governors</H3>

<I>Governors Tommy Thompson, Christine Todd Whitman and John Engler
accept Empower America 's first annual </I><B>Empowerment Awards.</B>
<P>
On November 17th, Empower America held its second annual New York
Gala Dinner aboard the historic USS Intrepid aircraft carrier.
The evening's dinner and discussion were particularly eventful
as Empower America honored Governor John Engler for his changes
in Michigan education policy, Governor Tommy Thompson for the
overhaul of Wisconsin's welfare system, and Governor Christine
Todd Whitman for her bold economic policies in New Jersey. These
governors were the recipients of Empower America's first annual
<I>Empowermerlt Awards&#151;</I>in recognition of their ingenious
and innovative policies benefitting the men and women, business
leaders, families, and children of their states.
<P>
The evening' s patriotic celebration was heightened with the presentation
of the colors by the USS Inchon Color Guard. Empower America Chairman
Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr. presided over the event and began the evening
with an introduction of New York Governorelect George Pataki.
The Empower America Board of Directors welcomed over 500 friends
and supporters as Lamar Alexander, William Bennett,
<P>

Jack Kemp and Jeane Kirkpatrick presented the awards to the Governors.
The energized crowd and impressive lineup of state and local leaders
set the tone for the debate which will resume in the new congress.
<P>
The discussion shed light on the emerging discussion surrounding
illconceived policies at both the national and state levels, in
addition to addressing the federal government's stream of unfunded
mandates. The progressive agendas of Governors Engler, Thompson
and Whitman will be on the leading edge of change -- to restructure
the relationship between the federal government and the states,
and comprehensively change the way that our elected leaders do
business.
<P>

<H3>Issue Conference Campaign Tackles Gold Standard</H3>
<P>


<I>Bretton Woods</I>
<P>
On September 8th, Empower America hosted a conference on monetary
policy which commemorated the 50th anniversary of the historic
Bretton Woods Conference. The anniversary conference, which took
place in Washington, DC, featured reputable experts in the field
of economics including Lawrence Kudlow, Arthur Laffer, Lawrence
Lindsey, and Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr., in addition to Empower America
Co-directors Jack Kemp and Vin Weber. 
<P>
Communications Campaign Proves Effective
<P>
Over the past couple of months, Empower America has been waging
an intensive television and radio advertising campaign. Issueoriented
ads have been placed throughout the country opposing bad legislation,
like the Clinton health care plan, and promoting good proposals,
like tax cuts and the A to Z spending cut plan.
<P>
These ads often put Empower America squarely in the middle of
major issue debates. For instance, Department of Health and Human
Services Secretary Donna Shalala publicly attacked an ad that
called President Clinton's welfare reform plan &quot;cynical and
deceptive.&quot; The resulting debate brought to light many of
the Clinton plan's flaws, helping to defeat it.
<P>
Empower America produced one of the most critical television ads
that ran during
the health care reform debate. The ad pulled no punches in asserting
that &quot;President Clinton wants to socialize our health care.&quot;
This ad, with an intensive buy, helped put Empower America on
the front lines of the battle that eventually saw the Clinton
health care plan soundly defeated.
<P>
&quot;Because Empower America is a non-profit non-partisan organization,
our ads can also be run by TV and radio stations as public service
announcements, which many do. Also, stations can hear each ad
through a special digital phone line established to transmit radio
actualities. By absorbing the production cost, Empower America
thus is able to support friendly and conservative TV and radio
stations throughout the country by producing professional issue-oriented
messages. &quot;

<H3>Lamar Alexander Joins Empower America</H3>
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC &#151;Lamar Alexander, former secretary of education
and governor of Tennessee, recently joined the leadership of Empower
America. He will serve as a codirector elong with Bill Bennett,
Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber.
<P>
Since leaving government, Mr. Alexander has remained active in
national politics. He launched a satellite TV network based in
Nashville, TN, which conducts a monthly public policy discussion
through nearly 3,000 town meetings across the country. Alexander's
satellite network will provide another vehicle for the organization
to advance its empowerment agenda among a broad coalition grassroots
activists.
<P>
&quot;Our neighborhood meetings and Empower America fit together
perfectly ' Mr. Alexander said. &quot;I'm delighted to be on the
same team as Bill, Jack, Jeane and Vin, who are constantly challenging
conservatives to say more clearly what we are for.&quot;
<P>
Lamar Alexander is also an advocate for congressional reform and
champions the idea of &quot;cut their pay and send them home.&quot;
His plan includes cutting a congressman's time in Washington and
pay in half.
<P>
Alexander explains, &quot;If members ate their breakfasts in hometown
diners instead of Capitol Hill restaurants such harebrained notions
as turning the health care system over to the government to run,
raising taxes to create jobs, 'reinventing
<P>
welfare' from Washington, DC for the 7th time, would never see
daylight.&quot;
<P>
The new codirector's colleagues, Bennett and Kemp, praised his
addition to the group.
<P>
&quot;I have always respected and admired Lamar's outspoken advocacy
of creative
<P>
solutions to our nation's problems:' Kemp said. I'm thrilled that
he's agreed to join our team and help advance the conservative
cause.&quot;
<P>
Bill Bennett added, &quot;I'm very glad to have Lamar join our
organization. His is another clear and experienced voice on the
cause of empowering Americans.&quot;

<P>

<H3>Making Ideas Matter in the Fall Elections</H3>
<P>
EmpowerAmerica plays key role in development of popular message
in the fall elections.
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC: As the fall elections draw near, political
experts across the country are predicting big gains for proponents
of the principles of empowerment. In the House of Representatives,
most experts predict a shift of twenty five or more seats into
the conservative ranks. In the Senate, gains of four to seven
seats are not only possible, but likely. The same is true at the
state and local level. Several statehouses and several state legislatures
may move from the domination of liberal control to majority empowerment oriented
control.
<P>
One of the reasons for this success is the ability of conservative
candidates to define a coherent message of limited government
distinguished from that of President Clinton and his liberal allies.
Empower America has played an important role in the development
of this agenda.
<P>
We recently completed a series of successful Candidate Schools,
in which candidates from across the country learned about effective
and viable messages of family and community empowerment over massive
governmental bureaucracy. Now, Empower America has turned its
efforts to helping primary winners develop that same message.
<P>
While not endorsing or supporting any particular candidate, Empower
America has been actively involved with candidates in advancing
the message of empowerment.
<P>
As Congress struggles through the final weeks of the current session,
it is becoming increasingly clear that President Clinton is going
to be a huge millstone around the necks of big-spending, big-government
congressional candidates across the county. This stands in stark
contrast with Empower America's message.
<P>
Candidate School attendees and winners from across the country
are succeeding on the Empower America message. In Rhode Island,
Dr. Kevin Vigilante is running for Congress in the first congressional
district. Faced with strong opposition from Patrick Kennedy, son
of Senator Edward Kennedy, he has overcome huge Kennedy advantages
in name identification and fundraising to be within points of
Kennedy in the polls. Dr. Vigilante is utilizing the facts, theories
and vision advocated by Empower America. Crime, welfare, education
and economic growth define his campaign.
<P>
In Tennessee, attorney and former actor Fred Thompson is running
for the Senate against Congressman Jim Cooper.
<P>
Principal sponsor of the &quot;Clintonlite&quot; health care plan,
Cooper entered the race as the heavy favorite. Thompson, however,
has closed the gap significantly by running a campaign based on the 
principles of empowerment. Advocating a strong welfare reform package as well
as crime and real health care reform, Thompson has made this race
&quot;too close to call&quot; as the days count down to November.
<P>
Empower America also has been briefing candidates who did not
attend the Candidate Schools. Through weekly faxes on issues to
all primary winners and other periodic &quot;urgent updates&quot;
on breaking issues, Empower America is ensuring that all candidates
have access to the powerful message of empowerment.
<P>
When the November elections have come and gone, America will have
taken a step closer to returning power to citizens and local governments
and a step away from the big government control of the last thirty
years. 
<P>

<H3>A Letter from the President</H3>
<P>
 
Dear Empower America Members:
<P>
These past few months have been very exciting at <B>Empower America</B>
 and we must thank you, our membership, for this. Your continual
interest and involvement in this organization makes it possible
for us to promote the empowerment agenda across the country and
play a leading role in the national debate.
<P>
We are pleased to welcome Lamar Alexander to our leadership as
a codirector. There is no doubt that his involvement with us will
bring vigorous new energy to the public policy debate.
<P>
Empower America has been actively involved in the fight against
the costly crime and health care bills using an aggressive television
and radio advertisement.campaign to deliver our message on
both. Our goal was to activate Americans to participate in the
political system by contacting their representative and senators
and persuading them to vote against these economically destructive
pieces of legislation.
<P>
As the debate over health care continues in the months ahead,
Empower America will lend its voice around the nation to promote
insurance availability, affordability and portability for everyone
without government mandates.
<P>
<B>Now, we are encouraging all of you </B>to become active
in the fall midterm elections. This is a cridcal time for all of
us. This election represents the opportunity to make changes that
will affect the policies governing all of our futures. This is
the time to elect individuals who support the advancement of freedom,
the promotion of
economic growth and the pursuit of solutions to cultural and social
problems.
<P>
The best way to do this is to vote! Research the candidates in
your state and district. Then cast your vote for those who will
support legislation that empowers people and not government bureacracies.
Let's elect individuals to office who represent the most important
special interest: the American people.
<P>
Once again, thank you very much for your support of Empower America.
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>
Bill Dal Col
<P>
President

<H3>Crime in America: A Nation Held Hostage</H3>

<P>
WASHINGTON, DC: Over the past three decades violent crime
has increased by more than 500 percent. America leads the industrialized
world in rates of murder, rape and violent crime. As these
disturbing numbers continue to grow, nearly three out of every
four convicted criminals remain on the street, and the American
public's faith in its government's ability to fulfill its first
priority, to protect its citizenry from enemies foreign and domestic,
steadily erodes. As a result, parents are afraid to let their
children freely roam the neighborhood with their friends; individuals
are afraid to walk the streets of many cities at night;
and law-abiding, hardworking citizens in the nation's inner cities
live with the constant fear of being the next victim of a random
act of violence while traveling to and from their home. In short,
the lawlessness of an incorrigible few has been allowed to alter
the lifestyles of law-abiding citizens throughout the nation. The
Democratic leadership, sensing the urgency of the problem, has
delivered a crime 
bill to the American people. This type of legislation will help,
right? Wrong.
<P>
The recently passed crime bill is being hailed by supporters as
a tough assault on crime, but the specifics of the legislation
betray their rhetoric. Instead of focusing on the principles of
apprehending criminals quickly and sentencing them to terms which
they will actually serve, the bill continues the liberal tradition
of fighting crime by pouring taxpayer money into more untested
social programs aimed at the &quot;root causes&quot; of crime
(e.g. poverty, boredom, low self-esteem). For example, in the recent
legislation one can find:
<UL>
<LI>A provision to teach arts and crafts and establish dance programs;
<LI>A provision designed to increase self-esteem;
<LI>A provision establishing Midnight Sports Leagues.
</UL>
Regardless of what one might think of these programs, it is ludicrous
to present them as answers to the very serious crime problem facing
our nation. Such an ivory tower approach by the social scientists
on 
Capitol Hill who drew up these provisions is an insult to the
average hardworking American who is looking to Washington for
some real help. Most Americans who pay their taxes and fear for
their personal safety would probably not agree that funds, desperately
needed by local law enforcement agencies, would be more wisely
spent by social workers (in the name of crime fighting) to establish
late night basketball leagues.
<P>
Even though there are some meritorious provisions such as the
community policing and prison provisions, these are so encumbered
with restrictive federal language that their beneficial effects
will be severely hampered. Overall, the bill simply possesses
too many untried provisions, is too complex and is too cost-inefficient
to be accepted by an American public under siege and seeking real
reform.
<P>
What can we do? Plenty. First, we must reform our criminal justice
system.
Punishment needs to be swifter, more certain and longer than it
is now. We need to build more prisons, hire more police officers
and prosecutors, implement truth-in-sentencing provisions and overhaul
the current juvenile justice system.
<P>
Numerous police officers and prosecutors around the country tell
of the frustration they face when they see the same offenders
arrested time after time as our 
revolving door justice system places these lifetime criminals
back on the street. Stories of a brutal attack by a criminal on
early release from his or her sentence are becoming all too common.
The system must be altered and it must be soon. The problem is
that legislation such as the crime bill will spend billions of
taxpayer dollars and do little to slow down the revolving door.
<P>
America also needs more police officers and more prisons (the
diluted provisions of the current bill are not sufficient) to
attack the rise in crime seriously. Each time a federal judge
orders a state to release prisoners because of overcrowding, justice
takes another blow and society comes face to face with criminals
who have not served their full sentence all because the state
could not house the offenders. If society expects criminals to
take its laws seriously, then society must be willing and able
to enforce those laws and the punishment that is given to those
who break the law.
<P>
America also faces the problem of juvenile crime. As John DiIulio
of Princeton University has stated, &quot;America is facing a
ticking youth crime bomb. We have burgeoning numbers of young
people who, from all the statistical profiles, are at risk of
becoming violent and repeat criminals.&quot; Once again, this
is a problem we must address by altering the justice system's
handling of young offenders; again, the crime bill presented by
the Democratic leadership does not. There is hope; however, it
is just not in Washington, DC.
<P>
In Richmond, Virginia, Governor George Allen is attempting to
reform a parole system that allows criminals to avoid 
large portions of their sentences. His administration is looking
past the failures of the last three decades and saying it is time
we apply basic principles in our fight against crime. The main
principles are age-old: justice must be swift and it must be sure.
If it is not both of these, it will not be justice. Criminals
seem to understand this very well. It is unfortunate that
President Clinton and those members of Congress who voted for
the most recent crime bill do not.

<H3>How To Cut Government Spending...From A To Z</H3>

<P>
WASHINGTON, DC &#151; A bipartisan coalition of representatives
has presented Congress with the opportunity to restore some measure
of fiscal sanity to the federal budget. Their initiative, known
as the A to Z Spending Cuts Plan after its primary co-sponsors,
Democrat Rob Andrews of New Jersey and Republican Bill Zeliff
of New Hampshire, would hold every member of Congress accountable
for wasteful, inefficient, and unnecessary government spending.
<P>
Ever wonder why Congress can't just repeal the federal Helium
Act (started just after World War I to supply helium to our fleet
of military blimps) and save $1.7 billion? Or save $74 million
over five years by ending treeplanting grants offered by the Small
Business Administration? Or eliminate the $26 million the government
will spend this year to subsidize vacant public housing?
<P>
The answer is that these and hundreds of other federal boondoggles
costing billions are hidden deep inside huge pieces of legislation.
These omnibus spending bills are much more difficult to defeat
than individual examples of ridiculous government spending.
<P>
Liberals argue that the cuts outlined above won't make much of
a dent in the projected 1994 budget deficit of $220 billion. Maybe
so, but that's just a start. Citizens Against Government Waste,
a congressional watchdog organization has published a list of
556 &quot;Prime Cuts&quot; that would reduce federal spending
by nearly $187 billion this year and more than $1.3 trillion over
five years. People can argue the merits and demerits of these
and other spending programs. But supporters of these initiatives
don't want to encourage debate, they want to stifle it.
<P>
Until now, spending cuts which everyone purports to support, such
as the infamous Honey Bee and Mohair subsidies, have been allowed
to escape the budget ax. But for the first time, the A to Z plan
will force legislators to defend absurd special interest spending,
instead of denying responsibility .
<P>
The plan is simple and straightforward. Congress would set aside
an entire week &#151;56 hours of debate&#151;to consider nothing
but spending cuts. There would be no &quot;sacred cows.&quot;
Every government program would be on the table, vulnerable to
an amendment to reduce or eliminate its funding. Each individual
proposal would receive a recorded &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot;
vote. It would only take a simple majority of House members to
eliminate once and for all hundreds of federal programs that serve
no legitimate public purpose. Outdated and wasteful programs will
no longer survive by clinging onto popular proposals. Each member
will be held accountable for his or her vote with no excuses.
<P>
But in Washington, there has to be a catch for any proposal that
makes this much sense. Despite the fact that a strong, bipartisan
majority in the House of Representatives supports the A to Z plan,
Democratic leaders will not allow the proposal to come to the
floor for a vote. If all of the bill's 230 cosponsors would sign
what's known as a &quot;discharge petition,&quot; the legislation
could be discharged from the committee, where it is being bottled
up, and brought to the floor. As of press time, only 204 members
have signed the petition, 14 short of the necessary number.
<P>
Why would someone cosponsor the bill but then refuse to allow
a vote on the plan? Members of Congress sometimes use this tactic
to safely demonstrate support for a popular proposal knowing all
along that they will never have to cast a vote. By doing so, they
are blocking an important deficit reduction tool and contributing
to the deepening level of public cynicism toward Congress as an
institution.
<P>
Pressure is building on A to Z cosponsors who refuse to sign the
discharge petition. The bill continues to inch forward as more
and more legislators feel the heat of public scrutiny. More and
more Americans are demanding responsibility and accountability
in the federal budget process. Constituents want to know exactIy
where their representatives stand on helium reserves, mohair subsidies,
and treeplanting grants.
<P>
The fate of A to Z will help determine the legacy of the 103rd
Congress. That legacy can either be one of missed opportunities,
or one where Congress helped restore the public's faith in America's
elected of ficials. For now, the choice is up to Congress. In
November, the voters will decide.

<H3>Kirkpatrick Speaks at Foreign Policy Forum</H3>
<P>
<I>Calls For Missile Defense Program; says no justification for invasion
of Haiti</I>
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC &#151; Empower America Codirector Jeane Kirkpatrick
called on the Clinton administration to develop a defense for
America against ballistic missile attack. The former U.S. Ambassador
to the United Nations said, &quot;I believe that it is impossible
today for any president to fulfill his pledge to provide for the
defense of the United States without developing an effective missile
defense, period. That is just a fact. Like it; dislike it; it
is a fact of life in our times. And it is incredible to me that
the current Administration should continue its blindness in this
regard.&quot;
<P>
Ambassador Kirkpatrick pointed out that efforts to control
the proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons
of mass destruction and to stem the development of ballistic missiles
that can carry these weapons to targets long distances away have
reached a &quot;point of breakout&quot; that &quot;simply cannot
be tolerated.&quot; Ambassador Kirkpatrick said we need &quot;to
complete a missile defense program, a space-based missile defense
program which would enable us to defend ourselves and for
us to defend our friends and allies in the world against weapons
of mass destruction.&quot; She concluded by adding that &quot;the
problems are all of our making today in this regard. And this
president bears a heavy responsibility for his decisions in this
area.&quot;
<P>
Ambassador Kirkpatrick also stated that &quot;there should be
no use of force of Haiti.&quot; She
added that &quot;I do not believe that there is an
 American national interest that justifies an
 invasion of Haiti.&quot;
 Ambassador Kirkpatrick was one of
 four distinguished speakers at a recent
 Foreign Policy Forum held by the
 Republican National Committee at which
 she made these remarks. She was joined
by former Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney and former Secretaries
of State Henry Kissinger and James A. Baker III at the Forum to
address current international relations problems and to discuss
the Clinton administration's foreign policy.
<P>
Regarding the current government, Ambassador Kirkpatrick said
that she &quot;believes this administration underestimates the
danger in the world today, under
estimates the role of power and of force in the world, and, in
a curious kind of way, underestimates the force of American values
and institutions in the world.&quot; The countries of the former
Soviet Union are turning to America's values and institutions
as the model for their developing democratic and free market systems.
Therefore,
Ambassador Kirkpatrick said, &quot;It is as terrible a mistake
to underestimate the force of American values, as it is to underestimate
the value of American force.&quot;
<P>
Ambassador Kirkpatrick also evaluated various aspects of the Clinton
administration's foreign policy, pointing out that their actions
stemmed in part from conceptions about the limits of American
power and that &quot;multilateralism was to be at the center of
their foreign policy.&quot; Another key Clinton administration
belief is that America is, &quot;in some fundamental sense, in
a process of inexorable decline. Therefore, they think we should
not seek to act unilaterally in the world, but should act only
multilaterally. Moreover, they clearly believe that multilateral
action is more moral and more legitimate than unilateral action.&quot;
<P>
Further, the Clinton administra
tion has moved to &quot;dramatically
draw down American military
forces, to diminish American weapons and
weapons procurement, to downsize the mil
itary's industrial complex, to reduce
research and development and to concen
trate on producing enough weapons and
maintaining just enough military forces
only, as they always put it, to defend our
own country.&quot; The problem, Ambassador
Kirkpatrick asserted, is that &quot;we can only
do good in the world if we have the power
 to do good in the
 world.&quot; Under the
 Clinton administration, &quot;American
 Power is being 
neglected and dissipated.&quot;
<P>
Ambassador Kirkpatrick's address, 
&quot;U.S. Leadership: The Uses and Abuses of
Multilateralism,&quot; is available from
Empower America's <I>Speeches and 
Lectures</I> senies.

VOL. 2 NO. 3 FALL 1994
<P>

<H3>Empower America Interview: Public Opinion Pollsters 
Edward Goeas and John McLaughlin</H3>
<P>
<I>Mr. Edward Goeas is President and Chief Executive Officer of the
Tarrance Group, a survey and research company located in Alexandria,
Virginia. Mr. Goeas has served as the pollster for a number of
senate and congressional campaigns. He is also the pollster for</I>
U.S. News and World Report.
<P>
<I>Mr. John McLaughlin is a partner of Fabrizio, McLaughlin &amp; Associates,
a national public opinion polling and strategic consulting firm
in Alexandria, Virginia. Mr. McLaughlin has worked on hundreds
of campaigns, most recently as strategist and pollster on Governor
George Allen's campaign in Virginia.</I>
<P>
<B><I>Empower America:</I>What do you perceive to be the major issues
and concerns that will ultimately affect the 1994 elections? What
do you believe to be the &quot;mood&quot; of the nation and what
is on voters' minds?</B>
<P>
<I>Edward Goeas:</I> Issue concerns of the American public are being
voiced at two levels as we enter the final months of the 1994
election. One level is the actual problems voters are concerned
about, and on a second level they are judging incumbents and challengers
alike on their ability to address those concerns with common sense,
workable solutions.
<P>
As concerns over the economy (unemployment, taxes and the deficit)
have dissipatedeover the last year, the American electorate has
refocused on &quot;lifestyle&quot; issues. Crime has been the
major &quot;lifestyle&quot; concern that voters have focused on
for almost a year now, with nearly 41 percent of the electorate
mentioning crime as the number one problem facing the country.
Voter concern over health care, welfare reform, declining values
and education have rounded off these &quot;lifestyle&quot; concerns
now mentioned by six out of ten voters.
<P>
Candidates' ability to put forward credible solutions to these
problems has become much more difficult because of the skeptical
mood of the American elec
torate. After a brief period of optimism, voters have turned even
more cynical about government's ability to effectively address
the problems that they face on a daily basis. This cynicism has
increased as the voters have seen the solutions coming out of
Washington to be more government, more bureaucracy and the demand
for more of their hard earned money.
<P>
<I>John McLaughlin:</I> The Clinton administration appears to be better
able to run a campaign than a government. There is a large policy
gap between their rhetoric and the actual legislation they support.
This leads to three overall themes that appear to be undermining
Clinton's success among the voters. First, since Clinton's election,
American voters have repeatedly told us by a 2 to 1 margin that
they favor less government with fewer services as opposed to larger
government with more services. Clinton talks about less government,
but the facts reveal that all his policies point to larger government.
Americans are becoming more freedomoriented in a technological
age rather than the biggovernment orientation of the Industrial
Age.
<P>
Second, in June we asked voters if they were more concerned about
where a candidate stands on the issues, or about the candidate's
honesty. By a 7 to 3 ratio, the vast majority of Americans prefer
voting for someone who is honest. This is a direct
reflection upon President Clinton's character, or lack of it.
<P>
Finally, American voters are in the midst of a spending revolt.
In the late 1970's we saw America generate a tax revolt. From
our surveys of this year, the voters believe that the federal
government wastes $.42 cents out of every dollar it spends. By
margins of 7080 percent, they prefer cutting government spending
over any measures to raise taxes. Overall, it appears that the
1994 elections will be a state by state referendum for the Senate
and House on Bill Clinton.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I> In your opinion, is there an empowerment agenda that voters
want?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> Voters are looking for three things; accountability from their
elected officials, the opportunity for individuals and communities
to take more personal responsibility in both their daytoday lives
and their future, and the hope that a renewed emphasis on the
values of honesty, hard work, and a commitment to family and community
will once again put the American Dream within reach for middle
class Americans. The overwhelming majority of voters are certainly
not looking for government to do everything for them, nor are
they looking for an ineffectivc government that is always getting
in their way and hampers their ability to move forward. Proposals
like term limits and national initiatives and referenda receive
support from over 70 percent of the electorate because they are
searching for ways to have a greater say in their government.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> The voters are looking for new ideas. They want to turn away
from the old failed policies of the past and try creative solutions
to their current problems. Voters seem to be very receptive to
the idea of cutting taxes to create jobs. And on a local level,
voters who elected Republican mayors Tom Fetzer in Raleigh, and
Bret Schundler in Jersey City, are efljoying more police on their
streets while at the same time seeing their local taxes cut. Other
ideas to which voters are extremely receptive include: term
limits, workfare, common sense solutions to crime, school choice,
and tax credits for health care coverage. All these ideas would
give people greater control over their lives, and less control
to government. Finally, technology is driving voter beliefs that
they can have more direct democracy.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I>From your data, do you see a major shift on the horizon
in either the House of Representatives or the Senate for 1994?
Will 1994 be a vote on Bill Clinton's policies?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> As we enter the fall elections, it appears there will be a
substantial gain for Republic ns in both the House and the Senate.
In the Senate, it is likely that Republicans will pick up five
or six seats (with a chance of tak
ing control). In the House Republicans look to gain between
twenty-five to thirty seats (The last time GOP numbers in the House
were over 200 seats was 1954). The reality is that significant 
gains are likely for Republicans come November's elections.
 There is no question that significant gains will force Bill
Clinton to reevaluate the course of &quot;bigger government is
better&quot; that he has set for the country.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> Since last year, it has been apparent from Clinton's lack
of success on the stimulus package and the budget that the Republicans
would have large midterm gains in both the Senate and the House.
In the House, there is a minimum gain of about 15 seats, which
are mainly seats the Republicans should have gained in 1992 after
reapportionment. Add to that the usual historical antiincumbent
setbacks in Congressional elections to the party that controls
the White House, and it's likely that the Republicans will gain
30 seats. A similar antiClinton trend in the Senate would find
the interesting outcome of a 5050 tie, where Vice President Gore
might have to cast deciding votes in the Senate the last two years
of Clinton's term. On the gubernatorial level, Republicans may
have 
the potential for even greater gains. The growing trend for Republicans
with new ideas to attract Perot voters and disenchanted Democrats
is one that appears to be wellfounded for this November's election.
Only the Republicans themselves could lose this opportunity if
they compromise on principle.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I> From what you see, what are the bellwether races in the
country that will show whether a shift is underway?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> Without going into the numerous races that could be highlighted
as bellwether races, look for surprises in two areas&#151;the
South and West. The South is where resistance toward Bill Clinton's
overall philosophy of governance is
strongest. In the West, voters have increasingly felt that Clinton's
policies coming out of Washington are hostile to the West, and
they are looking to force Washington's policies to either help
or get out of the way.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> The bellwether races in the country certainly include high
profile Senate races, however, for the Republicans to make gains
in the Senate, they are going to have to win in states where Bill
Clinton may still be popular, and the trend towards Republicanism
is less strong. For example, in the Senate, wins by Republicans
that would point to a landslide would include Maine, Ohio, New
Jersey, California, Wisconsin and knocking off Ted Kennedy. A
more important trend regarding ideas could be the successful reelection
of innovative and pioneering governors that Republicans brought
to office four years ago. Voinovich of Ohio, Thompson of
Wisconsin, and Engler in Michigan have all experimented with ways
to keep taxes low, keep the size of government in check and find
creative solutions to problems. At the House level, there are
very interesting races which are absolute bellwethers of change
in the nation.
<P>
Mark Sharpe defeating Sam Gibbons, the House Ways and Means Chairman
of Florida, would be a strong sign that goodoldboy politics is
over with. Tom Davig' strong showing in Virginia's northern suburbs
would show that a successful progressive local executive would
be able to bring new solutions to Washington. And in Rhode Island,
Kevin Vigilante's victory over Patrick Kennedy would be another
setback for the failed liberal policies of the past. Across
the board, the message is change. Republican candidates are
running with the message of change, and all the previously 
mentioned contests will show whether that  message has a
very partisan edge, or whether American 
voters are still confused about who will give them the leadership
they need.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I>How much change do Americans really want in health care?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> After numerous delays and a year of debate, concern over government
control of health care, the threat of declining quality and increasing
costs, the possible loss of choice in the selection of their personal
doctor has left a bad taste in voters' mouths. Adding to these
negatives is the perception that, with the elections right around
the corner, it would be best to delay final action until the next
legislative year. In fact, the harder Congress pushes for a health
care bill this year, the more the voters are made to feel that
there is something to mistrust in Washington's motives. To many
Americans it looks like Congressional Democrats are rushing health
care reform only to improve their political health and not America's
health.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> Americans want their health care system improved, however,
they don't want the quality of their health care reduced. An early
warning to the Clinton administration came in June when Governor
Lawton Chiles called a special session precisely to enact the
Florida Health Security Act. Republican legislators stood firm
in the state Senate and the House, and nothing passed. There was
very little outcry; in fact, there was a sigh of relief among
Florida voters. Our polls showed that the vast majority had health
care and did not want the government to take it over. Furthermore,
twothirds of the voters were not willing to pay more than $100
a year in higher premiums or tax increases for universalhealth
care. As the details about Clinton's health care plan surfaced,
the voters became extremely concerned that these changes will
reduce the quality of care while increasing the cost. With the
prospect of larger government intervention in health care, the
potential decrease in quality, and an increase in taxes or premiums,
Americans agree this is not the change they need.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I> From your information, how do you perceive the American
people's response to the Clinton administration's welfare
proposals? Do they find them dramatic or cosmetic?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> The President has lost his &quot;New Democrat&quot; effort
to take over the welfare system as his own. Last year voters felt
that
 Bill Clinton and the Democrats in Congress would do a better job
reforming welfare over Republicans in Congress by nineteen percentage
points. After delayed introduction, and then introduction of a
plan that clearly missed the mark of voter concerns, Republicans
are, once again, seen as best able to address welfare reform.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> Americans responded very well to Clinton's rhetoric to end
welfare as we know it, but it's just rhetoric. Since his first
proposal, they have found out that among those people who currently
receive welfare, over 80 percent of them will continue to 'receive
it under Clinton's welfare proposal because he has exempted the
vast majority of them from work lre requirements. Also, 
the voters are underwhelmed by Clinton's promise of government
subsidized jobs for those who cannot find work in the private
sector. This sounds like merely a shell game rather than an actual
improvement in the system. This is why Clinton would increase
welfare spending by $9 billion dollars. In contrast, there is
a real vacuum in the media to present more popular alternatives.
The best piece of legislation, by Senator Lauch Faircloth and
Congressman Jim Talent, has gone unnoticed. Although endorsed
by Empower America, no one has yet drawn the direct contrast to
the Clinton bill. While Clinton would increase welfare spending
by $9 billion, FairclothTalent would cut it by $5060 billion dollars.
Clinton would only take 12 percent of the people off the rolls,
FairclothTalent would take 50 percent off the welfare rolls, and
FairclothTalent has more initiatives within it to keep families
together and end the destructive disincentives in the current
welfare system.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I> From your research, is America's
international standing an issue with the voters?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> Traditionally foreign affairs does not play a major role in
nonpresidential elections. In this election cycle, however, background
noise from Bill Clinton's continual mishandling, and sometimes
total incompetence, in the international arena, has made nervous
voters, even more skittish about where our nation is really heading.
It is puzzling to the voters how, in two short years, international
respect for the United States can so quickly plummet with misdirected
foreign policy. The one issue that will play a major part in this
year's election is Bill Clinton's policy to place U.S. troops
under United Nations command. American voters reject this Clinton
policy in overwhelming numbers and want it reversed.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> At present there is very little immediate concern among the
voters with foreign policy, defense, or international issues.
This is primarily because there is no perceived threat to the
voters' freedom and international security. Nevertheless, Clinton
scores very low ratings compared to the previous Republicans.
It is paramount in the voters' minds that Presidents Reagan and
Bush collapsed the &quot;Evil Empire&quot; while Bill Clinton
withdrew in the face of embarrassing opposition from a warlord
in Mogadishu and a band of thugs in Haiti. If there is an intemational
crisis where the United States cannot succeed to preserve this
feeling of security among our voters, Bill Clinton would suffer
drastically in 1996. The last election was an aberration, in that
it was the first election since 1932 where the economy was the
dominant issue. Every other presidential election in between had
an international issue as the dominant or leading factor in deciding
who would win.
<P>
For Clinton, the true wildcard would be a foreign policy setback.
Just like the Panama Canal became a symbol of weak leadership
under Jimmy Carter, Clinton's legislation to force the military
to accept homosexuals, illustrated from the start that he was
more interested in social engineering than.in protecting national
security. The subsequent defense cuts have actually provided reasonable
grounds for voters to believe any foreign policy setbacks are
the direct result of Clinton's policies.

<H3>THE SATELLITE MEDIA TOUR: Empower America's venture into communications
technology</H3>
<P
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC&#151;Reaching the public through earned media
opportunities poses a challenging task for any grassroots organization.
There are many methods for getting the message out, ranging from
the conventional news release, a static relic of oldstyle politics,
to building a new traditionl television or radio network, a costly
and cumbersome undertaking which ultimately reaches a minimal
audience.
<P>
Is there a better way?
<P>
New technology and the '90s information explosion have opened
the door to cheaper, more efficient, and more targeted means to
raise an organization's name and mission profile through the media.
<P>
One such method is the satellite media tour, which Empower America
has utilized with remarkable results.
<P>
Research shows that Americans are more likely to watch their local
news than network news. That means, in order to shape the debate
on current issues, it becomes critical to gain access to local
news broadcasts.
<P>
Using only a studio and uplinks to satellites, Empower America's
opinion 
makers can talk directly with your local TV news anchors and reporters,
free of the &quot;insidethebeltway&quot; news filter.
<P>
Empower America has conducted four satellite media tours. In September
1993, Bill Bennett discussed the results of the American Legislative
Exchange Council and Empower America Report Card on American Education
with local news stations across the country. Through the use of
fiber optics, Empower America chairman Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr.,
and other Empower America leaders, conducted a remote satellite
media tour in December 1993, live from Empower America's national
summit on the Clinton economic record. On June 6, 1994, Jack Kemp
and Jeane Kirkpatrick reflected on the 50 years since DDay during
a one and onehalf hour satellite tour for local TV stations doing
original reporting marking the 50th anniversary of that historic
day. And on August 11, 1994, Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr. conducted
a tour on health care reform plans and the debate in Congress.
<P>
Satellite media tours have enabled 
Empower America's leaders to talk with 27 TV stations, in roughly
ten minute increments each, for live broadcast or livetotape for
later use.
<P>
And the cost? The D-Day anniversary satellite tour tells all. On
June 6, 1994, Empower America reached 2 million actual viewers
at a cost of onefifth of a penny 
per viewer.
<P>
Empower America used satellite communications to make available
its 60-second TV ad on the Clinton health care plan to 1,800 television
stations and cable carriers across the country, for their use
in original news coverage or as a public service announcement.
In this case, satellite technology enabled Empower America to
greatly expand coverage for an alreadyproduced product, at modest
additional cost.
<P>
Satellite communications technology is costeffective and highly
efficient for grassroots organizations to harness the same power
as tbe major television networks.
<P>
Empower America is helping lead the conservative movement through
this exciting information revolution.

<P>
...What's going on in electronics with this exponential upsurge
is not comrnodity competitioh, it's dynamic competition. It's
creative destruction. And what is optimal now in technological
competition, technology competition focuses on innovation, and
innovation is the pursuit of the temporary positions of monopoly&#151;that's
what innovation is. And innovation is an advance that nobody else
has for a while. It's a monopoly...That's what motivates high
levels of investment and risktaking in technology advance. But
if you begin a race by saying nobody can win, and nobody can make

...How did we turbocharge Michigan's economy? By cutting taxes,
cutting red tape and holding the line on government spend
ing. We made tough decisions, built partnerships, and we worked
together. Just as Michigan companies are reengineering the way
they do business, we are reinventing state government&#151;from
top to bottom...
<P>
<B>&quot;Capitalism and Democracy
American Style: Can They Co-Exist?&quot;
<I>
By Theodore J. Forstmann,
Founding Chairman, Empower America Grants Political Conference</I></B>
<P>
..No political freedom, their words echo down to us, is secure
where the right to property, the fruit of one's own intellectual
or physical labor, is not strong. Government's job, our Founders
all believed, was basically to create a stable environment in
which free people could operate; to provide the permanent political
conditions in which economic changes would inevitably occur. This
was all basic noncontroversial stuff. And so, for example, in
Wilson's day, Americans paid no more than 10 percent of their
earnings to all levels of govemment. When the income tax was first
proposed in l909, one senator rose to suggest a constitutional
limit of ten percent. And it's staggering to reflect how this
suggestion was greeted. After further heated debate, the idea
was rejected on the 
grounds that if a ten percent maximum were set, the income tax
might inevitably rise to that ominous level...
<P>
<B>&quot;The Real War On Crime: 
States On The Front Lines&quot;
<I>
By George AUen, Governor of Virginia
Addressing The Governor's Forum</I></B>
<P>
...The surge in violent crime is more than a &quot;thief in the
night&quot; stealing some one's belongings. It is stealing something
much more precious: our freedom. It is denying our citizens their
unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;
their right to work, live and raise a family without being terrorized
and victimized by violent criminals and lawlessness...
<P>
...There is only one way to stop it [crime], and that is to take
the people who are committing the violence&#151;that small percentage
of criminals who commit the vast majority of crime&#151;and get
them out of the free society that they have declared war on. Because
one thing is certain: The one place a violent career criminal
won't harm more innocent people is in prison...
<P>
..But the last thing we need from Congress is more expensive social
spending designed to fight crime. If social welfare spending were
the answer to crime, the street corners of America would be far
and away the safest in the world. This approach has failed us
for the past 30 years, and will continue to fail. We in the states
need flexibility, we need to cover the costs of prison construction,
and we need the freedom to combat violent crime with the commonsense
methods our citizens demand.

VOL. 2 NO. 3 FALL 1994
<P>

<H3>Empower America Draws the Line on Health Care</H3>
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC&#151; Empower America's goal in the health care
debate has been to defeat any health care reform plan that includes
individual or employer mandates, price caps or controls, standard
benefit packages, more government interference, or higher taxes.
<P>
Empower America advocates more sensible, targeted health care
reform and is promoting marketoriented reforms that include tax
breaks for individuals and the selfemployed; making insurance
affordable, accessible, and portable; instituting taxfree Medical
Savings Accounts; medical malpractice reform; and voluntary purchasing
pools.
<P>
Empower America has been advancing its health care goals on a
variety of fronts, including an aggressive advertising campaign,
an effort to mobilize members and numerous television and radio
appearances.
<P>
The advertising campaign consists of a widely shown television
commercial and a series of more targeted radio commercials. Using
an electrocardiogram on a black screen with audio of a normal
heartbeat, the television ad
states that President Clinton's plan would &quot;socialize our
health care&quot; system. The ad notes that small businesses will
be called upon to pay the bill for what amounts to &quot;the largest
government bureaucracy in history.&quot; As the text and the narrative
continue, the EKG and heartbeat steadily increase in speed and
severity, culminating in a flatline across the bottom of the screen
and a terminated heartbeat.
<P>
The impact of Empower America's television ad is best demonstrated
by the outcry from the White House and the Democratic party. The
administration and the Democratic National Committee have made
the following critical comments about Empower America's television
ad on health care.
<UL>
<LI>On May 21, White House advisor George Stephanopoulos appeared
on 
CNN's &quot;Capital Gang.&quot; A clip of Empower America's ad
was shown during this particular show. Stephanopoulos commented
that the ad was a &quot;scare tactic&quot; and that &quot;people
aren't going to buy it.&quot;
<LI>Democratic Media Consultant Mandy Grunwald called Empower
America's radio ads on health care &quot;partisan politics&quot;
in the Wall Street Journal on June 30. She went on to assert that
Empower America and The American Cause &quot;believe in doing
whatever they can to damage the president.&quot;
<LI>On a PBS panel discussion on July 18 addressing health
care advertising, Democratic National Committee
Communications Director Ed Lazarus called the Empower America
television ad the most irresponsible and offensive ad of the entire
health care debate. He characterized the ad as misleading and
called the use of the word &quot;socialize&quot; a scare tactic.
Lazarus went on to criticize Empower America for the negative
tone and the absence of an alternative solution to the health
care problem in the ad. At the same event, AARP Policy Director
John Rother and Health Care Reform Project's Bob Chlopak agreed
with Lazarus' assessment of Empower America's ad.
<LI>Also on July 18, Vin Weber appeared on PBS's &quot;MacNeil/Lehrer
News Hour&quot; along with the DNC's Ed Lazarus, the RNC's Chuck
Grecner,
 and Bob Chlopak of the Health Care Reform Project (a group closely
tied with and partially funded by the DNC) to discuss health care
advertising. Chlopak said the television ad was &quot;aimed at
inflaming public opinion...There are no facts, no documentation
in the ad.&quot;
<P>
In addition to the television ad, Empower America has run a series
of radio ads on health care reform. An ad advocating a delay on
health care legislation until after the November election aired
nationwide and two other ads, which quoted prominent Democrat
senators, played in targeted markets. One ad quoted Senator Jay
Rockefeller saying, &quot;We're going to push through health
care reform regardless of the views of the American people,&quot;
and the other quoted Senator Ted Kennedy speaking of health
care saying, &quot;We l want people to understand very quickly
what they are entitled to and what they're not entitled to.&quot;
<P>
Empower America began its first targeted  state ad campaign
in Nevada recently. Nevada was chosen because a 
majority of its Congressional delegation has expressed support
for the Clinton health care proposal. The television and radio
ads created a great deal of media attention in Nevada and nationwide.
The ads generated a significant grassroots campaign against the
health care position of Nevada ' s more liberal members of Congress.
Massachusetts soon followed and other states will be targeted
as the debate continues.
<P>
Empower America's ads have also been featured in news stories
by ABC News, CBS News, CNN's &quot;Inside Politics&quot; and &quot;Capital
Gang,&quot; PBS's &quot;MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour,&quot; <I>The Wall
Street Journal</I>, Associated Press, and dozens of other media outlets.

<H3>EMPOWER AMERICA IN THE NEWS</H3>
<P>
<I>In addition to coverage in the national media, Empower America
also generates substantial coverage in the local and regional
press. Here is a snapshot of recent news stories that discuss
Empower America:</I>
<P>
<DL>
<DT>&quot;Empower America, the conservative coalition founded by
Jack Kemp, Bill Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber, has
hit the airwaves with their own ads, which warn that the
Clintons' plan would 'socialize our health care.' These ads reflect
the growlng opposition to anything that smacks of another entitlement
program. That is the last thing that our fragile economy and debt-ridden
government needs.&quot;
<DD><B><I>The Atlanta Journal and Constitution, </I>May 26, 1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;Empower America, a conservative political organization,
urged members of Congress to postpone final passage of any health
reforms until after the November elections. Its leaders, including
William Bennett, Jack Kemp and Vin Weber, attacked the 'ttzggered'
requirement that employers pay for health insurance as 'merely
a rest stop on the road to socialized medicine.&quot;' 
<DD><B><I>The Ketchikan Daily News,</I>Ketchikan, AK, June 14, 1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;EMPOWER AMERICA CHOOSES NEVADA: Empower America (EA)
launched a TV and radio ad campaign in NV to oppose Clinton's
[health wcare] plan. The 60sec. ads are airing in Las Vegas and
Reno. 'Using an electrocardiogram on a black screen with audio
of a normal heartbeat,' the TV ad maintains Clinton's plan would
'socialize' the system. The radio ad 'urges Congress to postpone
health care legislation until next year.&quot;'

<DD><B><I>The Hotline; </I>American Political Network, July 13,
1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;Empower America criticized Mr. Clinton's plan as socialized
medicine and urged that the health care debate be delayed until
next year after the November election when Republicans stand a
good chance of making significant gains.&quot;

<DD><B><I>The New York Times, </I>July 12,1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;[William 1.] Bennett said that he prefers a [welfare] policy
that cuts off benefits for any illegitimate child born after a
certain date... 'If they know they will not get anything from
the government, people will have to change their behavior. The
real message is you should not have children...unless you are
able to support them.&quot;'

<DD><B><I>The Courier-Journal, </I>Louisville, KY, June 19, 1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;'This is classic Clinton [on welfare reform], except to
the nth degree: Overpromise, underdeliver, and then try to fudge
the difference, 'said William Bennett, former education secretary
and drug czar in Republican administrations who now heads an advocacy
group called Empower America. 'What we've got here is marginal
tinkering which will cost more money.&quot;'

<DD><B><I>Newsday,</I> New York, NY, June 15,1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;A leading spokesman for conservative ideas, Bennett thinks
the nation can still recover its triedandtrue social standards.
'This is America,' [William J.] Bennett says. 'You know the American
capacity for selfrenewal. Look at what we have overcome in 200
years: England, King George, slavery, the Great Depression, fascism,
communism. This country has a tremendous record of going up against
very tough things and prevailing. But this one's a little different
because it's internal. But you never count this country out.&quot;'
<DD><B><I>The Dispatch, </I>Cookeville, TN, April 24,1994</I>
<DT>Jack Kemp, Codirector of the think tank called Empower America,
and a hope for imbuing capitalism with compassion, reminds again
how the most vulnerable among us were hurt by a welfare system
that sent a destructive message that was indifferent to a moral
life. 'It is an exarnple of how the capital of the human spirit
can be squandered in the course of a few generations,' he said
in a recent call for cultural and spiritual renaissance.&quot;

<H3>Empower America Continues the Fight for Real Welfare Reform</H3>
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC&#151;At present, those pushing for welfare reform
in Washington must await the outcome of the health care debate,
and may have to wait until the next Congress to see any legislation
actually reach the House and Senate floors. Even so, the lines
of disagreement have been drawn during the 103rd Congress. The
benchmark for the debate was set by President Clinton during the
1992 campaign when he promised to &quot;end welfare as we know
it.&quot; Unfortunately, like many of his promises, this bold
statement has not been supported by any meaningful legislative
language from the White House.
<P>
Eighteen months into his administration, President Clinton introduced
his long awaited welfare reform plan. After capitu l lating to
the liberal special interests in the House of Representatives
(specifically the Congressional Black Caucus), Clinton unveiled
a plan draped in conservative rhetoric, but founded upon the proposition
that risking a rift between the White House and the liberal wing
in Congress would be too high of a price to pay in order to help
repair the societal damage being inflicted by the present welfare
system. The result of this capitulation is legislation that proposes
mere tinkering with the present system instead of true reform.
<P>
On the Republican side there is dis l agreement as well. As was
mentioned in the spring newsletter, Empower America
has helped lead the fight for legislation that will truly &quot;end
welfare as we know it.&quot; This means moving past the original
House Republican bill to a more ambitious bill. This approach
is embodied in the TalentFaircloth Welfare Reform Act of 1994.
The TalentFaircloth bill is based on three basic principles:
<UL>
<LI>Ending the subsidization of outofwedlock births;
<LI>Enhancing work requirements for individuals on welfare;
<LI>Controlling welfare spending.
</UL>
<P>
Although the Republican bill has some worthwhile provisions, it
does not take the bold steps found in the TalentFaircloth approach.
And while President Clinton gives lip service to the basic principles
found in the TalentFaircloth bill, his legislation violates all
of them.
<P>
Meanwhile, the Empower America effort on behalf of reform is continuing.
Empower America Codirector William Bennett has appeared at one
press conference on Capitol Hill to endorse the TalentFaircloth
bill, and at another press conference to decry the fraudulent
reform being proposed by the Clinton administration. In a USA
Today article, Bennett was quoted as saying &quot;the Clinton
proposal is a onehalf joke, onehalf fraud.&quot;
<P>
In addition to Dr. Bennett's many efforts, the policy division
of Empower America is lending its help to reformers 
such as Congressman James Talent and Senator Lauch Faircloth by
providing information to members of Congress as to the necessity
for dramatic reform. &quot;Many individuals on the Hill simply
don't understand the suffering being wrought by the current system,&quot;
says Peter Wehner, policy director for Empower America. &quot;We
are finding more members of Congress are willing to support the
TalentFaircloth bill once they are given all the facts.&quot;
<P>
Empower America will, according to Wehner, &quot;use all its resources
to help bring about real reform.&quot; The reason for Empower
America's tenacity is obvious&#151;the current welfare system
has wrought havoc on the American poor. After three decades of
welfare programs the nation is faced with an underclass that is
much larger, more violent, less educated and which consists of
an alarmingly high number of singleparent families. In short,
the system is destroying the American social fabric.
<P>
In addition to the TalentFaircloth legislation, Empower America
is supporting initiatives aimed at loosening the restrictions
on adoption (particuarly interracial adoptions), as well as initiatives
to bring economic development to the inner city through incentive
based programs. Hopefully, many in Congress will begin to see
the need for real reform and join in the fight to rescue our culture.
Until that happens, Empower America will stay on the front lines
of the fight.

<H3>Empower America Hosts San Francisco Conference</H3>
<I>Regional Meeting Draws 500 Local Activists</I>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO, CA&#151;Empower America drew over 500 local activists
to its fifth regional conference, held in San Francisco, California,
on June 1, 1994. The regional conferences are designed to engage
conference participants in an open discussion with Empower America's
Codirectors William Bennett, Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick and
Vin Weber.
<P>
The conference focused on the future of entitlements. Panel discussions
addressed different aspects of entitlement programs ranging from
the information superhighway, to welfare policy, to the current
debate over health care reform.
<P>
The first session covered America's newest entitlement, the information
superhighway and the direction of the current administration's
technology policy. Famed author and economist George Gilder advocated
free market alternatives to President Clinton's government managed
approach to developing information technologies. Other panelists
included Larry Ellison, Chairman of the Oracle Corporation and
Tom Hazlet, a professor at the University of California at Davis
who specializes in telecommunicadons policy. A lively discussion
followed panelists' presentations in which several conference
attendees shared frustrations with a governmentrun technology
policy.
<P>
Empower America Co director William Bennett led the discussion
on welfare reform from which several suggestions were offered
by both panelists and conference participants. Addressing the
status of the welfare system, BenneK told the grassroots activists,
&quot;The current system is a complete failure. We have spent
enormous sums over the past three decades on welfare programs
and what do we have to show for it?&quot;
<P>
Jack Kemp provided the luncheon 
address entitled, 'Yhe Assault on Personal Liberty: The Clinton
Administration and the Growth of Entitlement Programs.&quot; Addressing
the recent growth and creation of entitlement programs, Kemp said,
&quot;Government- not the entrepreneur- is the centerpiece
of the Clinton economic plan. The notion that government can guide
America to prosperity is the fundamental flaw that fuels Clinton's
belief that 'government must do more.' This is wrong- individuals
must do more. The future of American prosperity depends on whether
we can roll back government's interference in our lives and allow
the entrepreneurial spirit to flourish again.&quot;
<P>
The afternoon session, chaired by Empower America's Chairman of
the Board, Malcolm S. Forbes Jr., addressed health care reform.
Forbes opened the session by airing Empower America's latest health
care television commercial which criticizes President Clinton's
nationalized health care plan. Joining Mr. Forbes in the discussion
were health care policy experts Stuart Butler of the Heritage
Foundation, Merrill Matthews, Jr. of the National Center for Policy
Analysis and Sally Pipes of the Pacific Research Institute. Each
pol
icy expert stressed the need for free market health care reforms
as opposed to government managed proposals.
<P>
Forbes criticized the Clinton administration's assumption that
individuals can't be trusted to make sensible decisions about
health care and that the only solution is a government run system.
He advocated a new health care system based on private sector
decisions and reforms, such as tax incentives like medical taxfree
savings accounts. He emphasized that individual based plans have
eliminated health care inflation, and that individuals are very
capable of making free market decisions regarding their specific
coverage needs.
<P>
Empower America's regional conferences have served to unite grassroots
activists around the country in an effort to promote the conservative
agenda of limited government. The San Francisco conference received
national media attention which has helped Empower America deliver
its message to the American people. It is this message that; Empower
America will build upon as the'se issues are discussed during
the 1994 elections. For more information about Empower America's
upcoming events, call 1-800-4-EMPOWER.

<H3>Empower America Launches Candidate Schools</H3>
<i>Seminars in Atlanta, San Francisco, Detroit, New York and other
U.S. Cities To Teach 1000 Candidates How to Run and Win on the Empowerment
Agenda</i>
<P></CENTER>
ATLANTA, GA--More than 120 candidates and campaign managers gathered
in Atlanta, Georgia March 9, 1994 to attend Empower America's
Atlanta Candidate School, the third in a series of candidate training
seminars that the political advocacy group is holding this year
in cities across the United States. The schools are designed to
help teach candidates for local, state and national offices how
to run and win on the empowerment agenda.
<P>
Candidates for offices ranging from mayor and state legislator,
to Governor, Congressman and U.S. Senator, gathered at the Atlanta
Hilton and Towers to meet with Empower America's distinguished
faculty of policy experts, elected officials and campaign consultants.
Instead of discussing campaign management, fundraising and &quot;get-out-the-vote&quot;
techniques, they attended panels on the elements of effective
welfare, education, crime and health care reform policies, and
the importance of economic growth, free trade and lower taxes.
<P>
&quot;Our schools are unique,&quot; said Empower America Vice
Chairman Vin Weber, who is heading up the candidate schools program,
&quot;because unlike most traditional candidate schools, which
teach the 'nuts and bolts' of campaigning, Empower America's schools
are focused on ideas and issues. We are teaching candidates how
to campaign effectively on the empowerment message.&quot;
<P>
The Atlanta school followed two schools hid earlier this year,
in Washington, DC on January 11th, and at Stanford University
on February 17th. Empower America will be holding candidate seminars
in cities such as Detroit, Denver, New York and a second school
in Washington, D.C.
<P>
&quot;By the time the 1994 elections come around, we expect that
some 1000 candidates for local, state and national office will
have attended our schools,&quot; said Weber. &quot;We are essentially
working with the next generation of public officials, building
a cadre of new political leaders who share our belief in the empowerment
agenda, and who will help us turn those ideas into real public
policies at all levels of government.&quot;
<P>
The Atlanta school opened with a panel discussion on economic
growth and empowerment. Mayor Tom Fetzer of Raleigh, North Carolina
discussed the growing movement towards privatization and individual
empowerment in America's inner cities. &quot;From Raleigh to Jersey
City to Indianapolis, a whole new generation of leaders is rising,&quot;
Fetzer said. &quot;These leaders represent a political view that
emphasizes the empowerment of people over government and families
and communities over spending and programs.&quot;
<P>
At lunch, Empower America Co-Director Bill Bennett suggested that
candidates for all offices emphasize a message that focuses on
returning power to people and private institutions, not on government
solutions. Cultural renewal, Bennett said, &quot;has to do with
what comes out of TV and the radio, it has to do with the composition
of families, it has to do with the health and well-being of schools,
neighborhood institutions, communities, churches and the like.
If the country is to get better, to improve, it will depend much
more on the health of those institutions than it will on the things
that government does.&quot;
<P>
Ed Goeas, President of the Tarrance Group, a leading national
potting firm, told candidates that his recent studies indicate
that &quot;the American public wants change, and they want change
that is reasonable and rational. Policies which encourage real
welfare reform, real change in education, real economic growth,
and real reductions in crime comprise the real winning platform
for 1994, 1996, and beyond.&quot;
<P>
The earlier schools drew an equally stellar faculty and were also
heavily attended. At the Washington, DC school, for example, more
than 170 candidates and campaign workers from 31 states and American
Samoa participated in panel discussions featuring House Minority
Whip Newt Gingrich, Mayor Bret Schundler of Jersey City, New Jersey,
former Attorney General William Barr, former Chief of Staff to
Vice President Quayle, Bill Kristol, and Empower America's William
Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber. At the San Francisco
area school, more than 100 candidates participated in a program
highlighted by an address from Dr. Edward Tetter, former director
of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the &quot;father&quot;
of the H-Bomb.
<P>
During his luncheon speech, Teller urged the candidates not to
shy away from foreign policy as a campaign issue: &quot;I don't
think I need to tell you of President Clinton's mistakes in the
realm of foreign policy. In the former Soviet Union, in Yugoslavia,
in Somalia, in North Korea, in Haiti, in every continent with
the possible exception of Australia, there have been mistakes.
These mistakes should indeed be discussed because of the widespread
belief that people will vote on the economy, on family values,
and not on foreign affairs.&quot;
<P>
All candidates who attend the Candidate Schools receive Empower
America's &quot;Candidate Briefing Book,&quot; with detailed chapters
on each of the issue areas discussed at the schools. Throughout
the course of their campaigns, candidates will also receive, by
mail and fax, &quot;94 Issue Briefs,&quot; expanding on the chapters
in their briefing books, &quot;Urgent Updates&quot; giving them
information on breaking issues that might be of importance to
their campaigns, and packets of material giving them more information
on the hot issues of the 1994 campaign cycle.
<P>
Candidates or campaign managers interested in attending upcoming
candidate schools should write to: Candidate Schools (Attn: David
Kuo), Empower America, 17761 Street, NW, Suite 890, Washington,
DC 20006.

<H3>Kemp, Bennett, Weber Call GOP Welfare Bill &quot;Too Soft&quot;
Urge Republicans to Unite Behind More Aggressive Reforms</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
WASHINGTON, DC--In a move that drew wide attention in the media
and on Capitol Hill, Empower America Co-Directors Jack Kemp, William
Bennett and Vin Weber issued a memorandum April 14th, in which
they criticized the welfare reform bill backed by House Republican
leaders, and urged them to scrap the current plan and replace
it with a &quot;bold, principled and fundamentally different alternative.&quot;
<P>
The Empower America memo, released to coincide with a meeting
of GOP lawmakers to discuss their welfare reform package, sparked
coverage in several major newspapers, including The New York Times,
The Washington Times and several dozen regional dailies. In it,
the Empower America Co-Directors argued that the House Republican
bill &quot;falls short in three important areas: It contains no
serious attempt to curtail out-of-wedlock births, its work requirements
are weak, (and) its hidden costs are exorbitant.&quot;
<P>
According to Kemp, Bennett and Weber, welfare is illegitimacy's
&quot;economic lifeline.&quot; They argue that &quot;direct welfare
payments that subsidize illegitimacy must cad,&quot; and recommend
that &quot;beginning a year after the enactment of legislation,
women under 21 who have children out-of-wedlock ... be ineligible
for direct welfare payments.&quot; They also called for ending
benefit increases to women who have more children while on welfare.
<P>
In an interview with The Washington Times, Kemp stated that Republican
leaders must &quot;recognize that there has to be a more dramatic
effort at welfare reform if we are to end welfare as we know it--a
socialist, Third World trap permanently subsidizing dependency.&quot;
<P>
&quot;It would be irresponsible and politically unwise for Republicans
to assist the President in perpetuating welfare reform that is
too costly and too soft on illegitimacy and work requirements,&quot;
he said.
<P>
&quot;The central issue is people having babies out of wedlock,&quot;
said Bennett, in an interview with the Associated Press. &quot;Babies
are coming into this world with no fathers and ill-prepared mothers.
It adds to the welfare rolls, education problems and criminal
problems. It adds to the social breakdown of this country. We
have seen enough of the carnage, the cruelty, the 19 kids living
in the (Chicago) tenement, the babies left in dumpsters.&quot;
<P>
Asked what the goal of the Republican alternative legislation
should be, Weber, a retired Member of Congress and former House
GOP Conference Secretary, said that Republicans should frame their
welfare reform plan in a way that &quot;stops President Clinton
from passing a phony welfare proposal that sounds tough, but really
does nothing to bring about fundamental reform.&quot; The GOP
leadership, Weber said, must &quot;prevent passage of a bad welfare
reform package by using their plan to show just how bad the Clinton
bill is, and to force improvement.

<H3>Empower America Economic Summit Findings: Jobs Deficit Is Nation's No. 1 Economic Problem</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
WASHINGTON, DC--America's number one economic problem is not the
budget deficit, but the nation's 5.4 million jobs deficit, according
to testimony delivered at Empower America's recent national economic
summit. Held in Washington, DC, December 14, 1994 exactly one
year after President Clinton's Little Rock Economic Summit, the
Empower America meeting brought together some of the nation's
leading economists, entrepreneurs and business leaders to assess
the state of the economy one year into the Clinton Administration,
and to develop pro-growth alternatives to Clintonomics. The goal
of the economic conference was to assess past and present economic
policies, and to propose an alternative growth plan for the economy.
<P>
In his presentation, Lawrence Kudlow, a noted economist and Empower
America board member, argued that ever since Congress voted to
raise the tax on capital gains from 20 percent to 28 percent in
1986, our nation's economic growth has fallen dramatically below
historic trendlines. This has cost America 1.3 million new businesses,
and has created a 5.4 million jobs deficit--the difference between
the jobs that should have been created and those that actually
were.
<P>
This jobs deficit is being created, according to testimony given
during the conference, because the largest job creator in the
country--the American entrepreneur--has been under continual assault
in the 1990's from higher taxes, more government red tape, and
diminishing incentives to risk-taking.
<P>
Chief among the problems with &quot;Clintonomics&quot; identified
at the conference is the Clinton Administration's core belief
that government is the most important actor in the economy. The
risk-taking entrepreneur is the most important actor in the economy,
argued Kudlow, not government. &quot;Far more important is the
individual man or woman, driven by a dream or an idea--the person
who is willing to sacrifice everything, to mortgage the home or
borrow from the family, friends and neighbors to start a new business.
So any true economic growth model must place the individual, the
investor and the entrepreneur at the center of the economic equation.&quot;
Kudlow said.
<P>
Kudlow argued that a direct link exists between several critical
economic policy mistakes and the plunge in entrepreneurial activity
in the country over the past eight years. The policies that have
caused this decline in job creation, which he compiled into a
list called &quot;The Assault on Capital Formation &amp; Growth,&quot;
include:
<P>
<ul>
<li> 1986 Capital Gains Tax Hike (20% to 28%),
<P>
<li> 1986-90 Social Security Payroll Tax Hikes (14.1% to 15.3%)
<P>
<li> 1989-91 Regulatory Reign of Terror owl bank credit
<P>
<li> 1990 Tax Bill
<P>
- Income tax hike (28% to 31%) and temporary phaseout of itemized
deductions and personal exemptions
<P>
- Alternative Minimum Tax hike (to 24&#162;)
<P>
- Luxury and business tax hikes
<P>
<li> 1991-1992 Regulatory Mandates
<P>
- Clean Air, Americans with Disabilities, and Civil Rights Acts
<P>
<li> 1993 Tax Bill
<P>
- Income tax hike (31% to 39.6%) and permanent phaseout of itemized
deductions and personal exemptions - Medicare tax cap eliminated
(2.9% tax rate) - Corporate tax hike (34% to 35%) and other business
tax hikes including entertainment deduction limits from 80% to
50%) - Other tax hikes: Alternative Minimum I Tax (24% to 28%),
Gas Tax Hike, Taxation of Social Security income.
</ul>
<P>
As a result of these higher taxes, business start-ups since 1986
have dropped dramatically below the historic trend costing millions
of jobs (see accompanying chart). According to Kudlow, &quot;When
taxes were low in the 1980's, we surged above the (historic) trendline
for business startups. Since 1986, as capital was taxed and incentives
diminished, we've fallen sharply below the trend, creating a 1.6
million business start-up deficit&quot; and the 5.4 million new
jobs that should have been created, but never were. Kudlow argued
that if the U.S. continues to &quot;strangle entrepreneurial activity,
America will find itself with European-like economic stagnation
and rising unemployment.&quot;
<P>
Also addressing the conference were Empower America Co-Director
Jack Kemp, Empower America board member Malcolm S. Forbes, Ir.,
and House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-GA), who argued that
closing this jobs deficit required the creation of entrepreneurial
incentives through lower taxes on capital investments and income.
Gingrich took the Clinton health care plan to task, arguing that
the Clinton plan is an anti-capitalist proposal &quot;designed
to seize control of the health system and centralize power in
Washington.&quot;
<P>
The conference was aired live, gavel-to-gavel, by C-SPAN and covered
by both CNN and CBS, which broadcast Empower America's message
to millions of viewers across the nation. It was also covered
in 167 newspapers in 37 states, reaching well over 10 million
people. Since the conference, Empower America has been flooded
with requests for transcripts and videos of the event. To accommodate
this demand, Empower America has made available a 60 minute video
presentation covering the conference.

<H3>Simon &amp; Schuster Publishes Bennett's Index of Leading Cultural Indicators</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>

WASHINGTON, DC--With the tremendous response last year to Empower
America Co-Director William Bennett's release of his Index of
Leading Cultural Indicators, Simon &amp; Schuster has released
the ground breaking study of our culture in book form. The new
book, published under the Touchstone Books insignia, is a significantly
enhanced version of the original Index, with new and updated data
on a wide range of cultural indicators.
<P>
The new Index is the most comprehensive statistical portrait available
of social and behavioral trends over the last 30 years. It consists
of five chapters: Crime; Family and Children; Youth Pathologies
and Behavior, Education; Popular Culture and Religion; along with
appendices on social spending and various economic indicators.
The cultural index is based on the government's &quot;Index of
Leading Economic Indicators,&quot; a set of statistics which track
the health of the nation's economy. The Index of Leading Cultural
Indicators is designed to provide a similar window into the state
of our nation's cultural health.
<P>
Unlike the first edition of the Index, this edition contains extensive
factual analysis of our current cultural condition, with commentaries
by experts and commissions that interpret and provide perspective
on the raw data.
<P>
Among the key findings: Over the past three decades there has
been a 560 percent rise in violent crime, a 400-plus percent increase
in illegitimate births, a quadrupling of divorce rates, a tripling
of the percentage of teenagers living in poverty.

<H3>Recent Visitors to Empower America:  Dr. Edward Teller, Father of H-Bomb, Criticizes Clinton-Gore Defense, Technology Policies</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
WASHINGTON, DC--Dr. Edward Teller, father of the H-Bomb and one
of this century's greatest minds, visited Empower America, March
29, 1994 to meet with Empower America's staff and offer his perspective
on the Clinton administration's defense and technology policies.
America, Teller warned, is in a critical state of transition,
and the current administration is making serious policy mistakes
that he-said &quot;could lead to-very great trouble ... (and)
must be corrected &quot;
<P>
Teller specifically criticized Vice President Gore, who has taken
the lead in the administration on technology issues. Teller said
that Gore has been moving America from being a &quot;progressive
country&quot; into a &quot;reactionary country&quot; in terms
of its receptivity to new technologies.
<P>
&quot;When I came to this country in 1935 everything new was good,&quot;
Teller remarked.
<P>
&quot;Now everything new is under suspicion.&quot; As an example,
Teller cited the Clinton administration's gutting of the Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI). &quot;The Strategic Defense Initiative
is new and is good,&quot; Teller said. &quot;I don't see any argument
that would say otherwise. But in the book of Al Gore, SDI is a
form of aggression.&quot;
<P>
Teller argued that, with the rapid spread of technology throughout
the world, America's era of isolation and invulnerability is over.
&quot;America is no longer isolated. America today is as vulnerable
as Poland was at the outbreak of the Second World War, or even
more vulnerable.... Today Iran or Iraq could put a missile loaded
with biological material on a ship and deliver it from a distance
of ten miles to New York or Los Angles and actually kill 50 thousand
people,&quot; Teller said.
<P>
Teller further added that, while the danger of attack from small
hostile powers which are rapidly acquiring nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons, is less awesome than that once posed by the
Soviet Union, it is also much more likely to occur. The danger
today, Teller said, is &quot;not as terrible as the danger (was)
from the threat of the Soviet Union during the Cold War --that
was a much bigger but much less probable danger. Now we have dangers
that are smaller but more probable.&quot;
<P>
But Teller argued that, despite the dangers posed by rapidly expanding
access to technology, government should not try to stop or interfere
with the progress of technology. &quot;We scientists are responsible
to find the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
so far as we can; including potentialities, what can be done,
and how to use it,&quot; he said. &quot;It is not to be determined
by any elite, not by the religious community, not by the scientific
community and not by the political community, except to the extent
that the political community is an honest representative of the
people.&quot;
<P>
In fact, Teller expressed his support for the &quot;very widespread,
very thorough declassification of information&quot; which the
Clinton administration has recently proposed, because he said
that this declassification would encourage public understanding.
Public understanding, he said, is the only way to combat fear.
<P>
But he also emphasized the potential dangers of such declassification,
and cautioned that it not be misused. &quot;While general principles
and ideas can't be kept secret,&quot; he added, &quot;detailed
blue-prints and precise weapons procedures can be kept secret
and in some cases they should be.&quot; Limited access to this
information does not interfere with increasing public understanding,
he explained.
<P>
Teller said that instead of teaching people to fear technology,
or controlling technological advances, government should harness
technology to protect us. The United States, he insisted, must
use the technological know-how at its disposal to develop defenses
aimed at protecting the lives of its citizens.

<H3>Empower America Interview: David Kay Former Chief of U.N. Nuclear Inspection Team in Iraq Discusses North Korea,Emerging Threats to American Security</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>

In 1991, following the United States' successful prosecution of
the Persian Gulf War, the United Nations sent a team of nuclear
arms inspectors to Iraq to enforce Saddam Hussein's compliance
with the terms of surrender and supervise the dismantling of Iraq's
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs. What the U.N.
team found was horrifying--unbeknownst to the West, Iraq was less
than 18 months away from &quot;going nuclear.&quot; For the next
several months, Iraq played a cat-and-mouse game with the U.N.,
trying to hide and preserve as much of its nuclear capability
as possible.
<P>
David Kay led the U.N. team that discovered Iraq's nuclear program,
and stood down Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard when they tried
to forcibly prevent him from bringing proof of that program to
international attention. An eminent authority on nuclear proliferation
and national security issues, David Kay recently spoke to Empower
America about the current nuclear stand-off with North Korea and
the new threats to American security emerging in the post-Cold
War world.
<P>
Empower America: The conventional wisdom today seems to be that,
with the Soviet threat gone, America will face no major threats
to its national security in me foreseeable future. Do you agree?
If not, what are the emerging threats to our security in the post-Cold
War world?
<P>
David Kay: No, I do not agree. While the Cold War held the potential
for the destruction of our society as we know it --and we are
clearly better for its end-- the Soviets and the U.S. also had
forty years to learn to manage the Cold War in ways that limited
the likelihood of direct nuclear conflict. Today we are witnessing
the emergence of states and groups that are quite unrestrained
in their hostility to the West and willing to run what to most
Americans must seem like irrational risks to advance their interests.
Saddam Hussein's massive miscalculation in the Gulf and North-Korea's
dash for nuclear arms are but two examples of this new development.
<P>
The United States now towers above all others as the only state
in the world with the power to restrain the lust for domination
of renegade states and radical ethnic movements. It is inevitable
that these states will seek to threaten us and diminish our willingness
to stand in the way of their ambitions. Further, even under the
best of circumstances, the vast Soviet nuclear arsenal will take
more than twenty years to dismantle. In the worst of circumstances
some of the former Soviet nuclear, chemical and biological weapons
could well leak into the hands of states and groups hostile to
the U.S. or become the tools of a resurgent Russian dictatorship.
<P>
EA: How soon do you believe it will be before hostile states like
Iran and North Korea are able to directly threaten the continental
U.S. with nuclear or biological weapons?
<P>
DK: North Korea probably already has the capability to threaten
the U.S. with the terrorist use of biological weapons. Biological
weapons have undergone a largely unpublicized revolution in their
lethality and ease of production, and the Director of the CIA
has recently testified that two dozen states have active biological
weapons programs. North Korea's long range missile program is
surging ahead at a rate well ahead of estimates of only two years
ago. I would not be surprised to see North Korea, particularly
if its missile program is assisted by unemployed Russian experts,
able to field an intercontinental missile that could strike the
United States during the mid-part of the next decade. Well before
then it will be able to threaten U.S. bases in Japan and Guam.
Cruise missile technology provides an even easier path than intercontinental
missiles to reach the continental U.S. from ships off our coast,
and this threat will almost certainly be with us by the end of
this decade. The Iranians have already benefited from North Korean
military expertise, and it is reasonable to assume that North
Korea will continue to sell weapons and technology to all bidders.
<P>
EA: What can the U S. do to prepare for this eventuality? Where
should we be directing our resources today, in terms of defense
and intelligence spending?
<P>
DK: First, every effort should be made to slow and disrupt the
advanced weapons programs and cooperation between states such
as North Korea and Iran. While general export controls of the
type that were applied against the Soviet Union during the height
of the Cold War are no longer practical, it is possible to maintain
highly targeted controls on exports and technology assistance
against rogue states such as these. We should do this and be sure
that our allies and states such as China and Russia that want
to benefit from Western trade and assistance do so as well.
<P>
Second, we must develop the capability and political will to destroy
their leadership and political society if they threaten their
neighbors. While we are rightfully proud of the accomplishments
of the coalition military forces in the Gulf, the fact is that
poor intelligence and the lack of suitable weapons for penetrating
deep underground bunkers allowed much of Iraq's military might
to escape attack.
<P>
And finally, we must develop a credible defense capacity able
to handle the most likely threats to American forces abroad and
our people at home. By the end of the decade, we must either have
a workable cruise missile defense and the ability to intercept
a small number of long range missiles aimed at the continental
U.S. or be prepared to accept intimidating military threats to
our society.
<P>
EA: What is at stake with the crisis In North Korea today? Why
should Americans be concerned about North Korea's nuclear program,
and why is it In our national interest to stop it?
<P>
DK: Without a doubt the most dangerous place in the world today
is the Korean peninsula. Within 60 miles on each side of the Demilitarized
Zone (DMZ) that marked the end of the Korean War, approximately
37,000 American troops, 600,000 South Korean and upwards of one
million North Korea troops face each other. The North Korean regime
of aging Kim Il-Sung and his son, Kim Jong-II, rule over an impoverished,
isolated relic of Communism which, if it were not for its military
might and its craftily constructed Image of unpredictability and
irrationality could be ignored until it collapsed into the footnotes
of history.
<P>
But the military might of North Korea is real. Its army is equipped
with Russian, Chinese and Korean-improved armaments that make
up in sheer numbers what they may lack in Gulf War-type quality
and precision. It also fields a battlefield rocket force capable
of reigning, with almost no warning, terror on the South's capital
of Seoul and U.S. bases in the South. Its recent testing of the
Rodong I missile with a range of at least 600 miles now brings
large areas of Japan into range. And most frightening of all,
the U.S. intelligence community is widely reported to have concluded that North Korea has deployed one or two nuclear devices from plutonium
illegally diverted from its IAEA safeguarded reactors. So nuclear
arms must now be added to the regime's armory of chemical and
biological weapons of mass destruction.
<P>
Beyond the fate of South Korea lies the reaction of other Asian
states who have grown used to leaving to the U.S. the management
of regional security concerns. The Japanese may well view the
outcome of a U.S. policy that leaves them to live with a North
Korean bomb as just the opening move in the inevitable retreat
of U.S. power and political influence from Asia. Allowing North
Korea to cheat its way into possession of nuclear weapons could
easily bring an end to this stability and open the way to a less
safe, less open Asia. In this case, foreign policy does matter
even if you believe, &quot;it's the economy, stupid.&quot;
<P>
EA: What is your assessment of the Clinton Administration's approach
to the crisis in North Korea thus far? Is the U.S. approach today
making a conflict more, or less likely' What should the Administration
be doing differently?
<P>
DK: North Korea's nuclear bomb program has faced this Administration
with a set of circumstances that must seem to them depressingly
familiar:
<ul>
<li> Presidential rhetoric has set out a policy that on reflection
the Administration has neither the will nor the ability to implement
and now must find a way to abandon.
<P>
<li> US allies are unwilling to support the announced position of
the President.
<P>
<li> The existing intelligence committee and military capabilities
inherited from the Cold War are inadequate to either implement
the President's policy or to cope with the failure to implement
it.
<P>
<li> Even the best of what are now viewed as possible outcomes, leaves
the US hostage to the actions of irrational, unpredictable leaders
of a regime that has demonstrated implacable hostility to our
ally, South Korea, and to the U.S.
</ul>
<P>
But the allocation of blame should be the least of our concerns
now. There are three important steps that must be taken soon to
ensure that the least possible damage results from the situation:
<P>
First, the U.S. decision must clearly convey to North Korea that
any use by them of weapons of mass destruction, whether they be
chemical, biological or nuclear, would immediately result in the
annihilation of their society. If this is not to be dismissed
as just more overheated U.S. rhetoric then the forces that would
implement this policy must be visibly put in place. If we are
going to have to learn to live with a North Korean bomb, then
we must make it clear to the North Koreans that the use of any
of their arsenal-of weapons of mass destruction would mean the
end of the history of their political leadership. To live with
a North Korean bomb is to live with a regime that has cheated
and won. We will discover that the task of ensuring that victory
does not feed the North Korean appetite requires a toughness of
policy and resolution that has not yet been seen in Washington.
<P>
Second, the inadequacies in U.S. intelligence and military posture
which left the Administration with only a series of bad options
for eliminating the North Korean program must be put right. Proliferation
has already occurred, and North Korea will not be the last case.
The highest priority must be finding effective defensive measures.
As the Administration has discovered, it is impossible to build
a coalition in favor of standing up to a nuclear cheat when the
cost of doing so involves the destruction of one's own country.
Unless we can provide our forces and our allies with meaningful
defenses against missiles and aircraft, the prospect of controlling
proliferation will become much more difficult.
<P>
Third, we must make it clear that North Korea will not be allowed
to export its military technology to others. If North Korea will
not accept effective international inspection and controls on
its nuclear program (and this seems clearly unlikely), and if
the Administration is unwilling to run the risk of a war on the
Korean peninsula to eliminate the North's nuclear capability (and
this seems clear despite occasional Presidential rhetoric to the
contrary), then it is incumbent that we and our allies use our
individual and collective rights to ensure that all of the North's
attempts to export this capability are interdicted.
<P>
EA: You led the weapons inspection effort in Iraq after the Gulf
war which uncovered Saddam Hussein's advanced nuclear program.
What lessons can you draw from your experience in Iraq for how
the Administration should approach North Korea?
<P>
DK: The clearest lesson from Iraq is that the world is better
off to intervene before a rogue state acquires a nuclear capability
than to deal with such a state after it has acquired even a crude
nuclear capability. Korea is in many ways a tougher case than
Iraq. The North is capable of inflicting truly horrible damage
on South Korea with little or no warning. Our closest ally in
the region, Japan, can now be reached by missiles from the North.
While our ability to make the North pay a high price for any such
attack remains, we have little if any ability to truly defend
against such a blow and prevent massive damage to allies and significant
American casualties. Korea, like Saddam's Iraq is a revolutionary
state bent upon overturning the regional order. It is wrong to
assume that we share common objectives with such states and that
more or better negotiations will lead to an acceptable solution
that will provide long-term stability. North Korea under its present
leadership will not play a constructive part in a stable and prosperous
Asia. Our policy should be directed toward containing the destructive
forces of North Korea while waiting for the inherent destructive
forces of the failed regime to bring about its own collapse.
<P>
EA: Can the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons
be stopped, or is their proliferation inevitable?
<P>
DK: Every effort should be made to limit the further spread of
these weapons. But regardless of how vigorous such efforts are,
I believe that further significant proliferation is inevitable.
It is therefore vitally important to ensure that U.S. forces and
our allies are able to defend themselves against the use of such
weapons. We must make clear to any rogue state that the United
States cannot be intimidated from protecting its vital interests
by their possession or use of such weapons. If these states come
to believe --and this is the long-range danger of the situation
in North Korea--that nuclear, chemical or biological weapons would
stop the U.S. from protecting our allies and our own interests,
then the forces of proliferation would become unstoppable. The
most effective nonproliferation policy would be rooted in a vigorous
U.S. military capability to operate and advance our foreign policy
objectives in the face of such weapons.

<H3>Kudlow, Shelton, Coulter Join Empower America Board</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>

WASHINGTON, DC--Empower America announced that two of the nation's
most respected economists, Lawrence Kudlow and Judy Shelton, and
one of America's leading entrepreneurs, Jamie Coulter, have joined
the organization's Board of Directors.
<P>
Mr. Kudlow, former Chief Economist with Bear Stearns, served as
Associate Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
in President Reagan's first term, and was one of the principal
architects of the Reagan Administration's economic and budget
policy. Most recently, Mr. Kudlow served as Co-Chairman of the
Economic Recovery Council in New Jersey Governor Christine Todd
Whitman's election campaign, where he co-developed the tax cut
plan that helped Whitman win the 1993 race against incumbent Governor
Jim Florio.
<P>
Dr. Shelton is currently a Senior Research Fellow at the Hoover
Institution at Stanford University, and is one of the nation's
foremost experts on international monetary, financial and economic
policy. She is the author of several highly-acclaimed books, including
1989's prophetic The Coming Soviet Crash (which was translated
into German and Italian), and the forthcoming Money Meltdown,
to be published by the Free Press in April of 1994.
<P>
Mr. Coulter, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of
Lonestar Steakhouse and Saloon, Inc. since 1992, is one of the
nation's most successful entrepreneurs.
<P>
He has been responsible for developing and operating more than
250 restaurants throughout the United States. And, under the umbrella
of companies he controls, more than 8,000 people are employed
in 30 states. He has served as Chairman of the Board of Directors
of the Young Presidents Organization, Chairman of the Venice International
University of Leadership, and as a Member of the Board of Advisors
of the Wichita State University Center for Entrepreneurship.
<P>
&quot;Larry Kudlow, Judy Shelton and Jamie Coulter bring a wealth
of experience to Empower America,&quot; said Chairman Malcolm
S. Forbes, Jr. &quot;They will play a crucial role in helping
us develop progrowth alternatives to the Clinton economic agenda,
and to champion policies that encourage entrepreneurship, create
jobs and expand opportunity for all Americans.&quot;

<P>
<H3>Following Washington State Vote, &quot;Three Strikes, You're
Out&quot; Initiatives Gaining National Attention</H3>
<i>Empower America Was Early Supporter of the Innovative Anti-Crime Proposal</i>
</CENTER>
<p>


WASHINGTON, D C - Last November, when voters in Washington state
passed Prop. 593, the &quot;Three Strikes, You're Out&quot; and-crime
initiative, they had no idea they were starting a national movement.
But since the historic vote, in which the ground-breaking initiative
won by a margin of more than 3-to-1, versions of the Washington
state &quot;Three Strikes&quot; law have been proposed across
the country, at both the federal and state level, drawing support
from both Democrats and Republicans alike.
<P>
Empower America was one of the earliest active supporters of the
Three Strikes idea, which would place criminals convicted of their
third violent felony in jail for life, no chance of parole. Co-Director
William Bennett -- campaigned in Washington state on behalf of
the initiative, making public appearances, publishing op-eds in
favor of the proposal, conducting interviews with local media
and preparing taped radio &quot;actualities&quot; supporting the
initiative. &quot;When this thing passes,&quot; Bennett argued
during the campaign, &quot;a lot of other states are going to
do the same thing. We do not have a health crisis in this country.
We do have a violent crime crisis.&quot;
<P>
Bennett's prediction has come to pass. Since Washington state
passed Three Strikes in November, legislation has been introduced
in Washington, DC, and as many as thirty states are considering
Three Strikes proposals. An initiative process is underway in
California to place a Three Strikes measure on the 1994 ballot;
legislation was passed last March in California to require a life
prison term with no chance of parole for 25 years for third-time
felons convicted of two violent crimes. Governor Mario Cuomo (D-NY)
has indicated support for legislation involving Three Strikes-type
provisions, and even President Clinton stated his support for
Three Strikes measures for federal crimes during his State of
the Union address this January. Some leaders, such as Gov. Zell
Miller (D-GA), have even claimed that three strikes are too many.
Miller has called for a two strikes and life law.
<P>
The Three Strikes law is intended to target the small group of
repeat offenders who commit the vast majority of violent crimes.
Studies indicate that less than 10 percent of all criminals commit
some two-thirds of all crimes.
<P>
The popularity of the Three Strikes proposal stems from the growing
concern many Americans have about the safety of their communities.
Recent national polls have shown that Americans consider crime
the number one issue facing the country, and politicians have
responded to this sentiment by proposing a number of &quot;tough
on crime&quot; initiatives, both in Washington, DC and in the
states. In addition to the various Three Strikes proposals, both
Florida and Oregon are gathering signatures to put initiatives
on the 1994 ballot which have truth in sentencing provisions prohibiting
the early release of prisoners. The Florida initiative would ensure
that prisoners serve at least 85 percent of their sentence.
<P>
Critics of Three Strikes proposals raise the cost of incarceration
as an issue. But while the average annual cost to incarcerate
an inmate is $25,000, the Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates
that the average annual cost to society of allowing a career criminal
to roam free is $430,000. Thus, the costs of keeping criminals
on the streets and out of prison is much more significant than
the cost of keeping them in prison.
<P>
Critics also cite the discrepancy in the severity of crimes covered
by the law. The initiative passed in Washington state includes
40 crimes as violent crimes, a list which some view as too long.
Critics also argue that the Washington law does not provide rules
to prove Three Strikes, an omission which is likely to set off
a Constitutional challenge.
<P>
Whatever the outcome, the Three Strikes idea has gained significant
popular support in the current and-crime climate. Three Strikes
proposals signify a tough, realistic approach to crime and get
multiple offenders off the streets and into prison where they
belong.

<H3>Issue Briefing</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
<b>The Clinton Health Care Plan: The Making of a Crisis</b>
<P>
There is an emerging consensus that the current health care debate
is perhaps the most consequential domestic public policy debate
in recent American history. The stakes are so high because of
what the 1,364 page Health Security Act, reduced to its essence,
represents: a power-grab by the federal government that is unprecedented
in its scope, its dimensions and its political ambition.
<P>
As the health care debate proceeds, it is important that we establish
a clear concept of what constitutes (and what does not constitute)
real victory by advocates of responsible health care reform. We
believe, for example, that the defeat of the Clinton health care
plan would be an unambiguously good thing. But we also believe
that the passage of a modified version of the plan or an &quot;alternative&quot;
plan which accepts many of the flawed premises of the Clinton
plan--the Chafee plan and the Cooper-Grandy proposal come immediately
to mind--is unacceptable because they, too, would inflict real
long-term damage on the country. In sum: many of the &quot;alternatives&quot;
to the Administration's health care proposals are merely distinctions
without essential philosophical differences. Their passage would
result in a ratcheting leftward--a steady, incremental march toward
statism and collectivism. And so they, too, need to be opposed.
<P>
The good news is that a thoughtful, humane, and essentially conservative
reform of the health care system is now within the realm of legislative
possibility. Opponents of the Clinton plan should therefore resist
the calls for premature capitulation or accommodation and build
on the momentum for intelligent reform. At the same time, we need
to provide a coherent philosophical framework by which to judge
various proposals--to better establish in the public mind what
we believe should be central, and what we believe is unacceptable,
to any health care reform. . .
<P>
<b>Crime and Punishment in America</b><P>
...Crime is one of the most important issues facing America. Government's
first responsibility is the protection of its citizens from &quot;all
enemies, foreign and domestic.&quot; Those who terrorize the lives
of law abiding citizens are, by any measure, enemies; citizens
deserve protection against them. Unfortunately, under our current
system, crime often pays; high crime rates reflect this. The odds
need to be changed back in society's favor.
<P>
The Solution: Incarcerate prisoners, build more prisons and correctional
institutions, enforce prison sentences, increase the police force,
focus on juvenile crime, reduce illegitimacy...
<P>
<b>School Choice</b>
<P>
...The current system is harmful to students and undermines parental
authority. The American people sense this: more than 70 percent
of Americans support school voucher systems, and as of 1992, thirty-four
states had some form of choice legislation pending or introduced.
Increasingly, even teachers and education bureaucrats lack faith
in the system they defend--22 percent send their children to private
schools, for example, and the number is far higher in urban school
districts. The widespread support for school choice is part of
the &quot;parents' rights movement,&quot; in this case an attempt
by parents to regain control from an education bureaucracy that
has stripped individual schools of their autonomy and incentives
to meet student needs.
<P>
School vouchers would provide all parents--regardless of income
level--with an equal opportunity to secure a quality education
for their child. If parents are pleased with the public school
their child attends, as many parents will be, the voucher will
simply stay with that school. If they are not, parents now have
a choice --they can send their child elsewhere, to another public
school, or to a private or religious school. This is the same
concept we use in higher education; students can use government
grants and loans to attend the University of Indiana, or Notre
Dame, or Yeshiva University...
<P>
<b>Clinton's SDI Cuts imperil America</b>
<P>
(Prepared exclusively for Empower America by Henry F. Cooper,
former Chief Negotiator at the Geneva Defense and Space Talks
and the first civilian SDI Director)
<P>
...In 10 years with $30 billion, the Strategic Defense Initiative
(SDI) made dramatic technical advances enabling the deployment
of systems to protect the United States, our troops abroad, and
our friends and allies from ballistic missile attack. The 1991
Gulf War demonstrated the importance of defending civilians against
missile attack, and Congress directed that advanced defenses be
developed for deployment as soon as technology permitted. The
Bush administration left a fully funded plan, approved by a comprehensive
Pentagon acquisition review, with options to deploy advanced defenses
for our troops, friends and allies as early as 1996 and for the
American homeland as early as 1999. After Clinton's first year,
what remains is barely a shadow of the Reagan-Bush SDI legacy.
<P>
The Bush plan to protect the American homeland against limited
missile attack by as early as 1999 called for 5-times the Clinton
budget, which aspires only to support a &quot;technology readiness
program.&quot; The Bush plan included 60 percent more for advanced
technology to assure that America excels at the very competitive
edge of the technology frontier. The Clinton cuts severely constrain
efforts to respond to reactive threats that will follow from the
inevitable measure-countermeasure competition--and will stop development
of new technologies...
<P>
<b>Goals 2000</b>
<P>
...President Clinton's $420 million education bill, Goals 2000,
falls far short of the mark of qualifying as education reform,
and provides for no real change such as more choices, greater
accountability, more
<P>
local control and flexibility to teachers. Instead, the bill contains
a number of &quot;business as usual&quot; options as well as a
number of potentially harmful provisions. Unfortunately, the Clinton
Education Department receives its marching orders from the education

proposal during the past 20 years. The establishment is largely
responsible for engineering the worst decline in the history of
American education. And they are now in the posit ~~n of defending
one of the worst-performing systems in the world.
<P>
Our education system needs entrepreneurial reform. Here's what
that might look like: reform measures providing for accountability,
decentralization, national standards in the core subjects, merit
pay, alternative certification, and allowing parents to choose
the public, private or religious school to

would dramatically improve American education. . .

<H3>Bennett's <I>Book of Virtues Reaches</I> Nation's Best Seller
List</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>

WASHINGTON, DC--Empower America Co-Director William J. Bennett's
<I>The Book of Virtues</I> has reached number one on the national
best-seller lists, including those complied by The New York Times,
The Los Angles Times, and The Washington Post. The book, an anthology
of great moral stones, focuses on ten virtues: self-discipline,
compassion, responsibility, friendship, work, courage, perseverance,
honesty, loyalty and faith. The purpose of the collection, Bennett
writes in his introduction, is &quot;to aid in the time-honored
task of the moral education of the young.&quot;
<P>
The book has proved not only a popular success, but a critical
success as well. It has received rave reviews in both the general
press and opinion journals from across the political spectrum,
including <I>Newsweek, Time, People, The Washington Post, The
Wall Street Journal, The New Republic, National Review</I>, and
<I>Commentary</I>.
<P>
However, despite the wide attention it has received, Bennett is
quick to emphasize that <I>The Book of Virtues</I>, was in no
way animated by politics. &quot;I commit a lot of political acts,&quot;
he recently told the Associated Press. &quot;This book was not
a political act.&quot; In a recent essay, Time magazine columnist
Lance Morrow echoed this sentiment, writing: &quot;Bennett is
not demagoguing the verities. He anthologies the old republic
and the old virtues, but he addresses virtue at a level of commonality
that is deeper than politics or nostalgia.&quot;
<P>
Perhaps what is most encouraging about the success of <I>The Book
of Virtues</I> is what it may say about changes in our culture.
The book's popularity seems an expression of the American people'
s desire to hear again --and to read again --about time honored
virtues. As U.S. News &amp; World Report put it in a recent article,
&quot;the Public longing for moral anchors helps to explain how
William Bennett's anthology ... was able to push shock-jock Howard
Stern's autobiography from the top of the bestseller list earlier
this year.&quot; Asked why he feels these moral tales have struck
a chord with the American public, Bennett answers simply: &quot;Unless
you're a criminal, these are your values.&quot;

<H3>EMPOWER AMERICA IN THE NEWS</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>

In addition to coverage in the national media, Empower America
also generates a great deal of coverage in the local and regional
press. Here is a sample of recent news stories that discuss Empower
America.
<P>
&quot;Empower America, a conservative organization, said Clinton's
(State of the Union) speech had one purpose: 'to resuscitate his
faltering health care plan,' which it said 'has steadily been
losing support with the American people.' 'He has manufactured
a phony health care 'crisis' to scare people into accepting his
plan to nationalize the health care industry,' said the group,
led by former Housing Secretary Jack Kemp and other conservatives.&quot;
<P>
--<I>San Jose Mercury News</I>, January 26, 1994
<P>
&quot;Many conservatives say Clinton's (health reform) plan is
a liberal power grab based on the illusion that there is a health
care crisis. 'The crisis will come only if the Clinton plan becomes
law,' said a press release Tuesday from Empower America The White
House responded to such criticism with offers to back off some
of its more ambitious goals...&quot;
<P>
--<I>Orlando Sentinel</I>, January 26, 1994
<P>
&quot;William Bennett--the former education secretary and drug
czar under the Reagan and Bush administrations--called for an
end to welfare, saying it fosters the dissolution of low-income
families. He advocated instead programs to strengthen the family.
He said polling data shows a change in values in America that
has worsened the crime crisis, with few modern parents looking
at their children as their most important priority. 'We have conducted
a social experiment in the last 30 years in this country along
these lines--what happens if we have lots of children and don't
raise them?' said Bennett. 'The results of that experiment are
now in.&quot;'
<P>
--<I>Pensacola News-Journal</I>, January 20, 1994
<P>
&quot;Former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick ... took Clinton
to task, saying his just-concluded trip to Russia and Eastern
Europe was a pullback of the historic U.S. commitment. 'The U.S.
performance was largely interpreted as a retreat,' said Kirkpatrick.
Kirkpatrick ... (was) in Miami for the third regional meeting
of the new organization, Empower America.&quot;
<P>
--<I>Palm Beach Post</I>, January 20, 1994
<P>
&quot;During his visit to Miami Wednesday ... Kemp says his organization
(Empower America) is reshaping the party. He called Clinton's
foreign policy in general 'a disaster' and U.S. policies in both
Bosnia and North Korea 'an empty shell.' As for the problem of
ending the cycle of poverty in American cities, 'President Clinton
doesn't have a clue.' 'We've turned our cities into socialized,
almost Third World economies,' he said. Kemp shared the podium
with Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick,
and former Education Secretary and war-on-drugs czar William Bennett
....&quot;
<P>
-- <I>The Miami Herald</I>, January 16, 1994
<P>
&quot;Jack Kemp ... blasted the Administration's first year as
a failure in foreign policy .... 'The President's administration
has been close to a disaster in terms of credibility,&quot; Kemp
said Wednesday. Kemp ... Ridiculed Clinton for allowing 'a bunch
of thugs with AK47 submachineguns' to force a U.S. Navy warship
to leave Haiti. He criticized Clinton for being too soft on North
Korea's nuclear threat, and said the administration has fumbled
the Bosnia crisis with its inaction.&quot;
<P>
--<I>Marietta Daily Journal</I>, January 20, 1994
<P>
&quot;Vin Weber, Co-Director of Empower America ... (noted) that
the version of the (balanced budget) amendment sponsored by Senator
Paul Simon, D-Ill., that is being debated on the Senate floor
would make tax cuts designed to stimulate economic growth unlikely,
largely because any tax cut would be seen as adding to the deficit.
<P>
--<I>Investor's Business Daily</I>, February 25, 1994

<B>&quot;A Cultural Renaissance&quot;</B> 
<P>
By Jack Kemp, Co-Director, Empower America, delivered at Hillsdale College
<P>
...A government conceived in liberty has none of the tools of
tyranny. It depends, instead, on other institutions-- structures
between the individual and the state--that instill character,
purpose, and virtue. Churches and synagogues that raise a moral
standard. Parents who provide a moral and spiritual example to
their children. Schools that teach, not only the basics of math
and history, but the basics of citizenship and character that
come from an understanding of the Decalogue as well as the Declaration
of Independence.
<P>
Can we separate economics and values? The choice is not necessary.
The achievements of capitalism depend on the achievements of the
human spirit, nurtured in families. I am a believer in the power
and promise of free markets, free minds, and free nations. I am
also a believer in fostering the values that make them possible.
And I will admit no conflict between them. . .
<P>
<B>Commencement Remarks at Pepperdine University's School of Business
and Management</B> 
<P>
By Theodore J. Forstmann, Founding
<P>
Chairman, Empower America
<P>
...Basically, there are just two ways to organize society. The
first is the statist society, in which inequalities are reconciled,
resources are redistributed, and interaction is regulated through
the machinery of the state. The other is the civil society, in
which people organize themselves through voluntary association.
It's an old argument, filled with a lot of ideological 'isms'
and intellectual pretensions, but it basically comes down to a
question of who has the power to make some of the most important
decisions in your life. Do you invest your money, or does someone
else invest it for you? Do you choose your children's schools,
or are they assigned? Can you give to the charity of your choice,
or is the money funneled to state welfare programs? When you get
sick, can you pick your doctor or is your health-care plan prescribed.
<P>
The irony of the politicization of American life is that no country
on the face of the earth could be more ill-fitted for statism
than the United States of America. This is not a value judgment.
It is a simple statement of fact. For better or for worse, the
American spirit is not a bureaucratic spirit. It's a risk-taking,
rulebreaking, establishment-shaking spirit. While Western Europe
was groomed for statism in its centuries of monarchical rule,
America was born of revolution. For 60 years now, we have been
subjected to the materialist wisdom of the state as it imposed
ever increasing levels of social engineering. Today, sadly, we
all reap its non-spiritual devastating rewards...
<P>
<B>Closing Remarks at Empower America's National Economic Conference</B>

<P>
By Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr., Chairman of the Board, Empower America
<P>
...We're living in a world where, more and more, capital is intangible.
It's in the mind. And if people don't have an education, don't
have that tool, they're never going to get ahead. They're never
going to fulfill their potential. This new age is symbolized by
the microchip which is extending the reach of the human brain
the way machines extended the reach of human muscle in the last
century. The microchip, which is doubling in power every 18 months,
will dramatically expand our standard of living.
<P>
Our nation must take the lead to create and preserve not only
a national environment but an international environment where
democracy, pluralism, tolerance and free markets can take root
and flourish. Only we can guarantee that this will happen. If
we don't take the lead in making sure that there is a benign world
order, an environment where freedom can flourish, no one else
will. . .
<P>
<B>&quot;An Agenda for Economic Growth&quot;</B> 
<P>
By Lawrence Kudlow, Economist and Member of Empower America's
Board of Directors, Delivered at Empower America's National Economic
Conference
<P>
...During the Bush Administration some Republicans became ashamed
of their support for a lower capital gains tax. They cowered before
anyone who cried 'fairness' and abandoned the effort to reduce
it further and index it for inflation. By doing so, they surrendered
a core principle of successful economic policy: the idea that
growth comes from dynamism, risk-taking, and entrepreneurship
and that we cannot punish productive capital with a confiscatory,
unindexed tax on capital gains.
<P>
The entrepreneur suffers the most from bloated government spending
because he or she looks to government for little, but pays the
most every time taxes go up. Government &quot;investment&quot;--the
latest euphemism for more spending--may help a special interest
group, but the rest of society will suffer as incentives are blunted
and risk-taking is punished. Our economic and cultural policies
should nourish and support the family and the family-owned business,
not undermine them. We must pass an end to economic and social
policies which obstruct risk-taking in the marketplace and traditional
values at home. We need a vision that offers people maximum incentive
to succeed and a complementary vision that offers them maximum
faith and hope when they go home to their families...

<i>Regional Meeting Draws 400 Local Activists</i>
<P>
MIAMI, FL - Empower America drew over 400 local activists to its
fourth regional conference, held in Miami, Florida, January 19,
1994. The regional conferences are designed to engage participants
in open discussion with Empower America's Co-Directors William
Bennett, Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Vin Weber and other political
leaders, in an effort to promote conservative grassroots activism
throughout the nation.
<P>
Participants in the Miami meeting discussed issues such as crime,
foreign policy and the economy at the one-day meeting. The morning
session, led by Empower America Co-Director William Bennett, focused
on national and community crime issues. Looking back on his tenure
as Drug Czar in the Bush Administration, Bennett told the grassroots
activists, &quot;I traveled to more than 100 communities in America,
most of which were poor communities. And whenever I visited these
communities I never heard people say 'let's deal with the root
causes of crime.'
<P>
What they kept asking me is, 'why can't you keep criminals off
the streets?' Our poor communities deserve the same protection
that society provides its more affluent communities.&quot; Joining
Dr. Bennett in the discussion were local experts who addressed
issues such as local law enforcement and community policing.
<P>
Among the highlights was a presentation by U.S. Senator Connie
Mack (R-FL), who addressed the conference on the Clinton administration's
domestic policy. Mack told the audience that since taking office,
President Clinton had largely backed away from his conservative
campaign promises. &quot;I'm very disappointed,&quot; Mack said,
'I'd give him a 'D' for his first year.&quot;
<P>
Jack Kemp chaired the afternoon discussion on community empowerment
and conservative prescriptions for economic renewal. As for the
problem of ending the cycle of poverty in American cities and
promoting economic growth for all, Kemp said, &quot;we've turned
our inner cities into socialized, almost Third World economies.
President Clinton is moving in the wrong direction. Instead of
easing government's burden on the American taxpayer and entrepreneur,
he's raised taxes, discouraged entrepreneurship and now he's trying
to nationalize health care, all under the disguise of a recovering
economy he has inherited.&quot;
<P>
Empower America will be hosting its next regional conferences
in Houston on May l9th and San Francisco on June 1st. For more
details on how you can participate in upcoming regional meetings,
call Empower America toll-free at 1-800-4EMPOWER.

<H3>Kirkpatrick Assails Clinton Policy in Europe</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>


MIAMI, FL--At Empower America's recent regional conference in
Miarni, former UN Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick gave an assessment
of the Clinton administration's policy in Europe, arguing that
President Clinton's recent statements, and the U.S. performance
at the recent NATO Summit, were viewed by the Europeans as &quot;a
broad policy of withdrawal, (and) a weakening of America's NATO
role in Europe.&quot; According to Kirkpatrick, the Europeans
believe foreign policy is more concerned with power than democratic
ideals, and the Clinton administration's fitful responses to the
reemergence of Europe's historical balance of power concerns has
produced an unnecessary and growing ambiguity about U.S. purposes
in Europe and in NATO.
<P>
By its failure to exercise U.S. Leadership in Europe and in NATO,
and by delegating too much authority to the United Nations Secretary
General, the Administration, Kirkpatrick asserted, has permitted
collective security to be weakened and &quot;has had a difficult
time finding common ground with our European allies.&quot;

Little &amp; Co.; and Joe Cannon, Chairman &amp; CEO of Geneva
Steel in Salt Lake City.
<P>
&quot;I am delighted and honored to be working so closely with
a unique organization that effectively combines ideas with activism,&quot;
said Forbes. &quot;This organization has grown to nearly 400,000
members in less than one year, and has an ambitious agenda for
1994. I look forward to building on this record of success.&quot;
<P>
In other organizational changes, Vin Weber will move up from President
to become ViceChairman of the Board. Weber will also join Kemp,

<H3>What's Ahead for 1994</H3>
<P>
1993 has been a very successtul year for EmpowerAmerica. 
We created and built a brand new organization from the ground 
up, and with your support has forged it
into a powerful political voice for promoting
innovative ideas in the public arena. 
<P>
Now, as 1994 approaches, we have kicked off a number of exiting
projects for our second  year:
<UL>
<LI>To make sure that the campaigns of 1994 are tough on the
issues you and I care about, next year Empower America will be
hosting candidate training schools across the United States.
<LI>On Decomber 14, 1993, the one year anniversary of  President
Clinton's economic summit in Little Rock, Empower  America will
be hosting an economic summit of its own to assess the Clinton
Administration's perforrnance and to begin developing alternatives
to Clinton's economic agenda. <A HREF="/empower/aehigh21_2.html">
(see article)</A>.
<LI>In 1993, Empower America worked hard to promote Proposition
174, the California school choice initiative, and Proposition
593 the anticrime initiative  in Washington State, which places
repeat offenders convicted of their third felony in jail for life,
with no chance of parole, probation or work release. In 1994,
we will be backing more of these kinds of grassroots campaigns
in states across the country.
<LI>As the Clinton team continues to grope for a coherent foreign
policy we believe it is time for a serious dialogue on preserving
America 's leading role on the world stage. To this end, Empower<B>
</B>America plans<B> </B>to host its first major conference on
international issues.
<LI>And finally we will continue to expand Empower America's
efforts to bring our message of empowerment, opportunity and entrepreneurial
capitalism to new groups of citizens by establishing Empower America's
&quot;Community Empowerment Project.&quot;
</UL>

<P>
As you can see, 1994 will be an important year for us. We look
forward to working with you, and to seeing you at our 1994 regional
conferences. Please keep us informed about your ideas on how we
can make EA more effective in fighting for the ideas we believe
in.
<P>

<H3>NAFTA Approved by Congress</H3>
<P>
<I>Empower America Campaign Credited as Central to Securlng NAFTA
Victory</I>
<P>
<B>Washington, DC  </B>On November 17, the House of Representatives
voted 234 200 to approve The <B>North American Free Trade
Agreement</B> (NAFTA), the historic accord which will now link the
economies of the United States, Mexico and Canada into the world's
largest and most powerful free trading bloc. Days later the accord
easily passed the Senate, and will now be implemented beginning
January 1,1994.
<P>
The battle for NAFTA was hard fought, and Empower America's efforts
to help pass the trade pact were described by many as central
to the victory in Congress. In an article published before the
House vote, columnist Morton Kondracke praised Empower America's
efforts on behalf of NAFTA, calling them a model for other conservative
leaders to emulate. Empower America and its CoDirector Jack Kemp,
Kondracke wrote, &quot;are doing what the entire GOP leadership
should be doing: making passage of NAFTA one of its top priorities
for 1993... Kemp boosts NAFTA in every speech, blankets the nation's
oped pages with proNAFTA columns and is circulating a...proNAFTA
(open letter to America) among the nation's governors. Now other
GOP leaders need to take up the cause in an equally public way.&quot;
<P>
Indeed, Empower America was one of the earliest vocal supporters
of NAFTA. Early on, Kemp published proNAFTA opeds that ran in
newspapers in California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois,
Missouri, North Carolina, New York, Texas, Georgia, Arizona and
Massachusetts, spreading the NAFTA message to some 4.17 million
Americans. And, as the House vote neared, Kemp played a key role
delivering the GOP vote for NAFTA and winning over undecided House
Republicans
<P>
Empower America concentrated its efforts on bringing in the votes
of undecided Republicans, many of whom supported NAFTA in principle
but were hesitant to &quot;deliver a big victory for Bill Clinton.&quot;
Just one week before the vote, Kemp held a private, closed door
meeting on Capitol Hill with some 40 undecided GOP House Members
to discuss their concerns about the vote. Paraphrasing Lincoln,
Kemp told the Republicans to vote on their convictions on NAFTA
because &quot;you serve your party by serving your country.&quot;
Immediately following the meeting, Kemp held a Capitol Hill press
conference, at which several previously undecided Members announced
their support for NAFTA.
<P>
The following Sunday, Kemp appeared on &quot;This Week With David
Brinkley&quot; to argue the case for NAFTA. The next night, just
two days before the vote, Kemp took on conservative NAFTA
opponent Pat Buchanan in a oneonone debate, broadcast on CNN's
&quot;Larry King Live&quot;. The day before the vote, Kemp published
an editorial in the Washington Post, cowritten with Rep. Dick
Armey (TX), laying out the reasons why conservatives should support
NAF TA. And Kemp worked the phones lobbying Members who were still
wavering.
<P>
In the end, all these efforts paid off, as Republicans came through
for NAFTA, voting in favor by an overwhelming 132-43. The solid
GOP support provided the margin of victory for NAFTA&#151; as
the final tally showed, Clinton would never have succeeded in
passing the accord had he depended solely on his party's vote
in Congress.
<P>
With NAFTA now signed into law, Empower America is now calling
on the Clinton Administration to use the momentum the GOP has
provided him on free trade, and move quickly to expand NAFTA to
other Latin American countries. In a Wall Street Journal oped
published just after the House vote, Empower America President
Vin Weber called on the President to immediately &quot;pursue
the next step in building a hemispheric free trade zone: negotiations
to incorporate Chile, Argentina and Venezuela into the NAFTA trading
bloc.&quot;
<P>
Whether Clinton heeds this advice and continues to support free
trade policies, or seeks to heal his Administrations wounds
with organized labor by moving left again, remains to be seen.
But one thing is certain: thanks to the support of Congressional
Republicans, Ronald Reagan's vision of a North American free
trade zone has finally become a reality. Empower America is proud
to have played a major role in this historic effort.
<P>

<H3>The Forced Collectivization of Medicine</H3>
<P>
By Jack Kemp
<P>
After a Clinton Administration official let slip that 40% of Americans
will pay more under its health care plan, the President's media
rapid response team went immediately into action...to change the
subject.
<P>
The diversion they chose was a frontal assault on insurance companies.
&quot;It is time,&quot; Hillary Clinton told an audience of doctors,
&quot;for...every American to stand up and say to the insurance
industry, 'Enough is enough. We want our health care system back.'...It
is time we stood up and said, 'We are tired of insurance companies
running our health care system.'&quot;
<P>
The First Lady's attack would have been more credible if not for
this ironic fact: The centerpiece of the Clinton health plan is
a dramatic increase in the power of insurance companies over the
health of Americans&#151;the power to ration medical care.
<P>
Remember, first, how the Clinton proposal is designed to cut health
costs. It would create regional &quot;Health Alliances&quot; that
would enforce a health care budget by placing legal limits on
what insurance companies could charge. Insurers could be fined
if their premiums don't meet these caps on health costs.
<P>
The result? Only those insurance companies that place the most
effective, restrictive controls on what they are charged by doctors
and hospitals will survive. By some estimates, only 5 or 6 insurers
will remain, and each of these companies will provide &quot;managed
care&quot;&#151; programs to cut costs and meet a budget set by
government.
<P>
How is that budget met? Insurance companies will dictate how doctors
and hospitals reduce expenses. Insurance reviewers, or &quot;gatekeepers,&quot;
will micromanage medical treatments to cut costs, secondguessing
doctors and nurses. These bureaucrats with little direct knowledge
of a patient, will effectively have the final say on what specialists
that patient can see, or what tests and technology they deserve.
<P>
This, in essence, is the Clinton plan: Big government would require
a few big insurance companies to meet smaller health budgets.
Those companies, to cut costs, would do the dirty work of rationing.
<P>
Michael Tanner of the Cato Institute recently described how this
rationing process works in other nations with nationalized health
care. In Canada, hundreds of medical procedures and drugs that
once were covered by national insurance have been declared too
expensive and are no longer paid for&#151;a process Canadians
call &quot;delisting.&quot;
<P>
In Germany, a 1989 reform reduced the range of medical services
covered by that nation's &quot;social insurance&quot; program.
The story is similar in Britain, Spain, Sweden&#151; and Oregon.
Yes, Oregon.
<P>
That state's Medicaid program lists 709 medical services in order
of urgency. The list is then matched against the amount of government
funding available in the health budget. Only 535 medical procedures
made the cut this year, while the remainder will not be paid.
So, for example, the treatment of swelling of the esophagus&#151;
numbered 538&#151;is covered. Disk surgery&#151;number 536 --is
not.
<P>
The Clinton plan's national budget for health care would make
this kind of rationing inevitable for every American.
<P>
&quot;When individuals pay for their own health care,&quot; Michael
Tanner concludes, &quot;they decide what services to buy. When
government pays for health care, it decides what services it will
pay for. The availability of health care services becomes subject
to the whims of majority rule.&quot;
<P>
Even Stanford University's Alain Enthoven, one of the original
designers of &quot;managed competition,&quot; has opposed the
Clinton plan because it uses health alliances to impose price
controls.
<P>
Nationalized health care always puts bureaucrats in the business
of choosing who deserves care, and who does not. In the Clinton
plan, those bureaucrats would work for insurance companies, enforcing
a health budget set by the government. In other countries, those
bureaucrats work for the government directly. The effect, in
either case, is precisely the same: a decline in the quality
and accessibility of medicine.
<P>
<B>Bad Medicine: The Clinton Health Care Plan</B>
<P>
Despite the hours of television time and millions of dollars spent
by the Clinton Administration to drum up support for its health
care reform plan, the public isn't being told much about the details.
A close look at these details reveals why:<B> </B>the President's
health care plan masks the largest power grab by the federal government
in recent history.
<P>
Here's what the Clinton administration won't tell you about their
health care plan:
<P>
I. <B>Government bureaucracies will be granted massive new powers
to ration care, set price controls, and eliminate competition.</B>
<UL>
<LI>Price Controls: Central to the President's plan is the
creation of a new bureaucracy, the National Health Board (NHB)
which would set &quot;global budgets,&quot; or limits on the total
amount of public and private spending on health care. It would
also set price controls on insurance premiums and prescription
drug prices.
<LI>Rationed Care: If total health care spending exceeds the
governmentset &quot;global budget,&quot; rationing must follow.
Managedcare &quot;gatekeepers&quot; will have systemic incentives
to ration care to comply with the spending caps imposed on them
by governmental health bureaucracies.
<LI>Tyrannical Enforcement: The National Health Board would
also have bigbrotherish enforcement powers. If a state fails to
fully comply with its edicts, the NHB can cut off all health care
funds to the state or direct the Secretary of the Treasury to
impose a payroll tax on every employer in the state.
<LI>Outlawing Traditional Medicine: Everyone will be required
to purchase insurance through governmental &quot;health alliances&quot;
in each region. Health alliances choose which insurance plans
consumers can choose among; they can shut out any plan whose premium
is 20% above the average,
thereby eliminating feeforservice (traditional) medicine and forcing
all residents of a particular region into HMOs. Clinton's plan
could take away citizens' ability to choose their doctor.
</UL>

<B>II. The President's plan cannot be
 paid for without drastic tax or deficit increases.</B>
<UL>
<LI>Underestimated Costs: Clinton originally estimated the
cost of his plan to be $30 billion; now, most economists place
that figure at least $120 billion higher. Harvard Economist Martin
Feldstein estimated that the plan would require an additional
$120 billion in taxes in the first year alone.
<LI>Unrealistic Expectasions: The President plans to expand
Medicare to include prescription drug and longterm care coverage
(price tag: $152 billion) while realizing a net savings of $124
billion:cutting &quot;waste and fraud.&quot; He relies on a steep new
cigarette tax to finance the bulk of government subsidies, even
though many studies have shown that his tax will bring in less
than half of the revenues he is counting on.
</UL>
<B>III. Economic downturn and job destruction will result.</B>
<UL>
<LI>Employer Mandates: Small companies will face a payroll
tax of 3.5%&#151;an estimated $29 billion in new costs to those
small companies which now account for around 80% of new job creation.
Larger companies would have to pay 7.9% of their payroll.
<LI>Job Loss: The Employment Policies Institute estimates that
Clinton's employer mandates will eliminate 3.1 million jobs.
<LI>Dislocation: The health care industry accounts for 14%
of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs 10 million people.
Huge changes in the structure and delivery of health care will
lead to significant dislocation and further job loss.
<LI>Stunted Innovations: Price controls on premium caps and
drug prices will stunt pharmaceutical and biomedical research
and development, which in turn, will postpone or eliminate the
opportunity to develop new drugs, prevention medicines, and disease
cures.
</UL>
<B>IV. Clinton's health plan strips individuals of choice,
autonomy, and privacy.</B>
<UL>
<LI>No Choice of Benefits: The Clinton Administration will
draw up a &quot;standardized benefits package;'9 that every American
is required to purchase. The content of this package will inevitably
be politicized.
<LI>Loss of Medical Privacy: Clinton would require every American
to carry with them at all times a &quot;National Health Care Card&quot;
which would contain one's entire medical history on a computerized strip. 
Anyone who can gain
electronic access (legally or illegally) to the computer system
could access an individual's medical records.
</UL>

<P>
President Clinton's health care plan begins with a wrong assumption
and ends with the wrong treatment. The President seeks to convince
us that our health care system&#151;which has consistently delivered
the best, most technologically advanced care in the world&#151;is
so broken that it must be replaced by bureaucracies and governmental
oversight. The flaws of our current health care system are real
and demand redress; changes in malpractice, tax, and insurance
laws are all necessary. But President Clinton's plan to disempower
Americans by placing the government in charge of health care will
ultimately result in higher prices, greater inefficiency, and
poorer health care.

<H3>EmpowerAmerica Launches 1994 Candidate Schools</H3>
<P>
Empower America is initiating a series of issues-oriented 1994
Candidate Schools to provide candidates at the local, state, and
national levels a coherent and comprehensive empowerment agenda.
These schools, to be held early next year in Washington, D.C.,
San Francisco, Denver, Detroit, Atlanta, and New York will focus
on economic competitiveness, growth, and entrepreneurship, free
trade, international leadership, health care, as well as education,
welfare, and crime.
<P>
Currently there are a number of political schools that address
the nuts-and-bolts of campaigns: fundraising, electoral strategies,
opposition research, and direct mail. What is missing, however,
are schools that present candidates with the <I>substantial </I>elements
of a political agenda and how best to campaign on such issues.
<P>
Candidates will be given a briefing book and a series of papers
authored by policy experts explaining the elements of the empowerment
agenda. Each candidate school will then be led by policy experts
who will explain the issues in detail, and political analysts
and pollsters who will instruct candidates on how to translate
the agenda into a winning campaign. Empower America's principals,
Jack Kemp, Bill Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and Vin Weber will
offer insights based on their political experience in governmental
leadership.
<P>
Interested candidates or campaign managers should contact Empower
America at 1-800-332-2000.

<H3>From the Grassroots....</H3>
<P>
Empower America held three successful grassroots events during the fall.
In Los Angeles, California, William Bennett, Vin Weber and Jack
Kemp greeted over 700 Empower America associates and supporters
at a highenergy reception honoring several of that city's noteworthy
citizen! who are devoted to the ideals of empowering individuals.
Also, it was our pleasure to be joined by Robert Woodson, Sr.
of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, Orson Swindle
of Empower America, and Leon Watkins of the Family Help Line,
all of whom played essential roles in the evening's success.
<P>
In Dallas, Texas, our members gathered for a daylong conference
led by Jack Kemp and Vin Weber to address topics of vital interest
to southwest America. The eloquent conservative insight of former
Chief of Staff to Vice President Quayle, Bill Kristol, and the hardhitting
pragmatism of Dallas' own, Mayor Steve Bartlett were major attractions.
We were also joined by local area experts for panel discussions
on the economy and NAFTA.
<P>
In New York City, Empower America held a dinner and panel discussion
with some notable conservative leaders. Joining Jack Kemp, Bill
Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber, was radio talk show
host Rush Limbaugh. Also in attendance was National Review founder
and Editor-at-Large William F. Buckley, Jr.
<P>
We are currently scheduling 1994 conferences for Miami, Houston,
San Francisco, and New York.

<H3>Empower America and GrassRoot state Initiatives</H3>
<P>
By William J. Bennett
<P>
On November 2,1993, citizens of the C November 2,1993, citizens
of state of Washington passed two important referenda that should
serve as models to other states, and will hopefully be a harbinger
of things to come. Their success reflects a growing (and healthy)
citizen conviction that government's primary duty is to protect
its people, rather than confiscate and redistribute their income.
<P>
Proposition 593, also known as &quot;Three Strikes, You're Out,&quot;
will place criminals convicted of their third violent felony in
prison for life, with no chance for parole, probation, or work
release. The simple logic of ensuring the incarceration of the
most dangerous and violent criminals made plenty of sense to the
citizens of Washington state; &quot;Three Strikes, You're Out&quot;
garnered the support of 75% of the voters.
<P>
The reasons for Proposition 593's landslide victory are straightforward:
violent crime is destroying our social and civic order. And despite
evidence that the crime problem is largely caused by a small group
of hardcore criminals (studies indicate that two thirds of all violent
crimes are committed by less than 10 percent of criminals), government
has done little to protect law abiding citizens from these predators.
While the modern state has expanded its reach into virtually every
aspect of citizens' lives, it has increasingly abdicated its first
responsibility: to ensure public safety. Citizens are afraid and
they want to fight back; the passage of &quot;Three Strikes, You're
Out&quot; is a very good start. It may well serve as a blueprint
for other states, and has already been passed as an amendment
to a comprehensive crime bill awaiting passage in the U.S. Senate.
<P>
Voters also registered their opposition to an ever expanding &quot;nanny
state&quot; that takes too much from us in order to do too much
for us.
<P>
Proposition 601 restrains future state spending growth and tax
increases by limiting the growth of the state budget to the population
and inflation growth rate and mandates that any new tax increase
must be approved by the voters. Proposition 601's success heralds
a rising tide of public support for job creation over social service
expansion, and economic opportunity over higher spending. Today
there is an enormous gap between what people believe government
can do and what it actually can do. The passage of Proposition
601 is a first step toward narrowing the gap and securing a progrowth,
fiscally responsible economic program.
<P>
Conservatives need to lead a national conversation that examines
anew the relationship between government and the governed. What
happened on the first Tuesday in November was a good place to
begin. And events in Washington state should remind people to
look less to the nation's capital and more to the states and localities,
those &quot;laboratories of democracy,&quot; where the most innovative
reforms are taking place.

<H3>President's Message...</H3>

This has been a very busy three months. We launched our grassroots
citizens' action campaign to defeat the Clinton tax increases.
The Clinton plan wilI~ raise taxes, destroy jobs and increase&#151;not
lower&#151;the federal budget deficit. We worked hard to defeat
it. Many of you received your Tax Action Packet, which explained
what you could do in your own state to help defeat the Clinton
plan. Jack Kemp, WilL; am Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick and I gave
literally hundreds of radio and TV interviews, attacking the plan
and explaining why it will be so destructive to our economy. We
also launched an eightstate grassroots lobbying campaign to put
voter pressure on speciallytargeted, key &quot;swing vote&quot;
Senators. We appreciate the thousands of petition signatures that
you gathered and returned to us. And thanks to your generous support,
we were able to produce and place antitax radio ads on the Rush
Limbaugh show.
<P>
We're also working to promote positive change in America. We've
gotten behind the &quot;A Better Choice&quot; school choice ballot
initiative in California. It's the kind of innovative empowerment
idea America needs. It's a tough fight&#151;the antichoice forces
are spending millions of dollars to defeat us. But we're fightina
to win.
<P>
School choice will be one of the central themes at Empower America's
reception in Los Angeles September 23rd. The evening will feature
speeches by both William Bennett and Jack Kemp.
<P>
Our first conference in Milwaukee was a huge hit&#151;we sold
out all 700 spots. We'll also be holding regional conferences
this year in Dallas, Texas; and Phoenix, Arizona. To get a copy
of our special video of the Milwaukee conference, send in the
form on the last page of this newsletter.
<P>
We look forward to seeing many of you in LA, and appreciate all
your hard work in the antitax effort. Together, we can make a
difference.
<P>
<B>Vin Weber, President</B>

<H3>Warning: Tax Hikes Ahead</H3>
<I>Clinton Budget is mined with more taxes, new spending</I>
<P>
<B>By Jack Kemp</B>
<P>
Three years ago, Americans were hit with the highest tax increase
in history because of the disastrous 1990 Budget Deal that was
sold on the promise to reduce the deficit by $500 billion. Sound
familiar? The result: the deficit exploded to over $300 billion,
taxes were raised on the &quot;rich,&quot; while revenues were
reduced and the economy suffered from anemic growth.
<P>
History demonstrates that economic growth and deficit reduction
cannot be achieved through higher taxes and promises of future
spending cuts. The parallels between the 1990 Budget Deal and
President Clinton's 1993 Budget Deal are remarkable. Both packages
rely heavily on &quot;soaktherich taxes,&quot; a regressive gas
tax, and the hope that a future Congress will cut spending. Specifically,
the 1990 Budget Deal raised taxes by $158 billion. Clinton's package
will nearly double that tax increase. Moreover, 80% of all spending
cuts in the 1993 Budget Deal are not scheduled to take effect
until after 1996.
<P>
One would think that somewhere along the way to constructing and
selling a budget package that is a mirror image of the deal struck
less than three years ago, someone would check whether the desired
results were achieved. Apparently, it is not in President Clinton's
nature to do so. Now that data from the 1990 Budget Deal is in,
we can compare the promises with the results. According to the
IRS, in 1991 the rich paid 6.1 % less in taxes even though their
tax rates were raised in 1990. Can Clinton blame this on the
slow economy? No, he cannot. The middle class paid more in
taxes (1% more)
even though their tax rates stayed the same. According to projections
of the 1990 Budget Deal, the deficit this year should be $142
billion. In fact, it is over $300 billion.
<P>
There is nothing new in the President's tax and spend asoroach;
it has been tried again and again, not once achiev
ing lower deficits and higher growth. The reason why people are
buying into the President's call for sacrifice (through higher
taxes on Americans as the only alternative to smaller deficits)
is that there has been no complete explanation of the ramifications
of the Clinton plan. However, the blame can be extended across
party lines. Unf ortunately, many Republicans, along with the
Democrats, have paid zero atten
tion to the real alternative - GROWTH.
<P>
Americans, after reading the fine print, will come to realize
what is in store for them. Will higher taxes, massive cuts in
defense spending and a growing dependency on government services
lead to longterm prosperity? Or will a broader tax base through
lower rates and the responsible scalingback of government free
up the resources that individuals and families can use to control
their own destinies? The real defining issue is whether we allow
our Tiation to cure its economic ills through growth or taxation.
I side with growth and the American people.

<H3>American Leadership or Disengagement?</H3>


<B>By Jeane Kirkpatrick</B>
<P>
Everyone knows that candidate Bill Clinton promised a middle class
tax cut, while President Bill Clinton has increased the taxes
on the middle class.
<P>
Everyone knows that candidate Bill Clinton promised American armed
forces second to none, while President Bill Clinton has cut the
defense budget so deeply that the Secretary of Defense was forced
to change U.S. strategy and Clinton has also demoralized the armed
forces by imposing, without consultation, decisions that violate
basic American standards and values.
<P>
Everyone knows that candidate Clinton promised American air strikes,
if necessary, to save Bosnian civilians from Serbian aggression.
President Clinton has only followed the European lead in doing
nothing for too long.
<P>
Candidate Clinton promised to preserve U.S. leadership, but President
Clinton has retreated from a policy of leadership to a point of
acquiescent multilateralism. &quot;We have taken the lead,&quot;
said Secretary of State Warren Christopher, &quot;in passing to
multilateral bodies decisions and action on threats to peace.&quot;
They call it leadership. These policies variously called assertive
multilateralism, or cooperative security are, in fact, policies
of progressive AmeAcan disengagement and abdication.
<P>
The policy of &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; is applied far
beyond the issue of gays in the military to other important questions
of preparedness, morale and AmeAcan power.
<P>
Don't ask, don't tell how robust or hollow our military forces
will be after the scheduled cuts have been carried out.
<P>
Don't ask, don't tell what President Clinton will do when it becomes
even clearer that Iraq and North Korea are developing nuclear
weapons in spite of promises to the contrary.
<P>
Don't ask, don't tell what the Clinton Administration will do
when it is undeniably clear that China is selling missile technology
to Pakistan and nuclear technology to Iran - in spite of promises
to the contrary.
<P>
Don't ask, don't tell how the Clinton Administration proposes
to protect the continental United States from missiles launched
by the world's most violent dictators now that they have eliminated
funding for a strategic missile defense.
<P>
The President and Secretary of State have shown signs of improved
clarity and effectiveness in Lebanon and Bosnia, but not enough.
Further evidence of American disengagement can be perceived in
a variety of Clinton Administration decisions to date: the unconditional
extension of Most Favored Nation status to China, the unconditional
diplomatic recognition of the MPLA government of Angola, the uncon
ditional release of financial assistance to Nicaragua, the Administration's
continuing inaction on the North American Free Trade Agreement
and related hemispheric matters.
<P>
Some see in the U.S. insistence on multilateralism in economic
relations with Russia yet another example of a deliberate nonleadership
style in foreign policy.
<P>
Is the Clinton Administration renouncing the global leadership
the United States has excercised since World War II? Secretary
of State Warren ChAstopher has suggested that is the case, and
other State Department officials have recently emphasized the
Administration's determination to reduce U.S. commitments abroad.
<P>
One can only hope that our new president will heed the emerging
warning signs of the large price we, and the world, could pay
for abdication of U.S. leadership. The worldwide increase of terrorism
that has spread to the United States is a dramatic wakeup call.
A disengaged and unprepared America courts the very problems it
seeks to avoid.

<H3>The Politics of School Choice</H3>
<P>
<B>By William J. Bennett</B>
<P>
Over the last 30 years, we have witnessed a sharp decline in the
quality of public education. Today, low test scores, consistently
high dropout rates, drug use and increasing violence characterize
many of our public schools. Even as per student expenditures have
jumped (in constant 199192 dollars) from $2,035 in 1960 to $5,247
in 1990, student performance has continued to decline. Median
SAT scores have fallen almost 80 points over the last three decades,
and a recent international comparison of math and science skills
scored Americans at the bottom of the list of industrialized countries.
We need real reform, and we need it now.
<P>
The problem with our public schools is not a lack of money. Indeed,
both teacher salaries and overall educational expenditures have
increased dramaticallv. The failure of our schools is systemic:
despite the poor record of many schools,
unionization has strengthened the education establishment's power
over students and parents. Teachers' unions have made it virtually
impossible to fire even the most inept educator, and have freed
administrators from accountability. Parents, particularly lowerincome
parents, have few recourses, since they often lack the financial
means to send their child elsewhere.
<P>
The current system is a wreck; it hurts students, it undermines
parents and it perpetuates a social injustice. The American people
sense this: more than 70% of Americans support school voucher
systems, and as of 1992, 34 states were considering various school
choice initiatives. Increasingly, even teachers and education
bureaucrats lack faith in the system they defend&#151;22% send
their children to private schools, for example, and that number
is far higher in urban school districts. The widespread support
for school choice is part of
the &quot;parents' rights movement,&quot; in this case an attempt
by parents to regain control from an education bureaucracy that
has stripped individual schools of their autonomy and incentives
to meet student needs.
<P>
School vouchers would provide all parents - regardless of income
level - with an equal opportunity to secure a quality education
for their child. If parents are pleased with the public school
their child attends, as many parents will be, the voucher
will simply stay with that school. If they are not, parents would
now have a choice - they could send their child elsewhere,
to another public school, or to a private or religious school.
This is the same concept we use in higher education; students
can use government grants and loans to attend the University of
Indiana, Notre Dame or Yeshiva University. Higher education performs
better because of the competition.
<P>
The intellectual debate about school choice is just about over.
It will increase competition, accountability and parental involvement.
It will save taxpayers money. Indeed, school choice is the most
important and farreaching education reform in America.
<P>
The only people to benefit from the public schools' lock on educational
resources are those who hold the key&#151;the teachers' unions
and the educational bureaucracy they represent. The National Education
Association (the nation's largest union with 2.1 million
members) has a
vested interest in ensuring public schools' monopoly over taxpayer
money, which is why they are raising teachers' dues for the express
purpose of funneling more than $15 million into a campaign to
defeat school choice in California. That is why we at Empower
America are taking a leading role in the fight for school choice
in California. As a recent <I>Forbes </I>article noted, &quot;The
public may be only dimly aware of it, but the union's growing
power has exactly coincided with the dismal spectacle of rising
spending on education producing deteriorating results.&quot; 
<P>
The timehonored task of education is to provide children with
sound intellectual and moral instruction. School choice empowers
parents to select schools that reflect the values and the academic
goals that they hold for their children.

<H3>Success in Milwaukee</H3>

<I>Standing Room Only at Conference</I>
<P>
&quot;...more than 700 regional political activists gathered
here. . .to celebrate. . .ideas. Conservative ideas such as public
school choice, welfare limits, free enterprise-style economic incentives
and things as basic as good oldfashioned tax cutting.&quot;
<P>
<RIGHT><I>-Wisconsin State Journal, </I>June 26, 1993</RIGHT>
<P>
&quot;President Clinton's economic, foreign and social policy
initiatives were found lacking by three prominent conservatives
who were in Milwaukee for the first meeting of a new national
organization called Ernpower America.&quot;
<P>
<RIGHT><I>-Milwaukee Sentinel, </I>June 25, 1993</RIGHT>
<P>
Well over 700 enthusiastic supporters crowded into Milwaukee's
Italian Community Center on June 25th to hear Empower America's
William Bennett, Jack Kemp and Jeane Kirkpatrick as they launched
their series of regional conferences. With more than twenty events
scheduled over the next 18 months, these conferences are designed
to integrate national policies with state and local initiatives
and programs.
<P>
The Milwaukee event featured a morning session of comments by
William Bennett, Jack Kemp and Jeane Kirkpatrick, followed by
energetic question and answer sessions.
<P>
The lunch session featured two prominent conservative leaders.
Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson, a member of Empower America's
Gubernatorial Advisory Board, listed his state's numerous innovations
in the areas of education and welfare reform. Bob Woodson, president
of The National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, focused on
reviving our nation's inner cities through economic growth and
policies which encourage home ownership and &quot;workfare&quot;,
not welfare.
<P>
The afternoon panels emphasized school choice and economic growth,
and provided an indepth look at efforts in these areas on the
local and state levels.

<H3>Battling for School Choice:EA Joins the
Grassroots Effort in Calif. </H3>

<P>
On November 2, the people of California will vote on Proposition
174, a revolutionary school choice initiative tesignet to empower
parents, reform education and save taxpayers money. The initiative
would give parents the opportunity to choose where their children
will be educated&#151;at a public, private or religious school.
If parents choose a public school, that school receives full funding,
about $5,200 per child. If parents choose a private or religious
school, they will receive a voucher worth half that amount, about
$2,600, to be used to pay the tuition (62 percent of California's
private schools cost $2,600 or less.)
<P>
Empower America is playing a leading role in the battle for school
choice in California. CoDirector William 1. Bennett signed the
ballot argument supporting Proposition 174 that will be sent to
all of the state's registered voters and he plans to participate
in numerous school choice events. CoDirector Jack Kemp has raised
$600,000 for the effort thus far. For a School Choice Action Packet,
please call 1-800-332-2000.

<H3>Free Trade and NAFTA</H3>

<P>
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is scheduled to
be considered this fall by Congress. This agreement will make
history&#151;either as the missed opportunity that cost the U.S.
jobs, increased trade and a more competitive economy; or as the
creator of the world's largest free trade zone which expanded
exports to Canada and Mexico and created a growing supply of higher
paying jobs. Despite support by President Clinton, NAFTA might
not make it thtnilah Concrrecc Tf those onnosed to NAFTA would
only
look at the facts, they would find consensus among economists
who has seriously studied the documents and realize that it will
increase U.S. exports and create American jobs.
<P>
Before Mexico's 1986 decision to join the General Agreement on
Trade and Tariffs (GATT), tariffs on U.S. exports
were as high as lOOSo; Now they are down to an average of 10%.
The average tariff placed on Mexican products being sold in the
U.S. is 3%. The arithmetic is straightforward. The U.S. clearly
has more to gain by the elimination of tariffs. But let the facts
tell the story: since 1986 these declining tariffs produced a
windfall of export activity (see chart), shifting our trade status
with Mexico from a deficit of $4 billion to a surplus of $9 billion.
Mexico has become the fastest growing export market, purchasing
73% of its imports from the U.S. It has now established itself
as our second largest market; Canada being the first. Consequently,
as the Mexican economy grows, so do U.S. exports.
<P>
These increased exports have already created 300,000 new
jobs, doubling the number of jobs supported by exports to Mexico
(see chart). In fact, the Department of Commerce estimates that
each extra $1 billion in exports creates over 19,000 net new jobs.
The Institute for International Economics projects that by 1995,
over 1 million U.S. jobs will be supported by U.S. exports to
Mexico alone.
<P>
The answer to the question, &quot;what kind of American jobs will
be produced by the NAFTA agreement?&quot; is key. According to
the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, exportrelated jobs
pay 17% more than the average U.S. wage. This applies to workers
in both the service and manufacturing industries.
<P>
Our borders and trading patterns have a finite capacity; but our
potential to expand trade and grow the economy, is infinite&#151;provided
we pursue free trade. The evidence is dear. If PresidentClinton
truly wants a stimulus package that creates longterm, private
sector jobs, he would seize the moment and urge passage of this
agreement now.

<H3>President's Message...</H3>
<P>
This is a critical time for our country as we are finally getting
a good look at President Clinton's economic plan. It's tax and
spend all over again.
<P>
The bottom line for individuals, families, and businesses: the
biggest tax increase in American history, $328 billion over five
years; an effective acrosstheboard tax increase on every taxpayer
of up to 20 percent; a tax on individuals earning as little as
$30,000; and more government spending. Whatever happened to President
Clinton's campaign promise to cut taxes for the middle class?
<P>
Every time you turn around, the Clinton team is talking about
another new tax on American families and workers. But they never
talk about cutting taxes.
<P>
Empower Arnerica thinks that's wrong and we've launched a campaign
to defeat the Clinton tax hikes. By energizing activists like
yourself, we're convinced <B>that the Clinton tax bill </B>can
be defeated. America needs economic policies that promote growth,
create jobs, and provide opportunity for entrepreneurs.
<P>
President Clinton says that his policies reflect the &quot;new&quot;
Democrat. Frankly, I can't tell the difference between his tax
hikes and tax hikes of the old Democrats. We need to get the economy
moving up the growth curve again. The Clinton tax increases will
only hurt our economy and increase the deficit.
<P>
Bill Clinton thinks you're not paying enough taxes. Empower America
thinks Americans are overtaxed, and we need your help in defeating
these tax increases and promoting an agenda for economic growth.
<P>
At a grassroots level, thousands of concerned citizens are helping
us to promote conservativeoriented empowerment strategies at all
levels of government. So, if you're concerned about Bill Clinton's
tax and spend policies, stay involved with Empower America. We
know there's a better way. 
<P>
Vin Weber

<H3>Clinton's First 100 Days</H3>
Bill Clinton now concedes that his presidency is off to a rough
start. The problem, the White House would have us believe, has
to do with a lack of &quot;agenda discipline,&quot; trying to
do too much too soon. Mr. Clinton's problems, however, run much
deeper. <I>His Administration is not working because his liberal
philosophy is not taking.</I>
<P>
At an April 28th press conference, Empower America released its
analysis, &quot;The Credibility Gap: The First 100 Days of the
Clinton Administration.&quot; Among the key points:
<P>
  1. The idea heavily marketed during the campaign that Mr. Clinton
was a &quot;New Democrat&quot; has been disproved.The gap between
candidate Clinton and President Clinton is rapidly becoming a
gulf. He has reversed himself on middle class tax cuts, free trade,
Haitian refugees, home ownership for lowincome Americans, and
tax funding for abortions, among other issues. This is part of
the reason why his opinion ratings are the lowest in history of
any president at a comparable point.
<P>
 2. The presupposition that guides the Clinton Administration's
policies is, as the President told a joint session of Congress,
&quot;government must do more.&quot; In Bill Clinton's America,
the federal government will tax more, spend more, regulate more&#151;and
the American people will depend on government more. The public's
increasing frustration and alienation toward government does not
square with President Clinton's vision of an everexpanding government.
<P>
  3. During the campaign Bill Clinton invoked the word &quot;change&quot;
like an incantation. He made a compelling case for &quot;reinventing
government.&quot; But he seems far less interested in reinventing
government than in reinflating it. President Clinton's budget
will increase spending almost $300 billion over the next five
years.
<P>
4. Bill Clinton's political career has been characterized by an
easy abandonment of commitments. Rather than allaying these concerns,
President Clinton has confirmed them through a series of welldocumented
policy reversals. Bill Clinton is coming dangerously close to
forfeiting a president's most precious political asset -- his
credibility with the American electorate.
<P>
5. President Clinton has failed to create a government that can
govern. Many agencies still lack key appointments. Meanwhile,
President Clinton's policies and tactics have galvanized the Republican
party to a remarkable degree while key Democrats are backing away
from many of the President's proposals.
<P>
The Clinton presidency is way off stride and on the defensive.
His Administration appears overwhelmed. Public skepticism is rising.
It is in the nation's best interest for Bill Clinton to purposefully
steer his presidency to the responsible center --  which after
all is how he got elected.
<P>

<H3>The American Scene: Leading Cultural Indicators</H3>
by William J. Bennett
<P>
The Index of Leading Cultural Indicators, the most comprehensive
statistical portrait available of behavioral trends over the last
30 years, was released on March I 5th. The Index provides an empirical
analysis of the condition of modern American society.
<P>
The findings are troubling. Over the last three decades we have
experienced substantial social regression. Since 1960 there has
been a 560 percent increase in violent crime; more than a 400
percent increase in illegitimate births; a quadrupling in divorce
rates; a tripling of the percentage of children living in singleparent
homes; more than a 200 percent increase in the teenage suicide
rate; and a drop of almost 80 points in the average S.A.T. scores.

<P>
The Index does more than document cultural decline; it points
to some solutions. Cultural renewal depends above all on strengthening
and revitalizing our social and civic institutions -- families,
churches, schools, and neighborhoods. But government has a role to play. 
First, government should heed
the old injunction, &quot;Do no harm.&quot; The longterm impact
programs have on strengthening families, discouraging dependency
and criminal behavior, and encouraging educational achievement
should inform debate on social policy. Second, political leaders
should make use of their ability to shape attitudes through discourse
and legislation. Third, a legislative social agenda should emphasize
a tough and intelligent criminal justice system; radical education
reform (including school choice for public, private, and religious
schools); reversal of the destructive incentives of the welfare
system; removal of economic barriers to those living in poverty;
support of families by increasing the personal dependent exemption;
rescinding nofault divorce laws; removal of major obstacles to
adoption; improving child support collection; and encouraging
responsible fatherhood.
<P>
The Index struck a responsive chord with the public.  More than
70,000 people called to request copies of it. The Index also received
extensive media coverage, including 130 newspapers each with a
circulation over 100,000 and more than 500 newspapers overall;
and television, radio, and magazine coverage. It received favorable
coverage from the <I>Washington Post's </I>David Broder, the <I>Wall
Street Journal's</I> Paul Gigot, and nationally syndicated columnists
Mona Charen, Cal Thomas, Georgie Anne Geyer, Morton Kondracke,
Ben Wattenberg, and Richard Grenier.
<P>
Perhaps the most encouraging news is that there is a rough consensus
emerging about the nature of the cultural debate. Gerald Seib
wrote in the <I>Wall Street Journal </I>that recent writings on
social issues, including the Index, are &quot;starting to cause
ripples inside Washington, and in time are likely to transform
the standard liberalconservative debate over social policy.&quot;

<H3>It's the Economy, Stupid Not A Stupid Economy</H3>
by Jack Kemp
<P>
Conservative activists now have an opportunity to defeat President
Clinton's tax increases and to go to the American people with
a superior agenda for real jobs, real economic growth and renewed
American leadership in the global economy.
<P>
First, we must debunk Clinton's notion that higher taxes will
lead to a more prosperous America. In reality, higher taxes will
weaken the economy, reduce revenues and increase the deficit.
Never in American history have tax increases created jobs or economic
growth. 
<P>
<B>A ProGrowth Agenda</B>
<P>
Empower America believes we can reduce the size of government
and lower the deficit without raising taxes. At the same time,
we support a progrowth agenda that really puts people first, not
government.
<P>
Here are some ideas for a growth agenda:
<P>
 <I>&#149; </I><B>Encourage en&#166;repreneurship, saving, investment</B>
<P>
The best way to rekindle the job creating power of America's entrepreneurs
is to expand the supply of risk capital available to finance creative
new ideas and develop new products. All provisions in the tax
code affecting saving and investing should be immediately indexed
to stop the corrosive effect of inflation. This includes indexing
capital gains taxes, depreciation allowances, corporate tax rates,
and retirement plans, such as IRAs and 401Ks.
<P>
Ultimately, we should phase out the capital gains tax altogether
on longterm investments and eliminate it for anyone who works,
saves, or invests in America's lowincome communities.
<P>
<I>&#149; </I><B>Tax relief for families and working Americans</B>
<P>
We should advocate a flat, fair, and simple tax system that rewards
success instead of punishing it.
<P>
To spur job creation, the payroll tax, currently the greatest
burden on middle class families and small businesses, should be
reduced. Since the mid1960s, the payroll tax has more than doubled
from 7.25 percent to 15.3 percent today. Middle income families
now face an effective marginal tax rate on all income of over
30 percent, compared with less than 20 percent 30 years ago. Reducing
this tax would expand employment by lowering the cost of hiring
additional workers and increasing the reward for working for unemployed
Americans.
<P>
 We must also champion tax reform, such as raising the dependent
exemption, that recognizes the family as America's paramount valueshaping
institution. The moral, spiritual, and cultural health of our
nation is inextricably linked with the strength of the Amencan
family. That strength is being undermined by government policies,
both economic and social, which are biased against marriage and
famiiies with children.
<P>
<I>&#149; </I><B>Spending restraint</B>
<P>
Spending restraint and regulatory relief is a key part of our
philosophy of limited government. Government spending absorbs
valuable resources, often for inefficient and wasteful purposes.
<P>
While cutting wasteful spending, there must also be strong budget
caps to restrain the growth of government spending. Capping the
rate of entitlement growth, except Social Security, at inflation
plus population growth,would save more than $250 billion over
five years.
<P>
However, real spending control requires institutional changes
to enforce accountability in the federal budget process, including
a lineitem veto to help balance the budget without raising taxes.
<P>
<B>* Free Trade</B>
<P>
Opentrading policies helped expand the global export market to
$3.1 trillion by 1989. Mr. Clinton is dangerously reversing course
by threatening trade wars with Europe and Japan.
<P>
The key to U.S. and global economic growth lies in opening new
markets to goods and services. Passing a clean, mutually beneficial
North American Free Trade Agreement and completing the floundering
Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is
a top priority.
<P>
The next step is to negotiate marketopening trade agreements culminating
in a hemispheric freetrade zone. Our ultimate goal should be to
incorporate the Pacific Rim nations, Russia and other former communist
states into an open global trading system.
<P>
Clinton's farleft liberal policies must be stopped to prevent
them from hurting America.  Now is the time for us to once again
raise the banner of economic growth, low taxes, limited government,
strong families and equality of opportunity for all. Nothing could
produce a sharper contrast with the policies of the Clinton administration.
<P>

<H3>NATIONAL SECURITY FOR THE '90s</H3>
By Jeane Kirkpatrick
<P>
There have been three great watersheds in the twentieth century&#151;moments
when the world came apart and recreated itself.
<P>
The first occured in the wake of World War I, and like today,
the optimistic trend in Europe was to a continent of democratic
governments. But in the decades that followed, Lenin in Russia,
Hitler in Germany, and Mussolini in Italy were able to seize power.
In each case, resurgent nationalism and a tradition of authoritarianism
played a role. In each case, the world stood by as democracy floundered.
And in each case, the cost of failed democracy proved incredibly
high. World War II, the Holocaust, and the Cold War were only
part of the price. The replacement of new democracies with Bolsheviks,
Fascists, and Nazis was wholly unexpected. It should prompt us
to ask ourselves now: what could happen that we do not expect?
<P>
The second watershed of the century occurred following World War
II. After Eastem Europe was conquered by the Soviets, the democracies
<I>did </I>act to prevent Westem Europe from the incorporation
into the Soviet bloc. U.S. resistance &#151; in the form of the
Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan and NATO&#151;stopped the Soviet's
westward drive. NATO succeeded in providing a framework for democracy,
development, and stability because it was an organization of democracies
around the principle of collective security. Each time a former
dictatorship&#151;Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece&#151;was
incorporated into NATO after they established democratic institutions,
the belief that membership in NATO reinforced democracy was reiterated.
<P>
Now, in the wake of the collapse of Communism and the end of the
period of Soviet military threat, we have arrived at the third
great watershed. It is a moment of possibility when the world
is creating itself again. The transition of the former communist
states from totalitarianism to democracy, and from command to
market economies has already proved more complex and difficult
than was generally anticipated. The consequences of failure could
be catastrophic, yet no innovative Westem response comparable
to the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, NATO, or the Common
Market has been forthcoming. <I>It is critically important that
we make room for the new democracies in Western institutions.</I>
<P>
Now is the time to think about collective security. The U.S. and
the democracies helped create the context for the defeat of Communist
governments by providing an altemative model of more successful
societies and by maintaining military strength. But the peoples
of Central and Eastem Europe were not liberated by foreign armies,
but by their own efforts. They are already our allies in SpiIit.
We should make them allies and trading partners in fact.
<P>
After World War II, we believed that institutionalized association
with other democracies would reinforce habits of constitutional
rule and peaceful cooperation. We were right. It is time to apply
the lessons.
<P>

TAXING FAMILIES FIRST
<P>
<B>Bill Clinton wants the largest tax increase in American history.</B>
<P>
Bill Clinton plans to hike taxes $328 billion between 1994 and
1998.
<P>
This means Bill Clinton wants the American taxpayers to send an
extra $7,488,584 an hour to Washington,D.C. --  that's $124,809
a minute!
<P>
The average family of four will pay $904 more in taxes per year.
The average New Jersey family will pay $1,276 more. (source: The
Tax Foundation, February 24, 1993)

<P>
A typical middle income family will pay about $500 more a year
in energy taxes under the Clinton proposal.
<P>
Gasoline taxes will go up 8 to 12 cents a gallon.
<P>
The Clinton energy tax will cost $50 billion and 600,000 jobs.(source:

<P>
<B>Taxes on Social Security benefits for middle class retired
Americans will skyrocket 70%.</B>
<P>
Bill Clinton wants to raise the maximum taxabte amount of Social
Security benefits from 50% to 85% for those individuals making
over $25,000; and for couples making over $32,000.
<P>
For some retirees, this could amount to $2,700 a year&#151;or
$225 per month. (source: U.S. Sentate Republican Policy Committee,
March 17, 1993)
<P>
<B>Small businesses and farmers will be plowed under. </B>
<P>
Small business owners will be the victims of Bill Clinton's new
36% tax bracket, not the rich. 
<P>
Of all income tax returns reporting earninl s over $100,000, 52%
are smail businesses. 
<P>

&quot;A Vision for Stagnation&quot;, Joint EconomicCommittee,
April 1993)
<P>
<B>Jobs will be lost and gone.</B>
<P>
Over the next five years, 1.4 million fewer jobs will be created,
and total wages in the economy 
<P>
will be $483 billion lower.(source: National Center for policy
Analysis, March 11, 1993)
<P>
An estimated 1.1 million jobs will be lost by 1996.<B> </B>(source:DRI/McGraw-Hill,

<TITLE>Foreword</TITLE>
<H2>Foreword</H2>
<HR SIZE=2>
<P>

<P>	Much has been made of the collapse of state socialism and the post-Cold War global march 
toward free markets. In reality, however, progress has been slow--and in some parts of the world 
nonexistent. Even today, as the authors show in the study that follows, only a relative handful of   countries--and we are blessed to be among them--have truly free economies. And some of them, our own 
included, are backsliding.
<P>	The recent shift in the congressional balance of power provides U.S. policymakers with one of 
those truly rare opportunities to rethink the way the United States government conducts its business. One 
area in which such a reexamination is long overdue is foreign aid.
<P>	As Admiral James W. Nance, senior Republican staffer on the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee told <I>The Washington Post</I> shortly after the 1994 congressional elections, the 
amount of money the United States has spent since 1947 on foreign aid equals more than one-third of the 
federal debt. Much of it has been wasted.
<P>	U.S. development aid should have one priority, and one priority only: promoting the kind of free 
market growth that will enable the recipient country to prosper <I>without</I> foreign aid. If U.S. aid 
does not promote free market capitalism and self-sufficiency, we need to ask the question: Why are we 
giving it?
<P>	The Heritage Foundation's<I> Index of Economic Freedom</I> provides compeling evidence 
that economic prosperity and economic freedom go hand in hand. Lasting prosperity cannot exist in the 
absence of economic freedom; and a free economy inevitably results in economic growth and rising living 
standards.
<P>	If nothing else, the November 1994 elections reflected the U.S. public's dissatisfaction with 
business as usual. Well-intentioned programs that fail to accomplish their goals--and in some cases 
make matters worse--can no longer be tolerated. The U.S. foreign aid program is a classic example of 
this: good intentions gone awry.
<P>	While U.S. and global policymakers and opinion-leaders have rightly placed considerable 
emphasis over the years on political freedom, economic freedom has received scant attention. It's almost 
as if the policy community has determined that it doesn't matter. But it does matter. In fact, it is the key. 
If a country has a free economy, it can lift itself--and its people--out of poverty. We see this today in 
Asia, Latin America, and even in the early stages in parts of the former Soviet empire. We also see that 
economic freedom is a breeding ground for political freedom. South Korea, the Republic of China on 
Taiwan, Chile, and many other emerging markets provide vivid proof that economic prosperity depends on 
the opportunities created by a free economy, not on U.S. aid, the heavy hand of government planning, or 
even advanced infrastructure and abundant natural resources. Freedom is what counts most.
<P>	Former Treasury Secretary William Simon told me after reviewing a draft copy of <I>The Index 
of Economic Freedom</I> that it may well be the single most important publication ever published by 
The Heritage Foundation, surpassing even the best-selling <I>Mandate for Leadership</I> series which 
guided the Reagan Administration in the 1980s.

<TITLE>Preface</TITLE>
<H2> Preface</H2>
<HR SIZE=2>
<P> Despite the near total collapse of socialism around the world, most countries still do not have free 
economies.  This is the main conclusion of the<I> Index of Economic Freedom,</I> a comparative study 
of economic freedom in the world.  The authors of the <I>Index</I>, Bryan Johnson and Thomas Sheehy, 
have discovered that most rich countries are also the most economically free.  Conversely, their research 
shows that most poor countries have economies that are unfree.  Thus, economic freedom is a critical 
factor in the relative wealth of nations.  The more government interferes in the market, the more it 
hampers economic growth and lowers the standard of living of its citizens.
<P>	These issues, though subject to academic study, have never been addressed in such a 
comprehensive manner. Thus, this report should lay to rest once and for all doubts about whether 
economic freedom is integral to economic development.  As the conclusions of this study show, there 
can be no doubt that the more free an economy is, the higher the likelihood of economic development.   
<P>	The idea of creating an index of economic freedom has been long in the making.  Milton 
Friedman and other economists for years have explored ways to measure the relative economic freedom 
of countries around the globe.  Groundbreaking work was done by the Fraser Institute and others to build 
the academic foundation upon which an index could be built.  However, in the mid-1980s analysts at The 
Heritage Foundation began thinking about ways to create an index that would be useful to policymakers, 
particularly with respect to allocating levels of foreign aid.  We were looking for a "user friendly" version 
of the index that could unambiguously show policymakers and investors the positive relationship between 
economic freedom and wealth.   
<P>	Thus was born The Heritage Foundation's<I> Index of Economic Freedom</I>, the first study of 
its kind.  It measures the economic freedom of over 100 countries according to the most important 
economic factors determining economic freedom, such as taxes, tariffs, and protection of private 
property.  Not all economic factors could or even should be examined.  Our task was to find accurate data 
for the most important factors, and then to provide the most comprehensive and accurate comparison 
possible. That is what the authors of the<I> Index</I> have done.  Avoiding paralyzing academic debates, 
the authors focus on what is known, and not on what can never be known.  The result is the most accurate 
snap-shot possible of how the countries of the world measure up to the standards of economic freedom.
<P>	There will be many uses for the <I>Index</I>.  Policymakers will find it helpful in determining 
whether Third World countries should be receiving foreign aid; that is, whether it will be squandered in 
economically unfree countries. They can discover that the main cause of poverty around the world is not 
the failure of rich countries to spread the wealth through foreign aid programs, but the misguided 
economic policies of developing countries themselves.  They also will find a paradox: The countries that 
appear to most need U.S. aid are the ones that least deserve it because their government-controlled 
economies will misuse the money.  By the same token, the countries that are least likely to squander U.S. 
aid because they have free economies are the countries that least need it.  Either way, there seems to be 
less of a need for so-called development aid.  The key to economic prosperity in the developing world is 
not foreign aid, but economic freedom.
<P>	Investors should find the<I> Index</I> to be useful as well.  While many countries are 
encouraging foreign investment through privatization and other means, and have more open economies 
than they did a few years ago, the report shows that the countries' economic "fundamentals" can be more 
important to investors than the strengths or weaknesses of particular companies or business sectors.  
These fundamentals include tax rates, the stability of the currency, trade policy, private property rights, 
and other factors considered by the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I>.
<P>	The<I> Index</I> should be a first stop for any investor who wishes to explore economic 
opportunities in a particular country or region. With the<I> Index</I>, economic trends can be discerned 
and regional comparisons can be made. While investment decisions always require in-depth and hands-on 
research by the companies themselves, the <I>Index</I> can be used as a starting point of research, 
particularly regarding investment decisions in developing countries.
<P>	Finally, the study should be an indispensable source of primary data and bibliographical 
references on the world's economies.  The authors use the most up-to-date information available.  They 
also have assembled an impressive bibliography that not only attests to the depth of their research, but can 
point other researchers in the right direction in their work.
<P>	Future editions of the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I> will enable readers to compare 
countries over time. Thus, trends in economic freedom will be established, which should be particularly 
useful to policymakers who are concerned with assessing the impact of foreign aid.
<P>	This report is a tremendously important undertaking of which I and the rest of the Heritage staff 
are justly proud.  It should show, once and for all, that economic freedom is no less important than 
political freedom.  As a human right which governments should be bound to protect, if for no other reason 
than concern for the general welfare of its citizens, economic freedom is a critically important key to the 
well-being of people.  It can be a measure not only of how free a person is, but of how rich or poor.  This 
is a powerful, even revolutionary idea.  If applied around the world, it could transform the world's 
economy.   It is in the hope that this report will contribute to that end that I present The Heritage 
Foundation's <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I>.

<H2> Acknowledgments</H2>
<HR SIZE=2>
<P>	We would like to express our appreciation to several individuals who helped to make the 
<I>Index of Economic Freedom</I> possible.  We thank Dr. Kim R. Holmes, Vice President and 
Director of Foreign and Defense Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation, who edited the study, 
and Larry Di Rita, his Deputy, for providing invaluable assistance and support for the project.  
Richard Odermatt and Tom Timmons bore the brunt of the<I> Index's</I> considerable 
production work.  Their good cheer was most welcome.  Rob Chase of the Foreign and Defense 
Policy Studies staff was extremely helpful with managing data.  Dr. Edward L. Hudgins, now of the 
Cato Institute, deserves credit for laying much of the foundation of the <I>Index</I> several years 
ago while serving as Director of the Center for International Economic Growth at The Heritage 
Foundation. 
<P>	Countless individuals serving with various accounting firms, businesses, research organizations, 
U.S. government agencies, embassies in Washington, and other organizations cooperated in providing us 
with data.  Their assistance, which so often went beyond our expectations, is much appreciated.  
<P>	The contribution of two individuals deserves special attention.  Christian Asis and Rebecca 
Schaefer, participants in The Heritage Foundation's summer internship program, were indispensable to the 
development of the <I>Index</I>.  It was Christian and Becky who did the legwork, tracking down data 
while exercising excellent judgment in the process.  Their unfailing good spirit and commitment were 
exceptional.
<P>	We would like to thank the Fraser Institute of Vancouver and the many scholars who have 
participated in its Rating Economic Freedom Project for doing groundbreaking work on measuring 
economic freedom.<FONT SIZE="-2">(1)</FONT>  
<P>	Finally, we are grateful for the advice and criticism from the experts who reviewed this study. 
Richard V. Allen, Dr. James B. Burnham, Dr. Stuart M. Butler, Nicholas Eberstadt, Dr. Leonid Grigoryev, 
Dr. Henry R. Nau, Thomas L. Rhodes, Dr. Gerald W. Scully, and Hon. William E. Simon all helped to 
make this a better book.
<P>	Of course, we alone bear responsibility for the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I>.  Therefore, 
any shortcomings belong to us.

<TITLE> Executive Summary </TITLE> 
<H2> Executive Summary</H2> 
<HR SIZE=2>
<P>	The idea of producing a "user-friendly" Index of Economic Freedom for policymakers was born at  The Heritage Foundation in 1989.  The purpose then, as it remains today, was to develop an index that 
measures the extent of economic freedom in countries around the world.  To this end a set of objective 
economic criteria has been established to grade over 100 countries. While there are many theories about the origins and causes of economic development, the findings of this study are conclusive: those countries with the most economic freedom have higher rates of economic development than those with less economic freedom.
<P>	The Index of Economic Freedom measures how well these countries score on a list of ten economic factors.  The higher the score, the more government interference in the economy (hence, the less economic freedom there is). The factors are: 
<UL><B>
1. Trade Policy<BR>
2. Taxation Policy<BR>
3. Government Consumption of Economic Output<BR>
4. Monetary Policy<BR>
5. Capital Flows and Foreign Investment<BR>
6. Banking Policy<BR>
7. Wage and Price Controls<BR>
8. Property Rights<BR>
9. Regulation<BR>
10. Black Market<BR>
</UL></B>
<P>	The study demonstrates unequivocally that countries with the highest level of economic freedom (the lowest Index score) also have the highest living standards (see following chart).  Likewise, countries that have the least amount of economic freedom (the highest Index score) have the lowest living standards.
<P>	A comparison of the Index scores also demonstrates an interesting phenomenon: wealthy and 
economically free countries tend over time to reintroduce restrictions on economic freedom (see chart). As they become wealthy, countries begin adding welfare and other social programs that were not affordable when they were poorer. Thus, after they have become economically "liberated," countries like Germany, Sweden, and even the United States tend to fall back down the scale of economic freedom, getting worse scores than newly emerging free economies like Hong Kong or Singapore. These "Asian tigers" are still growing and developing and have not yet begun to restrict their economies with post-industrial welfare and environmental policies. This phenomenon, when displayed graphically, is called the Curve of Economic Freedom. It shows that economic freedom can rise and fall and that the seeds of destruction can exist in the fruits of success.
<P>	Another conclusion of this report concerns how fast developing countries with free economies grow. The data and scoring show that developing countries that pursued economic liberalization quickly became the richest in the world. Conversely, developing countries that did not pursue economic liberalization remained poor (see chart). Clearly, the path to prosperity is paved by economic liberalization and maximized economic freedom. This is a lesson which all developing countries should learn.
<P>	For example, Hong Kong and Singapore have the highest amount of economic freedom in the world.  In these countries consumers and businesses are free from most government intrusion.  Their economies are based on the mutual consent of individuals to buy, sell, and dispose of property as they see fit.  As a result, they have had extremely high levels of economic growth. Between 1980 and 1991, Hong Kong's gross national product grew at an average rate of 5.6 percent, while Singapore's economy grew at an average rate of 5.3 percent over the same period. While their economic wealth is less than that of some industrial democracies, Singapore's and Hong Kong's economies are catching up quickly with the Western world.  These countries someday may even surpass the U.S. and Germany in per capita GDP if current trends continue.
<P>	In contrast, countries like Angola, Bangladesh, and Haiti have the least amount of economic growth.  These countries have done little to unleash the entrepreneurial forces in their economies.  Instead, they have followed the self-destructive path of central government control and state intervention in the economy.  As a result, they are among the world's poorest nations. Other countries scored poorly as well, such as the newly formed independent republics of Belarus, Moldova, and Ukraine.  Their problems stem from slow progress toward free market reforms.  Their economic problems are the worst in the former Soviet Union. 
<P>	Former Marxist countries which have made rapid progress toward maximizing economic freedom are doing relatively well: the Czech Republic and Estonia, for example, score well on the Index.  The Czech Republic has halted an economic decline. It probably will have a respectable growth rate of 3 percent in 1994.  The Bank of Estonia estimates the GDP growth will be in the 3 percent to 5 percent range in 1994.  These countries have managed to begin the process used by Hong Kong and Singapore to promote large economic growth rates by maximizing economic freedom.
<P>	Above all, these findings disprove the assertion that economic growth can be bought by huge transfers of wealth from the industrialized economies to the less developed world.  People in Angola, Mozambique, Haiti, and Ukraine are not poor because wealthy people in the West do not share their riches.  They are poor because their governments pursue destructive economic policies that depress free enterprise.  Only when poor countries increase the economic freedom of their citizens and unleash the phenomenal power of the free market will true prosperity come to the poor nations of the world. Anything short of this is not only economically unwise, but inhumane.

<H3>Why an Index of Economic Freedom?</H3>
<HR SIZE=3>
<P>	The U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) for years has been giving aid to 
developing countries whose economies are over-regulated, protected by trade barriers, and state-
controlled. Nevertheless, despite billions of dollars of U.S. development aid, most of these countries 
are still poor. The reason is simple: their governments have done little to promote economic 
freedom. Quite simply, the recipient countries are destroying their own economies.  Not only has 
U.S. development aid been wasted, it has actually retarded economic development in the countries 
that receive it. Not one country receiving foreign aid has succeeded in developing sustained 
economic growth.
<P>	It should be no surprise that U.S. aid has done so little to bring about global economic growth. 
The experience of the past three decades shows that economic policy, not aid, is the main factor in 
moving from the ranks of developing to middle and high income countries. For example, the economies 
of Hong Kong and Singapore, two of the "Asian Tigers," expanded their gross domestic product by a rate 
of 6 percent each year between 1960 and 1985.  During this period of rapid development, neither Hong 
Kong nor Singapore received significant amounts of development aid.
<P>	Indeed, these and other Asian countries would not have grown so much if the crutch of foreign 
aid had been available.  If Hong Kong had been flooded with aid, as was Tanzania, it probably would be 
closer to Tanzania's status as the world's second poorest country.  In reality, Hong Kong is one of the 
world's most dynamic economies, growing at an average annual rate of 5.6 percent from 1980 to 1991. 
<P>	The potentially perverse effect of development can be seen in the recent history of Chile. In 
1973, Chile was the world's second largest recipient of foreign aid.  It also had a stagnating economy. 
Under the leadership of Marxist President Salvador Allende, Chile's GDP shrank 5.6 percent in 1973.  As 
with many Latin American countries, the government controlled a large part of the Chilean economy, 
estimated to be around 75 percent of the GDP.
<P>	However, by 1990, Chile's economy changed dramatically.  General Augusto Pinochet launched 
a market reform program that drastically cut back on government intervention in the economy. The 
Chilean government controlled only 25 percent of the economy after Pinochet's privatization program 
was largely complete. As a result, Chile has developed one of the fastest growing economies in the world.  
A GDP growth rate averaging 7.3 percent per year since 1988 has dramatically improved the lives of the 
Chilean people. For example, the infant mortality rate has been reduced as life expectancy has gone up.
<P>	It was with this understanding of economic development in mind that the authors undertook to 
measure the relative economic freedom of most countries in the world. The <I>Index of Economic 
Freedom</I> represents an excellent tool for deciding how best to allocate development aid.  Using it 
would help to ensure that foreign aid is not sent to countries that repress economic freedom and have no 
chance of growing economically.  Countries scoring well or improving on the<I> Index</I> would be 
eligible for development aid if they were using the money in constructive ways--i.e., to help construct the 
building blocks of a free market economy. However, using aid to pay for building stock markets, a banking 
system, and other elements of a free market will always be dwarfed in importance when compared to the 
economic policy decisions of the host country. The greatest advantage of the Index is to ensure that U.S. 
development aid does no harm and is not wasted on countries that demonstrate no commitment to 
economic reform.
<P>	The<I> Index of Economic Freedom</I> is not a tool for deciding whether or not to dispense 
humanitarian aid or to promise aid for reasons of national security. A foreign country's economic 
policies have always been and undoubtedly will continue to be irrelevant when deciding whether to offer 
relief to people suffering from hurricanes, earthquakes, and other natural disasters. Moreover, for reasons 
of national security, the U.S. should continue providing foreign aid when necessary to bolster allies 
abroad.
<P>	There is yet another use for the <I>Index</I>.  Investors around the world would benefit from 
knowing  how well countries score on the "fundamentals" of economic freedom.  Although the<I> 
Index</I> would be of  little use in judging the advisability of specific investments or in discerning the 
relative strength of specific business sectors, it could be useful in understanding the overall economic 
environment inside a country and whether the economic trends are favorable to future investments.  
Moreover, the <I>Index</I> would be more useful as a starting place in judging investment opportunities 
in underdeveloped countries than in the advanced democracies.  The relative economic performances of 
underdeveloped countries tend to be less known than those of Western nations.  And perhaps more 
important, an understanding of the economic "fundamentals" would be more important in assessing risk 
for the lesser developed nations.   The economies of poorer countries tend to be unpredictable and 
difficult for investors to understand.  The <I>Index</I> should help them to improve their understanding.

<P>	The U.S. will spend over $13 billion on foreign aid in 1994.  This brings total U.S. bilateral aid      
since 1946 to close to half a trillion dollars.  Of the $13 billion spent in 1994, AID will distribute $2.4      
billion in bilateral economic assistance directly to specific countries.  In addition, the U.S. will give almost a billion dollars in economic support to the former Soviet Union, $1.9 billion through international financial institutions including the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, and $2.4 billion in Economic Support Funds (ESF), which are used to advance U.S. political and security interests.

<H3>Where We Are Going in Foreign Aid</H3>  
<HR SIZE=3>  
<P>	The Clinton Administration in 1994 made a bid to reform foreign aid. After countless   
commissions and blue ribbon panels over the years, President Clinton introduced the Peace,   
Prosperity, and Democracy Act of 1994 (PPDA).  Many thought this would be the year in which   
the foreign aid program would finally be revamped.  
<P>	This, however, was not to be. The Clinton foreign aid reform plan ran out of steam, falling prey to   
politics and other priorities. The Senate Democratic leadership was unwilling to devote the floor time that   
the PPDA required. The reason: doing so would have given Clinton critics a stage for complaints against   
the President's foreign policy. Senate Democrats also were hesitant to direct congressional attention   
away from the health care debate.  Thus, the PPDA never made it to the floor for a vote.  
<P>	The PPDA was a weak attempt to reform foreign aid. It failed to address one of the fundamental   
problems of development aid: how best to use foreign aid to advance economic freedom and, as a result,   
spur economic development. <FONT SIZE="-2">(1)</FONT>   The central idea of the Clinton reform  
plan was something called   
"sustainable development." In this idea, the state manages the economy, trying to create "sustainable"   
economic growth without harming the environment or unleashing a "population explosion." But the results   
of this approach will be the exact opposite of the free market-driven growth the Administration claims to   
champion. By increasing government intervention in the economy--with intrusive environmental   
regulations and industrial policies--the Clinton plan will only strangle economic growth.  
<P>	The battle over reforming foreign aid is by no means over. AID Administrator J. Brian Atwood   
believes that the U.S. foreign aid program must be reformed or face budget cuts by skeptical legislators.   
But for foreign aid reform to succeed, more will have to be done than pouring old wine into new bottles,   
as the Clinton Administration has done. The greatest weakness of the Clinton approach is that it continues   
to give aid to countries that waste it.  Moreover, the programming emphasis of the Administration is   
wrong, focusing largely on population control and environmental protection efforts, not on economic   
growth.  Unless the purpose of U.S. development aid is to spur free market-reforms and economic   
growth, it will only prop up failing economies, doing more harm than good.  
<P>	The Index of Economic Freedom is the ideal mechanism for judging which countries should   
receive foreign aid. This was the conclusion of George M. Ferris, Jr., Chairman of the President's   
Commission on the Management of Aid Programs (1992), who urged AID to establish an Index of   
Economic Freedom for the purpose of allocating development aid among countries. Representative   
Robert Livingston, then ranking minority member of the House Appropriations Foreign Operations   
<P>Subcommittee, stated on the House floor last spring that the Republican Party should "expand on [the   
Index of Economic Freedom] and ultimately adopt it in our foreign aid program."<FONT SIZE="-2"> 
(2)</FONT>    
<P>	The Index of Economic Freedom, rooted in the recognition that free markets are the only means   
toward development, should be the foundation of U.S. foreign aid reform legislation. By using the Index,   
policymakers can identify which countries are making progress toward free market reforms and which   
ones are not. Countries reforming their economies could use specially targeted aid to help build market   
institutions. Aid also could provide leverage in persuading developing countries to make market reforms.   
While it may be true that reforming countries over time will have less need for foreign aid, temporary   
assistance can help jump start the process of reform. The ultimate and ideal goal, however, should be to   
end dependence on aid altogether. It is with this goal in mind that the Index of Economic Freedom was   
developed.

<H3>Factors of the Index of Economic Freedom</H3>   
<HR SIZE=3>  
<P>	There are many factors that could be used to determine how much economic freedom    
exists in a country.  Economic relations between individuals are restricted to a varying degree by    
government intervention.  By looking at such economic factors as taxes, international trade, and    
banking, the extent to which economic freedom is encouraged or hindered can be discerned.    
</P>










<P><UL>
<B>Factors of the Index of Economic Freedom</B><BR>
1. Trade Policy<BR>
2. Taxation Policy<BR>
3. Government Consumption of Economic Output<BR>
4. Monetary Policy<BR>
5. Capital Flows and Foreign Investment<BR>
 6. Banking Policy<BR>
7. Wage and Price Controls<BR>
8. Property Rights<BR>
9. Regulation Policy<BR>
10. Black Market</UL>

<P><B>The Grading Scale.</B> Under each factor is a grading scale.  The scale runs from 1 to 5 with    
1 being the most free and 5 the least free. After each score is either a "-," "+," or "stable" mark.  These    
indicate whether a country is getting worse, better, or staying the same, respectively, in each category.   
<P>	Countries were ranked according to four categories of economic freedom.  Countries receiving    
an Index score of 1.99 or less are considered to have economies that are "free."  Countries scoring    
between 2.00 and 2.99 have economies that are "mostly free."  For scores of between 3.00 and 3.99,    
economies were ranked as "mostly not free."  And economies that obtained a score of 4.00 and above are    
"repressed."   
<P><B>The Sources.</B> In grading the countries, the most recent available information and statistical    
data were used. Where primary sources were not available, secondary sources were used. These cases are    
footnoted accordingly. In each section, a general list of sources is provided for each country. Unless    
otherwise footnoted, these are the main sources used to grade each of the countries.  A general    
bibliography appears at the end of the study.   
<P><B>	Choosing Which Countries to Score.</B> One of the prime motives for developing    
the Index of Economic Freedom is to provide policy makers with a guide for dispensing aid among    
countries. Thus, this edition of the Index rates most current or traditional recipients of significant ($5    
million annually) amounts of U.S. foreign aid.  Some countries, such as Rwanda, Somalia, and Zaire, were    
omitted mainly because reliable data to score their economies were not available. However, this poses no    
significant problem because U.S. aid to these countries is strictly humanitarian; by no measure is it    
contributing to sustained economic growth. Some major industrial and trading countries are included,    
largely for a point of comparison. As the results demonstrate, the respect these countries show for    
economic freedom generally stands in stark contrast to that of countries of the developing world.    
Additionally, a few countries of strategic importance to the U.S., including Mexico and China, were    
included. Future editions of <I>The Index of Economic Freedom</I> might consider even more than the    
current 101 countries.   
<H3>THE FACTORS<BR>   
Factor #1: Trade Policy.<FONT SIZE="-3">[1]</FONT> </H3>      
<P>	Trade policy is a key factor in measuring economic freedom. The degree to which a government    
hinders the free flow of foreign commerce has a direct bearing on economic growth. Trade policy, in fact,    
is a key factor in industrialization of developing economies. <FONT SIZE="-2">[2]</FONT>     
International trade enables a country's    
industries to maximize production by allowing them to import raw materials and foreign goods and    
services that are cheaper than those produced at home. It can also offer a country greater access to a large    
world market, which can be the source of much wealth.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B> The average tariff rate is used to score a country's trade policy. A    
score of 1 through 5 is given based on a country's tariff rate--the higher the tariff rate, the worse the    
score. Sources to determine the average tariff rate were derived from reports issued by the General    
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  When the average    
tariff rate was not available in these sources, the authors determined the average rate by calculating the    
revenue raised from tariffs and duties as a percentage of total imports. Most of the average tariff rates are    
valid for 1992. In some cases, adequate average tariff rate figures do not exist.  In these cases, the authors    
used publications from the United States Trade Representative's office, the Commerce Department, and    
the State Department. These instances are footnoted. <FONT SIZE="-2">[3]</FONT>  Such non-tariff   
barriers as trade quotas, overly    
strict licensing, or import inspections also were examined. If they existed in sufficient quantity, a    
country's score based solely on tariff rates was moved one point higher on the scale, representing    
decreased economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Example:</B> The U.S. has an average tariff rate of 3.6 percent.  Based on a scale    
measuring tariffs alone, it would be given a score of 1.  However, because the U.S. maintains non-tariff    
barriers, such as import quotas on textiles and sugar, it was given a total score of 2.

<H3>Factor #2: Taxation. <FONT SIZE="-3">[4]</FONT> </H3>      
<P>	Taxes are a key factor in measuring economic freedom. While every country taxes economic    
activity to pay for national defense, public health, and other vital government services, too much taxation    
stifles individual entrepreneurship. A tax is essentially a government-imposed disincentive to perform the    
activity being taxed. For this reason, exorbitant taxes slow economic growth. When analyzing this factor,    
taxes on corporate profits, income, and other significant activities are measured.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B> Two types of taxation are scored: income taxes and corporate    
taxes.  Each country was first scored based on these two major types of taxation, which many economists    
agree have the most negative economic impact on individuals.  These scores were then averaged to get a    
single taxation score.  Then, other taxes such as value-added taxes, sales taxes, and state and local taxes    
also were examined. If they existed in sufficient quantity, a country's taxation score was moved one-half    
point higher on the scale, representing decreased economic freedom.  This one-half point increase    
represents the relative impact of these other taxes on individual freedom.   
<H3>	1) Income taxes.</H3>    
<P>	Some countries have relatively high top income tax rates, but they apply to very few people. For    
example, Japan has a top income tax rate of 50 percent, but it is levied on such large amounts of income    
that very few people fall into this high tax bracket. The tax rate that applies to the average Japanese    
taxpayer is much lower.  Thus, to more accurately measure taxation policy, it is necessary to examine not    
only the top income tax rate, but the rate that applies to the average taxpayer.   
<P>	To discover the average income tax rate, a country's total gross domestic product was divided by    
total population. This per capita income figure was then used to determine which tax rate applies to the    
average income level. <FONT SIZE="-2">[5]</FONT>  Once this was done, each country was scored on   
1) the top tax rate and 2) the    
tax rate that applies to average income.   
<P><B>	Example:</B>  Japan has a top income tax rate of 50 percent.  But the 50 percent tax    
bracket applies to income levels that equal about $180,000, which is more than nine times the per capita    
GDP level, which is around $19,000.  The tax level that applies to that amount is 20 percent.  Thus, based    
on the tax scale, Japan would receive an income tax score of 4.   
<H3>	Income Tax Grading Scale  </H3>   
<P>This scale lists a score from 1 through 5. The higher the score, the higher the tax rate. The highest    
level for which a country qualifies is the score that the country receives.

</PRE>

<H3>	2) Corporate taxes. </H3>   
<P>	The second type of tax analyzed is the corporate tax. Each country is scored according to a    
sliding scale based on corporate tax rates.    
<P><B>	Example:</B> Japan has a top corporate tax rate of 37.5 percent. Thus, based on the    
corporate tax rate scale, Japan receives a score of 4.  Japan's overall tax score average is a 4.  But Japan    
maintains additional taxes in the form of a 37.5 capital gains tax, a 3 percent consumption tax, a 17.3    
percent to 20.7 percent local inhabitant tax, and a 14.6 percent social contributions tax.  Thus, Japan    
moves from a 4 to a 4.5.

<H3>Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output. <FONT SIZE="-3">[6]</FONT>     
</H3>   
<P>	The greater the degree to which the government intrudes in the economy, the less individuals are    
free to engage in their own economic activities. By taking government consumption as a percentage of    
gross domestic product, the level of government consumption of economic output can be determined. The    
higher the rate of government consumption as a percentage of gross domestic product, the higher the    
Index score, and hence the lower the economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B> Measuring a country's government consumption as a percentage of    
GDP reveals only an approximation of the government's role in the economy. <FONT SIZE="-2">  
[7]</FONT>  In the U.S., for    
example, the federal budget is about 24 percent of GDP.  This figure includes servicing the federal budget    
deficit and transfer payments through entitlements like Medicaid. Other government consumption figures    
for most less developed countries do not include funds spent on servicing the budget deficit and some    
transfer payments. While using government consumption figures probably understates the total    
government intervention in the economy, it is a useful tool and starting point for gauging the degree of    
government intervention in the economy.   
<P>	The next step in scoring a country on government consumption is to determine the size of the    
state-owned sector of the economy. If  a large portion of a country's GDP is produced by the state-owned    
sector, it was moved one point higher on the scale, representing decreased economic freedom.    
<P><B>	Example:</B>  Russia has a government consumption as a percentage of GDP figure    
of about 22 percent.  This would give Russia a score of 2 because the government consumption figure is    
between 11 percent and 25 percent. However, state-owned enterprises account for a majority of industrial    
production.  Thus, Russia gets a final score of 3, one point higher.

5	Very high 		46 percent or above of GDP.  

</PRE>

<H3>Factor #4: Monetary Policy. <FONT SIZE="-3">[8]</FONT>  </H3>   
<P>	The value of a country's currency is based largely on the government's monetary policy. If a    
government maintains a "tight" monetary policy, meaning the supply of currency does not exceed demand,    
individuals have the economic freedom to engage in productive and profitable economic activities.  If the    
government maintains a "loose" monetary policy, meaning it supplies more money than demand requires,    
money loses its value and individuals are less free to engage in productive and profitable economic    
activities.  The best way to measure monetary policy is to analyze a country's inflation rate over a period    
of time. The inflation rate is directly linked to the government's ability to manage the supply of money in    
the economy.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B> The average inflation rate was the main criterion for this factor.    
The inflation rate is the best measure of how a country manages its money supply.  Countries with high    
inflation rates have a loose monetary policy and are graded higher because they have less economic    
freedom than countries with lower inflation rates. Countries with a low inflation rate have a tight    
monetary policy and are graded lower because they have more economic freedom.  Countries of the    
former Soviet Union pose a unique problem in determining average inflation rates.  Due to the fact that    
these countries had command economies, annual inflation rate averages from 1980 to 1991 are    
misleading.  Without a market-based system, prices can be held constant because they are controlled by    
the state.  Therefore, countries of the former Soviet Union are graded solely based on 1992 or 1993    
inflation figures.  While these figures are high, especially due to their transformation to a market-based    
system, they are more accurate reflections of the conditions of today than are figures from the Soviet era.   
<P><B>	Example:</B>  Japan keeps a tight control over its money supply, and low inflation    
rates are the result. Japan's government has done this by maintaining a supply of yen consistent with the    
domestic demand for the currency.  In addition, Japan has very high savings rates. This supplies the    
financial system with yen that banks and other institutions lend to borrowers. As a result of a tight    
monetary policy, Japan maintained a very low average annual inflation rate of 1.5 percent from 1980 to    
1991. Because of its low inflation rate, Japan receives the lowest score of 1.

<H3>Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment Policy. <FONT SIZE="-2">[9]</FONT>  </H3>   
<P>	Foreign investment funds economic expansion. Investors from abroad supply capital to domestic    
investors who then start or expand their businesses. Restrictions on foreign investment hamper economic    
freedom and thus limit the inflow of foreign capital. By contrast, few or no restrictions on foreign    
investment maximize economic freedom and thus increase the flow of investments. For this category, the    
more restrictions a country imposes on foreign investment, the higher the score, and hence the lower the    
economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology.</B> A country's foreign investment policies were scrutinized in order    
to determine the overall investment climate. Among the specific questions asked: Are there foreign    
ownership limits placed on domestic industries? Is there an existing foreign investment code that defines    
the country's investment laws and procedures? Does the government encourage foreign investment by    
providing tax holidays or other incentives? Are foreign corporations treated under the law the same as    
domestic corporations? Are specific industries closed to foreign investment? These questions were    
answered to develop an overall description of the investment climate of the country being examined.     
Each country was graded based on its investment climate.   
<P><B>	Example:</B> Venezuela maintains restrictions on foreign investment.  Foreigners can    
own no more than 20 percent of a company engaged in one of the following industries: accounting,    
architecture, engineering, and insurance.  Foreign investment in oil, gas, coal, petroleum, automobiles,    
and iron ore is prohibited.  Finally, there are some employment restrictions.  On some investments, the    
workforce of a company with more than 10 employees must be 90 percent Venezuelan.  Thus, according    
to the criteria in the scale below, these restrictions are considered as moderately restrictive. Venezuela is    
given a score of 3 because there are restrictions on investment, but government policy at least conforms    
to established foreign investment codes.

<H3>Factor #6: Banking. <FONT SIZE="-3">[10]</FONT>   </H3>   
<P>	In most countries, banks provide the economy with the financial means to operate.  They lend    
money to start businesses, provide services such as real estate, insurance, and securities investments, and    
furnish a safe place for individuals to store their earnings.  The more government controls banks, the less    
they are free to engage in these activities. The consequence of heavy regulation of banks is restricted    
economic freedom. Therefore, the more a government restricts its banking sector, the higher the Index    
score it receives, and hence the lower the economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology.</B> This factor is measured by determining the openness of a country's    
banking system. Among the questions asked: Are foreign banks able to operate freely?  How difficult is it    
to open domestic banks?  How heavily regulated is the banking system?  Are banks free to provide    
customers with insurance, sell real estate, and invest in securities?  The answers to these questions were    
used to develop a description of the country's banking climate.  The Index represents a sliding scale that    
measures the relative openness of a country's banking system.   
<P>	Example: The U.S. banking system is minimally regulated.  However, it maintains federal    
deposit insurance and interstate banking regulations.  Based on the scale below, the U.S. receives a 2    
score, which means that restrictions on banks are considered to be low.

<H3>Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls. <FONT SIZE="-3">[11]</FONT>  </H3>   
<P>	A free economy is one that allows individuals to set not only the prices on the goods and services    
they sell, but also the wages they pay to the workers they employ.  Some governments mandate wage and    
price controls. By doing so, they restrict economic activity, and thus curtail economic freedom.    
Therefore, the more a government intervenes and controls prices and wages, the higher the Index score    
and the lower the economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B>  This factor is measured by how much a country lets the market or    
the government set wages and prices. Among specific questions asked: Are there any products whose    
prices are set by the government?  If so, which products?  Does the government affect prices by    
controlling such things as utilities?  Does the government have a minimum wage policy?  Are other wages    
set by the government? A sliding scale is developed to measure the relative degree of government control    
over wages and prices. A 1 or "very low" score represents wages and prices being set completely by the    
market, whereas at the other end of the scale, a "very high" score of 5 means that wages and prices are set    
completely by the government.   
<P><B>	Example:</B>  In Hong Kong, all wages and prices are determined by the market. Thus,    
it receives a score of 1. By contrast, in Cuba, wages and prices are set by the government. Therefore, it    
receives a score of 5.

<H3>Factor #8: Property Rights. <FONT SIZE="-3">[12]</FONT>  </H3>   
<P>	The accumulation of private property is the main motivating force in a market economy.  This    
factor examines the extent to which private property is protected by the government and how safe it is    
from expropriation.  The less protection private property receives, the higher the score, and hence the    
lower the economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B> The degree to which private property is a guaranteed right is    
measured. So, too, is the extent to which the government protects and enforces laws to protect private    
property. The probability that the state will expropriate private property also is examined. The less legal    
protection of private property, the higher the score.  The higher the chance of government expropriation    
of private property, the higher the score.   
<P><B>	Example:</B> The U.S. economic system is based entirely on people's right to    
accumulate property. America's legal system is one of the best in the world. It allows people to use the    
court system for disputes over property and to enforce contracts. Thus, based on the scale below, the U.S.    
would receive a very low score of 1, meaning that the level of protection for private property is "very    
high."

<H3>Factor #9: Regulation. <FONT SIZE="-3">[13]</FONT>  </H3>     
<P>	In many less developed economies, obtaining a business license to sell a good or service is    
nearly impossible.  With so many hoops for the entrepreneur to jump through, it is very difficult to create    
new businesses. In some cases, government officials frown upon private sector initiative and it may even    
be illegal. While there are many regulations that hinder business, the most important ones are those    
associated with licensing new companies and businesses.  In some countries, like the U.S., obtaining a    
business license is as simple as mailing in a registration form with a minimal fee.  In others, especially in    
Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South America, obtaining a business license requires endless trips to a    
government building and countless bribes, and may take up to a year.    
<P>	Once a business is open, that is not necessarily the end of government regulation.  In some cases,    
it is just the beginning.  Some countries apply their regulations haphazardly.  For example, an    
environmental regulation may be used to shut down one business while another is not penalized. Business    
owners become confused over which regulations must be obeyed. Moreover, the existence of many    
regulations can cause corruption as confused and harassed business owners try to work around the red    
tape.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B>  The purpose is to measure how easy or difficult it is to open a    
business.  The more regulations on business, the harder it is to open.  In addition, the degree of corruption    
was examined, as was whether the regulations are applied uniformly to all businesses. Another factor was    
whether the country has any state planning agencies that set production limits and quotas. The scale was    
established by listing a set of conditions for each of the five possible scores.  These conditions include    
such items as the extent of government corruption, the uniformity of the regulations' applications, and the    
extent to which the regulations pose a burden on business. At one end of the scale is the 1 score of very    
low levels of regulation, where corruption is nonexistent and regulations are minimal and uniformly    
applied. At the other end of the scale is the "very high" score of 5, where corruption is rampant,    
regulations are applied randomly, and the general level of regulation is very high. A country need only    
meet a majority of the conditions in each score for it to receive that score.   
<P><B>	Example:</B>  Obtaining a business license in Hong Kong is very easy.  In some cases,    
one can even be obtained by mail. Hong Kong's regulation system is corruption-free, not a burden to    
business, and is applied uniformly throughout the country. Thus, Hong Kong receives a 1.

<H3>Factor #10: Black Market. </H3>   
<P>	Black markets are a direct result of government intervention in the market. In fact, a black market    
activity is one that the government has outlawed.  The larger the black market is in a country, the lower the    
economic freedom.  The smaller the black market, the higher the economic freedom.  This factor    
considers the size of a country's black market as a percentage of GDP.  The higher the percentage, the    
higher the score and the lower the economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology.</B> Information available on the size of black markets in less    
developed countries is extremely scarce. Nevertheless, estimates can be made on the size of black market    
activities by answering several questions. For example, does the country have a large smuggling market?     
If so, this could be an indication that the government imposes too many restrictions on foreign imports.    
Do consumers need to turn to the black market to buy such items as televisions and video-cassette    
recorders?  If so, this could be an indication that these products cannot be bought in stores legally or that    
their prices are too high because of very high tariffs. Are there large numbers of workers who work    
illegally?  If so, this could be an indication that the economy is overly regulated and that labor must be    
supplied by the black market.   
<P>	The existence or absence of these and other activities was used to estimate the size of the black    
market as a percentage of gross domestic product.  In cases where black market information exists for    
specific countries, it is noted. At one end of the scale is the score of 1, where the black market    
constitutes less than 10 percent of GDP. At the other end is the score of 5, where the black market makes    
up 30 percent or more of GDP.   
<P><B>	Example:</B> In Peru, almost 30 percent of the GDP consists of such black market    
activities as labor and food. Other black market activities are outlawed in many cases. Peru receives the    
highest score of 5.

<H2>The Countries</H2>
<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	This section is a compilation of countries, each graded in all ten factors of the Index of 
Economic Freedom. Each country receives a 1 through 5 score for all ten factors. Those scores are then 
averaged to get a final Index of Economic Freedom score. Countries with a score between 1 and 2 have 
the freest economies. Countries with a score around 3 are less free. Countries with a score near 4 are 
over-regulated and need significant economic reforms to achieve even the most basic increases in 
economic growth. Countries with a 5 score are the most economically oppressive nations in the world.

<H2>Conclusion </H2>
<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	This study demonstrates that the countries with free economic systems enjoy the highest 
degree of economic development.  Likewise, the countries with the least amount of economic 
freedom suffer from the lowest degree of economic development and are among the poorest 
countries on earth.  Throughout the world, free markets have driven development, while heavy 
government intervention has wrought nothing but economic disaster.
<P>	These conclusions are reflected in the scores of 101 countries examined in the <I>Index of 
Economic Freedom</I>. 7 countries were given  a "free" score, while 36 were found to be "mostly free." 
By contrast, 50 nations were "mostly not free," while 8 were deemed as "repressed." As these 
designations show, most of the countries in the world have economies that are not free. 
<P>	The <I>Index</I> demonstrates clearly the positive relationship between economic freedom and 
wealth. Five of the seven advanced industrial (G-7) democracies are among the ten countries whose Index 
score reflects the most economic freedom. By contrast, countries with unfree economies, such as Cuba, 
Mozambique, North Korea, and Vietnam, are among the world's poorest. Predictably Mozambique is 
indeed the world's poorest country.  While Mozambique's long running civil war, which ended in 1992, 
contributed to its poverty, there can be no doubt that Mozambique's long embrace of Marxism has been 
the major cause of its abysmal state of economic development.
<P>	<B>Asian Powerhouses. </B> Nor is it surprising that the Asian "Tigers"--Hong Kong, South 
Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan--are doing well economically. Two members of this enviable group, Hong 
Kong and Singapore, tie for the best score on the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I>.  Each country 
scored a 1.25, receiving identical scores in all but two categories.  Hong Kong edged out Singapore by 
having lower tax rates while Singapore scored better than Hong Kong on monetary policy.  These two 
countries are paragons of economic freedom.
<P>	When compared with growth rates in many African countries, the "Asian Tiger" success is indeed 
impressive.  By 1965, the Asian Tigers and most Sub-Saharan African nations had achieved independence 
from colonial nation states.  In that year, Sub-Saharan African countries like Gabon had equal to higher 
levels of per capita wealth than Asian Tiger countries like the Republic of China on Taiwan.  For example, 
in 1965, Gabon had a per capita GDP figure of $1,286. By contrast, Taiwan had a per capita GDP of 
$1,133.<FONT SIZE="-2">[1]</FONT>   By 1991, Gabon's per capita wealth had risen to only $3,448. By contrast, Taiwan's per capita GDP had climbed to  $9,805. <FONT SIZE="-2">[2]</FONT>
<P>	Since 1965 , Taiwan has received negligible amounts of development aid. Gabon has been flood-
ed with hundreds of millions of dollars of development aid--over $500 million in the past five years. The 
conclusion is inevitable: Taiwan flourished because it became economically free, while Gabon, awash in 
development aid, languished because it refused to steer a free market course.
<P>	Right behind Hong Kong and Singapore, finishing third overall in economic freedom, is Bahrain.  
This Middle Eastern country scored a 1.60. Despite Bahrain's state-owned oil industry it maintains one of 
the most open markets in the world with average tariff rates of around 3.3 percent.  It makes no use of 
non-tariff barriers such as trade quotas and voluntary export restraints.  It taxes neither income nor 
corporate profits. Because of tight monetary policies, Bahrain actually has achieved what economists call  
"negative inflation rates"--in other words, prices actually dropped in the 1980s.
<P>	Bahrain has few government-imposed prices or set wages, minimal restrictions on foreign 
investments, a limited bureaucracy that imposes scant regulations on businesses. Its black market is 
practically non-existent. In each of the categories where countries were ranked, Bahrain scored among the 
best.  Since Bahrain's independence in 1971, it has achieved a per capita GDP of $11,536,
<FONT SIZE="-2">[3]</FONT>  which makes it more wealthy than Ireland.
<P><B>	Nations Emerge from Communism. </B> The <I>Index </I>also sheds light on the 
different economic paths taken by former communist countries. Of the countries graded in this edition of 
the <I>Index, </I>the Czech Republic is ranked among the top 12 in the world with the highest levels of 
economic freedom.<FONT SIZE="-2">[4]</FONT>  Thus, the Czech Republic has the freest economy of all the former East Bloc 
countries. Right behind the Czech Republic is Estonia. Both Estonia and the Czech Republic have adopted 
low rates of taxation, eliminated abusive government regulations, and minimized state constraints on 
individual economic activity. The results are that the economies of these two countries are performing 
better than any other former socialist state.
<P>	Some of the more developed countries have less economic freedom than less prosperous, 
developing countries.  Sweden, for example, scored a relatively weak 2.65.  This score can be attributed to 
Sweden's high level of taxation and the heavy role its government plays in the economy.  Neverthe-less, 
Sweden is wealthier than Malaysia, which scores a 2.15.  Sweden has a per capita GDP amount of 
$17,490, while Malaysia has a per capita GDP figure of $7,400.<FONT SIZE="-2">[5]</FONT> 
<P> 	This finding may seem, at first glance, to invalidate the claim that economic freedom is the most 
important factor in stimulating economic development. However, this would be a misreading of the 
evidence. The Index of Economic Freedom is but a snapshot in time.  It measures economic freedom 
today.  There is no accounting for the economic history of Sweden, nor is Malaysia's past captured in its 
Index score. Sweden is richer than Malaysia, even though it is less free, because Sweden began 
industrialization long before Malaysia. Thus, it has had longer to develop and accumulate wealth. 
However, at present growth rates, it may not be long before Malaysia catches up with Sweden. Malaysia's 
economic growth exceeds Sweden's today, and Malaysia had an average growth rate of 5.6 percent from 
1980 to 1991.  Sweden had an average rate of growth for the same time of 2 percent.
<P><B>	The Curve of Economic Freedom. </B> This comparison of Sweden and Malaysia 
points to an important phenomenon discovered in this study: Long periods of economic growth resulting 
from high levels of economic freedom seem to create states that reverse course and place limits on 
economic freedom.  This is the Curve of Economic Freedom.  As the curve demonstrates, most countries 
with limited levels of economic freedom are grouped together with corresponding low levels of per 
capita wealth.  As some countries begin to reform their economies by establishing market-based systems 
that promote economic growth, per capita wealth increases.  However, once these countries reach a 
certain level of economic prosperity, as in the G-7 countries, they are tempted to regulate their 
economies, raise taxes, and add welfare programs, which results in less economic freedom and slower 
rates of economic growth.
<P>	The Curve of Economic Freedom helps to explain why economic growth rates have lagged lowed 
in the U.S. and Europe since the mid-1980s. Since that time, these countries has increased government 
spending, resulting in corresponding increases in taxation and regulation. If these trends continue, these 
countries will eventually suffer from dwindling economic growth and shrinking per capita wealth. 
<P><B>	Regions of Freedom. </B>North America, parts of Europe, and East Asia have the 
highest amounts of both economic freedom and per capita wealth.  Sub-Saharan Africa, Central America, 
and some republics of the former-Soviet Union are among the least economically free and poorest 
countries in the world.  Yet, while many countries in the developed world have rather high levels of 
economic freedom, many have reimposed restrictions on that freedom while many less developed 
countries have removed impediments to freedom and are beginning to catch up with the advanced 
industrial countries.
<P>	For example, some nations in Europe, mainly Germany, France, Italy, and even the United 
Kingdom to a lesser extent, have economic recessions.  Much of this is a result of increased government 
spending and interference in the economy.  The European Union, for example, will spend about 22 percent 
of its combined GDP on social welfare programs.  This is up from around 16 percent in 1989.  In 
Germany, government spending on social security and welfare now accounts for 49 percent of total 
government expenditures.  In the U.K., social spending is about 33 percent.
<P>	To fund social programs, these countries have raised tax rates to very high levels. Germany, Italy, 
and Japan have top income tax rates over 50 percent.  Britain has a top rate of 40 percent, while that of  
the U.S. is 39.6 percent.  Hong Kong, however, taxes income at a top rate of around 15 percent.  Other 
developing countries, like Estonia, have adopted relatively low top tax rates of 26 percent.
<P><B>	Foreign Aid Failures. </B> The <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I> scores 
represent a damning condemnation of the U.S. foreign aid program.  It is well known that many countries 
which have received the largest amount of economic assistance from the U.S., including India and 
Bangladesh, are also the world's poorest countries.  Sadly, many of these countries are only getting 
poorer, and most policy makers know that the U.S. foreign aid program is doing little or nothing to stop it. 
Indeed, this is why Brian Atwood, the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, is 
scrambling to "reinvent" his beleaguered agency.
<P>	It is troubling to learn that the large recipients of U.S. aid are also the countries with the least 
amount of economic freedom.  India, for example, scored a 3.70 and Bangladesh scored even worse at 
3.90.  The dearth of economic freedom permitted in these countries has produced nothing but economic 
misery.  It is tragic that this disastrous course has been subsidized by U.S. foreign aid. 
<P>	The record is particularly damning in Africa. The west African country of Ghana scores a poor 
3.20. Nevertheless, Ghana is the "star" of the international donor community, receiving nearly $1 billion 
in development aid each year. The three Sub-Saharan countries, Swaziland, Uganda, and South Africa, have 
the greatest degree of economic freedom, scoring 2.90, 2.94, and 3.00, respectively. Though good by 
Africa standards, these are bad scores when compared to Western standards. Africa's interventionist 
economic policies have drained it of economic vitality. 
<P>	Israel scored a 3.10 and Egypt 3.50.  These two countries together receive the bulk of U.S. 
foreign aid.  They are scheduled to receive over $5 billion in 1995.  Although each country has spoken of 
economic liberalization, little progress has been made, particularly in Egypt, where a reform effort has 
run out of steam.  U.S. aid to these two countries may be justified in terms of U.S. national security.  The 
peaceful relationship between Israel and Egypt is viewed as the bulwark of Middle East stability.  
However, these considerations aside, there can be no doubt that U.S. aid is doing little to promote 
economic development in these countries. In fact, it may be retarding development by delaying economic 
reforms.
<P>	The U.S. has recently occupied Haiti to restore democracy to that poverty-stricken country.  
Haiti scores a 4.20 on the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I>.  This amounts to economic repression. 
The Haitian elite has repressed economic activity by every means, including the use of physical violence.  
Haiti's lack of economic freedom has made it the Western Hemisphere's poorest country.  In short, 
Haiti's crisis is as much economic as political. Haiti's <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I> score 
suggests that foreign aid will do nothing to promote economic development unless the Haitian economy 
is dramatically liberalized.
<P>	Finally, nations still under the control of communist dictatorships like Cuba and North Korea, 
and to a lesser extent, Vietnam, collected at the bottom of the Index.  These countries are controlled by 
regimes that repress most forms of economic activity, saving most sources of wealth for corrupt 
government officials who use their control over the economy as the means to maintain power.
<P>	After all is said and done, the inescapable conclusion of the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I> 
is that the best way for a nation to grow economically is to tax less, lower trade barriers, better protect 
private property, allow foreign investment, and generally reduce the level of government interference in 
the economy. Whether they be G-7 countries or the Asian Tigers, countries that are the wealthiest and 
growing the fastest are the ones that are most economically free.  While many factors in addition to 
economic freedom account for the absolute wealth of nations--such as size, resources, the absence or 
presence of war, and even culture--no single factor is as important in determining economic development.  
The road to riches, it seems, indeed is paved with freedom.

<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>

<p>
<h1><center>The Center for Political Renewal</center></h1>
<p>

The purpose of the Center for Political Renewal is to examine the revolutionary
changes now underway in American politics and develop the principles and the
agenda that will guide the next majority political coalition. Big Change may lead
to a revolution in American governance and civic affairs.<p>

The work of the Center for Political Renewal consists of two related endeavors:
The work of Foundation distinguished Senior Fellow <a href="/pff/people/sfellow.html#Weber">Vin Weber</a> on his book, The New
Majority; and the work of the Center itself in developing a set of principles and
an agenda to guide the next successful political coalition to produce a
(peaceful) revolution in American governance and civic affairs.<p>

In The New Majority, Weber looks at the current political upheavals from a
historical perspective and outlines the principles of an emerging majority
coalition -- which may be a "new" Democratic party, a "new" Republican party or,
conceivably, a new party by a different name. <p>

Weber's work is reinforced by other Center activities. For example, in November
1994, the Center sponsored a major post-election poll whose stunning results were
reported in <a href="http://www.wsj.com">The Wall Street Journal</a>. Among its findings were that "a tidal wave
of voter discontent with government in general, and <A HREF="http://thomas.loc.gov/home/thomas.html">Congress</A> in particular, was
responsible for the loss of dozens of incumbent Democrats who failed to heed the
warning signs." The study found that by nearly 15 to 1, Americans believe the
Federal government is "much too big and has too much power."<p>

Unfortunately, the budget issue is beginning to lose the attention of the voters.  In the end, success at the polls will not be determined by the poignancy of the issues, but by the amount of interest the issue can muster among voters.  And so, light weight stupid issues like school prayer and smut on the internet become the cause d'jour while important matters like the solvency of our economy are neglected.<br><b>Mark, Staten Island, NY</b><P>

Just shut it down.<br>
It's time to call Clinton's and Paneta's bluff.
Keep up the talk of the "irresponsibility of leaving more debt to our children"on top of the $5 trillion already spent.
<br>Enough is enough!<br><b>Dean, Portland, OR</b><p>

Republicans should stand fast.  Don't get political
cold feet.  You don't need to compromise.
Compromising your principles means violating them!!
That's not what we sent you there to do.
<BR>
Unfortunately, old-bulls like Bob Dole seem to have a
"principle of the day" - whatever seems to be popular.
These are not principles, so we would have to call
wavering Republicans such as Bob Dole unprincipled.
<BR>
I speak for myself and hundreds of others who are tired
of seeing the old-timers run scared from the media, and
the freshman ignored by the Republican leadership.
<BR>
Get your act together guys, or we'll put you out to
pasture as soon as possible!!!
<br><b>Ron, St. Louis, MO</b>
<P>
The Democrats obviously have no desire to balance the budget. They are only playing along because they want to appear to be part of the process. If the Republicans had not gained a majority there would no talk of balanced budget, or welfare reform or Medicare reform from the Democrats. The Republicans should ignore the polls for the next year and keep pushing their budget reform. If the Republicans faulter at this there is a danger of the Democrats retaking the Congress.<br><b>Mark, Pasadena, CA</b><P>

Ronald Reagan once told his budget director, Jim Miller, "Jim, let's just shut it down, and see whether anyone notices!"<br><b>Terry, Toms River, NJ</b><P>

Please DO NOT raise the national DEBT ceiling 1 dollar on our children and grandchildren. I believe AS HAS ALREADY panned out in the media that the Republicians can make NO deals with either the Democrats or the President. Therefore I suggest a strong hand approach in dealing with him, DON'T BUDGE ONE INCH, give him the bills then adjurn congress and go home and let him squell. A week or two of no budget wont cause America to go under,and Him, Morris and his other handlers and so called experts can just scream. Get tuff with the media, show them that Clinton and Dems wont compromise, do your own media blitz. He has already stated he does not like this or that in the bills, face it at every turn he will make Congress look bad, SO PLAY HARDBALL with him. If he calls you back from adjournment TAKE YOUR TIME getting back, let Clinton be the GRINCH THAT STOLE CHRISTMAS. I have learned that NASTY people can only be delt with from a STRONG position and NEVER, NEVER compromise unless THEY are willing to also compromise.<br><b>William, Frederick, MD</b><P>

Quit the cutbacks and start cutting whole departments!
Any bureaucracy not eliminated while we have the chance
will just "grow" itself back within a decade or three.<br><b>Mike, Little Rock, AR</b><P>

 I'm very anxious about the 4.8 trillion dollar dept; particulary when I contemplate the future for my children. As a middle class income earner, I find the tax burden excessive, and quite frankly I'm getting physically and mentally tired. I want the federal government to be downsized, the states to be empowered, and my taxes restributed with more staying in my state.<br><b>Robert, Sierra Vista, AZ</b><P>

Republicans have lost some credibility with me by failing to address some of the more egregious examples of the so-called corporate welfare and special interest subsidies.  But the party has to remain firm in its convictions and continue to stress the benefits of the budget package without feeling that they must respond to the criticisms of the left.
<br>Stay the high ground.<br><b>James, Centerville, OH</b><p>

The Republicans in Congress must stand fast!  They must
withstand the barrage of the criticism of desperate
liberals.  Let Clinton save face by "negotiating" with him 
and making minor conciliations that he can then gloat
over.  As long as the result is a balanced budget, the
citizens of this country are the real winners.<br><b>Louise, Menlo Park, CA</b><P>

<title>A Message From Aspen -- 1/18/95 -- PFF</title>
</head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>

<h2>Message from Aspen</h2>
<P>
by <a href="/pff/people/sfellow.html#Vlahos">Michael Vlahos</a></center>
<P>
Big Change is upon us.  In America, we have called this <I>revolution</I>.
 Today, it is also called <I>cyberspace</I>.
<P>
Two dozen doyens of big change and the new world met in Aspen
in August.  The theme on the table:  <I>Cyberspace and the American
Dream</I>.  Big Stuff:  an economic revolution, a transformation
of our way of life.  We asked them:  What does this mean for us,
the way we live together, do business, and govern?  Around the
table were some of the first surveyors of the digital landscape.
 It was familiar terrain for all;  so active talk we expected
&#150; and we wrangled and argued for two days about important
things, and about revolution. The last thing we expected to come
out of it all was a ringing, <I>solidarnosc</I> manifesto.
<P>
But something unexpected none the less remained.  A message runs
through the talk.  And it is a message, not for those in the know,
but for regular Americans, those to whom cyberspace is no more
than a breath of esoterica.  It is a message of needed fundamentals,
of things about big change that everyone should know.
<P>
We offer it in the form of the informal, of principles not for
incantation, but for reflection.  Words taken from the talk at
Aspen appear <I>&#147;like this.&#148;</I>
<P>
Here is our message.
<P>
<B><center>Cyberspace is not a medium, but a place.</B></center>
<P>
Before cyberspace, there was <I>the air waves</I>.  The old metaphor
was about how information traveled, how the ether took data packets
from one terminal to another.  And as a metaphor, the air waves
signaled a medium only, an agency that all wished to use;  a common,
and thus shared, instrumentality.
<P>
But cyberspace is a place.  We meet in the ether itself.  For
those who regularly play or do business there, it is even a temporary
habitation.  The new metaphor of a place becomes real;  even though
we are physically separate, our senses connect.  Information is
no longer data, but landscape.  At Aspen, when we reached for
words, they were concrete, world-words:  cyberspace as <I>&#147;ecosystem,&#148;
a new &#147;ecology,&#148;</I> <I>&#147;cyberspace is closer to
a datasphere or space of information.&#148;</I>  It has laid the
same claim on our imagination as a newly discovered country, a
frontier.  It is truly a new world.
<P>
We know it is a place because we think of it as a place.  We act
as though it is a place.  Groups of us meet there; we interact
there:  where <I>interact</I> is merely our new word for being
social.
<P>
Meaning we create human communities there.
<P>
Calling cyberspace a place is our fundamental first principle:
 first to change unstated habits of thought, and then the very
definitions of law.  It means that cyberspace is not a common
medium, a public good; which after the model of <I>the air waves</I>
needs government control and regulation if it is to be shared
as a commons.  Cyberspace is a realm, a sphere of permanent human
gathering and activity.  Primitive it is &#150; a digitally savage
place &#150; but it is, like the earliest American colonies, <B>in
the process of being settled</B>.  Since cyberspace is a created
place, our technology reach endows the possibility of its social
development, of its rise to civilization;  just as the evolution
of ships and the first computers &#150; sextant and astrolabe
&#150; made possible America itself.  So the first colonies in
cyberspace are like any other human experiments at living on a
distant shore.  They are experiments in society itself.
<P>
<B><center>The communities that grow there must be <br>private before they<I>
</I>are public.</B></center>
<P>
These experiments in cyberspace are pioneer communities, and they
may be the first stakeholders of a new society.  Not an alien
culture:  more like an extension of ourselves in a new, but very
different place.  And like any weak and distant settlement, the
new place seems oppressive in its harshness;  and from our far
away vantage &#150; like that of 17th century Londoners &#150;
it all seems primitive and strange.  And it is strange;  and the
unyielding strangeness of an alien world forces human social adaptation.
 People come to this new place with all the inherited social traditions
of late-industrial culture;  and it doesn&#146;t work that way
here.  Others have come in rebellion, or seeking sanctuary from
the tyranny of those traditions.  They want it all to be different.
<P>
What the cyber-colonists share is the desire to adapt, to be able
to be there, and stay there, and make it work.  That drives them;
 and that means, like so many fragile first settlements, that
they will find a way to make it work.  But that means finding
out above all what <I>does</I> work.
<P>
Culture is everywhere in us.  It teaches us how to arrange human
things, how to relate to one another.  And it urges us to make
rules that guide our thinking and our actions.  Law is only the
last form of human rule-making to appear.  Most societies rely
on custom and taboo; they save the law for community theater:
 a mix of teaching and collective observance.
<P>
Social rules &#150; custom and taboo as opposed to law &#150;
have become <I>private</I> in the modern sense:  that is, they
inhere to a community or group only, and are not officially owned
by the national society as a whole.  When social rules inhere
to the national society, they are no longer owned and exercised
by a community of <B>people</B>, but by the national <B>government</B>.
 This is the modern meaning of <I>public</I>.  Long ago, <I>public</I>
referred to the whole of a tribe, in a time when tribe and community
were the same word.  The industrial period separated public from
community.  The new nation state created a formal code of national
law that grew in to a superstructure of life:  it supplanted custom
and taboo for all groups, and replaced social rules with centralized
fiat.  Today, in everyday usage, public no longer means <I>of
the people</I>, it means that particular aspect of government
regulation of <I>everyone&#146;s</I> life.
<P>
Since cyberspace is still seen by America&#146;s centralized authority
as a public medium,  this authority seeks to regulate the new
ether as it did the air waves.  But suppose this authority affirmed
the new metaphor of cyberspace as a realm, colonized by pioneering
settlers?  Would the authority allow the new communities to create
their own rules?  Would it understand that old rules, hardened
into code and statute, might not fit the new place?<HR>

<P>
America&#146;s frontier communities grew up on their own.  The
British Crown did not interfere unduly in their <I>private</I>
life, even as this evolved into civic life, even to the level
of colonial assemblies.  And after we won our independence, young
America let communities continue to make their own rules.
<P>
<I>&#147;We are hearkening back to the old frontier.  At first
they spent an awful lot of time conquering the frontier and building
the frontier and making a society here where there was no one.
 And then they studied politics.&#148;</I>
<P>
Politics as governance should grow out of the traditions of community
rule.  But in industrial America rules have been codified on high,
and are imposed from above.  This reversal of original tradition
is suffered more or less passively by most citizens.  Those sodbusting
in cyberspace, however, are different.  They argue that regulation
for an industrial world will not work in the ether.  And they
are generally more &#145;ornery and defiant than most American
citizens.
<P>
Their message:  to colonize cyberspace,
<P>
<B><center>Custom must precede law.</center></B>
<P>
They want to build their own communities, not have them administered
by the state.  They insist that state-regulated human relations
in cyberspace will stunt, if not destroy, the growth of real society
there.
<P>
<I>&#147;This discussion is very evocative of communities in America
in the 18th century.  If you look at the communities that founded
America, many of them were fleeing a place of tyranny, and they
sought just to be unto themselves, and that was accepted originally
in America.  I think in some ways we have come full circle.&#148;</I>
<P>
Not just frontier spirit here, but a bit of <I>Allegheny Uprising</I>
too.  Cyberspace foments a rebellion against the Old Order.
<P>
<B><center>The new society is a successor society &#150; and so<br> a new
model.</B>
<P></center>
Why is this important?  This is surely the most marginal of frontier
societies.  Or is it?
<P>
What we call cyber-communities look more like encampments than
colonies.  But we tend to tie our image of community to the familial-neighborhood
icon only.  We forget that our economic intercourse is a highly
advanced network of business communities, marked by highly developed
sets of personal and group relationships.  In the US in fact,
a case can be made that the strongest personal ties that many
have are not family at all, but company and firm.  From core identity
to emotional investment, the communities of commerce define late
20th century America.
<P>
We call it The Marketplace.  And the new marketplace is moving
to the new place, cyberspace.  It is moving there because the
technologies of the ether <I>&#147;can make transaction costs
so small that we can eventually eliminate them.&#148;</I>  What
earthly market can say that?  And what market can ignore transaction
costs, when there is one that has none?
<P>
Like the ancient agora or bazaar, markets seek communities, and
communities cluster around the marketplace.  And as cyberspace
becomes a living social sphere, going to market there is not just
a response to zero transaction costs;  it is like going downtown
in the old city.  Communities actually, and increasingly, inhabit
the same space as the new marketplace.  Cyberspace begins to lose
its frontier edges, and edges into <I>Boom Town</I>.  More and
more people enter the ether and work there.  They don&#146;t just
get info dumps on their terminal;  the terminal becomes their
vehicle, their wheels into cyberspace.  So the new society gets
serious, and gets beyond the BBS, through the social network of
enterprise.
<P>
And because of business, the new society truly promises to succeed
the old.  It succeeds because it lets everything work faster,
better, and with higher confidence.  And it is open:  everything
is there to see.  Open markets have always worked on trust, and
each advance in transaction has been built on it.  Transparency
is its own enforcement.
<P>
Which means that the very nature of the cyberspace urges a ethos
of trust.  Transparency reaffirms the power of ostracism;  it
encourages virtue as no law of the land can.  What openness does
to business deadbeats, it does in a much larger sense for the
new society:  it renews the strength of custom over law, of group
rules self-defined over regulation by government authority.  And
it is fairer by far.  If <I>&#147;value is determined by the trust
that people have and can be engaged directly so as to define their
own currency even,&#148;</I> then each of us has the power to
shape our own value according to our actions.
<P>
So a new ethic in the marketplace at last comes home:  and the
far shores of a new world brings us back to the Atlantic shore
of our earliest ancestors;  back to that confidence in their values
and beliefs that is their charge to us.
<P>
<B><center>It threatens the old, and the old order seeks<br> to kill or stunt
it.</B></center>
<P>
But in this promise of progress is a problem.
<P>
<I>&#147;If markets are going to get immeasurably better, it should
be possible to return to the market many things that are handed
to government.&#148;</I>
<P>
Or, cyberspace as the main threat to the Old Order.
<P>
It took the American colonies almost two centuries to become a
threat to Britain&#146;s established order.  And it took long
war and a financial crisis to disrupt a century-long pattern of
British benign neglect of rule.
<P>
No such hope exists for cyberspace.  To the Old Order, the threat
of cyberspace is like the Industrial and the French revolutions
rolled into one.
<P>
<I>&#147;The fact that a system is chaotic and not capable of
control by old institutions, does not necessarily mean that it
is going to blow up like a bomb.&#148;</I>
<P>
Ah, but that is exactly how imperial Washington sees cyberspace.
 In its eyes it resembles a bomb in every respect:  it ticks like
a bomb, it is fused to blow in a finite period of time, and its
explosive power is enough to bring down the old house.
<P>
And the pioneers know it:
<P>
<I>&#147;When we start using phrases like </I>Government as the
Engine of Progress<I>, then we are deep into machine think and
machine language.&#148; ... &#147;The old machine model came out
with a perfect Hoover blueprint for everything.  Everything has
to be under control. Everything has to be in balance.  All the
pieces have to fit together.  But the machine can&#146;t evolve
or change.  And I think what we are engaged in now is the disassembly
of that super bureaucratic apparatus.&#148;</I>
<P>
or,
<P>
<I>&#147;We should be examining very critically just which freedoms
really need government to be protected&#148; ... &#147;Before
we hand back to government or say to government, oh yes, you get
to protect all our freedoms, we should ask critically just which
ones we can protect for ourselves ...&#148;</I>
<P>
All we have to do is listen to our own words.
<P>
So &#147;telecom&#148; legislation brought forward by the <I>ancien
regime</I> is offered as public reform or public protection, but
it is intended to freeze evolution.  It would be like Charles
II forbidding all ship departures from Bristol to British North
America.  Of course, that would have been a form of royal self-mutilation.
 It was beyond the 17th century imagination.
<P>
But not beyond of the mind of the late 20th century imperial bureaucrat:
<P>
<I>&#147;We are in a world with ever-increasing regulatory tentacles
reaching throughout the system, and even now beginning to invade
the information economy itself and strangle it  ...&#148;</I>
<P>
or,
<P>
<I>&#147;What we need is for telephone companies with their tremendous
fiber capacity to link to the broad band connections to homes
that cable companies now possess to create a broad band infrastructure
for the Internet.  But because regulators prohibit this natural
evolution ... capital is fleeing from the Internet ... to Hollywood.&#148;</I>
<P>
The irony is that forcing new world builders to compete over &#147;content&#148;
drives telecom back to the social universe of couch potato-TV;
 back to the stupefying, one-way feed box of industrial information
... back to the vision of George Orwell.
<P>
Back to the cultural compass of the 1950s?  Back to the future?
<P>
<B><center>We need to protect the new from the old, <br>while it is still
vulnerable.</center></B>
<P>
No regime has ever stopped relentless change.  Revolutions happen;
 the Soviet <I>nomenclatura</I> had not enough T-72s to stop theirs,
and our Imperial City has not enough Clipper Chips or Senators
Exxon to starve out the brash settlements on the Net.  But they
can slow it down, divert its course for awhile, give us all grief.
<P>
But what we have made in cyberspace is revolution&#146;s start.
 We don&#146;t have to worry about what it will do:  we know full
well what it will do.  What we must do is fight like hell to give
this juggernaut &#150; just like yesterday&#146;s locomotive of
progress &#150; its History-breaking head of steam.
<P>
<I>&#147;I am convinced that federal level government is an industrial
era artifact that arose to protect the interests of large industrial
institutions and will go away with them.&#148;</I>

 It's still trendy among liberals to link homelessness with supposed
government cuts in social services.  Nattering about Newt in the
mid-90s has replaced the roaring about Reaganism that characterized
the early-80s, but the message is the same:  Budget dips sink
ships.  The truth is different:  Many of the lives sinking in
recent years had holes cut into their hulls 25 years ago, during
liberalism's golden age.
<P>
 Take as a case study the story of Rudy Jones, 45.  He grew up
in a middle class household in the District and as a teenager
reacted, 60s-style, to school &quot;regimentation.&quot; He became
a voracious reader of political thrillers and worked for Hubert
Humphrey's campaign in 1968.  Then he went to college, where drugs
were more important than studies, and learned about LSD, speed
and surrealistic painting.
<P>
 After college Mr. Jones moved to Los Angeles and &quot;tried
to get into the film business.  That's where I really got into
some fast circles.  I was doing a lot of powdered cocaine out
there.&quot;  The infantilized gratification-seeking that characterized
late-sixties politics and culture stayed with him as he moved
back to Washington and worked at a television station as a production
technician and then as film and tape editor.  
<P>
 By 1984, Cal Ripken, Jr. thirty miles to the north had already
begun his streak of showing up for work day after day, but it
was hard for a child of the sixties to be an iron man.  A stripper
in a strip-tease joint in 1984 introduced Jones to crack cocaine,
which he had heard of before as a drug that led middle class people
to &quot;sell their houses and break up their lives.&quot;  He
had scoffed at such reports, but when he took his first hit &quot;the
bells were going off in the center of my brain.&quot;
<P>
 Jones had learned during the sixties to satisfy his impulses,
and he spent the mid-80s turning theory into practice.  More cocaine,
more disintegration in his life: &quot;It was like a slow motion
train wreck.  A big long pile up.&quot;  Unable to work consistently
because of his drug use, Jones left his job in 1988 and began
a series of freelance assignments that would give him the money
for crack without the obligation of regular labor.  
<P>
 The culmination came in September, 1994, when he received a check
for $1500 from a public television station: &quot;I just went
nuts. Didn't sleep or eat for four days in a row, doing crack
all the time.  That's when I realized I needed to do something
drastic.&quot;   Drastic for Jones was entering a live-in, anti-addiction
program at the Gospel Mission at 810 Fifth St., N.W.
<P>
   Ironically, it was sixties reasoning -- don't think about right
and wrong, just show me where I can get a buzz -- that led him
into a program built on right and wrong:  Jones based his decision
to enter the Gospel Mission not on faith in Christ, but on research
showing that religious anti-addiction programs are more successful
than others:  &quot;I wanted to get results, I didn't care how.&quot;
 
<P>
 Pragmatism changed to awe as Jones went through the Gospel Mission's
Bible studies and counseling programs, however. The transformation,
he says, began when he stopped thinking of God as &quot;a bunch
of physics laws&quot; and started to see Him as &quot;a personal
entity that man could relate to.&quot;  Suddenly he could pray,
for he knew that God was listening.  Suddenly there was purpose
that went outside self-pleasing, for God was watching.  Suddenly
there was power to change, because God was helping.
<P>
 After five months Jones felt &quot;completely changed.&quot;
 When I interviewed him in February, 1995, he spoke of no longer
living for each day's pleasures, as he had done since the 1960s,
but dying to self -- seeing God rather than man as the center
of things. 
<P>
 
<P>
 Complete changes sometimes short-circuit; time heals all wounds
and also tests all spiritual swoons.  I've checked on Rudy Jones:
 He has stayed clean this year and was judged ready to move out
of the Gospel Mission in order to live with and care for his mother,
who is now in her 80s and in need of help.  He's working in telecommunications
and volunteering twice a week to teach English and writing to
newcomers at the Mission.   Stuck in the sixties for three decades,
he has finally grown up.  And its time that the apologists for
infantilism did so also.

<title>Time to End Costly Direct Student Loans -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<H3><i>TIME TO END COSTLY DIRECT STUDENT LOANS</i></h3>

By Matthew Spalding<br>
Manager of Academic Programs<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Issue Bulletin No. 215<br>
September 20, 1995<br></center>
<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The Clinton Administration has portrayed its direct lending program for college students as essential to the educational future of young Americans. Nothing could be further from the truth. The direct government lending program is bad for taxpayers, bad for students, and bad for schools. Later this week, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee and the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee will consider the statutory changes necessary to achieve the spending targets for the 1996 federal education budget. They could expand, cap, or eliminate the Clinton direct lending program. The best choice for taxpayers, students, and schools would be to end it.
<p>

<b>STUDENT LOAN PROGRAMS</b>
<p>
The primary source of student financial aid in America is federally guaranteed student loans. Since it was created in 1965, this program, now known as the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFEL), has funded 74 million student loans worth over $180 billion.1  More than six million loans totaling nearly $22 billion were disbursed in FY 1994 alone.2  Private lenders provide the capital for the loans, and private and state guarantor agencies process them. The federal government subsidizes the interest rate, guarantees the loans in cases of default, and exercises regulatory authority over the program. This relationship, while by no means perfect, has worked relatively well in providing loans to millions of American college and university students.3<p>In 1993, the Clinton Administration proposed replacing this program with direct lending by the federal government, extending a limited pilot program approved in the 1992 Higher Education Act. The Administration claimed this would be more efficient. While schools would administer the program, the federal government would borrow the money necessary to provide capital for the loans and would service and collect the loans itself. This plan would radically change the federal government's three-decade involvement in college lending programs by effecting what Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS) called "a total federal takeover of a successful public-private sector partnership."4<p>Congress initially rejected a full direct lending program, but approved a trial phase-in over at least five years:  5 percent of loan volume in 1994-1995, 40 percent in 1995-1996, 50 percent or more in 1996-1998, and 60 percent or more in 1998-1999. The U.S. Department of Education in July 1994 began making direct loans to 104 schools, representing 5 percent of the loan volume. In a sign that schools are hesitating to participate, the 1995-1996 loan volume will end up at around 28.7 percent -- far short of the 40 percent target.5  The Administration hopes to accelerate the program to reach 100 pe
rcent participation in 1997-1998, and is willing to require colleges and universities -- including those that object to the program -- to participate.6<p><b>BAD ECONOMICS</b><p>Much of the debate over direct loans turns on the question of cost:  Replacing guaranteed loans with direct lending is supposed to save taxpayers billions of dollars. The FY 1996 Clinton budget claims $4.1 billion in savings over the 1996-2000 period if the direct loan program is fully implemented.7  Recent cost estimates tell a very different story.<p><b>Eliminating the direct loan program saves money.</b> Prior to 1990, the long-term financing and administrative costs of all student loans were ignored in budget scoring, and direct loan capital outlays were considered current year expenditures. This problem was corrected with the Credit Reform Act of 1990, which required calculation of these long-term costs for guaranteed loans but not for direct loans. When the direct loan program was enacted in 1993, the Congressional Budget Office initially estimated the program could save $4.3 billion over five years.8  This estimate ignored the long-term costs of direct loans in accordance with the Credit Reform Act. The 1996 Budget Resolution, however, amended the Credit Reform Act to account for the complicated long-term administrative costs of the direct loan program. The revised report of the Congressional Budget Office, released in July and based on these changes in official budget scoring, projects that a fully implemented direct loan program would save just $115 million over the next seven years. Indeed, according to the CBO, eliminating the direct loan program and maintaining the guaranteed program would save $1.5 billion in budget outlays over the next seven years.9<p><b>The direct loan program adds considerably to the national debt.</b> The vast bulk of capital for student loans today is provided by private sources. But under the Clinton plan, the federal government would borrow the money necessary to provide capital for the loan
s. This would require the federal government to borrow an additional $20 billion-$25 billion each year to provide enough capital for the program. According the Representative Ernest Istook (R-OK) in congressional testimony last spring, a complete shift to direct loans could add $348 billion to the national debt by the year 2014.10  Two independent analyses in 1993, conducted by leading accounting firms, argued that such amounts of government borrowing could increase interest rates on the public debt. One noted that this would "wipe out the saving claimed for direct lending" and warned lawmakers that they "may be on the verge of making a serious public policy mistake" if they shifted to direct lending.11<p>Furthermore, the direct loan program is fiscally irresponsible. A key feature of the Clinton direct loan program is the "income contingent repayment plan" for students. The goal of this plan is to reduce the debt repayment burden on graduates struggling with repayment, thereby also reducing the rate of loan defaults. Instead of a regular monthly installment, repayment is contingent on future income. Students choosing this option, however, could well end up increasing their personal debt by stretching out their repayment period and actually increasing the principal on the loan. Nor will this help the default problem. According to the Congressional Research Service, "direct lending is largely irrelevant as a means of reducing [default] costs" and "may well increase default costs."12  If borrowers stretch out their repayments to 25 years, as encouraged by the income contingent repayment plan, the accumulated debt will simply be forgiven. Loan defaults would be permitted and assumed by the government.<p><b>BAD EDUCATION POLICY</b>
<p>
Direct lending centralizes control of student loans within the U.S. Department of Education. The Department is hiring 600 new employees to administer the program and anticipates 20,000 contract employees by the time the program is fully operational. The government already is funding this expansion with an unencumbered $2.5 billion authorization. This not only builds a new government bureaucracy, but also creates the potential for vast inefficiencies and unconstrained program costs. 
<p>
The Department of Education is notoriously disorganized and mismanaged. It has proven that it cannot manage the existing student aid program,13 and already is having problems dealing with the current small-scale direct lending program. Among other things, students are experiencing delays and complicated paperwork.14  In 1994 the Department of Education gave out $700 million in direct loans but was unable to account for some $100 million.15  The Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance, created by Congress as an independent advisory body on student aid, concludes in a recent study that the direct loan program is "potentially exposed to multiple loans, overawards, loans to ineligible students, and excessive cash drawdowns" and, in general, cannot "ensure program integrity."16 <p>The Administration has proposed turning to another bureaucracy to solve the problem of loan collection:  the Internal Revenue Service. A joint study by the Education and Treasury Departments, however, concludes that "it is not feasible to expand the participation of the IRS in the collection of student loans."  IRS involvement in loan collection would "strain IRS resources, interfere with its primary mission, and decrease higher dollar tax collections, without improving student loan program administration or customer service."17  Without the IRS, however, the burden falls back on the Department of Education.<p>There are precedents for failure with direct loans. In the early 1970s, Congress experimented with direct loans through the Federally Insured Student Loan (FISL) program. It was poorly managed, and because the government was ineffective at collecting the loans, default rates soared above previous levels. It was phased out in 1976. Largely because of this failure, there emerged the current decentralized system that relies on private lenders and guarantors.
<p>
The direct loan program also is bad for academic freedom. Three quarters of all available college financial aid comes from the federal government.18  If the government takes over the loan program, colleges and universities will become dependent on a single lender to support their students. Its power to control loan revenue, together with its regulatory authority and enforcement power, will give the government vast influence over post-secondary education. The very possibility that the federal government might use this new authority to force curriculum changes or mandate racial preferences should breed caution. This is no farfetched theory; it is the very question settled in favor of the government in the 1984 Supreme Court case of <i>Grove City College v. Bell</i>.19  There currently are efforts to centralize further the college accreditation process (which allows a college's students to be eligible for financial aid in the first place) as a way of enforcing nationwide multicultural education standards.20  One can only imagine the temptations presented to some education reformers if the power of accreditation is combined with government control over student loan money. If recent history is any guide, further government intrusion can only harm college and university education.21 <p><b>CONCLUSION</b><p>The existing guaranteed loan program is not perfect. Taxpayers bear all the risk, and schools, students, and lenders should bear greater responsibility. The system must be based on genuine risk sharing that minimizes government costs without destabilizing the current loan program. At the same time, recent improvements in the program should not be overlooked. The loan application process has become simpler in recent years, and the default rate has declined significantly. All of these improvements would be even greater if some of the streamlining ideas in the direct lending program were applied to the guaranteed loan program.
<p>
The solution is not to nationalize the multi-billion-dollar student loan program. That would mean new costs and bureaucracy. Moreover, Americans believe strongly that student loans should continue to be provided through private financial institutions, not the federal government.22 <p>Nor is the solution to maintain the program at some arbitrary level. This only postpones the final program decision, validates the creation of a new education bureaucracy, and delays the reforms needed to strengthen and improve funding prospects for America's educational future.23 <p>The only prudent and fiscally responsible answer is to eliminate the program.<p><b>Endnotes:</b><p><ol><li>For a review of the loan programs and ways to reform them, see Scott A.

<HR SIZE="3" WIDTH"="30%"><P>
Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee.  Let me begin by thanking you for the opportunity to testify before you this morning.
<P>
My name is <A HREF="/conservative/kbio.html">David Keene</a> and I am Chairman of the American Conservative Union.  The ACU has for more than 30 years served as the grass-roots lobby for the conservative movement.  Our nearly one million members have been interested in and involved in the debate over whether the Legal Service Corporation can be reformed or whether it should be eliminated as a delivery vehicle for legal services to disadvantaged Americans since the mid-seventies and feel very strongly that the entrenched interests in control of the corporation make it very unlikely that any meaningful reform is even possible.
<P>
Sometimes a program that has gone off the tracks becomes so entrenched and resistant to reform that it has to be eliminated.  The LSC is such a program.  It will do no good to cut off a few branches . . . you must go to the root problem, bite the bullet . . . and start over.
<P>
The Legal Services Corporation was, as you know, established in 1974 to take over the programs then housed within the Office of Legal Services in the Office of Economic Opportunity or OEO.
<P>
You will hear various versions of just why the LSC was established, but as you consider the question of extending its funding, I would urge you to consider that the Nixon Administration had been urged to establish such a quasi-governmental corporation by the Ash Commission in 1971 as "a first step toward reprivatization of what has traditionally been a function of the private sector."
<P>
The LSC has, in fact, developed into something quite different employing via grants and contract thousands of attorneys who have become dependent upon government largesse both for their income and as a means of allowing them the freedom to pursue an agenda that has very little to do with providing individual legal services to those who cannot otherwise afford to go to a lawyer.
<P>
It must be admitted that most of those who came to dominate the new corporation as well as a sizable number of those who fought first to establish it and later to defend it have no desire at all to "reprivatize" the provision of legal services within our society.  Rather, they sought a permanent home for their activities with a guaranteed source of funding free of even the minimal oversight they had faced at OEO.
<P>
And . . . as history has shown . . . the interests that quickly came to dominate the new corporation have a far, far different view of its role in our society than did most of those who voted to establish it.
<P>
Many in Congress who voted in 1974 to establish the LSC did so in the belief that through the corporation they would be giving individual Americans without the wherewithal to afford private lawyers access to the legal system that they might otherwise be denied.  They envisioned a small army of idealistic men and women utilizing LSC grants to help poor families fight unfair evictions or avoid consumer rip-offs.
<P>
Since 1974, however, the LSC has spent millions of dollars on quasi-legal political activity designed to "organize" and "empower" the poor as a group or class . . . money that might better have been used to serve individual clients.  The mission as those running
LSC has seen it is to transform American society by changing laws and governmental policies affecting what they tend to see as their constituencies.
<P>

Partisan and ideological disputes between Congress and the White House have allowed the LSC more than independence they made it unaccountable to anyone.  And this has allowed the interests that came to dominate it to take total and complete control . . . . A case in which the inhabitants were truly given control of the asylum.
<P>
There are no doubt good men and women working within the LSC framework who do see their mission as the members of Congress who voted to establish the program saw it.  I have no doubt that these men and women are out there serving the legitimate needs of individual clients.
<P>
We can applaud the work of these people while recognizing that the LSC has gone off the tracks in pursuing an additional mission that Congress has an obligation to halt.  The simple fact is that the LSC's major impact has not been in serving these clients, but in funding a network of activists dedicated not to helping clients function better within the framework of our society, but to changing that society.
<P>
The question is not whether the policy goals LSC grantees have sought are good or bad . . . or how much time they spend pursuing it, but whether Congress ought to be funding an effort to undermine the authority of the states and to influence public policy at all levels.
<P>
Private citizens have every right. . . indeed they may often have a moral obligation . . . to organize and work for policy changes that they hope will lead to the kind of society in which they want to live . . . and in which they want to raise their children and grandchildren.
<P>
But that is far, far different from saying that they have a right to tax money to finance such activities.
<P>
The funding of the LSC has amounted to little more that the channeling of tax money to men and women with an ideological, political agenda and allowed them to use that money to pursue that agenda.
<P>
Let's be clear.  Congress has no business funding such activities.
<P>
Senator Hollings said earlier this morning that the proper way to achieve such change is not through the course, but through the Congress . . . and he is dead right.
<P>
There is a legitimate question as to whether Congress should be funding even the provision of individual legal services . . . those services which the Ash Commission so correctly described as traditionally a function of the private sector.
<P>
The question of whether the private sector can accomplish this task will be debated in and out of Congress . . . and should be.
<P>
But that debate . . . however it is resolved . . . should not influence your vote on the continuation of the LSC.  As constituted with its network of grantees, contractors, alumni and friends the LSC cannot be reformed or limited to these arguably legitimate functions.
<P>
Instead, you must abolish it . . . reduce its funding to zero, send those who have perverted its original purpose and misused the tax money you have provided them packing . . . and start over.
<P>
If this Congress truly believes that tax monies should be used to provide legal assistance to those without  the funds needed to gain access to the civil justice system, you should design a system that will accomplish this goal, but don't think for a minute that the Legal Services Corporation can or will help you in the effort.
<P>
It's something you are going to have to do on your own.
<P>
Thank you.

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">D</FONT></B>uring the coming year, Americans will begin a serious debate over the meaning and value of affirmative action. Among the early signs:
	<P>	A proposed ballot initiative in California aims to amend the state constitution to 
prohibit preferential treatment in public policy based on race, sex, ethnicity, or national 
origin.</P>
<P>	In Georgia, the state legislature considers a bill to end preferences for women and 
minorities in landing county contracts.</P>
<P>	Senator and presidential hopeful Phil Gramm (R-TX) promises that, if elected, he 
will end major set-aside programs on his first day in office.</P>
<P>	President Clinton orders an "intense, urgent review" of all aspects of government 
affirmative-action policy. Veteran Democratic strategist Susan Estrich says that as far as 
affirmative action is concerned, "now is truly the time to move on to some other 
approach."</P>
<P>	The Supreme Court may oblige her. In agreeing to hear Adarand v. Pena, the 
Court threatens to reform, restrict, or undo federal set-asides for minority-owned 
businesses. Policy Review asked several black businessmen to describe the impact of 
race-based government contracting on entrepreneurship, and to offer their own insights 
into establishing successful businesses in an increasingly competitive market. Here are 
their stories:

<H3>Ward Connerly</H3>
<P>	Of all the terms used to describe America, none is more descriptive (and it is my 
favorite) than "the land of opportunity." Opportunity, the chance to advance in life, is the 
centerpiece of our value system. It is this concept that separates us from the rest of the 
world. For opportunity to have meaning, there must be entrepreneurs, people who are 
willing to take chances in order to succeed. True entrepreneurs are created not by 
government, but by God, and their natural talents are stimulated by the marketplace.</P>
<P>	In recent years, our nation has begun to debate the effects and consequences of 
"affirmative action." Affirmative action comes in many forms; some are acceptable, even 
desirable, such as advertising the availability of contract opportunities in minority 
communities, and adopting strong measures to ensure that racial and gender 
discrimination have no place in our society.</P>
<P>	Other forms of affirmative action, however, are very damaging to the nation and 
to those whom such programs and practices are designed to benefit. One of the most 
odious forms of affirmative action is the concept of awarding contracts on the basis of 
racial, ethnic, or gender preferences. There are many variations on this theme, but the 
approach taken in California is fairly representative and instructive.</P>
<P>	Several years ago, the California state legislature passed a law requiring every 
state agency to award 15 percent of all contracts to firms owned by minority business 
enterprises (MBEs), 5 percent to firms owned by women-owned business enterprises 
(WBEs), and 3 percent to firms owned by disabled veterans (DVBEs). Minorities are 
defined as "socially and economically disadvantaged" groups and include blacks, 
Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans.</P>
<P>	What are the effects of this policy?</P>
<P>	First, the prospect of getting government contracts, as a result of belonging to a 
protected group, is sometimes a false inducement for people to go into business without 
being adequately prepared to be in business. They often are undercapitalized and lack the 
business acumen to remain in business without government contracts. This is not itself a 
sin, but these businesses tend to become an extension of the government agencies 
themselves. Consequently, the agencies often create contract opportunities to sustain 
these businesses rather than acting to meet their needs or those of the taxpayers.
<P>	Second, the costs and headaches associated with administering the MBE and 
WBE programs are significant. A bureaucracy of MBE/WBE coordinators has been 
established in virtually every department of California's state government. This 
obviously increases the cost of government and creates enormous inefficiencies for 
companies that do business with the state. There is great inconsistency across 
departments, and many officials confess that their programs cost more because of these 
set-aside requirements.</P>
<P>	Third, these practices are marginalizing better-established businesses because they 
are forced to share their contracts with MBE/WBE partners. Few businesses can sacrifice 
23 percent from a contract and still make a profit. I hear the argument that 23 percent is 
not being taken off the top, but rather the total pie is merely being sliced differently. 
Sometimes that is true. Our firm, however, is usually able to carry out most portions of 
our contracts. Yet we must often create a role for those whom we are required to include. 
This generally means subcontracting for tasks that we could perform ourselves at lower 
cost. Whenever we take on a state contract, we lose profit, and our private-sector clients 
bear the burden of our higher prices.</P>
<P>	After 22 years in business, I know that government procurement of goods and 
services is less costly when the specifications are clear and private contractors are able to 
fit these requirements into their methods of doing business. Whenever contractors have to 
customize their methods of delivering products, such as aligning themselves with new 
partners, the cost on a per unit basis of doing business inevitably rises.</P>
<P>	Fourth, the quality of the work sometimes suffers. When you are forced into a 
shotgun relationship with firms with whom you do not regularly do business, it is 
inescapable that you lose some management control over the project.</P>
<P>	Fifth, the policy invites deception. For example, there is evidence that some 
women or minorities listed as "owners" exercise no control over the day-to-day 
operations of their businesses. In some instances, the so-called owner rarely sets foot on 
the premises. How is the goal of equality advanced when, say, a man who has owned a 
construction business for decades suddenly switches ownership to his wife?</P>
<P>	Finally, these set-aside programs are blatantly unfair. Consider my own business. 
I own 50 percent of the stock issued by my company. My wife owns the other 50 percent. 
Technically, neither of us "controls" the business, and we qualify for neither MBE nor 
WBE preferences.</P>
<P>	We have chosen not to change the ownership of our business merely to qualify for 
preferences based on my race or her gender. But why should we operate at a competitive 
disadvantage just because we prefer to be considered on the merits of our work? How 
does society benefit when a business established 22 years ago, by individuals who were 
willing to risk their economic futures, is disfavored in order to lure others to go into 
business?</P>
<P>	Minority set-aside programs are creating all kinds of dysfunction in the 
marketplace, they are unfair, and they are based on the false proposition that government 
should be creating business opportunities for women and minorities. What government 
should be doing is ensuring, through advertising and other forms of outreach, that 
opportunities are equally available, and then allowing the marketplace to produce the 
lowest legitimate bids for the goods and services that the government seeks to procure.</P>

<H3>Daniel Colimon</H3>
<P>	I operate perhaps the largest black-owned litigation-support firm in California. 
We have been in business for 14 years, and our clients include at least 200 law firms from 
Santa Barbara to San Diego. We have never sought a government contract as a minority 
firm, and federal set-asides for awarding contracts to minority-owned businesses anger 
me to no end.</P>
<P>	After our firm did some work for the legal department of a state utility, one of its 
officials told me that if we became a certified minority enterprise, they would make us 
their primary vendor. There was no discussion of the quality of our work--none 
whatsoever. </P>
<P>	They merely needed to rack up points with the state's Public Utility Commission, 
which requires all state agencies to do at least 15 percent of their business with minority-
owned companies.</P>
<P>	I said no. Commission officials called me every other week for two and a half 
months. They warned that if we continued to refuse, they would simply opt for another 
vendor. They did, and I have since lost 80 percent of their business.</P>
<P>	It is time for America to acknowledge that affirmative action doesn't work. There 
are fatal flaws in set-aside programs, which, despite all of the good intentions, hope, and 
government intervention, have produced very few positive changes. If anything, the white 
"backlash" to affirmative action has perpetuated the polarization of America's various 
ethnic groups.</P>
<P>	If affirmative action was to be the vehicle by which we travel the road to racial 
equality, somewhere along the way we lost first the keys and then the map. If affirmative 
action was to redress past discrimination against African Americans and other racial 
minorities, it has failed miserably:</P>
<UL><LI>  White males dominate the social, political, and business landscape as never before.<BR>
<LI>  Racial minorities are still largely absent from the private sector's management or 
executive boardrooms.<BR>
<LI>  Worst of all, affirmative-action programs have established an extremely damaging 
stereotype that places African Americans and other racial minorities in a very precarious 
position. We are perceived as a group of people who--regardless of how hard we work, 
how educated we become, or what we achieve--would not be where we are without the 
preferential treatment afforded by affirmative-action programs.</UL>
<P>	Throughout my life, I have been taught that the best place to look for help is in the 
mirror. I grew up poor and  black and  in a single-parent household. I graduated from a 
predominantly white university. I have worked since the age of 12. I founded an 
extremely successful litigation-support firm that employs people of all races.</P>
<P>	Although I have suffered with the burden of being a businessman who happens to 
be black, never have I been given nor have I expected preferential treatment simply 
because I am black. I defy anyone to put an asterisk next to any of my accomplishments. I 
have always demanded that I receive respect, not by virtue of what I am, but of who I am. 
Conversely, I have always accorded the same treatment to all I have encountered, 
regardless of race, creed, or national origin.</P>
<P>	My personal experiences with affirmative-action programs, in the business 
community and outside it, have all been negative. It is not popular to be black and 
opposed to affirmative action. When discussing this with other blacks, I've been told that 
I have sold out to the white agenda. On the contrary, I argue that we don't need any 
affirmative-action programs precisely because I believe so strongly in my capabilities and 
those of all people of all races.</P>
<P>	Such programs are not the solution to America's race problem. Truly 
"affirmative" action should take the form of equal-quality education, which will help lead 
to equal political access and equal economic opportunity. Additionally, it is imperative 
that we acknowledge the existence of institutional racial discrimination. Rather than 
disavowing responsibility for it or wasting 25 years on programs that have not worked, 
we should aggressively ferret out those who practice clear discrimination and prosecute 
them. </P>
<P>	Only then will we truly be able to say that we have equal opportunity. The 
measure of this will be a society where people can achieve success regardless of race,  
where people "will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their 
character."</P>

<H3>Herman Cain</H3>
<P>	When Pillsbury Co. hired me as president of Godfather's Pizza, one of its failing 
subsidiaries, we  couldn't count on a government contract to revive the chain. Not only 
did we want to rescue the chain from debt and looming bankruptcy; we wanted to have 
the industry's highest average sales per unit and the highest average profitability per unit. 
You don't get that without a commitment to quality and an acute sensitivity to your 
market.</P>
<P>	When Ronald Gartlan and I later led a team of other managers to buy Godfather's 
Pizza, we didn't use a set-aside program. We had to fight and defend and sell the banks 
on our merit as investors. Our success or failure was based on our own raw business 
ability.</P>
<P>	If there were no federal programs to assist minority business owners, the 1 percent 
of businesses owned by the black community would probably be zero. But federal set-
asides are a double-edged sword: Any time you have a guaranteed participation level, you 
may not have the same incentives or the same motivation to perform as in a situation that 
is driven by performance. On the other hand, without set-asides, many minorities 
candidates for contracts, jobs, or services would not even be considered for inclusion.</P>
<P>	Remember, you need capital to start a business. The lack of access to capital is the 
number one reason for the tiny percentage of black-owned businesses. Set-asides do not 
address the capital issue as it relates to starting, maintaining, and running a business.</P>
<P>	One of the most important aspects of being successful is relationship-building. 
The vendor and the customer have to develop a relationship based on trust and 
performance. But you can't legislate relationships; set-aside programs won't build 
relationships between minority businesses and their customers.</P>
<P>	As a businessman and as a black American, I know there still exists institutional 
racism, which tends to exclude people from consideration. As a result, I've practiced 
several principles to help me achieve my goals:</P>
<UL><LI>  Because I am a black American, I've had to perform better than my white counterparts. 
This is a personal standard that I've set for myself: I've got to perform a little better in 
order to get the same opportunity. I can't just be as good; I've got to be better. It should 
not be this way, but it is.<BR>
<LI>  When I come across those barriers, such as racial bias, I have to let my performance be 
my barrier buster. That's just the price you pay for success.<BR>
<LI>  I have to maintain focus and be tenacious in achieving my objectives.</UL>
<P>	I have been very successful in corporate America because I have refused to allow 
any of the normal obstacles--and there have been many--to stop me. Part of my success 
is linked to getting an opportunity, but another part is taking advantage of the opportunity 
by staying focused. That is something you can't legislate or put in a program.</P>
<P>	When I came to Godfather's, I sought the views of the management, the 
operations people, and the franchises on how we got into the mess we were in and how 
we could get out. By focusing on our strengths and on the market niches where we could 
win, we embarked on a path to recovery. In just over a year--and against intense 
competition--store sales increased about 10 percent, with some restaurants running as 
high as 25 percent. More important than the numbers, however, is the fact that over the 
last several years we have built a foundation for sustained profitability.</P>
<P>	I'm a firm believer that we are put on this earth to make a difference. I happen to 
have been blessed in that I have achieved some business success. But what's truly 
important to me is that I'm able to use the position, compensation, and incentives that go 
along with business success to help make a difference in other people's lives.</P>
<BR>
<B>HERMAN CAIN <I>is the president and chief executive officer of Godfather's Pizza, with 
more than 525 restaurants nationwide. He is the current president of the National 
Restaurant Association.</B></I>

<title>Affirmative Effort Op-Ed</title>

<h2>Affirmative Effort Op-Ed</h2>
<b>By Jack Kemp</b>
</center>
<hr>
<p>	
The scene is Washington D.C.:  a Republican President, new to the White House, defiantly throwing down the gauntlet to a Republican Congress, saying he will veto any bill that proposes to do more for "black Americans" than for "whites".
<p>
This is not some fast-forward vision of 1997, and the first days of a new Republican White House.  No, it's a flashback to 1866.  The agency to be vetoed was The Freedman's Bureau, established in President Lincoln's administration to "affirmatively" assist the recently emancipated African Americans.  The President -- Andrew Johnson, Mr. Lincoln's successor,  worried that any "affirmative action" would hurt the white population by specifically helping "negroes".
<p>
I offer this page out of history not to prove once again that, politically, there is not much new under the sun, but to illustrate that the issues of race and equality are woven into the very essence of our American experience.  While our present-day passions on the subject of affirmative action open old wounds -- they summon us to moral leadership of Lincolnesque proportions.
<p>
Thus far, the summons goes unanswered by both liberals and conservatives alike.  The unreconstructed liberal notion of endless racial reparations and race-based preferences is doubly guilty:  wrong in principle, and ruinous in practice.  President Clinton's much-vaunted affirmative action review produced more of a bumper sticker than a policy; Clinton's focus-group-fashioned "mend it, not end it" slogan makes a far better rhyme than reason.  The same, however, is true of the new affirmative action "abolitionists'" position which heralds equality but seldom addresses the way to truly give all people an equal footing.  Critics are right in asserting that "Affirmative Action" quotas have contributed to the poisoning of race relations in this country:  But critics must offer much more than just opposition and reproach.  We know what they are against, but what instead are they for?  
<p>
"A color-blind society," comes their response.  Of course, the goal of equal opportunity is paramount and a worthy destiny to seek -- but to say that we have arrived at that goal is simply not true.  My friends on the Right call for a color blind society and then quote Martin Luther King's inspirational "I have a dream" speech in which he imagined a nation in which every American would be judged not on the color of his or her skin, but on the "content of his character."  But all too often they totally neglect to quote the end of his speech when he describes the painful plight of minority America:  "The Negro," Dr. King said, "lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity."
<p>
Much has changed in the thirty years since King stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.  Minority enterprises have begun to gain a foothold, although there are far too few of them.  But can any one venture to the crumbling brick and mortar of Cabrini Green Public Housing, or the fear-ridden projects of Bed-Stuy or the streets lined with the unemployed in South Central L.A. or East St. Louis, and believe that what he sees there today would pass as progress since Dr. King's day?
<p>
This is not to negate the gains made by so many in the black and minority communities, but for large numbers the situation has not only not improved in thirty years, it has grown dramatically worse -- with a welfare system that entraps rather than empowers and punishes work and marriage and prevents access to capital, credit, and property.  Reality requires that we admit two things-- difficult admissions for both liberals and conservatives:  First, that a race conscious policy of quotas and rigid preferences has helped make matters worse.  But second, and more importantly, the Good Shepherd reminds all of us that our work is not done and as we think about moving into the twenty-first century, we must not leave anyone behind.
<p>
Sound policy begins with strong principles.  Affirmative action based on quotas is wrong  -- wrong because it is antithetical to the genius of the American idea:  individual liberty.  Counting by race in order to remedy past wrongs or rewarding special groups by taking from others perpetuates and even deepens the divisions between us, but race-based politics is even more wrong and must be repudiated by men and women of civility and compassion.  	
<p>
Instead, like the "radical Republicans" of Lincoln's day, who overrode President Johnson's veto on The Freedman's Bureau, we would honor the past by creating a future more in keeping with our revolutionary founding ideals of equality.  In this way, the eventual ending of affirmative action is only a beginning -- the political predicate of a new promise of outreach in the name of greater opportunity for access to capital, credit, prosperity, jobs, and educational choice for all.
<p>
The time has definitely come for a new approach, an "affirmative action" based not just on gender or race or ethnicity, but ultimately based on need.  "Affirmative", because government authority must be employed to remove the obstacles to upward mobility and human advancement.  "Action", because democratic societies must act positively and make real equality of opportunity -- without promising the equality of reward.
<p>
Affirming opportunity in America begins with education.  America's schools, particularly our urban public schools, are depriving minority and low-income children of the education that may be their passport out of poverty.  Even the poorest parent must have the option more affluent families enjoy:  the right to send their children to the school of their choice.  Affirmative effort means ending the educational monopoly that makes poor public school students into pawns of the educational bureaucracy.  And we should be paving the way to a voucher and magnet school system of public and private school choice.
<p>
Opportunity means an entryway into the job market.  That means removing barriers for job creation and entrepreneurship and expanding access to capital and credit.  According to the Wall Street Journal, from 1982 to 1987, the number of black owned firms increased by nearly 38%, about triple the overall business growth rate during that period.  Hispanic-owned businesses soared by 81%.  Women owned firms expanded by 57% and their sales nearly tripled.  Even so, of the 14 million small businesses in existence across the U.S. today, less than two percent are Black-owned.  And of 27 to 28 trillion dollars of capital in the U.S., less than one percent is in Black ownership.  Affirmative effort would take aim at expanding capital and credit as the life-blood of business formation and job creation -- including an aggressive effort to end the red-lining of our inner cities and a radical redesign of our tax code to remove barriers to broader ownership of capital, savings, and credit.
<p>
Opportunity means the ability to accumulate property.  Affirmative effort would mean an end to every federal program that penalizes the poor for  managing to save and accumulate their own assets.  An AFDC mother's thrift and foresight in putting money away for a child's future should not be penalized by the government welfare system as fraud -- as is currently the case.
<p>
Finally, real opportunity for racial and ethnic reconciliation requires an expanding economy -- one that invites the effort and enterprise of all Americans, including minorities and women.  A real pro-growth policy must include policies ranging from enterprise zones in our cities to a commitment to lowering barriers to global trade.  It should also offer relief from red tape, regulation and freedom from punitive tax policies.  Each is part of an affirmative action that can "move America forward without leaving anyone behind."
<p>
Now that we have opened a somewhat hysterical dialogue on affirmative action, we can never go back --  we can only go forward.  Our challenge is to put aside the past -- abandon the endless round of recrimination and a politics that feeds on division, exclusion, anger and envy -- and reaffirm, like Lincoln at his moment of maximum crisis, a vision of the "better angels of our nature", a big-hearted view of the nation we were always meant to become and must be if we are to enter the 21st century as the model of liberal democracy and market-oriented capitalism the world needs to see.

<title>Arresting Ideas -- Fall 95 Policy Review</title>

<h3>Tougher Law Enforcement Is Driving Down Urban Crime</h3>

<hr size=3 width=50%>

<b>John J. DiIulio Jr.</b><br>

<b>Policy Review</b><br>

<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center>

<p>

	Serious crime is declining in many big cities across America. That's the good news. Meanwhile, the country's largest and most violent cohort of young males will soon reach its crime-prone years. That's the bad news. But demography is not fate. Smarter law enforcement and tougher sentencing policies explain much of the recent drop in crime, and can minimize the damage from the next crime wave.
<p>	Between 1993 and 1994, the violent crime rate declined by 10 percent or more in eight of the 10 cities with the highest violent-crime rates (Miami, New York City, Los Angeles, Tallahassee, Baton Rouge, Little Rock, Jacksonville, and Pueblo, Colorado). In many cities, a sizable reduction in homicides accounts for much of the fall in these rates. For example, the number of murders in Atlanta, Chicago, and New Orleans together plummeted by 17 percent during the first half of 1995 compared with the same period a year ago.
<p>	New York City and Houston have enjoyed truly phenomenal drops in serious crimes, including murder. In 1992 and again in 1993, more than 1,900 homicides were committed in the Big Apple. But in 1994 New York City's  murder count fell to 1,581. Through July 1995, it suffered fewer than 700 murders, and it continued to show declines of 10 percent or more in robberies, burglaries, and most other serious crimes. Likewise, the number of people murdered in Houston declined by 32 percent during the first half of 1995 compared with same period a year ago. Rapes in Houston decreased by 21 percent, robberies by 15 percent, and the overall violent crime rate by 7 percent.
<p>	While New York City and Houston are leading the pack, other cities are catching up. During the first half of 1995, for example, the overall crime rate was down by more than 16 percent in San Francisco, 10 percent in San Antonio, and 6 percent in both Los Angeles and Philadelphia. And the number of murders declined by more than 6 percent in Philadelphia and Los Angeles, 9 percent in Detroit, and 10 percent in Boston and St. Louis.
<p>	What is going on here? Some criminologists dismiss the recent improvement in the crime rate as a mere statistical fluke. But it is hard to imagine that these downward trends, occurring in consecutive years in given jurisdictions, could have happened by chance. Others insist that the slide in crime rates is greased by a dwindling population of teenage boys. There is something to this claim, but it ignores the inconvenient fact that Houston and some other places with growing populations of at-risk youth have nonetheless experienced sharp reductions in crime.
<p>	Finally, a few criminologists have rushed to relate the dive in crime rates to everything from a sudden surge in the efficacy of gun control laws (which is patently absurd) to changes in the patterns of drug use (for example, the decline in crack-cocaine use which, they insist, has had nothing to do with anti-drug law enforcement). One much-quoted criminologist has even declared, "What goes up must come down."
<p>
<b>Bratton's Law: Enforcement Counts</b>
<p>	In many cities, the decline in crime rates can be explained at least in part by law-enforcement efforts that capitalize on community crime-fighting initiatives and take bad guys off the streets. I call this explanation Bratton's Law in honor of New York City's police commissioner, William Bratton. Like most veteran professionals in the justice system, Bratton understands perfectly well that crime rates are not determined solely by what cops, courts, and corrections agencies do. But his impatience with criminological cant about the inefficacy of policing practices and sentencing policies on crime rates is both ennobling and enlightening. Three brief examples illustrate Bratton's Law in action.
<P><ul>

<li><b>Jacksonville.</b> In July 1991, Harry L. Shorenstein became state attorney for the Fourth Judicial Circuit in Jacksonville, Florida. At that time Jacksonville was besieged by violent crime, much of it committed by juvenile offenders. In the year before Shorenstein arrived, juvenile arrests had risen by 27 percent, but most young habitual criminals were released quickly. Jacksonville's finest were doing their best to remove serious young criminals from the streets, but the rest of the system was not following suit.
<p>	Then, in March 1992, Shorenstein instituted an unprecedented program to prosecute and incarcerate dangerous juvenile offenders as adults. In most parts of the country, juvenile criminals for whom the law mandates adult treatment are not actually eligible for state prison sentences and are routinely placed on probation without serving any jail time. But Shorenstein's program was for real. He assigned 10 veteran attorneys to a new juvenile-prosecutions unit. Another attorney, funded by the Jacksonville Sheriffs Office, was assigned to prosecute repeat juvenile auto thieves.
<p>	By the end of 1994, the program had sent hundreds of juvenile offenders to Jacksonville's jails and scores more to serve a year or more in Florida's prisons. Jacksonville's would-be juvenile street predators got the message, and the effect of deterrence soon appeared in the arrest statistics. From 1992 to 1994, total arrests of juveniles dropped from 7,184 to 5,475. From 1993 to 1994, juvenile arrests increased nationwide and by over 20 percent in Florida. But Jacksonville had a 30 percent decrease in all juvenile arrests, including a 41 percent decrease in juveniles arrested for weapons offenses, a 45 percent decrease for auto theft, and a 50 percent decrease for residential burglary. Although Jacksonville still has a serious violent crime problem, the number of people murdered there during the first half of this year declined by 25 percent compared with the same period a year ago.<p>
<li><b>Houston.</b> Almost a thousand officers have been added to the city's police force since 1991. Led by Police Chief Sam Nuchia, Houston has a cost-effective police overtime program that puts more cops on the street when and where they are most needed. Residents of Washington, D.C., which fields the highest number of police officers per capita of any major city, know that more police manpower does not necessarily produce less crime or better police performance. But in Houston, Nuchia has used the additional manpower to jump-start community anti-crime activities.
<p>	To cite just one example, Houston's Citizen Patrol Program has operated in more than a hundred of the city's neighborhoods. Among other things, thousands of citizen patrollers have observed and reported suspicious or criminal behavior, from assaults to narcotics dealing to vandalism. Many once-troubled neighborhoods have gone as long as three consecutive months without needing to call for police service. Indeed, two recent studies found that Nuchia's enforcement efforts not only contributed to Houston's falling crime rates, but also improved police emergency response times, raised police productivity, and reduced citizens' fear of crime.<p>
<li><b>New York City.</b> Like Houston, New York City has greatly expanded its police force. Since 1990, the NYPD has grown by 7,000 officers. Under Bratton, police have been directed to crack down on public drinking, graffiti, vandalism, and other public disorders. The NYPD has beefed up action against street gangs and drug traffickers, returned to a policy of frisking suspects for guns and other weapons, and redoubled precinct-level efforts on a wide range of community-policing projects.<p>
	In the process, Bratton has promoted a new breed of precinct commanders and made them responsible for finding innovative, cost-effective ways of serving citizens and cutting crime in their neighborhoods. Despite recent corruption scandals, the precinct-based management system is working, NYPD morale is high, and New Yorkers are getting results that range from fewer aggressive panhandlers to fewer shootings and murders.
</ul><p>
<b>Criminologically Correct</b>
<p>	Why, then, are many criminologists so unwilling to admit that law enforcement can cut crime? Part of the answer is that more than a dozen major empirical studies over the last two decades have failed to demonstrate either that police manpower and crime rates vary inversely or that particular types of community-oriented policing practices prevent crime. The most famous of these studies is the Kansas City, Missouri, "preventive-patrol" experiment.
<p>	For a year in the early 1970s, Kansas City was divided into three areas, each of which received a different level of auto patrol. The 1974 report on the experiment found that criminal activity, reported crime, rates of victimization (as measured in a follow-up survey), citizen fear, and satisfaction with the police were about the same in all three areas. Active auto patrol -- beats where cars cruised the streets conspicuously two to three times more frequently than in the control areas --  no difference at all.
<p>But academic experts who treat such negative findings as the final words on the subject are badly mistaken. George L. Kelling of Northeastern University, the father of the Kansas City research and many other major studies, recently cautioned his colleagues that "generalizing from a study about a specific tactic to other tactics or uses of police is inappropriate." As Kelling observed, "random preventive patrol by automobile for the purpose of creating a feeling of police omnipresence" is a relic of "mid-century policing tactics."
<p>Kellling has scolded those "academic ideologists" in criminology who "do not let research interfere with their conclusions." He keenly characterizes as defeatist dogma their views that "crime stems from basic structural features of society, and until problems like homelessness, social injustice, economic inequalities, and racism are addressed, police impact on crime will be negligible."
<p>	As a matter of ideology, denying that law enforcement counts in cutting crime may be trendy, but the policy science of the subject remains far from settled. Following an exhaustive review of the empirical literature on policing, David H. Bayley of SUNYAlbany recently concluded that there has never been "a rigorous, clear-cut test of the association between the visible presence of the police and crime rates." Bayley is now in the early stages of a quasi-experimental study designed to test this relationship while controlling for demographic and other variables related to the incidence of crime. Such fine-tuned research on patrol presence, policing strategies, crime rates, and other key variables has become possible only in the past few years with the development of computer-assisted information systems for police dispatching and management.
<p>	Bayley's cutting-edge research will help to identify the general conditions under which tactics and increases in police manpower can curb public disorders and cut crime. For now, there is no solid evidence to dismiss, and every practical reason to uphold, Bratton's Law.
<p>
<b>Wattenberg's Law: Prison Works</b>
<p>	By the same token, there is tremendous empirical support for another proposition that many criminologists reflexively reject: Sentencing policies that keep violent and repeat criminals behind bars contribute mightily to reductions in crime.
<p>	I call this proposition Wattenberg's Law in honor of Ben Wattenberg, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a nationally syndicated columnist. As Wattenberg has quipped, "A thug in prison can't shoot your sister." Whatever else incarceration buys us in the way of criminal deterrence, rehabilitation, or retribution, it most definitely pays dividends by preventing crimes that prisoners would commit if they were free.
<p>	The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics has reported that fully 94 percent of state prisoners have committed one or more violent crimes or served a previous sentence in jail or on probation. Between 1980 and 1993, violent offenders were the greatest contributors to state prison population growth.
<p>	Even so, today more convicted violent offenders are serving time on probation and parole than in prison. About a third of all violent crime arrestees are on probation, parole, or pretrial release at the time of their arrest. Recent studies by me and others estimate that most prisoners commit between 12 and 21 serious crimes a year when on the loose.
<p>	From 1980 to 1992, the aggregate violent-crime rate in the 10 states where incarceration climbed the most decreased by 8 percent. In the 10 states with the lowest increases in incarceration, violent crime soared, in aggregate, 51 percent. A study published in Science calculated that in 1989 alone, the increased use of imprisonment spared Americans an estimated 66,000 rapes, 323,000 robberies, 380,000 assaults, and 3.3 million burglaries. In a research report targeted against California's three-strikes law (life without parole for thrice-convicted felons), the RAND Corp. conservatively estimated that the measure would spare Californians about 340,000 serious crimes a year.
<p>	Nationally, state prisoners convicted of violent crimes who were released in 1988 had served an average of only 43 percent of their sentences in confinement. Violent convicts released in 1992 had served an average of 48 percent of their time behind bars. And violent offenders released from state prisons this year will have served, on average, 50 to 52 percent of their time in confinement. This slow but steady increase in incarceration is the result of a nationwide trend toward tougher sentencing policies, and has already spared millions of Americans from serious crimes.
<p>	It is not yet possible to calculate precisely how much tougher incarceration policies have contributed to falling crime rates in particular cities. But in explaining New York City's falling crime rate, consider the fact that roughly half of New York's state prison population, and an even larger fraction of its violent offender population, comes from New York City. Over the last decade, the Empire State's prison rolls have more than doubled, and the amount of time served behind bars by violent and repeat criminals has increased by as much as 50 percent.
<p>
<b>DiIulio's Law: Be Prepared</b>
<p>	Apparently, it takes a Ph.D. in criminology to doubt that keeping dangerous criminals incarcerated cuts crime and to wonder whether releasing any significant fraction of the nation's 1 million prisoners tonight would result in more serious crime tomorrow.
<p>	But criminologists are right about one thing: Americans are sitting on a demographic crime bomb. Most predatory street crimes are committed by men under 25. Today there are about 7.5 million males aged 14 to 17. By the year 2000, we will have an additional 500,000. About 6 percent of young males are responsible for half the serious crimes committed by their age group. Thus, in five years we can expect at least 30,000 more young murderers, rapists, and muggers on the streets than we have today. Worse, since the 1950s each generational cohort of young male criminals has committed about three times more crime than the one before. Despite the recent decline in murder rates, homicides committed by 14- to 17-year-olds between 1985 and 1993 increased by 165 percent (more for minority males). The next wave of homicidal and near-homicidal violence among urban youth is bound to reach adjacent neighborhoods, inner-ring suburbs, and even the rural heartland.
<p>	This crime bomb probably cannot be defused. The large population of seven- to 10-year-old boys now growing up fatherless, Godless, and jobless -- and surrounded by deviant, delinquent, and criminal adults -- will give rise to a new and more vicious group of predatory street criminals than the nation has ever known. We must therefore be prepared to contain the explosion's force and limit its damage.
<p>	While there is some room for reasonable disagreements about policy tactics -- for example, whether the federal role in crime control should be expanded, or whether we should invest more in drug treatment or drug interdiction -- any effective anti-crime policy must advance one or more of three interlocking anti-crime strategies: hardening targets, targeting the hardened, and targeting resources.
<p>	<b>Hardening the Target.</b> Over the last decade or so, most Americans have taken steps to make the places where they live, work, go to school, or recreate impervious to crime. People have moved out of high-crime neighborhoods, installed anti-burglary devices, made crime-sensitive investment decisions, and lectured their children to be mindful of dangers. Businesses and the 32 million Americans who now live in privately governed residential communities have erected security gates and employed more than a million private security guards. 
<p>	Neighborhoods of every socioeconomic description have formed "town watch" associations and citizen patrol groups. And the poorest of the inner-city poor have battled the ACLU for the right to target-harden their homes, schools, and parks: They erect concrete barriers on streets frequented by drug dealers and prostitutes, evict convicted street thugs from public housing, install metal detectors, and institute random locker searches in public high schools, and more.
<p>	Though to a degree hard to quantify, such initiatives have contributed to recent decreases in crime rates and, over time, insulated us somewhat from the failures of our system of justice. But as the next crime wave approaches, we may well be nearing the limit of what private target-hardening measures can do to foster public safety.
<p>	Government at all levels, therefore, should do whatever can be done to bolster these protective measures. To offer just two of many possible examples, urban zoning decisions should begin to take into account the criminal consequences of permitting liquor outlets to be so heavily concentrated in high-crime, inner-city neighborhoods. Likewise, urban enterprise zones make sense as ways of giving <i>de facto</i> tax credits to businesses willing to locate in high-crime places.
<p><b>Targeting the Hardened.</b> At the same time, we must redouble our efforts to keep violent and repeat criminals behind bars. To consolidate and expand recent gains, we must be vigilant not only in pushing for truth-in-sentencing and three-strikes measures, but seeing to it that these laws are followed both in letter and in spirit.
	<p>Make no mistake: The counter-offensive against tougher sentencing policies is well underway. Aided and abetted by activist federal judges, prisoners' rights activists, journalists, and academic "experts," efforts are already being made to depict these laws as failures and to deny or disparage any suggestion that they have helped account for recent drops in crime rates.
<p>	But just ask the criminals. In California this year, within several months after the three-strikes law went into effect, an increasing number of parolees began to request inter-state transfers. Likewise, even before Washington State's three-strikes law hit the books in 1993, dozens of sex offenders called the Seattle Police Department with questions about what crimes might count as "strikes." As one career criminal told the detective in charge of the department's sex-offender unit, "It wasn't until [the three-strikes law] passed that I had to say to myself, 'Damn, these people are serious now.'"
<p>	As the next crime wave draws near, we must remain deadly serious about targeting hardened adult and juvenile criminals for arrest, prosecution, and incarceration. Anti-incarceration propagandists can be counted on to work overtime with much-publicized tales like the one about the California man whose "third strike" was stealing a slice of pizza from a child in a mall. They failed to note, however, that this criminal had four prior convictions.
<p>	Likewise, the anti-incarcerationists are sure to repeat canards about how tougher sentencing policies will bankrupt the country and result in massive prison overcrowding. In truth, we now spend less than half a penny of every tax dollar on prisons, and the costs of prisons can be reduced greatly by cutting back on inmate amenities and services that account for more than half of the prison budget in many states. 
<p>	As for "overcrowding," despite the growth in the prison population, fewer prisons today are operating over their rated capacity (the number of inmates they were designed to hold) than in 1990. And contrary to popular assertions, there is no systematic empirical evidence to show that double-celling raises the risk of prison disorders, inmate illness, or other serious problems.
<p>	Congress is taking steps to target the hardened, as it considers Title III of the Violent Criminal Incarceration Act adopted by the House last February. Known as the Stop Turning Out Prisoners or STOP law, this measure would prohibit activist federal judges from arbitrarily imposing prison caps that result each year in the early release of tens of thousands of dangerous criminals whose return to the streets results in murder and mayhem.
<p><b>Targeting Resources.</b> Whatever government does henceforth to combat crime should be done in a targeted fashion. It makes no sense, for example, to heed President Clinton's call for spending $8.8 billion in federal dollars for "100,000 cops." As I and many other analysts have proven, not only will that amount not pay for or even seed the funding of anything near 100,000 police officers, but the Justice Department's grant process is rigged to deliver lots of money to small cities that have enough cops and little crime. By the same token, however, it makes even less sense to follow the Republican alternative of dumping more than $10 billion on the states in open-ended anticrime block grants.
<p>	So here is DiIulio's Law: Over the next five years, as our euphoria over good news about crime fades and a public panic to "do something" about youth crime begins, let us prepare to honor the overarching conservative principle that government should never spend money it does not have for purposes it has not clearly articulated in order to generate results that cannot easily be evaluated.

	The Legal Services Corp. (LSC) exists ostensibly to provide legal counsel in civil matters to people who cannot afford it. Since it was set up as a quasi-independent government corporation in 1974, it has weathered accusations that it promotes an activist, ideological agenda at the expense of its poor clients, and it has survived numerous attempts at abolition or reform.<p>
	Now the House Budget Committee, under the leadership of its chairman, Congressman John Kasich of Ohio, has proposed to phase out its annual appropriation, currently at $400 million, over the next two years. American Bar Association President George Bushnell has defended the program and has called LSC critics "reptilian bastards." Numerous defenders of the LSC have taken to the floor of Congress to denounce proposals to trim funding for the agency on the grounds that without it, America's poor will be deprived of civil legal representation.<p>
	We offer a twofold answer. First, Americans should realize that the LSC is not the noble bulwark of the rights of the poor that its supporters claim. Its effectiveness at serving the poor has always been marred by its pursuit of a political agenda that wastes effort and money and at times works to the long-term detriment of the poor. <p>
	Second, alternatives to the LSC do exist. Private legal-aid societies predated federally-funded legal services by almost 90 years, and would be thriving today had the lure of federal money not ensnared many of them. Other alternatives flourish in spite of the hostility of groups such as LSC grantees and the organized bar.<p>
	On a political level, the legal-services "movement," as it styles itself, is a 30-year success story. Since its founding as part of Lyndon Johnson's "War on Poverty," it has pursued its agenda virtually unimpeded. It has withstood budget cuts and a challenge to its existence in the Reagan years, when it waged an extensive "survival campaign." During the 1990s, it has enjoyed increasing appropriations. Its grantees receive an additional $255 million per year (as of 1993) from state and local governments, money from interest on many accounts that lawyers hold in trust for their clients (known as IOLTA funds), and private sources. Its biggest achievement, however, has been securing astronomical amounts of money for recipients of government programs. The movement, however, must face up to a crisis even greater than Republican opposition in Congress: The entire rationale for its existence is flawed:<p>
	<b>Misunderstood needs.</b> The LSC was created to provide help in civil cases. Most legal problems that poor people face fall into several basic categories: family law, including divorce, custody, guardianship, and child-support issues; housing, including disputes between landlords and tenants; financial issues, including bankruptcy, wills, estates, and credit problems; employment law; public benefits; prisoner rights; and immigration.<p>
  LSC supporters say that if it were not for the LSC, the 1.6 million poor people it assisted last year would be without any legal recourse whatsoever. The LSC itself proclaims its inadequacy to meet the needs of the poor by asserting that demand for its services vastly outstrips the $400 million provided by the federal government. The agency pleads for ever-increasing amounts of money on the basis of studies conducted by the American Bar Association (ABA) and in several states. These studies purport to show that only a minority of the legal needs of the poor are being met. The state studies asserted that the range was 14 to 23 percent of need.<p>
	Their methodology appears defective, however, because they fail to distinguish between "unmet" and "unrecognized" legal needs. Poor people were contacted randomly by phone, mail, or in person and asked whether they had problems in various areas, such as housing. If they responded that they had a problem with roaches, for instance, it was counted as an unmet legal need, even if the person had no intention of involving a lawyer in solving the problem. Under the consumer category, the most frequent problem cited was "turned down for credit." Many people are denied credit, but very few hire a lawyer. Yet, these responses were considered unmet legal needs.<p>
	<b>Misdirected agenda.</b> Even if we took these claims at face value, it's not hard to see why LSC resources don't go very far, because many LSC grantees have other plans for their money. Sixteen LSC grantees known as "support centers" provide virtually no direct legal services to the poor. They are organized to address specific issues such as housing, welfare, immigration, youth, and food. National in scope, the support centers often initiate litigation far from their offices. In 1993, the San Francisco-based National Center for Youth Law forced Arkansas to expand its child welfare system, and won $314,107 in legal fees for itself in the process. <p>	The real agenda of the federal legal-services program is "law reform." It is not to serve the needs of poor individuals, but to "rescue" the poor as a class from poverty through litigated increases in transfer payments. However well-intentioned, this mission suffers from the same contradiction as the "War on Poverty" itself. The welfare state has not led men and women out of poverty but instead created dependency and a permanent underclass. As long as the LSC dedicates itself to bolstering and expanding the welfare state, it will fail to "meet the needs" even as it defines them itself.<p>	Nevertheless, federally-funded legal services pursues its goal of law reform to effect a redistribution of income. Through class-action suits and lawsuits against local, state, and federal governments, LSC grantees have won hundreds of billions of dollars in expanded rights to welfare, Medicaid, and food-stamp benefits. In recent years, LSC grantees have sought to protect earlier gains by filing suits to obstruct or stop welfare reform in nearly every state in which it has been attempted. Yet a consensus seems to exist among political parties that the current welfare system has been eroding the family and fostering dependency for more than a generation. Expansion of benefits under the current system hardly seems like a compassionate cause on behalf of the poor.<p>	After year
s of abetting dependency by winning more social welfare benefits for more classes of people, LSC grantees have turned to pursuits overtly destructive of the poor. In dozens of cities, the legal-services movement has prevented local public-housing authorities from evicting drug dealers. LSC grantees have signed up thousands of alcoholics and substance abusers for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits. They have also litigated to protect aggressive panhandling and to establish the right to camp in city parks and streets. Some legal-services litigation has undermined parental rights and family cohesion. For example, some LSC grantees have sued to force housing authorities to lease apartments to unmarried minors.<p>	
<b>Bureaucratic structure.</b> The LSC is wedded to providing services by the so-called "staff attorney" model, which is essentially a bureaucratic model. A legal-services office is manned by lawyers who are employed by the program. An indigent person walks in the door, describes his or her problem, and a legal-services attorney decides whether to take the case. The LSC grantee is under no obligation to render assistance, and often does not. Instead of setting priorities in response to individual needs, LSC grantees may select cases according to their potential for advancing a social agenda.<p><b>A Prime Alternative </b><p>	In evaluating how the LSC is doing, it is worthwhile to look at two groups in Indianapolis that provide legal help to the poor. The Indianapolis Legal Aid Society (ILAS) was founded in 1941 and last year received all of its $458,000 budget from private sources, primarily the United Way. The Legal Services Organization of Indiana (LSOI), on the other hand, was founded in 1966 as part of the federal legal-services program. Last year it received 84 percent of its $4.5 million budget in grants from the LSC, and another 12 percent from other government sources.<p>
	One might think that the group with the larger budget does a more effective job serving the poor. Unfortunately, it does not. In 1994, ILAS handled 6,079 cases while LSOI says that it handled 12,347. (A LSOI brochure complains that it was forced to reject over 6,000 additional cases "due to budgetary restraints.") The private group handled one-half as many cases on one-tenth of the LSC grantee's budget. That works out to an expenditure of $75 per case for ILAS and $367 for LSOI.<p>
	A closer look at these figures, however, may point to an even greater disparity. The ILAS figure of 6,079 includes only those cases that were actually contested, whether they went to trial or not. It does not include consultations and referrals. On the other hand, the LSOI figure of 12,347 appears to include brief consultations and the like. It reported to the LSC that it closed only 1,273 litigated cases in 1994! <P>
	ILAS materials state that it is "non-partisan and non-ideological" and does not engage in class-action suits. On the other hand, LSOI employs a full-time lobbyist and has, for example, filed a class action suit to stop implementation of Indiana governor Evan Bayh's welfare-reform plan.<p>
	Another difference is that ILAS does not take cases on behalf of individuals seeking benefits under government welfare programs. Public-benefits cases are a significant part of the LSOI caseload, and they are sometimes zealously pursued. For instance, LSOI sued Indiana in 1993 to continue AFDC benefits to a parent even though her children had been removed from the home because she failed to exercise responsibility for their care. <p>
<b>Life after the LSC</b><p>	The most remarkable thing about the private ILAS is that it exists at all. Private legal-aid societies like ILAS numbered in the hundreds across the country until the 1960s, when the federal government began offering direct grants to legal aid organizations <a href="#destroy">(See sidebar)</a>. ILAS was in the minority that resisted. Since 1974, each LSC grantee has enjoyed automatic refunding. The money flows to the same agencies, often administered by the same personnel, year after year. The system has never employed competitive grant procedures. Only a handful of programs have been defunded, and the LSC has not even tried to defund one since 1986. Scant evidence exists of innovation or experimentation with different approaches to meeting the legal needs of the poor. Luckily, others within the legal profession are meeting the challenge.<p>
	 <b>Expanded "judicare."</b> A preferable alternative to the LSC's staff attorney model is "judicare," offering legal services based on the so-called British System. Under judicare, an indigent client employs the private attorney of his or her choice, who is reimbursed by the government in accordance with a set schedule of fees. The LSC has funded only a few judicare programs, presumably because they offer little opportunity to practice so-called law reform.
<p>	In 1983, long-time judicare advocate Samuel Jan Brakel made his case this way: "What point or purpose is there in having a separate legal-aid establishment for the poor, staffed overwhelmingly by young and inexperienced lawyers, armed with a socio-political agenda and a whole folklore about what poor clients want, need, or what is good for them? Why patronize low-income people in this way? Why deprive them of the diversity of views, practices, and talents that abound in the private sector? Why deny them the right to choose their own lawyers? In no other area of social or human service that I am aware of have we made such a concerted, almost perverse, effort to avoid using the resources already existent and available."<p>
	In South Carolina, the LSC funds a judicare program called Legal Services of the Fourth Judicial District. This is an excellent model for private legal aid to the poor. Covering six counties, the program contracts with fifty-two private attorneys who receive referrals from a staff member in each county. According to the South Carolina Bar Foundation, last year the other five LSC programs in the state budgeted between 42 percent and 50 percent of their resources to direct client services, whereas the Fourth Judicial District group budgeted 68 percent.<p>
	Executive Director Robert Adams claims that he offers better service, too. "By offering the services of 52 panel attorneys, we feel the clients have access to a diversity of legal expertise instead of limiting them to a few staff attorneys." Adams also points out that new attorneys starting practices in small communities have benefited and have seen clients return as paying clients. Adams also notes that "our program has never been involved in class action suits, abortions, or fee generating cases."<p>
	<b><i>Pro bono</i> legal work.</b> While overstating legal needs of the poor, LSC proponents understate services that are already available, particularly in the amount level of <i>pro bono</i> legal work. <i>Pro bono</i> is a shortening of <i>pro bono publico</i> which means "for public good." It refers to legal help rendered to a client by a private attorney for no fee or a reduced fee.
<p>	The LSC underplays the amount of free legal work that is done in order to aggrandize the agency's importance. In May 1995, LSC chairman Douglas Eakeley and LSC president Alex Forger testified in Congress that 130,000 attorneys do <i>pro bono</i> work. But this figure is the number of attorneys who are formally enrolled in organized pro bono programs affiliated with LSC grantees.<p>
	The actual number doing <i>pro bono</i> work, including work on an ad hoc basis, is much higher. Although no national study exists, studies in individual states provide some useful data. A 1991 study by the State Bar of California reported that 64 percent of its members engaged in some form of voluntary, uncompensated legal work. A 1994 New York State Bar Association report put the figure at 49 percent. The American Bar Foundation places the total number of attorneys in the United States in 1995 at 896,000. If one adopts a rather conservative assumption that at least 40 percent engage in <i>pro bono</i> work, the number is 358,400, between two and three times the number cited by Eakeley and Forger.
<p>	Eakeley and Forger went on to testify that "<i>pro bono</i> services from private attorneys are at an all-time high primarily because of the efforts of the organized bar, the LSC, and local programs to involve private attorneys in the delivery of legal services." They were correct in pointing out that <i>pro bono</i> is at an all time high, but wrong to award the LSC a central role. During the 1980s, the ABA put a new stress on attorneys' <i>pro bono</i> obligation. A 1988 ABA resolution asked all attorneys to devote at least 50 hours per a year. An ABA directory of <i>pro bono</i> programs published in 1984 had 300 entries. The 1993-94 edition contained over 900 programs and indicates that no more than 375 of the programs are substantially supported by LSC grantees. (Some grantees are involved with more than one program.) Thus, the majority of <i>pro bono</i> programs would exist without the LSC and they are today more numerous than all the programs existing in 1984.
<p>	The LSC's involvement with <i>pro bono</i> largely stems from a somewhat modest attempt in the 1980s by the Reagan-appointed LSC board to provide competition to the staff-attorney system. Grantees were required to establish a "private-attorney involvement program," on which they must spend 12.5 percent of their annual federal grant. The attitude of the legal-services "movement" toward pro bono has often been hostile. Some LSC <i>pro bono</i> programs are notoriously inefficient. For instance, Legal Services Organization of Indiana managed to spend $408,867 in 1994 on a program that supposedly relied on voluntary help. It closed just 668 cases at an average cost of $612 per case.
<p>	Legal-services groups can only assist clients whose annual income is within 125 percent of the poverty level. Often, individuals cannot afford a lawyer, but have incomes which exceed this level. For example, Bay Area Legal Services, the LSC grantee in Tampa, Florida, was turning away a hundred legitimate cases a week because the clients earned too much. In response, 35-year-old real-estate attorney Mike Bedke sought to address the problem by launching the Courthouse Assistance Project. Except for office space provided by the Clerk of the Hillsborough County Court, the program receives no government support. It is staffed by volunteer attorneys who help 300 individuals per month right in the Courthouse on a first-come, first-served basis. Attorneys answer questions, help people fill out forms, and tell them what to expect in court. According to Bedke, "A lot of times we don't even have to help them file a lawsuit. It's a matter of resolving a dispute over the phone, writing a letter for them, or directing them to a particular agency."<p>
	Bedke, a board member of Bay Area Legal Services, says that Bay Area directors worried that the new program would compete for resources, but that he has found a "new class" of volunteers to staff the project. Bedke explains that many attorneys felt that Bay Area represented "welfare queens" and that they are much more willing to help clients who have jobs and are trying to get ahead. Through his position as chairman of the ABA's Young Lawyers Division, Bedke has been seeking to spread the program to other cities; so far 14 have emulated the Tampa project. Another two dozen have expressed interest.
<P>	Bedke says part of his inspiration came from a six-year-old Richmond, Virginia, project aimed specifically at the working poor. Hunton & Williams, the largest law firm in southeastern United States, opened an office in a basement in a distressed Richmond neighborhood.<p>
	Last year, the office handled about 600 client representations for a flat $50 fee, plus out-of-pocket expenses. For every reduced-fee client representation, the office handled two to three more consultations free of charge, usually resulting in some resolution short of legal action or a referral to another agency. Clients may earn up to twice the LSC eligibility level, although eligibility is not strenuously investigated, freeing time for the staff to work on actual cases. According to George H. Hettrick, a partner in the firm, "We believe the $50 fee is a good thing for the client. That person feels like a real client and not the recipient of charity. When people are given dignity, it fosters a more successful lawyer-client relationship."
<p>	The Hunton & Williams office in Church Hill receives no government support whatsoever. It is staffed by 60 of the firm's lawyers, who put in an average of 40 to 60 hours per year. The office handles housing, family, and guardianship cases, three types of cases shunned by private attorneys. In the housing category, the office not only handles landlord/tenant disputes, but also closings for first time home buyers, and the closings for the new owners of homes built or rehabilitated by Habitat for Humanity and other housing programs.
<p>
	<b>Alternative dispute resolution.</b> More and more poor people are avoiding legal services altogether by turning to Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). Informal ADR procedures like conciliation, arbitration, and mediation have enjoyed explosive growth in recent years. <p>
	The programs run the gamut from taxpayer-supported programs affiliated with state court systems to private, neighborhood programs. In New York, all 62 counties now have a Community Dispute Resolution Center. Each center is a private, nonprofit agency with a contract with the state court system. The program was established in 1981 with the support of both liberals and conservatives in the state legislature. By 1988, every county had one. Each currently receives up to 50 percent of its budget from the state. The balance is raised from local governments and private sources, like the United Way. New York will provide a total of $3.1 million for fiscal year 1995. 
<p>	Administered by a staff of four in Albany, the program depends on 2,254 trained volunteer mediators from all walks of life, including housewives and retirees. Most are nonlawyers. By any measure, the statistics quoted by the program's statewide office are impressive. In fiscal year 1994, the centers conducted 25,015 conciliations, mediations, and arbitrations involving 63,210 people. The first step is conciliation, where an attempt is made to work out the problem by phone or mail. If that doesn't work, the parties actually meet face-to-face with a mediator present. In 79 percent of the matters that reached the mediation stage, a voluntary agreement was reached. If there is still no resolution, the parties go to arbitration. <P>
	In fiscal year 1994, it took 16 days from the intake to final disposition for the average single-hearing case and 41 days for the average multi-hearing case. There were 13,609 cases involving a single hearing and just 623 requiring more than one. The average time per mediation or arbitration was one hour and 11 minutes. The average cost to the state for each case screened as appropriate for dispute resolution was $68. The average state cost per conciliation, mediation, and arbitration was $121. The centers reported $2,919,276 awarded in fiscal year 1994 in restitution and through mutual agreements. The average award per case was $788.
<p>	The centers are open to anyone. State courts make both voluntary and mandatory referrals, accounting for about half of the caseload. Clients may seek advice from lawyers, but very few disputants use them. A review of the disputes handled shows that they include those common to the poor. Thirty-four percent involved allegations of harassment, 24 percent alleged breach of contract, 7 percent housing, 7 percent interpersonal disputes, 7 percent assault, 4 percent personal or real property, and 4 percent custody, support, or visitation.<p>
	Interestingly, many dispute-resolution programs handle minor criminal cases. Thus, the approach to dispute resolution is comprehensive. Its goal is to prevent the escalation of problems, especially among people who know each other. A mutually acceptable resolution of a simple trespass case can prevent an assault later on. Sixteen percent of the disputes were between neighbors, 15 percent between acquaintances, 13 percent between tenants and landlords, 9 percent between consumers and merchants, 6 percent between family members, 4 percent between former boyfriends and girlfriends, and 4 percent between strangers. <p>
	According to the National Institute for Dispute Resolution, 27 states have formally incorporated various ADR methods into their court systems, up from just 10 in 1980. The National Center for State Courts reports that at least 1,200 programs around the nation are receiving referrals from state courts.
<p>	 One doesn't have to live in New York to take advantage of ADR. "Neighborhood justice centers" now exist in many urban areas around the country. Some receive support from local governments and some are privately funded. Some receive referrals from local courts and some do not. What they have in common is a minimum of bureaucracy and a reliance on volunteers to serve as third-party referees. The federal role in the development of these institutions is instructive. In 1978, the Justice Department dispensed 18-month seed grants to three neighborhood justice programs in Kansas City, Atlanta, and Los Angeles. Smaller grants were also provided for another year of operation. But in contrast to the automatic refunding enjoyed by LSC grantees, the programs were on their own in the third year. The programs survived and centers in other cities blossomed with no federal seed money at all. Today, there are several hundred community and neighborhood justice centers. The National Association for Community Mediation has 150 programs in 37 states.<p>
<b>	Services by nonlawyers.</b> Along with ADR, nonlawyer practice (NLP) is growing rapidly. Independent paralegals and other specialists are performing tasks previously reserved for licensed attorneys. Nonlawyer practitioners handle such matters as uncontested divorces, wills, estates, bankruptcies, real estate closings, child custody and support, and immigration problems. They appear before 38 federal agencies. Many LSC-eligible clients take advantage of these services. Help Abolish Legal Tyranny (HALT), a Washington-based legal reform advocacy group, estimates that 5,000 independent paralegals (paralegals not employed by an attorney) are currently working in private practice. 
<p>	There would be more if not for the bitter opposition of state bar associations. These powerful groups lobby for "unauthorized practice of law" (UPL) statutes, which are on the books in every state except Arizona. The vast majority of UPL complaints are not filed by dissatisfied consumers, but by members of the bar. Not only has for-profit NLP been targeted for formal complaints, but also individuals and non-profit organizations that have been helping the poor. The most celebrated case is that of Rosemary Furman, a legal secretary who escaped going to jail in the mid-1980s. Her crime was to charge a small fee for helping battered women fill out civil protection orders and divorce forms. HALT says that it gets an average of two calls per week from nonlawyers being investigated or charged under UPL.<p>
	The LSC has fought competition from nonlawyers. In Jacksonville, Florida, nonlawyer Susan Longley operated American Legal Clinic, Inc., now known as American Documents Clinic, Inc. Among other things, Longley assisted people in the preparation of Chapter 13 bankruptcy filings. She handled a filing for Sandra Samuels for $215, saving her home from foreclosure. Jacksonville Area Legal Aid, Inc., an LSC grantee, soon after launched a successful UPL action against Longley, and in December 1994 was awarded $5,316.20 in legal fees even though the judge found that the client had not been harmed in any way.<p>
	In response to the NLP phenomena, the ABA formed a Commission on Nonlawyer Practice scheduled to make a report in 1996, but most state bar association officials remain deadset against any increased role for NLP. Most argue that clients are put at risk by nonlawyers handling legal problems. But former New Jersey Bar President Thomas Curtin was quoted in the July 3, 1995, <i>Lawyers Weekly</i>, "I have no difficulty saying my position is protecting the interests of lawyers. Why is the ABA, an organization that is supposed to working for lawyers, trying to find work for nonlawyers? That is not the business of the ABA. This is the American Bar Association, not the American Paralegal Association."
<p>	<b>Do-it-yourself.</b> In her unsuccessful fight to offer legal services, Longley was also enjoined from using any computer program or legal form designed for use by attorneys. It is easy to see why lawyers are concerned about these tools. Self-help legal publications and computer programs are enjoying expanded sales. Ralph Warner, the editor of NOLO Press of Berkeley, California, estimates that how-to legal publications are now a $50 million business. One of NOLO's most popular titles is "How to File for Bankruptcy." Another is "Plan Your Estate." Its most popular software package, allowing individuals to create their own wills, sold 60,000 last year. <p><b>What to Do?</b>
<p>	The best thing the government can do for the poor is to do away with the LSC. The agency won't go willingly, so Congress should abolish it. Additionally, care should be exercised in replacing it with something else. The potential of unintended consequences is a central lesson of the last 30 years. A number of ideas have been proposed, but should be discarded: <p><ul>	<li>"Reform" of the Legal Services Corp. No new regulations or restrictions can reform a program founded on a flawed premise <a href="#reform">(see sidebar)</a>. <li>A federal judicare program. The last thing the country needs is Medicare for lawyers. State and locally-funded judicare programs are worthy of support, particularly in rural areas.<li>Block grants to the states. Preferable to the present LSC-grant system, they may be useful during a phase out of federal funding. Block grants pose the danger, however, of preserving a federal role in legal services.<li>Mandatory <i>pro bono. Pro bono</i> should not result from coercion. It is a violation of attorneys' free association rights and undercuts the voluntary spirit necessary for successful <i>pro bono</i> work.</ul><p>
	How then should the legal needs of the poor be met? First, it should be recognized that there are certain needs the poor don't have. Without deep pockets, they seldom get sued. When injured or harmed due to the negligence of others, there is no need for a taxpayer-provided lawyer. All a victim has to do is to call the number on the television screen. Plenty of private lawyers await with open arms to take contingency cases.<p>
	Second, it should also be recognized that many of the present legal problems of the poor do not require lawyers. Deregulation of the legal profession will provide disproportionate relief to the poor. ADR and NLP are well suited for many of the kinds of problems the poor encounter.<p>
	Third, legal needs which actually require a lawyer should not be established on the basis of self-serving and nonsensical studies sponsored by federal grant recipients. It may be impossible to quantify legal needs in the first place. In our lawyer-rich society, legal problems are whatever clever lawyers decide to bring forth. Actual needs can only be established by poor people themselves exercising free choice. A federal income-tax deduction for <i>Pro bono</i> work would help make the system client-based, rather than attorney-based. Such an incentive was proposed by GOP Congressman Henry Hyde of Illinois in the early 1980s with a monetary cap on the total deduction. 
<p>	The good news is that an expansion of <i>pro bono</i> work is already underway and the legal profession has been aggressively promoting it, notwithstanding ABA support for the LSC. Ending the federal legal-services program would further oblige attorneys to assist the poor. The existence of a federal program has undoubtedly provided some attorneys with the rationale to shirk responsibilities in their own communities. A federal income tax deduction is not a panacea, however. The success of <i>pro bono</i> should not be dependent on the availability of a tax deduction, but on a renewal of the voluntary spirit of members of the bar.<p>
	 Many attorneys will be more likely to engage in <i>pro bono</i> in a structured program, and there are many areas where a storefront, walk-in office would a tremendous convenience for the poor and working poor. As is being demonstrated in Indianapolis, a private institution can serve the poor better than a public one. We should work to restore the ethos of the private legal-aid society that not dependent on government funds.<p>
	Indeed, the private legal-aid society can serve as a useful model for LSC grantees if they should lose federal funding. The transition to a nonfederal system will not be tumultuous. As noted, LSC grantees already receive $255 million from non-LSC sources. Unlike other federal programs, LSC grantees may carry over surpluses each year, and some programs have significant reserves socked away. A simple policy decision to stop doing class-action suits, public-benefits cases, advocacy, and lobbying would allow most grantees to help more poor individuals, even on a reduced budget. If programs are truly providing a valuable service, they should be able to raise money locally.<p>
	Ultimately, legal services for the poor cannot be separated from legal services for everyone. Problems of affordability and accessibility are not limited to the poor or working poor. Our society threatens to become "overrun by hordes of lawyers, hungry as locusts," as Warren Burger, the late chief justice of the Supreme Court, put it. Reducing litigation and lowering its cost through tort reform and other measures would benefit everyone. Getting lawyers out of lives of Americans, including the poor, is the real point.

<blockquote>
<a name="destroy"><b>The Destruction of Legal-Aid Societies </b></a><br>
	The Legal Aid Society of New York was the nation's first, opening its doors with one part-time attorney in 1876. Private societies numbered more than 200 by the mid-1960s and, except in a few municipalities, received no government support. Overall, about 60 percent of their financial support came from community chests, 15 percent from bar associations, and the rest from individuals and businesses.
<p>	An 89-year-old tradition of private legal aid ended in 1965 when the federal government began making direct grants to legal-aid organizations through the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), a cornerstone of Lyndon Baines Johnson's "War on Poverty." The previously private societies constituted 60 percent of the grantees of the new  federal program. 
<P>	With federal funding came dramatic change. Sargent Shriver's OEO spearheaded a shift in emphasis to "law reform," the expansion of poverty benefits through litigation. The directors and staffs of many programs resented Washington setting local priorities, but were quickly overwhelmed. The law gave the OEO powers to award grants to antipoverty agencies on any basis. <p>
	The introduction of federal funds provided huge power to the small but highly ideological OEO staff to set priorities and demand changes in local organizations. Few local aid societies and bar organizations could resist the allure of new federal funds. The annual budgets of the private legal-aid societies totaled about $4 million in 1964. The federal program initially promised an annual expenditure 10 times that amount to groups administered or heavily influenced by local bar groups. In cases where the existing legal-aid operation refused to remake itself to the OEO's liking, a competing organization was founded and funded instead. By 1967, the OEO was distributing $42 million to 300 organizations. The OEO's crash campaign resulted in a network of law offices and attorneys equal in size to the U.S. Department of Justice and all its U.S. Attorney offices.  <p>
	The OEO placed its own personnel in programs it funded through something called the Reginald Heber Smith Fellowship Program. Beginning in 1967, young attorneys were recruited and trained in the principles and tactics of "poverty law." Sent out to local grantees, the "Reggies" remained employees of the Smith program.<p>
	By 1971, 25 percent of all LSC lawyers were graduates of the program. Fred Speaker, an OEO official at the time, expressed the OEO attitude to the formerly private groups: "We are a program that six years ago rose out of the sloth of token, tired, 19th-century legal-aid societies." Private institutions were not just crowded out by public ones, but were actively undermined and infiltrated in a campaign akin to a corporate takeover.<p>	 "Law reform" proceeded at a furious pace. By 1972, some 219 cases had been brought all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court by LSC attorneys. Under the former private system, not one case had ever gone that far. Through the end of 1972, some $290 million in federal funds had been spent on legal services, but the cost to the taxpayer was actually more than $2 billion. 
<P>	In 1973, President Nixon proposed to dismantle the OEO, and appointed as its director Howard Phillips, who promptly canceled "law reform" as a goal. Congressional supporters of legal services moved to "insulate" the program from "political pressure" and sought to establish an independent Legal Service Corp. (LSC), along the lines of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Richard Nixon signed the Legal Services Corp. Act on July 25, 1974the last legislation he signed before resigning. During congressional hearings this year, LSC officials pointed out that Nixon created the LSC, but they did not mention that liberal senators were holding up funds for his Watergate defense at the time.<p>
	The new LSC has dispensed funds in much the same way as the OEO did. According to Indiana University Law Professor William F. Harvey, a director of the Indianapolis Legal Aid Society and chairman of the LSC during the 1980s, "The effort to undermine the private legal-aid societies continued under the LSC, particularly during the chairmanship of Hillary Rodham Clinton [1978-80]. The Washington-based LSC ideologues cannibalized the standards, criteria, the concepts, even the esprit de corps of America's legal-aid societies."
</blockquote><hr length=70%><P>
<hr length=70%> <blockquote>
<a name="reform"><b>Why the LSC Cannot Be Reformed (sidebar)</b></a><br>
	Responding to criticism of the Legal Services Corp. (LSC), the agency's defenders in Washington favor reform over elimination. But the LSC is not reformable. The Legal Services Corp. Act of 1974, which created the corporation, allows it to take public funds$400 million this yearand transforms them into private funds, immune from the checks that apply to other types of federal spending.
<p>	The law also established a unique, hybrid structure for the corporation that guarantees it can never be accountable. The LSC is an independent, private, nonprofit corporation that makes grants to 323 separately incorporated private nonprofit grantees. The LSC's 11-member board is appointed by the president, subject to Senate confirmation, but the board has little actual influence over the grantees and how they spend their grants. Nor does the executive branch have much influence over the LSC budget. By law, it goes straight from the LSC to Congress, and the Office of Management and Budget may only review it.<p>
	The LSC's status as a private corporation exempts it from many federal criminal laws pertaining to government officials, such as the Anti-Deficiency Act. Although it is a felony for a federal official to misappropriate federal funds, the LSC Act frustrates operation of that law by declaring that "officers and employees of the Corporation shall not be considered officers and employees" of the federal government.<p>
	From time to time, Congress and the LSC board have sought in vain to exercise oversight. Restrictions on LSC involvement in abortion, Congressional redistricting, politics, lobbying, and advocacy have been ignored or circumvented, primarily through the nonfederal funds "dodge." Since most grantees receive some funding from IOLTA and state and local governments, they are able to claim that any restricted activities are not done with their LSC funds.<p>
	There is no way to verify this because legal-services attorneys do not keep time sheets, thereby eliminating the only means of federal oversight. Furthermore, legal-services lawyers do not report the cases on which they work to anyone beyond their offices, and all case records are off limits. This secrecy, shielded by an invocation of the attorney-client privilege, prevents Congress from evaluating the effectiveness of any legal-services program. There are no provisions for the privilege to be waived for purposes of oversight, even though the overseers have paid for the services. <p>
	As a result of these factors, we have little information on expenditures by case or by category or service. While most government programs are required to have detailed accounting systems to explain how taxpayer money is used, the LSC has continued to ask for funding increases without offering any detailed evidence that previous funding has been used well.<p>
	The LSC can track the use of its grants through a monitoring program that includes on-site visits by Washington-based staff. During the Bush administration, about 125 visits took place annually, meaning the average program could expect a visit once every three years. Under the Clinton-appointed board, only six monitoring visits took place last year.<p>
	The LSC structure is ripe for abuse, and abuses will be rampant as long as it exists. It makes little difference who is in the White House, the Congress, or on the LSC board. As long as funds flow through the 323 LSC grantees, public funds will continue to be spent by private citizens pursuing a private political agenda. As Alan Houseman, a legal theorist who helped draft the 1974 Act, wrote in 1984, "Since the central directions of the program were not created by statutes or regulations, they are invariably difficult to undo by regulations and LSC policies."

<hr size=3 width=50%>

<b>John O. McGinnis</b><br>

<b>Policy Review</b><br>

<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center>

<p>

	The 1994 term of the Supreme Court cast into stark relief the performances of Justices Clarence Thomas and David Souter. Justice Thomas emerged as the boldest member of the Court in half a century -- a jurist committed to seeking the original meaning of the Constitution in lengthy and learned opinions that survey the vast scope of American constitutional history. On the other hand, Justice Souter, while continuing his move to the Court's liberal wing, tended to write jejune opinions seemingly intent on avoiding the central issues of the case. It is as if Thomas and Souter keep alive in the public sphere the paradoxical qualities of the president who appointed them both. Thomas represents the bold and fearless George Bush who prosecuted the Gulf War and stood by Thomas in his contentious confirmation hearings, while Souter represents the reticent George Bush who was inattentive to conservative principles in many areas of domestic policy.
<p>	Given the excellent prospects in 1996 for a new president inclined to appoint conservative justices, it is appropriate to analyze the differences between these justices to aid the new president in choosing nominees in the mold of Thomas rather than Souter. I then propose a few criteria for choosing the next nominee that will maximize the chances of selecting an outstanding justice who will help ensure principled constitutional governance into the next century.
<p>	Liberal and conservative commentators alike agree on one proposition about the most recent Supreme Court term: Thomas became a force to be reckoned with. Tony Mauro, a liberal Court watcher, wrote of Thomas's "bold and searching" opinions. Burt Neuborne, a professor at New York University Law School and the former director of the ACLU, was struck by Justice Thomas's "vigorous tone" in his many "interesting and important opinions." James Kilpatrick wrote of his "masterly" work. George Will gave what may be a conservative's highest accolade for a judge: Thomas's opinions, he wrote, were "Borkean."
<p>	Indeed, the most striking characteristic of Thomas's opinions was one he shares with Judge Robert Bork -- a willingness to go back to first principles to uncover the meaning of the Constitution. In case after case where the original meaning of the Constitution was put in issue by the litigants or other justices, such as those involving term limits, the extent of Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause, and the protection afforded anonymous pamphlets under the First Amendment, Thomas wrote magisterial opinions that investigated the original understanding of the Constitution in detail. To be sure, not all of his opinions investigated all possible originalist angles of a case. But this is only to be expected, given the way issues are framed on the Court. Thomas is not a law professor, completely at liberty to approach every case without reference to the framework in which his colleagues or the litigants are operating. Nevertheless, his opinions undoubtedly represent the most impressive set of originalist opinions ever written by a Supreme Court justice within a single term. 
<p>	  Thomas's opinion in <i>U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton</i> was emblematic of his approach. The issue in the case was whether the states could preclude individuals who had served a certain number of terms as a senator or member of the House of Representatives from again appearing on the ballot for that office. The Constitution sets out certain qualifications for both representatives and senators. For instance, as to members of the House of Representatives, the Constitution provides, "No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen."
<p>	The analysis in the majority opinion in <i>Thornton</i> rested on the proposition that these qualifications were exclusive. It held that term limits were unconstitutional because state law could not add qualifications relating to the number of terms a candidate had previously served. The majority asserted that its view was supported by the precedent of <i>Powell v. McCormick</i> (1969), where the Court held that Congress could not exclude Adam Clayton Powell on the basis of criteria not mentioned in the qualifications clause. The majority also argued that the structure of the Constitution as a whole reflected the sovereignty of a national people, and additional qualifications would detract from national sovereignty.
<p>	Justice Thomas shredded these arguments. First, he showed as a matter of first principle that the Constitution was adopted by the people of each state and not by the people of the nation as a whole. Thus, the people of the states are prohibited from acting only if they impose such a prohibition on themselves in the Constitution or ceded such power exclusively to the federal government. This principle of residual state sovereignty is encapsulated in the Tenth Amendment: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."
<p>	Thomas showed that the Tenth Amendment was expressly designed to rebut inferences like the one the majority attempted to draw from the qualifications clause. Because the Constitution simply provides a set of minimal qualifications for representatives and senators and nowhere prohibits the states from adding additional qualifications, the Tenth Amendment shows that the states are free to make additions. As Thomas wrote, "All powers that the Constitution neither delegates to the Federal Government nor prohibits to the States are controlled by the people of each state."
<p>	Once it is established that the federal government is a government of enumerated powers while the state governments are governments of residual powers, the term-limits case is easily decided. In particular, it is clear that the precedent in <i>Powell v. McCormick</i> is no bar to state term limits. Congress simply lacks an enumerated power to impose additional qualifications, whereas the states reserve the power to add additional qualifications because nowhere in the Constitution did they surrender that power. 
<p>	The opinion in <i>Thornton</i> was not Thomas's only originalist <i>tour de force</i> of the term. In <i>United States v. Lopez</i>, he wrote a concurrence that was the most interesting judicial explication of the Commerce Clause in more than half a century. In <i>Lopez</i>, the Court invalidated (as beyond Congress's power under the Commerce Clause) a federal statute that prohibited the possession of a gun within 500 feet of a school. Justice William Rehnquist's majority opinion essentially reasoned that education was not commerce and therefore held inapplicable the long line of cases in which the Court has interpreted the Commerce Clause to permit Congress to regulate any activity which has "substantial effects" on interstate commerce.
<p>	Thomas's opinion was more sweeping. He called for a reconsideration of the "substantial effects on interstate commerce" test because it was inconsistent with the original meaning of the Commerce Clause. First, Thomas showed that the modern test used a meaning of "commerce" that encompassed all economic activity, whereas the meaning of "commerce" at the time of the Framing was limited to trading and exchange, as distinct from other productive activities such as manufacturing and farming. Second, Thomas observed that permitting Congress to regulate all activities "affecting" interstate commerce deprives many of the words contained in the clause of independent force. Moreover, most of the rest of the authorities granted to Congress under Article I would also be superfluous under the "affecting commerce" test. Why give Congress particular authority to regulate bankruptcy, since insolvency self-evidently affects economic activity among the states? 
<p>	Thomas did not settle on a precise test for Congress's authority over interstate commerce, explicitly recognizing the difficulty of recovering the original meaning of the Commerce Clause in light of decades of nonoriginalist precedent. Describing the exact contours of an improved jurisprudence concerning the Commerce Clause was appropriately left to a future opinion, where that test could command a majority of the Court.
<p>	Some commentators have labeled as radical Thomas's opinions in <i>Lopez</i> and other cases this term. But these opinions are radical only in the sense of going back to the original roots of the Constitution. They are, in fact, an attempt to begin to erase the decades of radicalism during the Roosevelt and Warren Courts, which transformed the Constitution into a hollow likeness of its former self. The Constitution fashioned by those courts reflected the enthusiasm of the New Deal and the Great Society for a powerful, centralized government to act as the engine of social democracy and collectivist reforms. Accordingly, the pillars of the original Constitution, such as federalism, the separation of powers, and property rights, that seemed to be roadblocks to social democracy were weakened and, in some cases, eviscerated. Now that centralized and collectivist solutions to social problems are increasingly seen as a snare and a delusion, it is not surprising that the Constitution of the Framers -- designed to sustain only the limited, centralized government necessary to maximize the protection of individual rights -- is beginning to reappear. Thomas has become one of the leading restorers of the original canvas, stripping away in opinion after opinion the obscuring varnish that has accumulated over the last 50 years. 
<p>	Thomas also wrote a profoundly originalist concurrence in <i>McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission</i>. At issue was whether Ohio could restrict anonymous election pamphlets. The majority, in an opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens (over a dissent by Justice Antonin Scalia), invalidated such restrictions because of the value of anonymous pamphleteering to political discourse and because of the long tradition of such pamphleteering. Refusing to join the majority opinion, Thomas wrote a concurrence in which he analyzed whether the freedom of speech as understood at the time of the Framing protected the right of anonymous political speech. Reviewing an enormous amount of political discourse, he demonstrated that the Framers themselves relied on anonymity to "a remarkable extent" in their advocacy of the Constitution with only one or two pieces signed in their original name. Moreover, he unearthed an important controversy about anonymous political speech between the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists in Philadelphia in 1787. There the Federalists backed down from an attempt to prohibit anonymous speech in the face of claims that such a prohibition "reversed the important doctrine of freedom of the press." Given the pervasiveness of anonymous political speech and its triumph over legal restrictions in the years immediately preceding the adoption of the First Amendment, Thomas concluded that anonymous pamphleteering was protected by the concept of freedom of speech. 
<p>	Nor was <i>McIntyre</i> the only case in which Justice Thomas deployed originalism to protect civil liberties. In <i>Wilson v. Arkansas</i>, Justice Thomas held for a unanimous Court that the Fourth Amendment reflected the "knock and announce principle" at common law at the time of the Framing. The Fourth Amendment therefore permitted unannounced searches only in circumstances where that venerable principle permitted them -- instances when there were strong countervailing exigencies or considerations. 
	<p><i>McIntyre</i> and <i>Wilson</i> discredit the familiar claim of liberal commentators that Thomas is hostile to civil liberties. He is fearless in sustaining the liberties that the Constitution protects. Indeed, we can look forward to his sharp analysis as the Court revisits liberties such as those contained in the Contract Clause that were conveniently discarded by the "civil libertarians" of the post-New Deal era. 
<p>	Thomas was also a strong voice on matters of civil rights. His opinions in that area were less elaborate than his originalist analyses of the Constitution, but no less forceful. In the most important civil-rights case this term, <i>Adarand v. Pena</i>, in which the Court declared that strict scrutiny must apply to racial preferences in federal contracting programs, Thomas inveighed against the dissent's attempt to create "a paternalism exception to the equal protection clause." He also showed an exact understanding of law's essential possibilities and limitations: "Government cannot make us equal; it can only recognize, respect, and protect us as equal before the law."
<p>In <i>Missouri v. Jenkins</i>, Thomas also filed an important concurrence supporting the Court's holding. The decision prevented a lower court from continuing to run Missouri's schools decades after segregation had ended partly on the justification that schools still were not racially mixed. "It never ceases to amaze me," wrote Justice Thomas, "that courts are so willing to assume that anything predominantly black is inferior." Consistent with the theme of his <i>Adarand</i> concurrence, Thomas observed there is nothing constitutionally wrong with a predominantly black institution, unless it is the law that forces an institution to be composed of a particular race. <p>
	Although his voting record was among the most liberal of any justice, even liberal commentators did not single out Souter's opinions for praise. Indeed, the mark of Souter's work last term was his attempt to use process to flee substance. "The Court's process of orderly adjudication has broken down in this case," began his <i>Missouri v. Jenkins</i> dissent, and his opinion soon degenerated into a set of querulous complaints about the procedural posture of the case -- complaints easily refuted by the majority. In <i>Adarand</i>, his opinion rested largely on the proposition that the Court must uphold the program of racial set-asides because of the <i>stare decisis</i> effect of <i>Fullilove v. Klutznick</i> (1980) in which a fragmented Court upheld a different set of racial set-asides more than a decade ago, and <i>Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC</i> (1990), in which the Court upheld racial preferences in the peculiar setting of broadcasting.
<p><i>Adarand</i> illustrated the failings of Souter's performance: Far from being a critical thinker, he is a prisoner of the school of legal process jurisprudence that reigned at Harvard Law School during his time as a student there. Legal process jurisprudence arose in response to legal realism, which claimed that judges made decisions on political or other personal grounds. One important strand of process jurisprudence maintained that judges could avoid unprincipled decisionmaking by focusing on the distinctive aspects of legal procedure such as <i>stare decisis</i>. This school no longer holds sway even among academics, in part  because it is widely recognized that procedural doctrines are as subject to manipulation at least as much as the substantive doctrines of law. 
<p>	In any event, Souter's performance in <i>Adarand</i> is an unquestioning pupil's parody of his master's teachings. There was no majority opinion in <i>Fullilove</i>, thus whatever the importance of honoring <i>stare decisis</i> and preserving long settled principles, it was preposterous to put <i>Fullilove</i> in this category. Moreover, <i>Metro Broadcasting</i>'s lenient standard of review for preferences in broadcasting conflicted with much of the rest of the Court's equal-protection jurisprudence. Accordingly, the issue of racial preferences in federal contracting could not fairly be understood as governed by binding precedent. It will certainly be interesting to watch whether Souter in the future gives <i>stare decisis</i> effect to the majority opinions from which he is now dissenting.
<p><i>Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of the University of Virginia</i> is the case that perhaps best shows the chasm between Souter and Thomas. In that case, the majority opinion, which Justice Kennedy wrote and Thomas joined, held that the University of Virginia could not refuse to fund the printing costs of a student newspaper because of its Christian editorial content so long as it was funding the printing costs of other student publications.
<p>	The Court held that the university had discriminated against religiously inspired newspapers relative to those with a secular editorial policy, thereby engaging in viewpoint discrimination forbidden by the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. Moreover, the Court held that the university's payments to the printer who published the religious newspaper did not violate the Establishment Clause, because the payments were part of program that had a secular purpose -- fostering student learning and creativity -- and that were available to all publications, regardless of their particular religious viewpoint or lack thereof.
<p>	Souter dissented. He argued that there was no free-speech violation because there was no viewpoint discrimination: The university's decision to prohibit the reimbursement of printer expenses for magazines with a religious editorial was no different from the decision to prohibit the reimbursement of all magazines except those devoted to cooking. Souter also argued that reimbursement would violate the Establishment Clause because the state was subsidizing the propagation of a religious point of view. In support of his position, he relied on Madison's <i>Memorial and Remonstrance on Religious Observance</i> in which Madison assailed a legislative proposal that would have taxed citizens of Virginia in order to support churches. 
<p>	Like his <i>Adarand</i> opinion, Souter's <i>Rosenberger</i> opinion faithfully represents the view of the liberal establishment that educated him. Under this view, religion is something that can be practiced privately and dissected publicly at a university in history, anthropology, and psychology classes. Religion, however, must be assiduously kept from the public square, particularly when that square is an educational institution of any kind.
<p>	This principle of separation between religion and state has been sold as a way of preventing the government from favoring religion. In reality, it has a way of uniquely disfavoring religious viewpoints and maximizing the influence of the predominantly liberal secular ideas of institutions of public education. Under the conventional liberal view of the Establishment Clause, the Constitution would forbid a public university from having a program of encouraging student writing and debate that refunds the printing costs of a religious magazine even if it simultaneously funds magazines celebrating the philosophies of John Dewey, Karl Marx, and Donald Duck. 
<p>In his concurrence, Thomas first stripped this view of the patina of historical legitimacy Souter tried to give it. Thomas pointed out that the program Madison attacked in his <i>Remonstrance</i> provided special benefits to religious institutions alone: Madison complained that this forced civil society to take "cognizance" of religion. A funding program for student journalism and debate that includes religiously inspired magazines does not give special benefits to religion, but simply allows religious magazines to enjoy the same benefits as other magazines. Only a program that discriminates against religious magazines -- the very kind of program that the University of Virginia was runningtakes "cognizance" of religion. 
<p>Moreover, Thomas suggests that the conventional Establishment Clause principles are incoherent on their own terms. Tax exemptions have been provided to religious and secular institutions alike as charitable recipients for 200 years because support for charity has a secular purpose. Yet these are functionally and economically equivalent to direct aid given to religious institutions that are contributing to some secularly defined program, like encouraging intellectual debate or chastity among the young. Thomas questions how direct aid to institutions could be different from tax exemptions if both are given as part of general program that has a secular purpose and is open to secular institutions. He thereby forces us to ask: Is a deep legal principle underlying this distinction? Or is it the political calculation that, while the curtailment of direct aid might provoke grumbles from the people, the termination of tax exemptions would lead to a wholesale constitutional amendment of the Establishment Clause that the modern Court has created. 
<p>The dramatic difference in performances of Thomas and Souter suggests a few essential considerations which should guide the next conservative president in his choice of a nominee:
<p><ol>

<li>The next nominee should show an established commitment to the conservative legal movement; he should, in other words, have "reputational capital" invested in conservative legal thought. The difference between Thomas's and Souter's relation to conservative thought before they were appointed almost certainly bears on the very different paths they have followed on the Court. Thomas had not only met and conversed with the members of the conservative legal movement, but was himself one of the leaders of the movement in the area of civil rights. Thus, Thomas came to the Court inclined to articulate principles that he had been on record as supporting and, in one area, had formulated himself. 
<p>Souter, by contrast, had never made any contribution to conservative legal thought or been part of the conservative legal movement. Although he had been the attorney general under a conservative governor in New Hampshire, his legal thinking had never been systematically exposed to originalism and other conservative jurisprudential movements that gained renewed strength in the 1980s. Without any reputational capital invested in conservative legal thought, it is not surprising that Souter fell back on the jurisprudence of his legal educators and the current elite legal establishment, which is substantially to the left of the country as a whole.
<p> Another important consequence of their different associations may be a difference in psychological commitment to conservatism. In participating in the fledgling conservative movement in law, Thomas cemented many friendships through what St. Augustine called "the warmth of kindred studies." Such friendships naturally sustain the intellectual outlook previously adopted in the face of predictable pressures of the Washington establishment. Moreover, the network of friendships from the conservative movement has very practical consequences as well. Thomas has largely hired clerks who are associated with the conservative legal movement. After his first few years, Souter has hired predominantly liberal clerks, some strategically recommended by the overwhelming liberal community of law professors at leading law schools.
<p><li>Although the next nominee emphatically does not have to be a Washington insider, he should have been tested in Washington at some point in his career. Thomas's outlook was forged in the heat of one of the most contentious national issues of our time -- civil rights. He had already taken positions for which he had paid a price in public attacks on his views and his character. Souter, on the other hand, had spent the major part of his career on relatively less consequential issues far from Washington and far from the influence of the predominantly liberal national media and opinionmakers. While some of his opinions on the New Hampshire Supreme Court were vaguely conservative, they were never important enough to be challenged by the liberal legal establishment. 	
<p>	Thomas thus was tested in his beliefs in a way Souter could not have been. Once both were put in the national spotlight of the Supreme Court, it was far more certain that Thomas would be steadfast in adhering to conservative views despite an initial reception that was certain to be hostile. A justice who has not been tested, like Souter (or Justice Lewis Powell), is much more likely to be blown from side to side by the very powerful political gusts at the storm center of the Court.
<p>There are other considerations worth taking into account in choosing a justice, although they are admittedly less important than the first two:
<p><li>The justice should be persuasive with his colleagues. Although the ability of any justice, no matter how incisive and collegial, to make a difference in the way his colleague votes is limited, in a few close cases over a justice's career he or she may hope to sway others. The qualities required for persuasion are keen analytical ability (to spot possible coherent lines of analysis that a colleague might join), a persuasive pen, and a friendly, extroverted nature (to make the justice's colleagues want to be in the same corner). On the evidence of this term, Thomas has all these qualities. 
<p><li>The justice should have some understanding of economic analysis. Although this essay has addressed only constitutional law, so much of the best understanding of statutory law, both public and private, turns on economic concepts such as efficiency, consumer welfare, and cost-benefit analysis. A justice literate in economics has a substantial advantage in interpreting such statutes. Economic literacy does not necessarily entail that the nominee be a law and economics professor or have an academic degree in economics, but simply that the nominee have been exposed to systematic economic analysis during his or her career. Thomas, for instance, had taken an intensive course in economics for judges when he was appointed to the District of Columbia Circuit. 
</ol><p>	With the benefit of such considerations and the very large supply of lawyers and jurists in the conservative legal movement who would make excellent nominees, I am confident that the next president can nominate individuals who will join the pantheon of truly great Supreme Court justices: like Chief Justice John Marshall, Justice George Sutherland, Justice Scalia, and, if he continues to meet the standard he set last term, Justice Clarence Thomas himself.

<b>Policy Review</b><br>

<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center><p>



	Although slavery ended in the United States more than a century ago, its legacy continues to be disputed among scholars and to underlie contemporary debates about public policy. The reason for this is that slavery is considered the classic expression of American racism, and its effects are still viewed as central to the problems faced by blacks in the United States. Slavery seems to be the wound that never healedthe moral core of the oppression story so fundamental to black identity today. No wonder that bitterness generated by recollections of slavery has turned a generation of black scholars and activists against the nation's Founding -- against identification with America itself.
<p>	"Jefferson didn't mean it when he wrote that all men are created equal," writes historian John Hope Franklin. "We've never meant it. The truth is that we're a bigoted people and always have been. We think every other country is trying to copy us now, and if they are, God help the world." He argues that, by betraying the ideals of freedom, "the Founding Fathers set the stage for every succeeding generation of Americans to apologize, compromise, and temporize on those principles."
<p>	In <i>Black Odyssey</i>, Nathan Huggins condemns the American Framers for establishing, not freedom, but "a model totalitarian society." Huggins condemns the Framers for refusing to mention the words "slave" or "slavery" in the Constitution in an effort to "sanitize their new creation" and avoid "the deforming mirror of truth." The Founding, he concludes, was simply "a bad way to start."
<p>	Speaking on the 200th anniversary of the Constitution, former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall refused to "find the wisdom, foresight, and sense of justice exhibited by the Framers particularly profound. The government they devised was defective from the start." Marshall urged that instead of jingoistic celebration, Americans should seek an "understanding of the Constitution's defects," its immoral project to "trade moral principles for self-interest."
<p>	Is it true that the American Founding was corrupted by a base and unwarranted compromise with slavery, and that the Framers of the Constitution, many of whom were slaveowners, revealed themselves as racist hypocrites? Must we agree with the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, who charged that the American Founding was a "covenant with death," an "agreement with hell," and a "refuge of lies," an appraisal endorsed by the great black leader Frederick Douglass? If these charges are true, then America is indeed ill-founded, blacks are right to think of themselves as alienated "Africans in America," and the hope for racial amity constructed upon the liberal democratic vision of the Founding becomes a chimera.
<p>  On the other hand, if the Framers are exonerated of the charges of racist hypocrisy, then their blueprint for America might provide a viable foundation for helping blacks and whites to transcend the pathology of race. Indeed, it is the vision of Thomas Jefferson and the Framers that provides the only secure basis for a multiracial society, in which citizens are united not by blood or lineage, but by virtue of their equality.
 <p>
<b>Of Human Bondage
</b><p>	Notwithstanding the vilification of American history by many commentators, the institution of slavery was neither peculiarly American nor peculiarly white. Not only was slavery extensively practiced in the ancient world -- Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, India, and elsewhere -- but in the modern era Africans and American Indians practiced slavery, Arabs actively promoted the slave trade, and thousands of blacks in America were slaveowners.<p>
	The practice of whites owning slaves developed in the United States in line with universal practices, including prevailing Western institutions that held millions of whites in various degrees of unfreedom. In this context, it is not hard to understand Charles Pinckney's amazement, during the debates over the American Founding, over questions about the morality of slavery. "If slavery be wrong," Pinckney erupted, "it is justified by the example of all the world."	In most parts of the world, slavery was uncontroversial for the simple reason that the concept of freedom simply did not exist. Writes African-American scholar Orlando Patterson, "There was no word for 'freedom' in most non-Western languages before contact with Western peoples."<p>
	Prior to the development of a modern Western notion of freedom, most people lived in a world shaped by what historian David Brion Davis terms "the normal network of kinship ties of dependency, protection, obligation, and privilege," a system that included various forms of patronage and servitude.
<p>	Nathan Huggins writes that slavery evolved in a social system radically different from our own, one that "regarded servants and laborers as base people," that used "hunger and the lash as a goad to productivity," that maintained discipline by means of "maiming, dismemberment . . . torture, the rack, beheading, burning at the stake, impaling." Between white laborers and black slaves, Huggins writes, "the differences were more in degree than in kind." 
<p>	Historian Oscar Handlin notes that in Europe, as in much of the world, the antithesis of the term "free" was not "slave" but "unfree," and the vast majority of people lived in servitude or partial freedom. Involuntary bondage was common. "A debtor could be sold" to pay off his debts, he writes, vagrants and vagabonds "might be bound over to the highest bidder, their labor sold for a term," and criminal offenses were routinely punished with sentences of forced public service, "sometimes for life."
<p>	Many whites became indentured servants in America; they bound themselves to a planter or company for four to seven years in return for free passage across the Atlantic and some starting-up provisions. Like English servants, bondsmen in America were frequently bought and sold, or used as gambling stakes. "Under such circumstances," writes Gordon Wood in <i>The Radicalism of the American Revolution</i>, "it was often difficult for the colonists to perceive the distinctive peculiarity of black slavery." 
<p>	Until the 18th century, few Europeans had moral qualms about slavery, which contradicted no important social value for most people around the world. In the Arab world, which was the first to import large numbers of slaves from Africa, the slave traffic was truly cosmopolitan. Slaves of every hue and origin were sold in open bazaars. The Arabs played an important role as middlemen in the trans-Atlantic slave trade, and contemporary research suggests that between the 7th and the 19th centuries they transported more than l4 million black slaves across the Sahara and the Red Seaa larger number than were shipped to the Americas.
<p>	Native American Indians practiced slavery on each other, long before Europeans arrived to practice it on them. For several tribes in the American Northwest, slaves constituted between l0 and l5 percent of the population. The Cherokee employed "slave catchers" to retrieve wounded combatants from other tribes, although the Cherokee preferred to kill enemies rather than take them captive. In some Indian tribes, slaveowners routinely killed large numbers of slaves in potlatch ceremonies to prove how wealthy they were.
<p>	Among Africans, the three powerful kingdoms of Ghana, Songhay, and Mali all relied on slave labor. Nor were these slaves exclusively blacks: The emperor Mansa Musa, for example, purchased Turkish slaves for his court in Mali. White Europeans who were shipwrecked off the west coast of Africa were also enslaved. The Ashanti of West Africa customarily enslaved all foreigners. African slavery was both widespread and uncontroversial. Historian Paul Lovejoy argues that "in the American context, slavery was introduced from the outside and always relied on the importation of slaves," while "in Africa slavery evolved from indigenous institutions."
<p>	In a recent study, John Thornton shows that slavery was far more deeply embedded in Africa than in Europe because Europeans recognized land as the primary source of private wealth, whereas "slaves were the only form of private, revenue-producing property recognized in African law." Tribal chiefs in Africa, working through Arab middlemen, sold millions of blacks to Europeans and supplied the trans-Atlantic slave trade without any fundamental modification of the institutions and values of Africa. According to Basil Davidson in <i>The African Slave Trade</i>: "The notion that Europe altogether imposed the slave trade on Africa is without any foundation in history.... Those Africans who were involved in the trade were seldom the helpless victims of a commerce they did not understand: On the contrary, they responded to its challenge. They exploited its opportunities."
<p>	Contrary to the popular belief nourished by Alex Haley's novel <i>Roots</i>, Europeans did not typically invade African tribes to chase down and capture slaves. Many slaves purchased by Europeans were already slaves in Africa. Income from the slave trade made many African chiefs and tribes rich. The grim reality of the African slave trade between Africa and America was summed up by Zora Neale Hurston, the great black writer of the Harlem Renaissance in the early part of the 20th century: "The white people held my people in slavery here in America. They had bought us, it is true, and exploited us. But the inescapable fact that stuck in my craw was: My people had sold me.... My own people had exterminated whole nations and torn families apart for a profit before the strangers got their chance at a cut. It was a sobering thought. It impressed upon me the universal nature of greed."
<p>

<b>Racism and Slavery
</b><p>

	American slavery was prompted not by racism but by the pursuit of profit. There was work to be done building the New World, and slavery provided the unpaid labor to do the job. Scholars are fairly unanimous that African slaves were purchased and transported to America for reasons of convenience and economic gain. How, then, did American slavery assume a distinctively racial character?
<p>	Marxist scholars have a powerful answer. "Race relations did not determine the patterns of slavery in the new world," writes historian Eugene Genovese, "the patterns of slavery...determined race relations." The Marxist view is that racism developed and spread in America as an ideology to rationalize the enslavement and exploitation of blacks by a white master class. Fortified by racism from the beginning, American slavery itself fostered and institutionalized bigotry.
<p>	This view draws on the insight that C.R. Boxer popularized: "One race cannot systematically enslave members of another for centuries without acquiring a conscious or unconscious feeling of racial superiority." That is why, in many ancient cultures, it was customary to brand or tattoo slaves to confirm their social stigma. But in the United States no such measures were necessary. Africans were chosen for slavery in part because they were considered inferior as a race. They already wore a racial uniform, which itself became the mark of slavery, and even later a stigma of shame and inferiority. 
<p>	The Marxist view contains a good deal of truth. Even though not all blacks in America were slaves, and not all slaves in America were black, over time these nuances became blurred, and in crucial respects racism and slavery became synonymous, in perception if not in operation. The consequence was a virtually inseparable association in the American mind between the degradation of slavery and the degradation of blackness. Yet the Marxist account does not explain what economically exploitative purpose racism serves by tormenting the free black population.
<P>

	This question is illuminated by considering the differences between slavery in the United States and slavery in Latin America. Scholars who study Caribbean and South American slavery agree that the system was extremely harsh, in some respects harsher than in the United States. Reporting to absentee owners in Spain and Portugal, ruthless overseers wielded the lash over gigantic plantations of Africans, working them with little apparent concern for their health or longevity. The slave mortality rate was far higher in Latin America than in the United States.
<P>	Yet partly through the influence of the Catholic Church, Latin American slave laws were far more benign than those in the United States. Nowhere in the United States was marriage legal for slaves, whereas slaves in Latin America had a legal right to marry and receive the sacraments. Because of the church's emphasis on family unity, slave families in Latin America had specific rights, including legal protections against arbitrary dissolution.
<p>	By contrast, slaveowners in the United States had full discretion over whether to break up families and separately sell parents and children. Every American slave state except South Carolina had laws against miscegenation. In Latin America, because of the small number of white women who settled in the Spanish colonies, black concubinage was everywhere legal, public, even moderately respectable. In fact, according to Stanley Elkins, miscegenation was generally considered a good thing in Latin America because it had a whitening effect, whereas it was generally considered a bad thing in the United States because it had a darkening effect.
<p>	Manumissions were easier, both as a matter of law and practice, in Latin America. Some American states severely restricted the right of masters to free their slaves, fearing the presence of a resentful class of free blacks among the white population.
<p>	The consequence of the Latin American system was the gradual emergence of a free colored class, which was considered neither white nor black, but named for the specific proportion of white and black and Indian blood. It was common throughout Latin America for masters to free their offspring by slave women. In the United States, by contrast, the progeny of master and slave usually remained slaves. Thus the United States gradually embraced a doctrine unique in the history of slavery: All children with any recognizable black ancestry would be considered black. To be white meant, <i>de jure</i> if not <i>de facto</i>, to be a thoroughbred European, uncontaminated by a single drop of Negro blood. Even after slavery, the one-drop rule would ensure that blacks, as a group, would remain distinct and distant from whites who could think of themselves as a ruling class.
<p>	None of this means that no enduring hierarchy developed in Latin America. It did, but it was primarily a social and not a racial hierarchy. The colored class emerged as a buffer zone, an intermediary between pure whites and pure blacks; in many countries, the colored class became the national majority. Dark skin continued to carry some stigma, but it was entirely possible to erase this through wealth, political status, and intermarriage with others of lighter skin. Racial tensions persist today in Brazil, Cuba, and other Latin American countries, but the racial legacy of slavery there is unquestionably more benign than in the United States. 
<p>	Scholars have struggled to explain why the slave systems in North America and South America evolved so differently. No doubt many factors are responsible, including religious and cultural differences. But an often-overlooked cause lies in the radically different systems of government. Spain and Portugal, which maintained South American colonies, were rigid monarchies. From the seat of government to the church, presided over by the Holy Inquisition, freedom defined as the rights of self-government and individual self-determination simply did not exist. Consequently, Spanish and Portuguese plantation owners did not have to explain to anyone, even to themselves, why they were enslaving large numbers of Africans, depriving them of liberty, and stealing the fruits of their labor. Slavery was a practice that seemed entirely reasonable for social and economic life, and one that did not contradict any of the institutions in their home countries. In short, South American slaveowners were under very little obligation to justify or rationalize slavery.
<p>	By contrast, the United States in the late 18th century became a free society with a liberal democratic creed. Inspired by the words of a Southern slaveholder, Thomas Jefferson, Americans fought a revolution in order to secure the proposition that all men are "created equal" and "endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights." Historian Duncan MacLeod writes that "the very term slavery was among the most frequent in the Revolutionary vocabulary. The war was seen as essentially a battle against political servitude." It is not easy for a society revolting in the name of liberty and equality to justify slavery. The British Tory Samuel Johnson summarized the dilemma: "How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of Negroes?"
<p>	Many Americans found a way to resolve the contradiction. All men are created equal, blacks are being bought and sold in America, therefore blacks must not be men. After all, if blacks are men, and all men are created equal, then blacks are entitled to the same rights as whites, including the right not to be held in captivity. In order to sustain slavery, therefore, the premise of black humanity must be denied. This explains the contorted logic of the infamous <i>Dred Scott</i> decision of l857 in which the Supreme Court invoked black inferiority to exclude slaves from constitutional protection, and pronounced slave ownership as a fundamental property right.
<p>	The doctrine that slaves were legally equivalent to property generated both legal and human contradictions. In fact, slave laws implicitly recognized the humanity of slaves by holding them accountable for their actions. Nathan Huggins writes, "A pig in the corn was not a thief; a slave in the smokehouse was. A horse that trampled the life from a cruel master was no murderer; a slave who struck out against brutality was."
<p>	So the Marxist argument is essentially correct: The ideology of racial superiority, which originated to explain civilizational differences, became consolidated in America as a convenient rationalization for continuing oppression. What some Marxist scholars seem to miss is that racism in America was not an economic but a moral justification. Although they limited the franchise to propertied white males, the American Founders were not insincere in proclaiming their allegiance to principles of liberty and equality. Southerners who were in the forefront of the American Revolution, and no less committed than Northerners to the principles of the Declaration and the Constitution, found themselves in a particular quandary as they administered their forced-labor plantations. Racism in the American South served to rationalize and justify behavior that flatly contravened the nation's political ideals.
<p>	If Americans did not believe in equality, then racism would serve no ideological or material purpose. Racism, therefore, flourished in the gap between the principles of the constitution and its pragmatic concessions. Far from being proof of distinctive American evil, racism is a peculiar reflection of the moral conscience of America, and of the West. It reflects the oppressor's need to account for the betrayal of his highest ideals. Despite the ignominious pedigree of racism as a justification for exploitation, in all of human history only the white man has felt compelled to provide such a justification. Paradoxically, those who indulged in racism thereby revealed their humanity, even as they disregarded the humanity of others. The very existence of racism implies that, from the very outset, slavery existed uncomfortably and anomalously with Jeffersonian principles.
<p>
<b>Who Killed Slavery?
</b><p>	Although slavery was a universal institution, not confined to the West, what is distinctively Western is the abolition of slavery. Many people have, of course, resisted being captured and sold as slaves, but no society, including all of Africa, has ever on its own account mounted principled opposition to human servitude. In all the literature condemning Western slavery, however, few scholars have asked why a practice sanctioned by virtually all people for thousands of years should be questioned, and eventually halted, by only one.
<p>	Paradoxically, it is in America and nowhere else in the world where the legacy of slavery is a contemporary issue, the American Constitution is condemned as a document that compromised with slavery, and the Framers are routinely denounced for being racist hypocrites. The irony is compounded by the recognition that the prevailing view of the Constitution as proslavery was precisely that of Justice Taney in the <i>Dred Scott</i> decision. By contrast, Abraham Lincoln strongly denied Taney's view, and his position came to be enthusiastically embraced by Frederick Douglass, the greatest black leader of the 19th century. It is to the debates over the legitimacy of slavery in the West that we must turn to decide whether Taney and many 20th-century scholars are right, or Lincoln is.<p>
	Throughout world history, slavery had few defenders for the simple reason that it had few critics. The institution was uncontroversial, and that which is established and taken for granted does not have to be justified. The American South was unique among slave societies in history in that it produced a comprehensive proslavery ideology. In part, this was because slavery was under assault to a degree unrivaled anywhere else in the world. <p>
	The simplest defense for slavery was economic necessity: Someone has to do the dirty work, and better them than us. This position was based on an implicit premise that whites in the South were in a position to compel blacks to perform menial but necessary tasks. It is force, rather than right, that kept the system of slavery in place.
<p>	Southerners were also familiar with a European tradition, going back to the Crusades, that held it was permissible to enslave pagans but not Christians. In response to this, the leading forces in the South formulated an identical justification: Africans were heathens, so slavery would serve as a kind of moral education to introduce them to Christianity. But once slaves embraced the Christian faith of their masters, other excuses became necessary in order to justify keeping them in servitude. Here many Southern divines intervened to offer a racist rationale. They promulgated a dubious interpretation of a story in the book of Genesis in which Noah curses the descendants of his son Ham, who impudently looked upon his father's nakedness. Thus, in this account, the children of Ham were condemned to blackness and future enslavement. For a long time there was little challenge to this absurd innovation in biblical exegesis.
<p>	It was only when the institution of slavery came under moral assault for betraying the Declaration of Independence and Christian charity that many Southern apologists such as John C. Calhoun, James Henry Hammond, Edmund Ruffin, George Frederick Holmes, and George Fitzhugh responded by formulating an audacious defense of slavery as a positive good. Hammond, among others, repudiated the Jeffersonian doctrine of equality as "ridiculously absurd."
<p>	Their case for slavery depended on a paternalistic worldview in which Negroes, like women and children, occupied positions in an organic society commensurate with supposed limited moral and intellectual abilities. Eugene Genovese writes in <i>The Slaveholders' Dilemma</i>, "Southerners from social theorists to divines to politicians to ordinary slaveholders and yeomen insisted fiercely that emancipation would cast blacks into a marketplace in which they could not compete and would condemn them to the fate of the Indians or worse." Although defenders of slavery were right about the harshness of Northern capitalism, their paternalistic vision foundered in that the community of interests that could generally be presumed between husband and wife, or between parents and children, could not be presumed between master and slave.
<p>	The Southern doctrine of Negro inferiority immediately extended to whites, even those who were destitute and ignorant, membership in an exclusive racial club and a social position above that of all blacks, both slave and free. Edmund Morgan argues in <i>American Slavery, American Freedom</i> that the racial defense of Southern slavery strengthened, among whites, the conviction that, despite conspicuous differences of wealth and position, they were equal just as the Declaration of Independence posited. Racism, in other words, became a source of white social status.
<p>	The dilemma over slavery ultimately came down to one of the oldest Western arguments, which we find in Plato's <i>Republic</i>: The wise should rule over the unwise. During the Lincoln-Douglas debates, Stephen Douglas defended the right of states to decide for themselves whether they wanted slavery in precisely these terms:
<p><blockquote>	"The civilized world has always held that when any race of men have shown themselves to be so degraded by ignorance, superstition, cruelty, and barbarism, as to be utterly incapable of governing themselves, they must, in the nature of things, be governed by others, by such laws as are deemed to be applicable to their condition."
</blockquote><p> 
<b>Wisdom and Consent
</b>

<p>	We may think Stephen Douglas's view to be crude and hateful, but Abraham Lincoln did not. He agreed with Douglas: It is absurd to construct a regime in which the wise do not rule; surely no one wants the mediocre or the foolish to rule. In fact this raises a problem with democracy that the American Founders and Lincoln recognized: How can the wise, who are by definition the few, be reliably identified and chosen to rule by the many? Representative government is based on the hope that the majority will exercise their power on behalf of right, that they will choose others who are wiser than themselves to govern. Yet modern democracy introduces a crucial qualification to the claim of the wise to rule: Such rule is only legitimate when it is vindicated by popular consent. The majority is not the best judge of what is wise, but most people do recognize their own interests. Hence representative democracy is a "mixed regime," which seeks to reconcile the claims of right and expediency.
<p>	This debate is the crucial backdrop to an examination of the antislavery movement of the 18th century, because it provided the context and the moral terms for the issue. The two principles that would form the basis for the first serious challenge to the institution of slavery and the doctrine of black inferiority are both encapsulated in the Declaration of Independence: the Christian belief that all persons bear the image of God and are equal in His eyes, and the distinctly modern European political conception that all human beings enjoy a natural right to freedom and self-government that can only be abridged by their consent. 
<p>	In the second half of the 18th century, a small but militant group of religious and political activists began to apply the doctrine of equality more broadly and concretely in order to reform the injustices of this world, what David Brion Davis terms "a sacralization of social progress." Tocqueville wrote: "We have seen something absolutely without precedent in history -- servitude abolished, not by the desperate effort of the slave, but by the enlightened will of the master. . . . It is we who have given a definite and practical meaning to the Christian idea that all men are born equal, and applied it to the realities of this world."
<p>	The first group to mount an organized campaign against slavery was the Society of Friends, the Quakers, first in Europe in the second half of the 17th century, then in the United States. Ignoring passages in the Bible that had been invoked to justify slavery, leading Quakers such as George Fox in England and John Woolman and Anthony Benezet in the U.S. emphasized that spiritual freedom -- man's capacity to choose the good in his quest for moral perfectibility -- required freedom of choice in this life. Slavery, according to this view, represented the moral imprisonment of God's children and thus was wrong, even blasphemous. Drawing on the religious energies of the Great Awakening, the first of a serious of revival movements that would energize America between the mid-18th century and the end of the 19th, many evangelical Protestants began to embrace a similar interpretation. They applied Christ's injunction -- do unto others as we would have them do unto us -- directly to the relationship between slaveowners and slaves.<p>
	In l772, Lord Mansfield issued a landmark decision in Britain abolishing slavery on English soil. In l833, thanks to the abolition campaign of Granville Sharp, Thomas Clarkson, and especially William Wilberforce, slavery was outlawed throughout the British empire. Economic motives undoubtedly contributed, but scholars now generally agree that religious and political principles were indispensable in achieving the abolition of servitude. Antislavery victories soon spread to France, which forbade slavery in its territories in l848, and to other European nations as well. In a bizarre development, tribal leaders in Gambia, Congo, Dahomey, and other African nations that had prospered under the slave trade sent delegations to London and Paris to vigorously protest the abolition of slavery. "Africans felt that the rules of their traditional life had been called into question," Mohamed Mbodj writes, "by initiatives which destabilized the bases of their society." <p>
	Eventually the British example, backed by diplomatic and even military measures, eradicated slavery in all foreign areas of influence. In America, although there were many among them who shared prevailing prejudices against blacks, the abolitionist movement contained the first antiracists. Leading abolitionists agreed that blacks were civilizationally inferior and incapable of ruling themselves. But black inferiority, they said, is no justification for slavery; rather, it is the product of slavery itself. Some abolitionists endorsed the idea of helping blacks to resettle in Africa, but those who recognized the implausibility of such schemes attempted to show that blacks were capable of living as free people. In order to directly rebut the Southern argument that blacks were better off being ruled by their betters, abolitionists began a slow but relentless quest for intelligent blacks who would be standing refutations of theories of intrinsic inferiority.<p>
	Three prime exhibits for opponents of slavery to demonstrate the intellectual capacity of Negroes were Phillis Wheatley, the Negro poet; Benjamin Banneker, the black mathematician and scholar; and Frederick Douglass, the runaway slave and later statesman and orator. For many Americans, it was so unbelievable that a black person could produce a serious work of literature that 18 eminent whites (including John Hancock, who signed the Declaration of Independence, and Thomas Hutchinson, the governor of Massachusetts) offered an "attestation to the publick" that, upon examination, Wheatley's poems were verified to be her original work and that she was indeed a full-blooded black woman. Additionally, abolitionists stressed the physical and mental sufferings of slaves in order to recruit humanitarian sentiment on behalf of emancipation. No one was more successful in this than Harriet Beecher Stowe, author of <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, published in l852. Perhaps the most influential political tract of the 19th century, Stowe's sentimental novel was credited by Lincoln for turning the North irrevocably against slavery, setting the stage for the confrontation that culminated in the Civil War.

<p><blockquote>The only distinction between freedom and slavery is this: In the former state, a man is governed by the laws to which he has given his consent; in the latter, he is governed by the will of another.
</blockquote><p>

 -- Alexander Hamilton
<p>
	Justice Taney's argument in <i>Dred Scott</i>, shared by many contemporary scholars, that the American Founders were hypocrites who produced a proslavery regime, rests on the apparent contradiction between stated ideals and actual practice. It seems hard to explain how a slaveowner like Thomas Jefferson could declare that "all men are created equal." Nor is it obvious how 55 men in Philadelphia, some 30 of whom were slaveowners themselves, could proclaim antislavery principles while endorsing a document that would permit slavery to continue in the Southern states. This is the force behind Taney's insistence that these men could not have meant what they said. Taney's interpretation, that the Constitution secures no rights for blacks that whites must respect, leads directly to the contemporary suggestion that the Founders were motivated not by noble ideals but by crass self-interest.<p>
	That the American Founders were self-interested is impossible to deny. Thomas Jefferson owned some 200 slaves and did not free them. Yet the case of Jefferson is revealing. Far from rationalizing plantation life by adopting the usual Southern arguments about the happy slave, Jefferson the Virginian vehemently denounced slavery as flatly inconsistent with justice. Jefferson recognized that blacks were not slaves "by nature," only by convention. Although he agreed with the scientific view of his time, and suspected that blacks were inferior to whites in capacity, Jefferson expressed his wish that black accomplishment prove him wrong. (Jefferson's empirical observations about black inferiority were not shared by either Benjamin Franklin or Alexander Hamilton.) Moreover, Jefferson strongly denied that possible black intellectual or civilizational inferiority justified white enslavement: "Whatever be their talents, it is no measure of their rights." Consequently, the only rationale for Jefferson not freeing his slaves is expediency. "Justice is in one scale, and self-preservation in another."<p>
	The dilemma of Jefferson and the American Founders may be summarized as follows: They fully recognized that a democratic society depends not just on wisdom, but also on consent. Consequently, there is no justification whatever for ruling another human being without his consent. Blacks are human beings, and in possession of natural rights. Slavery is therefore against natural right and should be prohibited. But how? Here Jefferson and the Founders faced two profound obstacles. The first was that virtually all of them recognized the degraded condition of blacks in America. Whatever the cause of this condition, the Framers recognized that it posed a formidable hurdle to granting to blacks the rights of citizenship. By contrast with monarchy and aristocracy, which only require subjects to obey, self-government requires citizens who have the moral and civilizational capacity to be rulers. 
<p>	Jefferson also recognized the existence of intense and widespread white prejudices against blacks that seemed to prevent the two peoples from coexisting harmoniously on the same soil. While Jefferson agonized over the problem, Madison proposed a strange but bold scheme for solving the nation's multiracial dilemma of the time. The government, he suggested, might take the land it had acquired from the Indians, sell it to the new European immigrants, and use the money to send blacks back to Africa. The concept of relocating blacks in Africa was later endorsed in principle by Lincoln and retained its appeal among many whites and some blacks until the Civil War.
<p>	The deference of Jefferson and the American Founders to popular prejudices strikes many contemporary scholars as excessive. Some suggest that popular convictions simply represented a frustrating obstacle that the Founders should have dealt with resolutely and forcefully. In a democratic society, however, the absence of the people's agreement on a fundamental moral question of governance is no mere technicality. The case for democracy, no less than the case against slavery, rests on the legitimacy of the people's consent. To outlaw slavery without the consent of the majority of whites would be to destroy democracy, and thus to destroy the very basis for outlawing slavery.
<p>	The men gathered in Philadelphia faced a genuine dilemma. For them to sanction slavery would be to proclaim the illegitimacy of the American Revolution and the new form of government based on the people's consent; yet for them to outlaw slavery without securing the people's consent would have the same effect. In practical terms as well, the choice facing the men gathered in Philadelphia was not to permit or to prohibit slavery. Rather, the choice was either to establish a union in which slavery was tolerated, or not to have a union. Any suggestion that Southern states could be persuaded to join a union and give up slavery can be dismissed as implausible in the extreme.
<p>	Thus the accusation that the Founders compromised on the Declaration's principle "all men are created equal" for the purpose of expediency reflects a grave misunderstanding. The Founders were confronted with a competing principle, also present in the Declaration, that governments derive their legitimacy "from the consent of the governed." Both principles must be satisfied, and where they cannot, compromise is not merely permissible but morally required. 
<p>	The American Founders found a middle ground not between principle and practice, but between antislavery and majority consent. Not only are these closely related principles, but in a philosophic sense, they are the same principle. How did the Framers seek to mediate between their rival claims? By producing a Constitution in which the concept of slavery is tolerated, in deference to consent, but nowhere given any moral approval, in recognition of the slave's natural rights. Indeed nowhere in the document is the term "slavery" used. Slaves are always described as "persons," implying their possession of natural rights. The Founders made concessions to slavery as a matter of fact but not as a matter of right. In addition, the Framers produced a Constitution that nowhere acknowledges the existence of racial distinctions, thus producing a document that transcended its time and provided a charter for a better future.
<p>	None of the supposed contradictions that contemporary scholars have located in the American Founders were unrecognized by them. Many of the Framers justified their toleration for slavery on prudential grounds: In the 1770s and 1780s, they had reason to believe that slavery was losing its commercial appeal. In this they were wrong. Eli Whitney's invention of the cotton gin in l793 (which the Founders could not possibly have anticipated) revived the demand for slavery in the South. Even so, the test of the Founders' project is the practical question: Did the American Founding strengthen or weaken the institution of slavery? 
<p>	The intellectual and moral ferment that produced the American Revolution, Gordon Wood argues, should be judged by its consequences. Before l776, slavery was legal in every state in America. Yet by l804, every state north of Maryland had abolished slavery, either immediately or gradually; Southern and border states prohibited further slave importations from abroad; and Congress outlawed the slave trade as soon as it was allowed to, in l808. Slavery was no longer a national but a sectional institution, and one under moral and political siege. "Before the revolution, Americans like every other people took slavery for granted," Wood says. "But slavery came under indictment as a result of the same principles that produced the American Founding. In this sense, the prospect of the Civil War is implicitly contained in the Declaration of Independence."
<p>	Abraham Lincoln was one of the most astute students of the American Founding in his time or since. He not only perceived the Framers' dilemma, but knew that he inherited it. The principle of majority rule is based on Jefferson's doctrine that "all men are created equal," yet what Harry Jaffa terms the "crisis of the house divided" arises when the majority denies that "all men are created equal" -- that is, denies the basis of its own legitimacy. Lincoln was presented with two concrete options: working to overthrow democracy, or working to secure consent through persuasion.
<p>	Conscious that he, too, must defer, as the Founders did, to prevailing prejudices, Lincoln nevertheless sought to neutralize those prejudices so they did not become a barrier to securing black freedom. In a series of artfully conditional claims about blacks -- "If God gave him little, that little let him enjoy" -- Lincoln paid ritual obeisance to existing racism while drawing even racists into his coalition to end slavery. Lincoln made these rhetorical concessions because he knew that the possibility for securing antislavery consent had improved since the 1780s.<p>
	In one of the clearest commentaries on the Declaration, Lincoln observed: "They intended to include all men, but they did not intend to declare all men equal in all respects. They did not mean to say all were equal in color, size, intellect, moral developments, or social capacity. They defined with tolerable distinctness in what respects they did consider all men created equalequal in certain inalienable rights. They did not mean to assert the obvious untruth, that all were then actually enjoying that equality, nor yet, that they were about to confer it immediately upon them. . . . They meant simply to declare the <i>right</i>, so that the <i>enforcement</i> of it might follow as fast as circumstances should permit."
<p>	By working through rather than around the democratic process, Lincoln justified the nation's faith in the untried experiment of representative self-government. In vindicating the slave's right to rule himself, Lincoln also vindicated the legitimacy of democratic self-rule. And Lincoln's position came to be shared by Frederick Douglass, who once denounced the Constitution but who eventually came to the conclusion that it contained antislavery principles: "Abolish slavery tomorrow, and not a sentence or syllable of the Constitution need be altered." Slavery, he concluded, was simply a "scaffolding to the magnificent structure, to be removed as soon as the building is completed." 
<p>	It took a civil war to destroy slavery, and with it much of the infrastructure and economy of the South, between l860 and l865. More than a half million whites died in that war, "one life for every six slaves freed," C. Vann Woodward reminds us. Although the question of slavery in the United States was ultimately resolved by force, Lincoln and Douglass both believed the triumph of the union and the emancipation of the slaves represented not the victory of might over right, but the reverse: Justice had won over expediency and the principles of the American Founding had at long last prevailed.
<p>
<b>The Price of Freedom
</b>

<p>	Whatever its functional relevance in a world utterly different from our own, slavery was a moral crime. People should not own other people. Unfortunately the practice of slavery persisted into the 20th century in many parts of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East: Saudi Arabia and Yemen outlawed it only in l962. According to the British Anti-Slavery International, which monitors the institution worldwide, it is still practiced covertly in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and the Arab world. In Mauritania alone, nearly l00,000 people are estimated to be enslaved.
<p>	The abolition of slavery in the West did not produce the abolition of racism. As George Fredrickson puts it, "The slaveholding mentality . . . remained the wellspring of white supremacist thought and action long after the institution that originally sustained it had been relegated to the dustbin of history." At the same time, abolition constitutes one of the greatest moral achievements of Western civilization. The reason for the acceptability of slavery prior to the 18th century is that the idea of freedom simply did not exist in an applied and comprehensive sense anywhere in the world.
<P>	It is understandable that American blacks, on discovering the circumstances in which their ancestors were brought to this country, would feel at best a qualified patriotism. But upon reflection this ambivalence may be unwarranted. Africans were not uniquely unfortunate to be taken as slaves; their descendants were uniquely fortunate to be born in the only civilization in the world to abolish slavery on its own initiative. For Zora Neale Hurston, the black feminist writer of the Harlem Renaissance, the legacy of slavery is one of opportunities for the future, not unceasing submersion in the past.
<p>	"From what I can learn, it was sad," she wrote. "Certainly. But my ancestors who lived and died in it are dead. The white men who profited by their labor and lives are dead also. I have no personal memory of those times, and no responsibility for them. Neither has the grandson of the man who held my folks. . . . I have no intention of wasting my time beating on old graves. . . . I do not belong to the sobbing school of Negroes who hold that nature somehow has given them a low-down dirty deal and whose feelings are all hurt about it. . . . Slavery is the price I paid for civilization, and that is worth all that I have paid through my ancestors for it."
	<p>A similar position was elaborated by Booker T. Washington, who was born a slave but went on to become the most powerful black statesman and educator in the United States: "Think about it: We went into slavery pagans; we came out Christians. We went into slavery pieces of property; we came out American citizens. We went into slavery with chains clanking about our wrists; we came out with the American ballot in our hands. . . . Notwithstanding the cruelty and moral wrong of slavery, we are in a stronger and more hopeful condition, materially, intellectually, morally, and religiously, than is true of an equal number of black people in any other portion of the globe."
<p>	Washington's argument is that slavery proved to be the transmission belt that nevertheless brought Africans into the orbit of modern civilization and Western freedom, so that future generations of black Americans would be far more free and prosperous than their former kinsmen in Africa. Washington's conclusion seems hard to deny: Slavery was an institution that was terrible to endure for slaves, but it left the <i>descendants</i> of slaves better off in America. For this, the American Founders are owed a measure of respect and gratitude.
