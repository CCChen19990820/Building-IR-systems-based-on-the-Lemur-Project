<P>CTLS members will gather this month at regional meetings to identify their
patrons' requirements in the year 2000 and beyond.  A professional facilitator
will conduct the five regional meetings using a focus group format.  The Long
Range Planning Committee will use your ideas about the services your patrons
will demand in the next century to prepare our SFY 2000 - SFY 2001 plan.  You
are urged to come and voice your patron's needs.  All of the regional meetings
will begin at 9 am and conclude by noon.  Registration and networking begins at
8:30 am.  </P>

<P><B>1996 TOCKER GRANTS ANNOUNCED 
</B><BR>On October 15 the Tocker Foundation announced the recipients of its
1996 grants for small libraries.  Of the 120 eligible libraries applying for
grants, 78 were either fully or partially funded.  A record $605,042 was awarded
to small public libraries this year, a 56% increase over 1995, when the
Foundation distributed a total of $387,755. 
</P>
<P>As the available pool of money grows, so does the competition.  More than
130 libraries submitted applications by the June 1, 1996 deadline.  As in the
past, projects of all kinds received support from the Foundation, although ten
applications were ineligible because the project was outside the scope of the
Foundation's mission.  Shelving, furniture, Internet access, audio books, music
CDs, large print books, children's materials, and reference collections are but
a sampling of the types of requests funded.  Automation projects did not fare
well this year&#151;of the 42 automation projects submitted, 22 went unfunded. 
Five automation projects were fully funded and 15 projects received partial
funding. 
</P>
<P>Sixteen of the 26 CTLS libraries that applied got a grant.  The 62% success
rate for CTLS members was slightly lower than the overall success rate of 65%. 
However, both figures are remarkable given the competitive nature of most
foundation grants. 
</P>
<P>Congratulations to the 16 CTLS member libraries receiving Tocker grants in
1996: Bertram, Burnet, Cedar Park, La Grange, Florence, Gatesville, Hearne,
Kyle, Lampasas, Leander, Marble Falls, McGregor, Navasota, Teague, Westbank, and
Wimberley. 
</P>
<P><B>MORE GOOD NEWS ON THE TOCKER FOUNDATION FRONT.....
</B>
<BR>Beginning in 1997 the Foundation will accept applications and award grants
twice a year.   Darryl Tocker, Executive Director of the Foundation, hopes that
this will make the process more convenient for small libraries.  If you missed
the June 1 deadline or if your last application was unsuccessful, you should
begin working on your next application now.  The first application deadline for
the new year will be January 15, 1997.  If the January deadline is too  soon for
you, the next application deadline will be in early summer. 
</P>
<P>The Tocker Foundation has also announced a Seminar Assistance grant for
librarians participating in the State Library's Small Library Management
Training Program.  The target group is public libraries serving a population of
under 12,000.  This grant will cover expenses for attending the TSL seminars; it
can be used for travel expenses or to pay for replacement personnel.  Requests
must be submitted five days before the actual date of training. With adequate
advance notice, the Foundation can send a check for expenses prior to the
seminar. 
</P>
<P>A new round of Small Library Management Training Program seminars is
scheduled to begin in the spring of 1997.  If financial limitations have kept
you from attending this excellent series, check out this Tocker grant.  For more
information contact Pat or Laurie at the System office.  
</P>
<P><B>AND STILL MORE GOOD NEWS FROM THE TOCKER FOUNDATION... 
</B><BR>It appears that the Tocker Foundation has been diligently seeking new
ways to help small public libraries all over Texas.  In partnership with the
Texas State Library, the Tocker Foundation will help underwrite the cost of the
new <I>Handbook of Texas</I> for libraries serving populations of under 12,000.
 Libraries that have already purchased this essential reference work will
receive a rebate directly from the publisher.  The Texas State Library will send
out information within the next two weeks detailing how the program will work. 
Watch your mailbox for details and be prepared to respond quickly.  
</P>
<P><B>A NEW SOURCE OF LIBRARY FUNDING</B> 
<BR>The Seawell Elam Foundation has contacted the Texas State Library and
requested help in letting Texas libraries know that the Foundation is interested
in providing grants to libraries. 
</P>
<P>The goals of the Foundation in providing grants to libraries are to fund
innovative programs that encourage reading and provide reading materials to meet
the needs of library patrons and the library community to be served,
particularly those libraries that &quot;may not have the financial resources of
larger cities, but a population that is eager to read.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The Foundation includes school libraries, public libraries, and
school/public library combinations in their funding criteria.
</P>
<P>This funding period the Seawell Elam Foundation has $21,500 to distribute. 
The approximate amount to be granted will range from $1,000 to $5,000.  The
Foundation is interested in funding family literacy and children's programs,
mainly through the purchase of books. 
</P>
<P>Community interest and support is encouraged and should be documented.  The
support can be in funds or in-kind donations of time and/or expertise.  Requests
that ask the Foundation to provide a portion of the support for a project
generally will receive greater priority than those that look to the Foundation
for total funding.
</P>
<P>The application process is in two steps.  There is a proposal letter that is
due December 15, 1996.  The proposal letters will be reviewed by the Foundation
and those that meet the funding priorities will receive a Grant Application by
January 20, 1997.  This application is due February 20, 1997.  See the checklist
to get the <I>Instruction Sheet</I> and <I>Grant Making Policies and Criteria</I>
for further information.
</P>
<P>Those libraries interested in applying for the grants must have 501(c)(3)
status or apply under the umbrella of a 501(c)(3) organization.  Contact Patty
Davis, Special Services Consultant at the Texas State Library, (512) 463-5476 or
the Seawell Foundation, P.O. Box 5353, Austin, Texas 78763, for more
information.

<P><B>CONGRATULATIONS TO KATHY TOON, THE 1996 SIDDIE JOE JOHNSON AWARD WINNER!

</B><BR>Nominations are now being accepted for the  prestigious Siddie Joe
Johnson Award.  The award  given annually at TLA conference, recognizes an 
outstanding Texas librarian and CRT member who  works with children from
preschool through eighth  grade and who has been active within the past  twelve
months.  Nominees are evaluated on the  basis of outstanding or innovative
programs, a  sustained high level of performance, leadership  ability,
involvement in professional organizations,  community involvement, and
cooperation with  parents and other libraries, especially outside their  own
system.
</P>
<P>Information requested for nominations is limited to five pages, including
letters of recommendation received from other colleagues and employers as well
as supporting data (such as examples of work, news articles, etc.) to establish
the merit of the candidate.  The recipient will be honored at the Children's
Round Table breakfast on Friday, April 11, 1997 in Fort Worth.  The 1996
recipient was Kathy Toon, manager of the Children's Center of the Dallas Public
Library.  The award was named in honor of Siddie Joe Johnson, who served as
children's librarian and coordinator of children's services for the Dallas
Public Library for 27 years.  Miss Johnson, a published poet and author, was the
recipient of awards from the Poetry Society of Texas and the Texas Institute of
Letters, as well as from the American Library Association for her work in
children's library service. 
</P>

<P><B>RESOURCES CHANGE FORMAT 
</B><BR><I>Physicians' Desk Reference</I>, the standby of the medical field,
has a new format.  Not only can you buy it in hardcover and CD-ROM, but it also
comes in a <I>Pocket PDR</I> format&#151;a hand-held electronic data storage
and retrieval system with a Franklin Digital Book System unit with
interchangeable data cards.  I'm not sure what that is, but it looks like a
small typewriter-keyboard electronic device with a screen.  Available in
February for $199.95, the device is perfect for doctors.  It's too small for
libraries; it's too easy to slip into a pocket or purse! 
</P>
<P><I>PDR</I> has also developed a Pocket <I>PDR</I> Desktop System.  Larger
than the item described above, it will sell for $249.95.  Again, I can see
doctors having this, but not libraries.  For more information about PDR and
their latest products (print and electronic), call them at (800) 442-6657. 
</P>
<P><I>Standard &amp; Poor's</I> has gone CD-ROM also.  Call(800) 221-5277 for
more information and a demo CD-ROM. 
</P>
<P><I>Encyclopedia of Careers and Vocational Guidance</I> is available in
print for $149.95 and in CD-ROM for $199.95 for one workstation. Network
versions are available also, probably better for a high school or college.  Call
(800) 306-9941 for more information. 
</P>
<P><B>CALLING ALL URLS! 
</B><BR>We have kept our eyes open for useful URLs on all sorts of topics and
have tried to reprint them in the newsletter or on CTLS-L whenever possible.  If
you have some great sites bookmarked, please share them.  Also, if there's a
topic for which you would like to know a few sites, call or email me and I'll
see what I have.  Early on in the training, we got the bookmarks of one of APL's
longtime reference librarians and Internet trainers, Carolyn Rogers.  I'm sure
she's added to hers by now, and I've added to it also, but there may be some
information that could help you.  Just let me know!
</P>
<P>Kelly Sinclair of the Belton City Library kindly gave me an extensive list
of her bookmarks.  Monica has copied them and sent them out to everyone.  For
those of you who are not on the net yet, just hold onto them!  Your time will
come.  If patrons come in and want to talk Internet with you, you can pull these
out and look smart!  
</P>
<P><B>CONTINUING EDUCATION REMINDERS 
</B><BR>The Texas State Library's Small Library Management Training Program
will begin again in the spring.  The sessions are two days each, and there will
be five altogether:  spring 1997, fall 1997, spring 1998, fall 1998, and spring
1999.  Each will cover a different aspect of running a library;  the last round
had experts in the state as trainers.  I sat in on all five of the last ones,
and even with 20+ years of professional library experience, I learned something
at each session. 
</P>
<P>Even if you have been running your library for a long time, consider
attending.  Those of you who are new since the last session should definitely
go.  The training is aimed at head librarians in libraries where there is only
one, or at the most, two, employee(s).  If you find your tongue hanging out by
the end of the day, and there never seems to be an end to the work, come to
this.  You will learn a lot, you will get away from your own library, and you
will have the chance to see how other libraries are run.  Often, the
participants contribute valuable insights to the discussion.
</P>
<P>To sign up, call Belinda Boon at the Texas State Library, (512) 463-6624. 
The sessions are:

<P><B>DEVELOPING A CIRCULATING CD-ROM COLLECTION 
</B><BR>A session at the recent American Library Association (ALA) Conference
In New York City was titled Multimedia Madness, Developing a Circulating CD-ROM
Collection.  This program presented by the Audiovisual Committee of the Public
Library Association (PLA) was partially a repeat of a program from the PLA
Conference in Portland, Oregon.  One new presenter in New York City was Jim
Oker, Encarta program manager at Microsoft Corporation, who brought a different
perspective to the discussion of circulating CD-ROMs in libraries.  Other
presenters at the ALA session included two public librarians and Irene Wood,
media reviews editor at <I>Booklist</I>. 
</P>
<P>Briefly, here are some points raised at the Multimedia Madness Session: 
</P>
<P>Patron surveys can be used to find out what equipment and software people in
the community own (Macs, PCs with Windows, etc.), but this is becoming less
important as more products come out that are more compatible  with all operating
systems. 
</P>
<P>Damage has not been as much of a problem as might be expected; scratches
seem to be the most prevalent problem, although sooner or later, a library will
have the problem of missing CDs. 
</P>
<P>One presenter's library has two collections of CD-ROMs for patron use:
approximately 20 CD- ROMs loaded on PCs in-house and another collection for
patrons to check out. 
</P>
<P>A short loan period should be used when the circulating collection is small
(one library started with a one week loan period).  JeweI cases have been used
successfully, but look at catalogs' other casing products.  CD-ROMs should be
fully cataloged so that holds can be placed on them.  Keep the actual disc at
the circulation desk, and display just its casing for browsing. 
</P>
<P>Juvenile titles are very popular; one presenter's library spends one third
of the multimedia budget on titles for children I0 years old and under. 
</P>
<P>The prices of CD-ROMs are coming down (Jim Oker pointed out that Microsoft's
<I>Encarta</I> has gone from costing more than $300 to less than $50). 
</P>
<P>Libraries usually do not purchase games; however, there are educational
games (<I>Oregon Trail</I> was mentioned as an example) which are worthwhile
library purchases. 
</P>
<P>There should be some sort of warning to patrons that when they use the
CD-ROM product at home, it may automatically install software or alter
configurations on their computer. (Oker says that more and more programs are
being issued with an &quot;uninstall' program which should take care of this
problem.) 
</P>
<P>On the disc itself either use no label or affix circular labels so that the
disc's running is not affected.
</P>
<P>It should be made clear to patrons that Iibrary staff cannot provide help in
installing or using CD- ROMs.  Patrons should be referred to the manufacturer
for help. 
</P>
<P>As previously stated, Jim Oker presented a software manufacturer's point of
view.  Some of his comments follow: 
</P>
<P>Microsoft is happy that libraries are circulating CD-ROMs.  The company
feels that this gives their products more exposure, since some people will try
out the product and then purchase it. 
</P>
<P>As costs come down, there is more incentive for manufacturers to make their
products as trouble- free as possible and provide more help on disc.  At $50 a
copy, it takes only one call to <I>Encarta's</I> help line to wipe out any
profit. 
</P>
<P>There are continuing problems with the inability to run programs because of
equipment incompatibility (sound cards, etc.), but programmers are addressing
these problems.  Programmers are also talking to each other more often, so that
products are beginning to look more alike. 
</P>
<P>Watch out for inferior &quot;shovelware.&quot;  This is where someone takes
a lot of free material (such as government material) and &quot;shovels&quot; it
on a CD, adds some video, and sells it.  (<I>STLS Currents</I> note: Reviews
can help here!)  DVD (Digital Videodisc) is a new technology, and hardware
should be out in time for the Christmas season.  However, Oker says that it will
be a year or so before much software will be available for it. Also, he believes
it will be video-driven for a good while, as movies are issued in this format.

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><A NAME="Automation">Automation and Cooperation Notes</A></FONT></I></B>
<BR>Bob Gaines   </P>
<P>Recently Betty Thompson, at Taylor Public Library, posted a request on
CTLS-L for computer book recommendations.   I posted a response, as did Carla
Wilkins, Librarian at Gibbs Memorial in Mexia.  Here is an expanded version of
what I suggested, with Carla's response following mine:
</P>
<P>Lately I've spent about five hours in several bookstores examining how-to
computer books.  I came away with three impressions: how many computer books are
being published, how rapidly they go out of date, and how expensive they are
($30 to $60 retail). 
</P>
<P>Ideally, your library would have a how-to book on each piece of
currently-hot software and hardware.  In reality, I suspect only the largest
CTLS libraries can afford to offer more than a handful of current books.
</P>
<P>If you can spend several hundred dollars, here's what I'd buy: One
beginner's book (these are the $30 books) on each of the most popular PC
software packages: MS Word, WordPerfect, and Windows 95.   I'd also get a
beginner's book on networking a small office (this could be networking with
Windows 95, as it is the most popular method), one on the Internet (remembering
that any book is already out of date), and one on troubleshooting PCs.  I don't
know anything about Macs except that there is a small shelf of Mac books in the
bookstores I visit. 
</P>
<P>If your budget can bear it, you could also get an intermediate-advanced book
($45 to $60) for  MS Word, WordPerfect, and Windows 95.  Often, these
intermediate-advanced books come with a CD-ROM disc with various kinds of
software.  Sometimes you can order them without the disc, and I recommend you do
so, as keeping up with the disc will be a headache.
</P>
<P>The best method of selecting specific how-to titles, particularly those for
beginners, is to go to a good bookstore and see which ones you find helpful (do
the illustrations really illustrate? does the author explain it so that you know
what he means?).  If you can't get to a bookstore, ask a knowledgeable computer
user which books or publishers they like; this also works well for the
intermediate titles. 
</P>
<P>Sams, Que, Sybex, New Riders, and Osborne McGraw Hill all publish good
how-to books, particularly for intermediate users.  New versions of popular
software are released every year or so.  Look for a revised edition by one of
the above publishers on the latest version of the software&#151;it's a good sign
that the author and book did well enough in an earlier edition to merit
continuation.  While the various &quot;...for Dummies&quot; titles are usually
OK as to content, I find them insufferably cute and visually distracting. 
However, many do like them, and a friend found one to have exactly what he
needed to know about Windows 95. 
</P>
<P>Bookstores or knowledgeable computer users are probably the best ways to
identify the how-to books to buy on current hardware and software, as they
should know what folks in your community are looking for.  If neither are
available to you, get a title from one of the publishers mentioned, perhaps the
McGraw Hill series suggested below by Carla Wilkins.  General-interest  titles,
such as a history of computers or the social implications of the Internet, can
safely be ordered on a review in <I>Booklist</I> or <I>LJ</I>. 
</P>
<P>Because change is so rapid, magazines are really the best sources for
keeping up, particularly for the Internet (why not check magazines out just as
you do books?).  Go to your supermarket or bookstore for locally popular titles.
 I see <I>Internet World, PC Magazine, PC Today, Byte</I>, and <I>Computer
Shopper</I> in my local supermarket.  If you have sufficient Mac users, look for
comparable Mac titles at your supermarket. 
</P>
<P>Unless you need a book on an earlier version of software, or have a specific
reason to buy an older book, I wouldn't buy any published prior to 1996. 
However, if you already have books on popular software (and I don't mean COBOL
or CP/M!) that are only a few years old, do keep them; same for older hardware. 
Not everyone trades up every year.  Just don't have only books that are older
than the kids who are picking through them. 
</P>
<P>Here are Carla Wilkins' suggestions:  &quot;A series called &quot;For Busy
People&quot; published by McGraw  Hill, is new to us, we ran across it and
decided to try it.  I find it very useful and it is a step above the &quot;For
Dummies&quot; series and gives a summary of chapters so you can skip over what
you already know.  It is intended for the beginner.  Two of the series which are
especially helpful are: <I>Internet for Busy People</I> and <I>Windows 95 for
Busy People</I> (0-07-882110-x). 
</P>
<P>&quot;The &quot;For Dummies&quot; series is popular with our patrons.  Like
Bob Gaines, I do not like it though, you have to wade through too much of the
cutesy stuff&#151;&quot;For Busy People&quot; is much better.  <I>The Internet
for Dummies</I> (1-56884-620-7) is especially popular with the patrons.
</P>
<P>&quot;The only Mac book I have is <I>Macs for Dummies</I> (1-878058-53-3)
because I felt like we needed one.  I don't find that it checks out often so
maybe it is an unnecessary item for your library.&quot;  
</P>
<P><B>EMAIL OFFER 
</B><BR>Email is already important for many libraries, but it is certain
eventually to become as ubiquitous as phone and fax is now.  About 43 CTLS
libraries have some access to email right now.  It may be a year or two before
every library has email, but the need to have it will be upon us sooner than you
might think.  For just one example, Tim Prather is now setting up a procedure to
receive ILL requests via email, and I am working on arrangements to email ILL
requests directly from the Web version of CaTaLySt.
</P>
<P>If you have been resisting getting email and don't have ready access to
email via the Internet, I have a deal I hope you can't refuse. 
</P>
<P>There is a company which provides free email service via a toll-free number.
 The company, which is called Juno, makes its money by sending occasional ads to
its email users.  Six CTLS libraries have been using Juno for several months
because they don't have access to email via the Internet.  I've been trying out
Juno also.  None of us find the ads objectionable (can it be any worse than TV
ads?). 
</P>
<P>Juno email does require a Windows-capable computer, which some libraries do
not have.   Fortunately, several members have returned older computers to CTLS
which can be upgraded to run Windows. 
</P>
<P>So, here's the deal: If you will agree to learn how to use email, I'll bring
you a suitable computer and provide the brief training needed to get you
started.  I think you'll be surprised to discover how easily email will become
one of your most valuable tools. 
</P>
<P>Call if you're interested or need more information to decide, but don't wait
too long, as I only have a couple of computers available.

</P>
<P><B>REQUESTING MATERIALS IN SPECIAL FORMATS
</B>
<BR>When requesting materials in special formats, please be sure to indicate in
a prominent way the format needed.  For example, if you are requesting a Large
Print edition, be sure to spell out <B>LARGE PRINT EDITION</B> somewhere where
it will be easy to spot.  Just indicating an LT call number on the request does
not make it clear that your patron wants only a Large Print edition.  Similarly,
when requesting an audio version of a book, place some kind of note in the
request stating <B>AUDIO ONLY</B> or something to that effect.   Especially
when using the modem form for requesting, please place the note as high up on
the page as you can (such as in the call number field, or next to the title),
since we often miss notes placed at the bottom of the request form in the &quot;Subject
or Substitute&quot; field. 
</P>
<P>When requesting special format materials for you from other libraries, we
try to always put in special notes emphasizing that we are requesting <B>AUDIO</B>
or <B>LARGE PRINT</B> or whatever the special format is.  Unfortunately, it is
very common for the lending libraries to overlook our notes and to send the
wrong format, usually a regular print book instead of Large Print, or the book
instead of the requested audio version.  When that happens, you can either
contact the lender and ask them to send the correct item, or re-submit the
request to us and we will try again.  
</P>
<P><B>ABBREVIATED JOURNAL TITLES 
</B><BR>When requesting journal articles, please do not abbreviate the journal

</P>
<P>Hello!  I am Amanda Williams, the new Youth Services Consultant here at
CTLS.  My previous work experience was as a Children's Librarian at the Dallas
Public Library and the Austin Public Library.  Most recently I have been working
on a doctorate at the University of Texas at Austin.  My area of specialization
is public library service to children.  Hopefully some time in 1997, I will
become Dr. Amanda (opposed to the Miss Amanda I was at storytime?). 
</P>
<P>Originally I am from Abilene, Texas, and I have also lived in Ft. Worth,
Denton, Dallas, and Austin.  I have three dear friends, my cats&#151;Buddy,
Earl, and Cleo.  Since I enjoy traveling and exploring the back roads of Texas,
I figure this job is perfect for me. 
</P>
<P>I have experience planning and presenting all types of public library
programs for children.  Before I went back to school, I survived 13 Summer
Reading Programs.  I do crafts and storytelling.  Although I really can't sing
and I'm not that great with puppets, I'm always willing to try.  My areas of
specialization include preschool storytime, literature for young children,
storytelling, and poetry for children.   
</P>
<P>I am very excited to be at CTLS and ready to  work with you.  Call me
anytime for anything!  Also, you can email me at
<A HREF="mailto:amanda@tenet.edu">amanda@tenet.edu</A>. 
</P>
<P><B>UPCOMING EVENTS</B><BR>Mark your calendars for two events that are

<P><B>NATIONAL LIBRARY WEEK TO CELEBRATE KIDS, LIBRARIES</B> 
<BR>National Library Week, April 13-19, 1997, will celebrate the many ways
libraries and librarians serve our nation's children. The theme: Kids Connect @
the Library. The goal: to encourage parents, grandparents, and other caregivers
to bring children to libraries and help them connect to books, computers, and
other resources that will help them learn and grow throughout their lives. 
</P>
<P>Mary R. Somerville, American Library Association president for 1996-97, is
using her presidency to advocate support for library services to youth.  She
points out that an investment in libraries is an investment in the future of our
youth and our country.

</B><BR>The Texas Media awards is a statewide amateur media competition
sponsored by the Texas Library Association.  Any Texas citizen of any age who is
an amateur in the area of media production may enter the competition.  </P>
<P>Now in its tenth year, the contest has grown from fewer than 50 entries to
over 200 entries this past year, reflecting the efforts of over 900 people. 
</P>
<P>Categories of media include audio tape, photography, slide/tape, and video
tape.  Two new categories have been added to the Awards for 1997: multimedia
productions; and a demonstration category for individual student Web pages.  The
video tape category is divided by production done with in-camera editing or with
electronic editing.  Categories are further divided by age groups.  First,
second, third place, and honorable mention awards are given in each media
category within each age grouping.  In addition, a Best of Show Award is given
to the most outstanding media production entered.
</P>
<P>The entry deadline is Friday, January 17, 1997.  All entries must be
postmarked or delivered to the TLA Office by this date.  A $5 entry fee per
individual, sponsoring organization, or school campus is required to defray
postage costs.  To receive an entry form, contact the TLA Office at (800)

<H1>Scripture Class</H1>
<HR WIDTH=75%>
</CENTER>
<P>What would an ordinary Greek-speaking non-Jew have understood
when the Greek text of scripture was read aloud in worship in about
the year 100 a.d.? This class takes a close look at the text
and is suited for beginning as well as longtime Christians interested in
exploring the depths of scripture.

<P>In the early 1980s, Dr. Kenneth Warren Hamstra began a "Scripture
Class" on Sunday mornings at the First Presbyterian Church in
Austin, Texas. The church building is located at 8001 Mesa Drive;
the class has continued for the past 15 years, generally
from late August of one year to late May of the following year.
Visitors are always welcome.

<P>As part of the class, Dr. Hamstra has been working on his own translation
of the scriptures, discussing the work with the class as he goes. I
joined the class in 1993 and, after some discussions, persuaded
Dr. Hamstra to share part of the ongoing (draft) work with others.
Ken has a high regard for the integrity and authenticity
of the Bible; he speaks and reads several languages, including the
Greek of the time when John was written.
<P>
Dr. Hamstra's first career was as a chaplain in the U.S. armed forces. He
is currently a professor of philosophy in Austin, teaching

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>John 10:1-21</B>
<P>(Translated according to everyday use of language, c. 100 A.D.)

<P>Copyright 1994 Kenneth Warren Hamstra

<P>1.              "In very truth I declare this to you:  The one who
doesn't come into the community cattle-yard by the gate but climbs over
some other way is a deceiver and a plunderer.  The one who comes in by
the gate is the range boss.  The gate guard opens up for the range boss,
and the cattle  respond to the boss's voice, and the range boss calls
each critter in that herd by name.  When the herd has been brought
outside, the range boss steps out at the head, and the cattle follow
because they recognize the boss's voice.  Anyone else they will not
follow:  they'll flee from such a one because they don't recognize anyone
else's voice."

<P>6.           (Jesus told this metonymic tropology to them, but they
couldn't get their minds around the things he was speaking to them.  So
Jesus spoke again.)

<P>7b.             "In very truth I declare this to you.  I am is the gate
for the cattle.  All those who came prior to me are deceivers and
plunderers, but the cattle didn't respond to them.  I am is the gate.
Anyone who enters in by my agency will be salvaged and will be set free
to go in and out and discover their inheritance.  The deceiver comes for
no purpose other than to mislead, to engage in pagan sacrifice, and to
destroy utterly.  I came so they might have not just life, but an
overflowing life.

<P>11.            "I am is the completely moral range boss.  The completely
moral boss puts life on the line for the herd.  The hired hand is not the
range boss, and doesn't own the herd.  The hired hand spots the wolf
coming, leaves the herd, and gets out of there.  And indeed the wolf does
attack and scatter--because, after all, a hired hand is a hired hand and
doesn't feel any obligation for the herd.

<P>14.           "I am is the completely moral range boss.  I know my own
and my own know me, even as the Father knows me and I know the Father.  I
even put my soul on line for the herd.

<P>16.             "I have another herd which does not come out of this
cattle-yard, and these also I must lead out.  They shall respond to my
voice, and there shall be a single herd and a single range boss.

<P>17.           "This is why the Father's steadfast love is toward me,
because I lay down my soul so that I may take it up again.  Not that
anyone takes it from me:  rather, I myself lay it down.  I have the
authority to lay it down, and I have the authority to take it up again.
I have received this commission from my Father."

<P>19.          A schism arose among the Jews over this Logos.  Many of them
declared,  "He is possessed by an inferior deity and is stark raving mad.
Why do you listen to him?"  Others declared, "These are not the words of
one possessed by an inferior deity:  besides, an inferior deity doesn't
have the power to open blind eyes, does he?"ep).  Except for long usage and the images
produced by artists, there seems little benefit to be gained by
translating the (customary) plural of this term, Probata, as anything
other than the collective noun:  cattle. "sin", therefore, in the NT sense, is to miss the point of living, to
live in futility and pointlessness.  It is significant that both Paul in
his writings and the school of John (i.e., the Fourth Gospel) hold to a
view  which says that not just individuals but the whole of the created
order (cosmos) exists in just such a state as this.  On this view not
just we but our very time and times are out of joint (to use
Shakespeare's phrase, for he understood this condition much better than
many if not most theologians).  This means, in turn, that people are
"lost" whenever they wander about without a focus, without a point to
their existence, without really "living"!  Jesus said he came to rectify
this lack.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>By contrast:  paraptoma {parapipto, v.}:  8 times only in the NT:  Mt
6:14, 15; Mk 11:25, 26; 2 Cor 5:19; Eph 2:1; Col 2:13.
corresponds most often with Hebrew asham/ashmah, which have to do
with guilt offerings and the guilt which underlies such offerings.
Literally, a falling beside (most usual translation, (a) trespass);
hence, and figuratively, a falling aside from the Torah (OT) or the
Gospel (NT).
<P>and:  parabaino; parabantes/ parabasis/parabates:  13 times in NT:  Mt
15:2, 3; 2Jn 9; Ro 2:27; 4:15; 5:14; Gal 3:19; I Tim 2:14; Heb 2:2; 9:15;
Gal 2:18; Jas 2:9, 11.
corresponds most often with Hebrew maal (a stepping over the line) and
pasha/pesha (a stepping aside; a rebellion) A going beyond, an
overstepping of Torah (OT) or the teachings of Jesus (or the particular
apostle who is writing a letter).  (Note:  in the Passive voice it means
to be offended against.)  Translated variously as transgression or
trespass.

<H1>Latest reports from the field</H1>
<H2>Day 1 - All up in the air</H2>
<P>Well, we made it. Twelve months of planning culminated in around 50 of us
descending on the American Airlines check in desk at Austin's Robert Meuller
Municipal Airport early this afternoon in preparation for the start of the
journey. As I type this we are cruising at about 30,000 feet somewhere
over Iowa (or is it Oklahoma ? It's tricky to tell from up here) and, as
far as we can tell, all members of the party are safely on the plane.
<P>The hot topic of discussion is Melatonin and pills are being popped
left and right as people realise that it is now bed time on the other
side of the Atlantic. I'm a pretty hopeless eastward traveller but I
think I'll steer clear and watch for side-effects in the others first !
<P>After arriving in Chicago in an hour or so, our flight onwards to
Glasgow takes off at 8:45 this evening and a sleepless night looks very
likely. Just as long as we are all ready for the ceilidh on Saturday.....
<H2>Day 2 - It's Glasgow so this must be Thursday</H2>
<P>Contrary to last night's prediction, some of us actually slept on the plane.
Even more surprising (to me at any rate) is the fact that I was one of them.
Regardless of whether it was sleep or merely a Gin and Tonic induced stupor,
the end effect was the same and I arrived feeling rather more refreshed than
I had anticipated.
<P>Almost everyone appears to have had a pleasant flight though one person
(who shall remain anonymous lest their future colleagues in Hawaii get wind of
it :-) ) did report being rather sick during the night. We are, however, a
sympathetic bunch and she appears none the worse for wear this morning.
<P>After the usual frustration of clearing immigration and waiting for luggage,
the party was met at the airport by our tour company representative and my
parents, and headed straight to the hotel at which point about half our number
hit the sack for a few hours of sleep. The rest of us spent the day wandering
about the city, trying to find an ATM that would accept IBM Texas Credit Union
cards, window shopping, architecture watching and looking for modem cables
suitable for the British phone system. By the time we all headed back to the
hotel it was clear that having a Cirrus symbol on an ATM card doesn't
guarantee that you can get at your money but a Visa one is pretty safe.
<P>Tonight sees us attending a welcome dinner in the Glasgow Hilton (assuming
everyone remembers to wake up in time) but a report of this extravaganza
will have to wait until tomorrow since an hour or so of shut-eye is called
for to allow me to maintain consciousness during the meal.
<H2>Day 3 - Galleries Galore</H2>
<P>Last night's (very successful) dinner was thoroughly appreciated by all and
a good night's sleep was pretty much assured by a visit to a local pub for a
nightcap. The bar staff were no doubt somewhat surprised when 20 or 30
Americans arrived in what would otherwise have been a rather sleepy evening
but the additional revenue was probably to their liking. Some of our number,
including at least one highly placed member of the church hierarchy, were so
intent on joining in the Scottish experience that they ended up being the last
to leave one drinking establishment.
<P>This morning (which, incidentally, started with a sunrise at about 3:30am
due to the latitude) saw us savouring the delights of Scottish breakfast
cuisine in the Hilton restaurant. Several people inadvertantly tried haggis
and admitted that it was actually quite pleasant and even more got stuck into
the excellent kippers and smoked haddock. After the feast, a few hours sitting
on the coach as it toured Glasgow seemed a great way to rest.
<P>Rest was especially needed by one member of our party who, despite explicit
warnings, decided that a 110V hair drier could be operated in a 240V socket
and was somewhat taken aback when the unit turned into a smoke generator and
blew the hotel room fuse.
<P>Unfortunately rest was not to be had since
the day involved a fair amount
of walking. Visits had been arranged to the Kelvingrove Art Gallery (housing
an excellent collection of European masterpieces - Matisse, Degas, Van Gogh,
Whistler, Manet, Rembrandt, etc.), the Glasgow Transport
Museum (a must for any train, tram, car or ship fan), the Burrell Collection
(housed in a beautiful, custom designed, 1982 building in Pollock Park) and
Glasgow
Cathedral. The highlight of the day for many was a chance to see Salvador
Dali's dramatic and moving painting "Christ of St John of the Cross".
<P>Being a local, I ducked out of the group shortly after this to head back to
Lanark to do a bit of visiting prior to the rest of the choir arriving the
next day so I'm afraid that I can't shed any light on further happenings from
Friday afternoon. No doubt someone will be kind enough to provide some more
juicy gossip before tomorrow's report, though.
<H2>Day 4 - Party Time !</H2>
<P>Saturday started with free time and sightseeing in Glasgow for those of the
choir who were still there. Despite my absence, I gather that most people
enjoyed the experience though George Manson was acosted by a native who took
offense at his choice of sweater. One adventurous party also headed to
"The Baras", Glasgow's most famous flea market.
<P>After lunch, the buses were boarded and the choir drove up the beautiful
Clyde Valley to Lanark for our rehearsal with the Upper Clyde Operatic
Society, our hosts for the evening's festivities.
<P>The concert prior to the ceilidh (pronounced "kay-lay") turned out to be a
rather larger affair than we had anticipated with an audience of a couple of
hundred people but, undaunted by the crowd and the lights (and the spangly
backcloths and Texan and Scottish flags on the stage) both choirs sang
extremely well. UCOS offered a selection of numbers from their recent shows
including Merry Widow, Gondoliers, Pirates of Penzance, Showboat and Carousel
followed by several Robert Burns songs. Our choir then performed some
spirituals, Amazing Grace and Caledonia, a Scottish folk song which had
audience members crying in their seats (almost :-) ). Soloists from both
choirs performed beautifully and were very well received by the listeners.
<P>Following the performance, a buffet meal was served including such Scottish
delicacies as haggis (which many people tried out of courtesy and were
surprised to discover that they enjoyed), stovies (a hot-pot of
sausage, potato and onion) and cloutie dumpling (a dumpling boiled in a muslin
cloth).
<P>Many folks were pretty impressed by the hospitality and quality of the
party to this point but, before we had even had time to digest dinner, the
band struck up and the dancing began. Locals and guests mixed freely so
learning the steps was not a problem but for many of us, the exertion was
distinctly more than we were used to ! Rumour also has it that a certain
teenage member of our party (who shall remain Morgan) stole the hearts of
several of the young members of the Operatic Society Bass section ;-)
<P>By the time the dancing stopped at 12:40am, everyone was ready for the
short trip back to the Popinjay Hotel and a night's rest before the rigours of
Sunday.
<H2>Day 5 - Sing, sing, sing</H2>
<H3>Part 1</H3>
<P>Sunday has been an absolute marathon of a day so far and, as I type this,
it is only just past lunchtime ! We were hosted this morning by the
congregation of Greyfriars Parish Church in Lanark (my old church) where we
took part in an outstanding worship service, joining forces with the local
choir in the 8 part anthem "O Magnum Mysterium" by Gallus. The service was
conducted jointly by local ministers, Revs. Catherine and David Collins and
by our own appropriately named, senior pastor, Bob Bruce. During the service,
gifts were exchanged, the Lanark congregation presenting First Presbyterian of
Austin with a banner commemorating the visit and an inscribed antique pulpit
bible, and our church presenting Greyfriars with a mounted and lit section of
stained glass from the original downtown Austin church.
<P>The service ended with a singing of Kinley and Lee's new hymn, "Great and
Gracious God" which had been dedicated to the ministers and congregation of
Greyfriars. The hymn went down so well that David Collins has asked permission
to submit it for inclusion in the new Church of Scotland hymn book !
<P>Following worship, the people of Greyfriars had organised a
huge congregational lunch leaving their visitors absolutely overwhelmed by the
hospitality and in need of a rest before the next bout of singing begins at
3:30pm.
<H3>Part 2</H3>
<P>It's now Monday and I'm falling down in my obligation to update this page
each evening. Hopefully you'll excuse me given the number of things going
on yesterday !
<P>Despite our fears that we would be singing to small audiences, Greyfriars
Church was filled to overflowing last night (about 350 people, I expect) for
our first Scottish performance of the main programme including Melodious
Accord (as performed in Austin a couple of weeks ago). The programme
also included various organ pieces played with the usual gusto by Scott
McNulty and several pieces by the brass ensemble that would later accompany
the choir.
<P>From our perspective, things went fine though line-of-sight problems led
Scott to be left behind at the start of the White "Cantate Domino" when Kinley
started before he was ready. The basses also suffered section-wide amnesia
during one of the early movements of Melodious Accord, skipping a whole stave
and failing to come in for about 5 bars. Hopefully no-one in the audience
noticed and certainly no-one has commented to me. I like to think that we
take the Persian Rug approach to music - only God is perfect so we must
introduce a few flaws to prove our fallibility ! :-)
<P>With the performance finished, the choir adjourned to the Wilson household
for whisky and shortbread. A litle advice - if anyone ever suggests that you
employ a certain choir president's wife in your bar, think twice since a
little birdy tells me that she averages rather less than the usual 24 shots of
whisky from a bottle (Scottish standard measures) !
<P>As the rest headed back to the Popinjay Hotel, I hit the Crown Tavern for a
final evening of socialising with school friends, ending an almost perfect
weekend in Lanark (only "almost" coz my girlfriend is still back in Austin :-(
). While on the topic of friends, I would like to propose that
David and Jane Wyllie be offered Choir Groupie status since they drove
from London, a round trip of just under 1000 miles, specially to hear us !
<H2>Day 6 - History and Recuperation</H2>
<P>After the frenetic pace of Saturday and Sunday, Monday was a day for rest.
The golfers headed off to Mouse (pronounced "Moose") Valley Golf Club for a
day's play and the rest visited the wonderful, historic village of New Lanark
and the Falls of Clyde. Personally, I spent the day in Lanark speaking to yet
more friends and buying several pounds of chocolate to tide me over till my
next trip back at Christmas (sorry, guys, but Hershey's is not a patch on
either Cadbury's Dairy Milk or Galaxy).
<P>Further news of our next concert came to light yesterday. While we had all
expected the Edinburgh performance in Crammond Kirk to be a fairly small
affair, it appears that 1200 tickets have been distributed (though it is not
known how many will yield audience members) and that the concert has been
promoted on BBC Radio Scotland - the national radio station !
<P>Tomorrow we leave Lanark and it's superb hospitality (not that I'm biased,
of course) and head to Edinburgh. Hopefully this will give me some time to
come up with more juicy gossip and to think up a few more superlatives to
describe the trip !
<H2>Day 7 - Edinburgh and Roadworks</H2>
<P>Another performance-free day today for the choir as we moved back into
tourist mode for our visit to Edinburgh. The day started off on a sombre note
as the weekend's hospitality and many new friends in Lanark were left behind
(along with Kinley and Chris who missed the bus !) but things improved along
with the weather as we headed to Edinburgh.
<P>The first bus arrived on schedule and drove around for a while allowing us
to marvel at the Georgian architecture of the New Town and the considerably
older buildings on the Royal Mile. A visit to the castle and St. Giles
Cathedral ended the organised part of the day and we headed to Pollock Halls
to check into our rooms. Kinley and Chris were there to greet us with the keys
already organised, having made their way to Edinburgh by other means (the
Mac Wilson taxi service should be turning a profit this week).
<P>It transpires that the second bus ran into a few problems since the
route
that had been planned through the city (different from the bus 1 route) was
blocked in several places by roadworks ! Despite this frustration, they
arrived only slightly after the first bus.
<P>With the afternoon free, most people took buses back into the city and
wandered around Princes Street, the gardens and the shops. Several of us were
happy to find that "Phantom of the Opera" was still playing at the Edinburgh
Playhouse and the two-for-one ticket deal on seats in the stalls was taken up
by at least five of us this evening (yes, 2 for 1 does not translate well into
5 tickets. The sixth ticket went to waste because we couldn't find anyone to
give it to !).

<P>Tomorrow sees more sightseeing in Edinburgh, a trip to Dalmeny House,
another golf competition and the performance in Crammond. Watch this space for
all the latest gossip.

<H2>Day 8 - A Historical First</H2>
<P>The group split into three this morning for various activities. Our golfing
contingent headed off to play a match against the Session of Cramond Kirk
while another group visited Dalmeny House. The rest of us stayed in Edinburgh
and visited various tourist attractions (in my case, a day of galleries and
museums (OK, "musea" if you are feeling gramatically pedantic) - cultured or what ?).
<P>The group was very well received at Dalmeny House which had been opened
specially for them. They were especially proud to be shown the real silver. It
appears that this is normally hidden away when the house is open but our
status as a church group made us more trustworthy than the general public.
<P>The golfers had a good time but none of our group was willing to comment on
the score. The Session Clerk of Cramond Kirk also refused to provide numbers
but stated, diplomatically, that Cramond "got a result" - Scottish soccer
parlance for a win.
<P>The evening concert at Cramond turned out to be a great success. We shared
the programme with the Eskdale Singers, a group of ladies who had been singing
together since their school days and who provided us with some beautiful
renditions of a diverse range of pieces including "The Rhythm of Life" and
various traditional Scots songs. Our programme had been altered from the
Sunday concert with much of Melodious Accord replaced by spirituals (there
was no brass accompaniment in Cramond) and this seemed to go down well with
the audience. Several people from Lanark drove through to Edinburgh for the
concert and all agreed that the choir sounded more relaxed than it had at the
weekend (probably due to jet lag being a thing of the past and no ceilidh the
previous night !).
<P>Following the performance, Cramond Kirk provided a reception for both
choirs and followers and presented Kinley with a model of their church as a
momento of the visit. Kay Swadener picked up some leaflets detailing the
history of the chuch and it seems that there has been worship on the site for
14 centuries and in all that time, we are the first American choir to perform
there !
<P>Tomorrow we are once again on the road and head to Oban via Stirling,
Perth, Scone Palace and a distillery.
<H2>Day 9 - Whistlestop Tour</H2>
<P>We became tourists once again with a vengeance today, covering over 200
miles and visiting three main tourist sites on our way from Edinburgh to Oban.
A whole day on the coaches was welcomed by most people who were in need of a
rest after a strenuous day's walking on Wednesday. For a small number, however,
the experience was dampened by feelings of travel sickness brought on by
the windy Scottish roads and helped little by large doses of dramamine, etc.
<P>Both coaches left Edinburgh at 9:00am (after a minor panic when porters
organised to help pack luggage failed to turn up) and headed to Stirling Castle
for the first visit of the day. To my mind, Stirling is a better example of a
castle than Edinburgh - it feels more like a fortification and less like a
small town on a hill. The views from the ramparts were also spectacular with
the Wallace Monument on one side and the start of the Highland mountains
ringing the north and west horizons.
<P>From Stirling, the coaches parted, one heading to Scone Palace near Perth
(the crowning place of the early Scottish kings and queens) and the other
heading to the Glenturret Distillery near Crieff. Both places proved very
interesting though both parties would have liked to have been able to spend
several more hours exploring the extensive gardens and parkland around the
Palace.
<P>The coaches joined once again at Crianlarich and headed off on the final
part of the journey to Oban via the awe-inspiring scenery of the Rannoch Moor
and Glencoe - a textbook example of a glacial valley with 3000 foot mountains
rising steeply from a flat valley floor. We arrived in Oban at 7:30pm and
checked in to our hotels (after some confusion arising from an overbooking
problem at the Columba Hotel).
<P>Despite a full day, there is, I'm afraid, nothing new to report in the
scandal, gossip and malicious rumour department. My spies tell me that Adam Cox
shot a legendarily bad round of golf yesterday and wished he had joined the
rest of his family in their trip to St. Andrews. I wonder if he would have
had second thoughts if he had known that they were sporting a lovely puce
coloured rental car ?
<H2>Day 10 - Rain, rain go away</H2>
<P>Congratulations today to Rebecca Morgan who celebrated her 14th birthday
and to Jim and Susan Garrison whose wedding anniversary this is.
<P>Celebration was not on their minds, however, when the day started with a
bang or, more literally, a wail.  Our slumbers were rudely ended by the hotel
fire alarm which went off at 5:30am getting everyone outside in various states
of undress (Doris Clark looked great in her curlers and Mary Glover's bath
robe and towel were very dashing).  They say every cloud has a silver lining
and I suppose Bob Swanson and I should be thankful since it transpired that
the alarm clock we were using had a dead battery and would not have gone off.
<P>The earlier excitement guaranteed that we were all ready for the 8:00am
ferry from Oban to Craignure on Mull and, from there, by bus to Fionnphort and
the ferry to Iona. While we had been incredibly lucky with the weather up
until today, this luck dried up and the weather was pretty horrible with low
visibility and drizzle. As a result, very little of the spectacular Mull
scenery was visible on our outward journey and our walk to Iona Abbey resulted
in most people getting very wet.
<P>Spirits undampened, however, our performance at noon proved a great
success, the
choir incredibly honoured and humbled to be singing in such a significant and
ancient church. Our audience was also distinclty larger than expected with
our usual camp followers augmented by a coachload of French tourists and
several Iona residents.
<P>After the performance, we were very pleased to find that the weather was
clearing and we had a chance to see Iona and Mull in broken sunshine during
the trip back to Oban. All in all, everyone agreed that the day had been a
wonderful experience despite the morning weather and one other choir member
even commented that if we had not sung anywhere but Iona Abbey on our tour, he
would have been content.
<P>Tomorrow we head back to Glasgow for our final performance and the farewell
dinner.
<H2>Day 11 - Glasgow and Packing</H2>
<P>An early start (thankfully unaided by any fire alarms this morning) saw us
on the road to Glasgow from Oban at 8:30am. Traffic and road works turned out
to be less of a problem than our guides had anticipated and we stopped for
half an hour in Inveraray. Most of us spent the time in a tea room since the
weather was not really conducive to wandering around the town.
<P>A couple of hours and several castles later, we were in Glasgow and headed
straight for our concert venue, Renfield St. Stephen's Parish Church, arriving
at 12:10 and giving us about 40 minutes to warm up before the performance at
1pm.
<P>Having been rejoined by the brass players, the concert programme looked
very similar to that given in Lanark the previous Sunday though some first
half alterations were made to replace a couple of the a capella pieces with
spirituals (which had gone down well at other performances).
<P>The performance was remarkably well attended given that it was a Saturday
lunchtime and the 100 or so people there appeared to enjoy the concert. For
the first time we were even asked to resing one specific item after we had
finished. <H2>Day 12 - End of the Road</H2>
<P>After a final afternoon of shopping and packing, we boarded the coaches
(OK, Lewis, I promise never to call them "buses" again) and headed to
Deauville's Restaurant for our farewell dinner. In addition to an outstanding
meal, this event included a demonstration of highland dancing and a recitation
of Robert Burns' "Address to the Haggis". On a lighter note, Doug Lefeve
(El Presidente) handed out various award certifiicates to distinguished
members of the party, including:
<UL>
<LI> The "Daftest Question of the Week" Award to
Greg Swadener for the classic 'Just how long is the Royal Mile ?"
<LI> The "Obnoxious Teenager" Award to Dave Brace
<LI> The "Teachers Pet" Award to Suzanne Johnson and Joyce Schnurr for
appearing outside the Oban hotel during the fire alarm clutching their music.
<LI> The "Dilbert" award for yours truly and the trusty laptop (I'm not a
complete geek, honest !).
</UL>
<P>The evening ended with group photos of choir and groupies on the restaurant
staircase, a quick rendition of "Keep Your Lamps Trimmed and Burning" for
the restaurant staff and a massed singing of "Auld Lang Syne" (pronounced with
an "S" rather than a "Z" !) in the resaurant's front garden.
<P>Most people would have expected the evening's festivities to end after this
but a diehard group chose to paint Glasgow red on their last night only to
discover that the Bon Accord Bar closes at midnight. Another group decided
that staying in the Hilton bar would be a better bet and it appears that some
of them finally called it an evening at 2am after consuning rather a large
number of Harvey Wallbangers.
<H2>Day 12 - Final Farewell</H2>
<P>After a sleep in and a leisurely breakfast, we said goodbye to Glasgow at
11:30 this morning and headed to the airport. Spirits are mixed, just now with
many people wishing the tour could have been longer but also looking forward
to getting back to Austin. Personally, I feel that the whole experience was at
least 10 times better than I had ever imagined it would have been - the
hospitality of my fellow countrymen was absolutely outstanding and the
welcomes received by the choir were first class.
<P>A word of thanks is due at this point. The tour was primarily organised
by Chris
Manson, our travel agent/alto, who worked with Prestige Tours in Scotland to
put together a first rate programme of visits and a collection of excellent
accomodation. Huge thanks are also due to my parents (not that I am biased, of
course) for the enormous amount of work they did liasing with the various
churches we were visiting and generally acting as contacts and taxi drivers
during the choir's time in Lanark.
<P>I already suggested offering honourary Choir Groupie status to a couple of
people and feel that it is only appropriate that we do the same for the
Gilbert's of Lanark who attended every one of our performances apart from the
one on Iona (which is particularly difficult to get to).
<P>Once again, from 30,000 feet above Oklahoma though heading in the opposite
direction, it's time for this roving reporter to sign off.

<P>Hey Guys!

<P>We hear the yellow ribbons are out in Austin as most activity there came to
a standstill after you left.
Thanks for the continuing updates, this really lets us peek in on the trip
(peeping Tom, and Carol).
<P>Tell Adam Cox about the man who shoots a consistent 69 round of golf. He
shoots 69 and then leaves the course, even if he's only on the 12th green!
<P>Keep up the great work and mission.
<P>You're in our thoughts and prayers.

<P>Dear Choir,
<P>From Tim's Kite page, to Calvin and Hobbes, to First Presbyterian Church

<p>If you have read the textual reports of our travels during the second two weeks of June, 1996, you will no doubt be 
interested in seeing some of our exploits too. This page contains a selection of photos taked during the trip and some 
more explanation. Click each small image to show a larger version.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flash.net/~dawilson/pictures/sandston.jpg"><img src="scot15.jpg" align=left border=0 hspace=0 width=118 height=169></a>We started our tour in the city of Glasgow, visiting various landmarks in our two days there. This 
picture shows a detail of the Kelvingrove Art Gallery (much of Glasgow's west end is constructed of 
local red sandstone) which house a large collection of European art upstairs with a natural history 
museum on the lower floor. Below, are pictures of the Burrell Collection, another very popular 
museum in the city and Glasgow Cathedral (which also provided the stained glass to the right.</p>
<p align=center><a href="http://www.flash.net/~dawilson/pictures/burrell.jpg"><img src="scot5.jpg" align=middle border=0 width=114 height=169></a><a href="http://www.flash.net/~dawilson/pictures/cathedrl.jpg"><img src="scot6.jpg" align=middle border=0 width=118 height=169></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flash.net/~dawilson/pictures/rehearse.jpg"><img src="scot24.jpg" align=left border=0 hspace=0 width=118 height=169></a>Our next stop was in the town of Lanark, 30 miles south east of Glasgow (my home town). Work 
started straight away with a rehearsal in the Memorial Hall for the evening concert and ceilidh. The 
collection of photos below show the evening fun. At last, conclusive proof that women are attracted 
to kilted guys !</p>
<p align=center><a href="http://www.flash.net/~dawilson/pictures/band.jpg"><img src="scot7.jpg" align=middle border=0 width=169 height=118></a><a href="http://www.flash.net/~dawilson/pictures/billjo.jpg"><img src="scot8.jpg" align=middle border=0 width=106 height=169></a><a href="http://www.flash.net/~dawilson/pictures/ceilidbb.jpg"><img src="scot9.jpg" align=middle border=0 width=118 height=169></a><a href="http://www.flash.net/~dawilson/pictures/cgroup.jpg"><img src="scot10.jpg" align=middle border=0 width=169 height=134></a></p>
<p align=left><a href="http://www.flash.net/~dawilson/pictures/gryfriar.jpg"><img src="scot21.jpg" align=right border=0 hspace=0 width=169 height=118></a>Our hosts for the ceilidh were the Upper Clyde Operatic Society but on Sunday we changed 
hands and were wonderfully looked after by the congregation of Greyfriars Church. The 
picture on the right shows the interior of the church and below is one of the hall during lunch 
and of my parents who hosted a garden party for everyone after the evening concert.</p>
<p align=center><a href="http://www.flash.net/~dawilson/pictures/greyfrln.jpg"><img src="scot20.jpg" align=middle border=0 width=118 height=169></a><a href="http://www.flash.net/~dawilson/pictures/parents.jpg"><img src="scot1.jpg" align=middle border=0 width=165 height=139></a></p>
<p align=left><a href="http://www.flash.net/~dawilson/pictures/edinbrgh.jpg"><img src="scot14.jpg" align=left border=0 hspace=0 width=118 height=169></a><a href="http://www.flash.net/~dawilson/pictures/pollock.jpg"><img src="scot25.jpg" align=right border=0 hspace=0 width=118 height=169></a>After Lanark, our travels took us north east to Edinburgh, Scotland's capital city. 
The photo on the left shows the city skyline - the Scott Monument and National 
Gallery of Scotland visible in the centre with Princes Street Gardens in front. The 
forground shows the pet cemetary inside Edinburgh Castle. To the right is a 
picture of the administration block for Pollock Halls, our accomodation for the 
days we were in Edinburgh. Before you get the impression that all of Edinburgh is 
old, I should point out that most of the rest of the site comprises 1960s concrete 
blocks !</p>
<p align=left>&#160;</p>
<p align=left><a href="http://www.flash.net/~dawilson/pictures/arthurst.jpg"><img src="scot2.jpg" align=right border=0 hspace=0 width=109 height=165></a><a href="http://www.flash.net/~dawilson/pictures/edinhotl.jpg"><img src="scot13.jpg" align=right border=0 hspace=0 width=118 height=169></a><a href="http://www.flash.net/~dawilson/pictures/crammond.jpg"><img src="scot12.jpg" align=right border=0 hspace=0 width=118 height=169></a>Our hosts in Edinburgh were the congregation of Crammond 
Kirk, a very historic church in the west of the city which boast a 
building part of which dates back to the 1400s. Their grounds 
also include the remains of a Roman settlement. To the right, 
you can see people enjoying Crammond's hospitality after our 
concert there as well as a couple of general Edinburgh shots 
including one of Arthur's Seat, a well known landmark and 
popular destination for walks and drives.</p>
<p align=left><a href="http://www.flash.net/~dawilson/pictures/stirling.jpg"><img src="scot28.jpg" align=left border=0 hspace=0 width=169 height=118></a>From Edinburgh, we traveled north and west, heading for our next concert on Iona. Our 
touring day took us to Stirling Castle (left) and Scone Palace (rponounced &quot;Scoon&quot;), famous 
as the coronation site for Scotland's kings. <a href="http://www.flash.net/~dawilson/pictures/glencoe.jpg"><img src="scot19.jpg" align=right border=0 hspace=0 width=118 height=169></a>In addition to the history, Scone Palace is also 
proud of the large number of peacocks which inhabit the gardens. 
Pictures here show the chapel in the grounds, the rhododendrons which 
were in full bloom and Becky Meason making friends.During the day, we 
also drove through the spectacular scenery of Glencoe.</p>
<p align=left><a href="http://www.flash.net/~dawilson/pictures/stirlgrp.jpg"><img src="scot29.jpg" align=middle border=0 width=169 height=118></a><a href="http://www.flash.net/~dawilson/pictures/sconechp.jpg"><img src="scot26.jpg" align=middle border=0 width=169 height=122></a><a href="http://www.flash.net/~dawilson/pictures/beckypea.jpg"><img src="scot3.jpg" align=middle border=0 width=165 height=96></a></p>
<p align=left><a href="http://www.flash.net/~dawilson/pictures/ionaview.jpg"><img src="scot23.jpg" align=left border=0 hspace=0 width=118 height=169></a>I think it is fair to say that our performance in Iona Abbey was probably the high point of the trip for 
many people. The peace and quiet on the whole island is incredible but the atmosphere inside the 
abbey is truly incredible. The view to the left was taken beside the jetty where the ferry docks as was 
the group picture below. To the right, some of our party are seen on the ferry from Oban to Mull. 
<a href="http://www.flash.net/~dawilson/pictures/ionagrp.jpg"><img src="scot22.jpg" align=top border=0 width=169 height=118></a><a href="http://www.flash.net/~dawilson/pictures/ionafery.jpg"><img src="scot16.jpg" align=top border=0 width=169 height=118></a>&#160;</p>
<p align=left><a href="http://www.flash.net/~dawilson/pictures/dinner.jpg"><img src="scot17.jpg" align=right border=0 hspace=0 width=169 height=118></a>All good things come to an end, and we finished the tour in style with dinner at Deauville 
Restaurant back in Glasgow. The evening included more than just dinner, though, as Highland 
dancers, a piper and a reading of Burns were also included along with the prize-giving 
ceremony for the trip during which certificates were handed out to members of the party who 
had distinguished themselves in some way during the previous 10 days. It also gave us a 
chance to say thanks to Bobby (in his kilt) and Lewis, our two wonderful tour guides for the 
effort they had put in to helping us enjoy the trip.</p>
<p align=left><a href="http://www.flash.net/~dawilson/pictures/guides.jpg"><img src="scot4.jpg" align=left border=0 hspace=0 width=142 height=169></a><a href="http://www.flash.net/~dawilson/pictures/groupies.jpg"><img src="scot18.jpg" align=left border=0 hspace=0 width=118 height=169></a>Our final public performance of the trip took place on the restaurant stairs 
where we sang for the restaurant staff (who, presumably, couldn't believe that 
this rowdy rabble from America were actually a church choir). Photos of two 
groups were taken here and we see the choir groupies (non-singing members 
of the party) on the stairs before a rousing rendition of &quot;The Eyes of Texas&quot;.</p>

<h3>The Highway Trust Fund</h3>

The U.S. government provides funding for federal highway systems and 
state and local transportation systems through the Federal Highway 
Administration and the Federal Transit Authority; both agencies are 
components of the U.S. Department of Transportation.  The funding for 
these systems is primarily the Federal Highway Trust Fund, the source 
of federal highway financing since 1956, with some general revenue 
support. In simple terms, this trust fund receives user fees, 
primarily the federal taxes for gasoline and diesel fueled vehicles. 
The money is then disbursed  back to the states according to complex 
formulas. State taxes vary from state to state.<P>

Federal fuel tax levies are divided as follows: of the total 18.4 
cents of the gasoline tax and of the total 24.4 cents of the diesel, 
1.5 cents goes for use by the federal transit authority and 6.8 cents 
of the total goes into the general fund.  Only fifty-four percent of 
the gasoline tax and 65 percent of the diesel tax actually goes into 
the Highway Trust Fund. <P>

Federal tax rates appear to have kept up with inflation, whereas the 
state tax rates have not.  Despite significant increases in State 
motor-fuel tax rates during the 1980s, the weighted average gasoline 
tax rate expressed in constant 1970 cents actually decreased by 30 
percent from 7.02 cents per gallon in 1970 to 4.95 cents per gallon in 
1993.  Over the same 1970 to 1993 period, the Federal gasoline tax 
expressed in constant 1970 cents increased by 24 percent [adjusted for 
inflation] from 4.00 cents per gallon to 18.4 cents per gallon 
(including 4.3 cents for deficit reduction). Preliminary 1994 data 
show that State tax rates increased, but did not keep pace with 
inflation.  Other data shows 0.1 cents goes toward the leaking 
underground storage tank trust fund, and the remainder goes into the 
highway trust fund.  Of the amounts transferred into the  highway 
trust fund, two cents goes into the mass transit account, and the 
remainder (12 cents for gasoline, 18 cents for diesel) goes into the 
highway account.<P>

<h3>ISTEA (Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act)</h3>       

The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), signed 
into law in December 1991 by the U.S. Congress, is the current 
transportation funding bill for the nation. ISTEA allows funds that in 
past legislation were restricted to road improvement and construction 
to be spent on alternative modes such as mass transit, rail, air, 
bicycle, pedestrian, and other measures to control the demand for new 
roads. In addition, the construction of new capacity on roads is 
restricted unless it is shown to help attain clean air goals and that 
the social, economic, and environmental implications have been 
considered.<P>

Federal law has required state transportation agencies to coordinate 
transportation plans with local officials since the early 1960's.  It 
was only with the passage of ISTEA that  local transportation planning 
agencies (called metropolitan planning organizations, or MPOs) gained 
a significant role in making funding decisions. In addition, ISTEA 
mandates public participation in the development of the Long Range 
Plan and the Transportation Improvement Program at the MPO level, as 
well as in the State Long Range Plan and the State Transportation 
Improvement Plan. ISTEA is funded through the Highway Trust Fund.<P>

The original ISTEA authorization expires at the end of the 1997 
federal fiscal year.  Legislation to reauthorize ISTEA may be drafted 
as early as 1996. To date, ISTEA has begun to forge a successful 
partnership of mutual responsibility between federal, state, and local 
governments. Two major issues are emerging:  (1) should transportation 
trust funds be taken off-budget, i.e., should revenues collected by 
the federal government through payment of transportation fuel taxes 
not be subject to the regular appropriations process, and (2) should 
transportation funding formulas be adjusted to better compensate 
donor states such as Texas. Donor states are those that contribute a 
disproportionate amount of tax revenue into the highway trust fund 
than they receive back from the federal government. In 1991, Congress 
crafted an allocation formula intended to guarantee donor states 
minimum return of 90 cents for every dollar contributed to the trust 
fund. However, because the minimum allocation formula is based on 
historical contributions, it does not  account for growth states like 
Texas that contribute far more into the trust funds than they did in 
the past. Under the formula Texas only receives about 78 cents of 
every transportation dollar it sends to Washington.<P>

One of the defining characteristics of ISTEA is the decentralization 
of transportation decision-making away from the federal level.  In 
this new scenario, state and local organizations have become partners 
to federal agencies.  For decisions that affect the Austin 
Metropolitan Area, transportation planning organizations include: The 
Federal Highway Administration, Texas Department of Transportation, 
Austin Transportation Study, Travis County, City of Austin, and 
Capital Metro.  Each of these bodies plays a role in deciding how 
ISTEA and local transportation dollars are spent.<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>The Federal Highway Administration.</B>  Title I of ISTEA 
provides $121 billion in spending authorization from the period 1992-
97 for the Federal Highway Administration (FHA). These funds are 
disbursed to states and localities through state transportation 
departments to be used for construction and reconstruction of the 
recently designated National Highway System, the interstate system, 
the surface transportation program, and other specialized programs 
such as air quality improvement and bridge replacement and repair.  A 
small percentage of funds is retained at the federal level  to 
maintain federal roads such as park and Indian Reservation roads.  
State matching funds are required for most state programs.
<LI><B>Federal Transit Authority.</B>  Title III of ISTEA provides 
$31.5 billion in spending authorization for the period 1992-97 for the 
Federal Transit Authority.  Of the total authorization, $18.2 billion 
comes from the Highway Trust Fund and $13.3 billion comes from the 
general fund.  Over half the funds are transferred to urbanized areas 
throughout the country on the basis of a statutory formula.  Other 
programs funded by the Federal Transit Authority are those for the 
elderly and disabled, rail modernization, bus purchases, and planning 
and research.

<LI><B>National Highway System Designation Act 1995 (NHS).</B>  The 
1991 ISTEA legislation required that the Congress and the 
Administration designate a National Highway System so that federal 
resources could be focused on roads that are most important to 
interstate travel and national defense, roads that connect with other 
modes of transportation, and are essential for international 
commerce. The system was to be established after consultation with 
the states no later than September 30, 1995. The legislation was 
actually signed into law December, 1995.
</UL>

The Act designates approximately 160,000 miles of highway throughout 
the U.S. for priority treatment in future funding decisions.  
Thousands of miles of Texas highways stand to benefit from passage of  
the NHS, including the I-35 and the future I-69 corridors.  Both 
roadways hope to play a major part in the NAFTA superhighway system. 
According to figures obtained by the Federal Highway Administration, 
passage of the NHS legislation will result in Texas receipt of $936.2 
million in highway funds for programs such as interstate maintenance, 
NHS improvements, bridge construction, planning programs, and 
environmental compliance.<P>

In addition, the NHS Act provides for the establishment of up to 10 
state infrastructure banks.  This will permit, for the first time, 
bond issuance for transportation construction that pledges future 
federal highway funds and permits the use of federal highway funds for 
payment of principle and interest on bonds, provided funds are used 
for projects for eligible federal aid.  The banks can serve to speed 
up much needed construction and renovation work. The Texas Department 
of Transportation is developing proposals in order to be  considered 
as one of the 10 infrastructure banks.<P>

THE STATE CONTEXT</H1></CENTER>


<h3>Texas Department of Transportation </h3>

The Texas Transportation Commission is composed of three commissioners 
who are appointed by the governor.  This commission is responsible for 
review and authorization of projects submitted by the Texas Department 
of Transportation (TxDOT). TxDOT is divided into 25 districts. Austin 
District 14 is composed of 11 counties and contains 3000 miles of 
roadway.<P>

ISTEA requires the state to develop the Statewide Transportation 
Improvement Program (STIP) as a condition for securing funds for 
transportation projects from the Federal Highway Administration (FHA) 
and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). The Transportation 
Commission and TxDOT use the Projected Development Plan (PDP), TxDOTs 
ten year plan, for transportation project development.  The PDP may be 
updated annually.  The STIP, the three year financial plan, and the 
PDP are the backbone for developing projects for the intermodal 
transportation network in Texas.<P>

Categories have been established in the PDP to reflect the various 
systems outlined by ISTEA such as the National Highway System, and the 
Surface Transportation Program (STP).  More than 30 categories have 
been established for activities to reflect the intended use of funds 
(safety, rehabilitation, preventive maintenance, Farm to Market roads, 
bridges, etc.). Each category has a federal/state matching formula 
which varies, but the most common match is 80% federal and 20% state.  
In contract payment, the state pays the contractor 100% and then is 
reimbursed monthly by the federal government.<P>

The Transportation Commission authorizes TxDOT to manage many of the 
programs as bank balances  After projects are selected and developed, 
they are let for contract with each projects cost debited to the bank 
balance of funds available for that program.  Most of the bank balance 
programs are  projects directed toward preserving the current system 
and safety. This allows TxDOT the flexibility to respond to 
modifications by the Metropolitan Planning Organization and others 
without going back to  the commission for every project change or 
cancellation as long as the bank balance for that program is not 
exceeded.<P>

Estimated distributions of federal and state apportionment for fiscal 
year 1996 for Austin District 14, is $87,465,042, to be used for 
Transportation Construction Programs.<P>
                                                                                                                            
        There has been a reduction of $100 million in federal funds to 
Texas.  ISTEA authorized funding for a six year period (1991-1997) but 
the money did not have to be in equal funding annually. TxDOT has 
drawn heavily on its allocations the first four years of the funding; 
therefore, 1996 and 1997 will see a reduction of funds--a leveling 
process.<P>

<h3>Turnpike Authority</h3>

The Texas Transportation Commission recently "instructed local 
districts of the Transportation Department to begin considering all 
new highway projects as toll road candidates, with the possibility of 
subsidizing the toll roads with state money." These instructions come 
as a response to a state Department of Transportation analysis that 
indicates traditional sources of funding will pay for less than half 
of the identified surface transportation needs for the next 25 years. 
<P>

Although toll roads are common in a few regions of Texas, they have 
yet to be introduced to the greater Austin area.  Three roadways are 
being studied as potential toll roads in greater Austin: 183A, which 
would loop around Cedar Park; State Highway 130, an alternate to 
Interstate 35; and State Highway 45, the northern section of a 
proposed outer loop.<P>

The Texas Turnpike Authority is conducting in-house feasibility 
studies regarding these proposed roads as part of an inter-agency 
agreement with the state transportation department.  Revenue bonds 
would be issued to construct toll roads; the Authority is evaluating 
whether the need is there to attract drivers willing to pay the eight 
to ten cents or more per miles that would retire the bonds.  If the 
need and local support are there, one model the Authority may consider 
is a recently completed and innovative bond financing structure used 
for State Highway 191, a toll road to be constructed in North Dallas. 
Financing for this roadway became feasible as a result of a TxDOT loan 
of State Highway ISTEA federal funds.<P>

<h3>Austin Transportation Study</h3>

The Austin Transportation Study (ATS) was established in 1973. With 
the passage of ISTEA in 1991, ATS became the designated Metropolitan 
Planning Organization (MPO) for the Austin area. ISTEA requires each 
designated MPO to develop a Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) 
annually, and hold public hearings.  The plan is funded by the Surface 
Transportation Program (STP) at $7.8 million per year for the next  
three years. The Austin Metropolitan Area Transportation Plan (AMATP), 
adopted in December, 1994,  fulfills the requirement for a 25 year 
plan (1995-2020). ATS is governed by a 17 member Policy Advisory 
Committee (PAC); 15 are elected  state, county, and city government 
officials.  Of the remaining two, one is a board member of Capital 
Metro, and the other the district engineer for Austin District 14, 
Texas Department of Transportation.<P>

The ATS study area includes Travis County, parts of Williamson and 
Hays counties, and the city limits and extraterritorial jurisdictions 
(ETJs) of Austin, Round Rock, Cedar Park, Leander and Hays.  The 
purpose of ATS is to coordinate regional transportation planning among 
the state, three counties, nineteen cities, and Capital Metro, and to 
approve the use of federal transportation funds.  ATS is responsible 
for the promotion of transportation systems in a variety of modes.  
Mobility of people and goods should be efficient with minimal energy 
consumption, air and water pollution, and with minimal  negative 
social impacts. <P>

ISTEA Title 1, mandates that MPOs provide the public and affected 
agencies with a "reasonable opportunity" to comment on long range 
plans before approval. ATS staff actively solicited public comment and 
participation for over a year  incorporating many of the ideas and 
suggestions into the final AMATP. In addition, the AMATP financial 
plan meets the requirements of ISTEA. <P>

ATS implementing agencies, such as Capital Metro, the city of Austin, 
Travis County, TxDOT, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the Federal 
Highway Administration, and the Federal Transit Administration, face 
major financial planning issues: 
<UL>
<LI>no major dedicated transportation source
<LI>dependence on traditional funding sources (e.g., ad valorem taxes) 
for maintenance programs
<LI>inability to project revenues and budget allocations accurately 
for capital and  maintenance programs
<LI>an insufficient use of available alternative transportation 
funding mechanisms to supplement and leverage TxDOT funds
<LI>competing interests for limited local dollars (i.e., crime versus 
roads)
<LI>competing interests and demands for limited state (TxDOT) dollars 
delaying and deferring high priority state highway projects.
</UL>

<h3>Capital Metro</h3>

Voters in Austin and the surrounding areas approved the creation of 
the Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Capital Metro) in 
January 1985, and a one (1) percent sales tax to provide part of the 
funding. The jurisdictions presently participating in the Authority 
are Austin, San Leanna, Cedar Park, Leander, Lago Vista, Pflugerville, 
the Anderson Mill area of Williamson County, Jonestown, Manor, and 
Precinct Two of Travis County.  Ridership for 1996 is projected to be 
29 million persons.<P>

A seven-member board governs Capital Metro, with each member appointed 
for two years.  The Austin City Council appoints five members, the 
Travis County Commissioners Court appoints one, and a committee of 
seven suburban mayors and the Williamson County judge select the 
seventh member.  Board positions are part-time and members are 
compensated for travel and expenses only.<P>

The board meets at least once a month, accomplishing much of its work 
through standing committees on operations, finance and budget, and 
planning.  The board also receives input from the Citizens Advisory 
Committee and the Mobility Impaired Services Advisory Committee 
(MISAC).  Much of the day-to-day management, operation, and control of 
the Authority is delegated by the board to the general manager.<P>

As mandated initially in 1985, Capital Metros core service is the 
traditional fixed-route bus service operating on a regular schedule.  
Included in this definition are the University of Texas (UT) Shuttle, 
funded through UT student fees, and Dillo circulators.  Premium 
services, which serve markets with special and specific needs, 
include:
<UL>
<LI>Special Transit Services demand-response service for members of 
the disabled community;
<LI>Teleride demand-response neighborhood-level service for those not 
served by fixed-route bus service;
<LI>Flyer and Express Ride & Park which are commuter services into 
downtown employment centers;
<LI>Ridefinders, a vanpool service for groups of commuters who live 
near each other and have similar commute destinations.
</UL>

Ridership for 1996 is projected to be 29 million persons.<P>

Capital Metro is presently considering expansion of service under its 
Future Transit System Plan.  An expense budget of $695,000 for this 
plan has been allocated for 1996. Under consideration is a 1996  
election to authorize the issuance of revenue bonds to fund future 
projects. Issues that must be addressed include better access and a 
wider variety of  bus routes, additional transit locations, and more 
efficient service in areas of destination hubs.  For example, it has 
been determined that The University of Texas is a larger destination 
hub than downtown. Capital Metro is considering using smaller buses 
for downtown destinations.<P>

The largest portion of funding for Capital Metro comes from the local 
sales tax.  In 1988, the Capital Metro Board of Directors voted to 
lower the Authoritys initial one percent sales tax to 3/4 percent.  
This level of taxation was in effect for the period April 1989 to 
October 1995, when the board reinstated the full one percent sales 
tax. Capital Metros budget adopted September 25, 1995 for 1996 
includes:
<UL>
<LI>Total revenues                              $119,859,000    
<LI>Total expenditures                  ($133,335,000)
<LI>Opening balance                     $27,035,000
<LI>Ending unappropriated balance       $13,559,000
</UL>

The Capital Metro general manager envisions Capital Metro becoming a 
"mobility manager" rather than a bus company for the Austin 
Metropolitan Area.  In this role, Capital Metro maintains a 
cooperative partnership with the agencies whose  jurisdiction it 
shares, including the Austin Transportation Study and the Texas 
Department of Transportation. The General Manager, in response to an 
opinion poll indicating the publics desire for more participation in 
Capital Metros planning process, will provide more opportunities for 
public input. This will be through a new Community Involvement Group 
with a staff coordinator and five staff members.<P>

<H3>Park & Ride</H3>

Park & Ride, a function of Capital Metro, are lots where people can 
park their cars.  They serve as collection points for those who have 
no regular bus service or who prefer not to drive their cars to their 
final destinations. Capital Metro owns some of the Park & Ride lots; 
others are operated on space leased or contributed by shopping centers 
or the city of Austin. Some not listed as Park & Ride transit centers 
are in shopping centers which may also serve bus riders. However, 
Capital Metro does not provide an office or director for the Park & 
Ride function. The planning staff develops plans for future lots; 
scheduling, operation, and maintenance are part of regular operations; 
complaints are the responsibility of the Community Relations 
department.<P>

These lots include plans proposed for the light rail system, a Dillo 
lot north of downtown, analyses of employees trip patterns, use of 
demographic information to estimate ridership, and shared use with 
commercial enterprises used by commuters.<P>

<H3>Special Transit Services</H3>

Capital Metros Special Transit Services (STS) are for "persons who, 
by reason of disability, are unable to use the accessible fixed-route 
service." These include door-through-door assistance with a shared-
ride service throughout the Capital Metro service areas. Reservations 
are required; regular service is available on request. Open returns 
are available for medical and other such trips, but a wait may be 
necessary. The fee at present is 60 cents a ride.  The Taxi Voucher 
Program fares, currently under revision, are up to $8.75  plus the 60 
cent STS fare.  The Subscription Service, offered on a space and 
schedule basis, is for those who need to travel regularly from the 
same point of origin to the same destination with a minimum of one 
trip a week for 90 days.  It must be renewed annually. Fees for the 
services are: 1) 60 cents for one way; 2) ten ride ticket books are 
$3.00; escorts for a one way trip are 60 cents; 3) monthly passes are 
$15; 4) no fare is charged for attendants or aides or children under 
six years of age.<P>

Capital Metros Policies and Procedures contain a grievance procedure 
for passengers who wish to make a complaint or to appeal an STS staff 
decision about eligibility for service.<P>

<h3>Travis County</h3>

Transportation in Travis County receives funds from federal, state, 
and local governments.  The five member Travis County Commissioners 
Court has the responsibility for county transportation. This is 
delegated to the Transportation and Natural Resources Department which 
is responsible for providing comprehensive transportation and public 
service systems for citizens living in unincorporated areas of the 
county and outside the cities. Included among these responsibilities 
are:
<UL>
<LI>right of way acquisition
<LI>watershed management
<LI>traffic safety
<LI>utility coordination
<LI>land development review and permitting
<LI>capital improvements including road construction 
<LI>maintenance of 1200 miles of roads and 144 bridges.
</UL>

In 1989 the Travis County Commissioners Court adopted  the unified 
(centralized) road maintenance system. Of the total Maintenance and 
Operations Budget, 13.3% was used to maintain 155 miles of paved 
county roads.  In 1995, only 7.9 % was budgeted for 172 
miles of paved county roads. The 1996 transportation budget totals 
$21,864,431 and includes:

<H3>Expenditures:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>road maintenance (40%) that includes patching, signage and 
striping, secondary drainage, and right of way maintenance
<LI>bridge replacement (5%)
<LI>1984 capital improvement projects (24%)
<LI>major drainage projects (3%)
<LI>other projects such as surface treatment, hot mix overlay, traffic 
signals, and other  (28%)
</UL>
The county recently identified projects totaling over $200 million 
needs in a ten year transportation needs assessment.  These include: 
<UL>
<LI>$155 million for reconstruction, widening and upgrading existing 
county roads
<LI>$32 million for replacing deficient bridges, and building low 
water crossing bridges
<LI>$6 million for federal highway projects
<LI>$14 million for drainage projects, signalization, safety, bicycle 
lanes, and pedestrian walkways.
</UL>

Also identified was the need to repeal or amend the Texas 
Transportation Code (sec. 623.011) to restore county authority to 
regulate heavy loads on the county road system.<P>

The county Transportation and Resources department has been  
cooperating more frequently  with other entities to pool resources to 
increase its spending ability, bridge construction with the state of 
Texas, and signalization contracts with the city of Austin, for 
example.<P>

<H3>Revenues:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>property tax revenues for the county  general operating fund, 
certificates of obligation, and 1984 capital improvement bonds (53%) 
<LI>state funds from the County and Road District Highway Funds (which 
allocates based on the total miles of county roads maintained) and 
from license plate fees collected by Travis County (41%) 
<LI>Capital Metros Build Greater Austin Program and federal funds 
(6%).
</UL>

Prior to 1980, the county utilized Certificates of Obligation (COs) 
for bridges, hot mix overlay, and repair of substandard roads.  Now 
COs can be issued for any projects with a life over five years. 
Federal funds are derived from the Surface Transportation Program 
(STP) and the Transportation Enhancement Program (TEP), a statewide 
competitive program that enhances intermodal transportation.  Capital 
Metros Build Greater Austin Program, a ten year project, funds 
mobility and street projects such as sidewalks and street paving along 
bus routes. These two programs account for 6% of the revenue.<P>

<h3>City of Austin</h3>

The city of Austin  Public Works and Transportation Department is 
responsible for the installation and maintenance of 5,628 miles of 
streets, 250 bridges, 610 traffic signals, 122,500 traffic signs, 
3,800 parking meters, 110 crossing guards, and the new speed hump 
program.  The city does this through a combination of funding sources. 
The Transportation Fee, a user fee paid with  utility bills, provides 
funding for preventive street maintenance. Capital Metro, through a 
contract with the city entitled the Build Austin Program, provides 
funds primarily for the rehabilitation of the 970 lane miles used in 
the transit system. General revenue bonds are used for the 
rehabilitation of non-transit streets and street construction.<P>

The goal of the Transportation Fee, enacted FY 1991-92, was to prevent 
the further decline of the roadway network.  To date, the fund has 
raised $21.3 million through FY 1995 for preventive street 
maintenance, such as crack sealing, sealcoats, and asphalt overlays. 
The Build Austin Program will provide $40 million over 10 years for 
the maintenance and rehabilitation of transit corridors and roadway 
improvements along major transit routes. These improvements include 
space cuts into curbs for bus turnouts so they do not block traffic, 
intersection improvements to allow buses to make turns appropriate for 
their size; and designated bus lanes. The Capital Improvement Program 
and the city general fund have provided funding for street 
reconstruction as well as for sidewalks, traffic signal 
synchronization, and transportation system management programs that 
seek to improve intersection design as a means of decreasing 
congestion.<P>

The city has put an increased emphasis on maintenance due to the large 
number of substandard roads acquired during the rapid annexation of 
outlying areas in the 80s. Maintenance costs are also significantly 
cheaper than reconstructing roads.  Per lane mile, a street costs $500 
to crack seal, $6,000 to sealcoat, $15,000 to overlay the pavement, 
$150,000 to rehabilitate, and $250,000 to reconstruct.  As of November 
1995, 933 city lane miles were classified in excellent condition, 
1,403 in fair condition, 1,250 in poor condition, and 484 as failed. 
<P>

The city also reviews roadway and sidewalk layout in the filing of 
subdivision plans within the City of Austin limits and the 
Extraterritorial Jurisdiction (ETJ) five miles beyond the city limits. 
The Austin Metropolitan Area Transportation Plan was adopted as the 
citys transportation plan for those streets within its jurisdiction 
and provides guidance and street classification and location.  The 
citys Transportation Manual provides design criteria.<P>

In an effort to promote increased bicycle use, the city recently made 
major revisions to roadway design standards.  The standard design for 
all roadways now incorporates either wide shared-use curb lanes or 
bicycle lanes, based on the proposed Bicycle Plan recommendations.  
Current design standards also require sidewalks on both sides of the 
street to accommodate pedestrian needs.<P>

<H1>ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES</H1>
</center>

<h3>LAND USE--Growth and the Compact City</h3>

Transportation, or the movement of people, does not exist in a vacuum 
and  must be considered in the following contexts:  land use and the 
environment, where people live, work, and plan their leisure time; and 
growth and development.<P>

A major concern in the movement of people has centered on "urban 
sprawl," defined as "haphazard growth or extension outward resulting 
from real estate development on the outskirts of a city."  A recent 
report, "Beyond Sprawl: New Patterns of Growth to Fit the New 
California," takes a hard look at sprawl and its enormous costs. 
Sprawl results in decentralization of employment centers, increased 
dependence on the automobile, loss of agricultural and environmentally 
sensitive lands and  isolation or abandonment of older neighborhoods; 
it may even inhibit real growth. Sprawl has been fueled by perceptions 
that new suburbs are safer, more desirable, and cheaper. Costs of 
urban sprawl are often hidden and those who pay the costs are often 
unaware of it. Taxpayers bear the costs of building and maintaining 
highways, deteriorating urban areas, and environmental degradation; 
businesses bear costs of relocation, traffic congestion, and the need 
to mitigate air pollution. Suburban residents pay for commuting time 
and suburban infrastructure, and urban residents bear the costs of 
lost jobs, economic segregation, underutilized investments, and 
reduced tax base.<P>

The Austin City Council responded to these concerns by appointing the 
Citizens Planning Committee in 1994, to assess the current planning 
and development process which includes transportation.  Their report 
to council in January 1995, stated it was the committees unanimous 
opinion that "these times are not ordinary and that Austin is on the 
wrong road." They suggested "an urgent call to the citizens of Austin 
to follow another way and make the change now." The report,  based 
on a projected growth in the Austin area of 600,000 new residents in 
the next 20 years and includes the concept of a compact city. A 
compact city consists of an "urban quarter" which  means a place where 
most of the daily needs of the population can be satisfied within 
walking distance (usually 10 minutes). A compact city combines various 
modes of transportation, and  has abundant pedestrian streets with 
well defined edges full of content, with a hierarchy of public 
buildings and spaces strategically positioned to allow mental mapping 
and easy orientation in the urban quarter.  This type of development 
can occur throughout the city.<P>

Two of the 12 recommendations are directed toward transportation:
<UL>
<LI>Mobility/transportation planning should be fully integrated into 
and compatible with land use planning, and the development process.  
The livability of an area should be considered more important than 
roadway efficiency; planning and design should provide easy pedestrian 
and bicycle access to transit routes, and alternate modes of travel 
should be considered.
<LI>The planning and development process should encourage quality 
transit-oriented mixed use development. Neighborhood diversity should 
be valued and should be used as a criterion for appropriate use and 
densities for given areas.
</UL>

<h3>AIR QUALITY AND TRANSPORTATION</h3>

In Austin, according to Austin AIR Force, a nonprofit, clean-air 
organization, nearly 75% of air emissions come from motor vehicles 
which are also the largest source of ozone pollution.  Currently, 
Austin does not exceed federal clean air standards, but the Texas 
Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) has designated it as 
a "near non-attainment" area. Attainment of federal standards is 
necessary in order to avoid economic sanctions such as a  loss of transportation funds. The goal is continuing improvements in air 
quality under the Clean Air Act. <P>

The ATS adopted a three-part program to meet federal air quality 
standards: 1) preparation of a detailed pollutant emissions inventory 
and forecast, 2) a voluntary action program (Ozone Advisory Program) 
for forecast ozone "advisory days," and 3) analysis of long range 
pollutant reduction measures. <P>

First, the emissions inventory of existing air pollution in the Austin 
metropolitan area and a forecast of emissions to the years 2010 and 
2020 has been completed, including pollutants that combine to form 
ground-level ozone.  Hazardous ozone levels may be reached whenever 
hot, sunny, stagnant conditions arise.  This occurs about fifteen days 
a year in the Austin area.  Monitoring is important in determining how 
much ozone is formed from local emissions.<P>

Second, the Ozone Advisory Program and Voluntary Vehicle Trip 
Reduction Program are sponsored by the City of Austin and the Austin 
AIR Force.  Austins high ozone season runs from April 1 - October 31. 
The 1995 the season ended with 29 ozone alert days, almost twice the 
number in 1994. If levels go above 120 parts/billion four times in 
three years, Austin could face sanctions.  Of the 29 days in 1995, 10 
exceeded 100 parts billion.  Continued area growth in traffic is of 
great concern.<P>

When a high ozone day is predicted in the Austin area, an ozone 
advisory for the next day is issued to the media who notify the public 
that the weather conditions are conducive to the formation of high 
levels of smog.  Everyone is asked to take measures to reduce 
emissions.  Actions include:
<UL>
<LI>Limit driving: walk, carpool, avoid unnecessary trips, ride the 
bus (free) on Action Days.
<LI>Buy gasoline in the evening when it is cooler.
<LI>Do not use gas-powered lawn equipment.
</UL>

Third, long range pollution reduction measures will begin after 
emission forecasts have been analyzed.  Potential regulations would 
cover vapor recovery systems, automobile inspection and maintenance, 
and reformulated gasoline.<P>

Traffic congestion and environmental concerns have redefined 
transportation problems as an access issue rather than a mobility 
issue.  Telecommuting  is one such method of providing access to the 
workplace and promoting congestion reduction.  An employee may avoid 
commuting to a centralized place by working at home several days a 
week using modern technology with computers and modem communication.  
However, employers may prefer to monitor employee working activities; 
many business transactions require face-to-face personalized 
transactions; and many employees may prefer to work outside the home.  
While widespread telecommuting may not occur in the near future, some 
may develop to meet workplace access needs.<P>

<h3>ENERGY USE--Conservation</h3>

ISTEA requires that transportation plans promote energy efficiency and 
conservation and a system that is balanced and intermodal.  The Energy 
Policy Act (EPACT) of 1992, that affects all urban areas with 
populations of 250,000 or more, was enacted in part to encourage the 
use of alternate fuels.  By the year 1999, with certain exceptions, 
many fleets of vehicles must convert to alternative fuels. ATS has 
adopted strategies to reduce automobile travel, congestion, and 
traffic delays to accomplish energy conservation. ATS also 
participates in  local efforts to promote the reduction of petroleum-
based imported fuels as part of EPACTs Clean Cities Program.<P>

<h3>Bicycle Program</h3>

Bicycles seldom have been considered as an alternative transit system 
to reduce air or water pollution, or to relieve traffic congestion, 
and they cannot compete when time is a factor. However, as traffic 
gridlock is beginning to  be felt in Austin, bicycles could  be an 
option for many. Suprisingly, bikes can be faster than buses, and they 
are less expensive to buy, maintain, and park. Capital Metro plans to 
add bike racks to buses. Users would  purchase  a rack permit from 
bicycle shops. In addition, 250 racks will be installed in several 
areas funded through ISTEA. Those racks in the downtown area are being 
planned in cooperation with the Downtown Austin Alliance.<P>

Requests from cyclists have resulted in the citys commitment to 
short, medium, and long term goals to institutionalize bikes as a form 
of  transportation. The current bicycle plan has two parts: standards 
and policies, and routes and mapping. Routes and mapping are 95% 
completed.  They will be forwarded to city council for consideration 
in the summer of 1996, preceded by public hearings in early spring. 
The plan, which includes national standards, is based on the four Es 
of bicycle planning: Education, Enforcement, Encouragement, and 
Engineering. The plan also recommends that the subdivision ordinance 
be amended to include right-of-way for bicycles in the Land 
Development Code recognizing that not every road can be built to 
include them.<P>

Safety for bicyclists will require educating the public and bikers. 
Bicycles currently are not  registered with the city and licensure is 
not in the plan.  Many cyclists do not realize they must comply with 
the same traffics laws other motorists and pedestrians do. Reducing 
the significant incidence of  bike injuries also needs to be 
addressed.  Although the city of Austin distributes free helmets to 
children ages 5-14 through a state grant, helmets are not required by 
state law.<P>

Federal funding through ISTEA has provided $3.5 million and  includes 
a 20% local match for bicycle trails in the central city, under the 
management of Parks and Recreation.  In addition, the first  priority 
to implement the citys bicycle policy is a plan that would provide 
all neighborhoods with a basic route system within a mile of any home. 
The estimated cost is $45 million over a 10-12 year period. Funding 
sources would come from local bond elections for the citys 20% match 
for ISTEA federal funds.<P>

<h3>Sidewalks--Pedestrian Travel</h3>

Pedestrian travel often is lost among higher priced, faster paced 
forms of transportation. Nonetheless, pedestrian access and safety are 
key components to a balanced transportation system.  In a sense, 
everyone is a pedestrian.  When destinations are not too far away, the 
pedestrian mode may be the primary means of travel.<P>

As a primary means of travel, the pedestrian mode serves to reduce the 
number of vehicular trips made, reduce traffic congestion and air 
pollution.  Sidewalks and trail facilities improve the experience and 
safety of this form of transportation, but the distance  people are 
willing to walk depends on the nearby location of likely destinations.  
A goal for a compact city is to provide these nearby destination 
areas.  This means that land uses like residential, small retail, 
commercial, and employment centers must be mixed, or at least 
proximate, in order to encourage pedestrian travel.  Street and 
sidewalk layouts should enable pedestrians to travel shorter paths 
instead of circuitous routes.  Sample heavy pedestrian areas in Austin 
are downtown, the Capitol Complex, and UT Austin.<P>

As a secondary means of travel, i.e., providing connections between 
other modes of travel, pedestrian facilities necessitate planning and 
design for integration with other types of transportation. Examples:  
sidewalks connecting bus stops to employment or retail centers, 
sidewalks and pedestrian striping in parking lots, and pedestrian 
crossings of roads with heavy traffic. <P>

Pedestrian facilities tend to be under the direction of local 
jurisdictions--cities and counties. City ordinances typically apply 
sidewalk requirements during the land development process, but not 
always.  For instance, particular site developments that were 
initiated with the City of Austin prior to the current sidewalk 
ordinances were not necessarily required to provide sidewalks. 
Developers can ask for a waiver on sidewalk construction when laying  
out a subdivision. Often the sidewalks  have gaps in between 
structures and therefore may not be continuous.  To meet certain 
requirements, Capital Metro has provided sidewalks in areas not now 
covered.  Maintenance of sidewalks is the citizens responsibility.<P>

Sidewalks cost is about $2.00 a square foot with the average 
residential lot costing $400-$600. The American Disabilities Act 
(1990) requires retrofitting all sidewalks for the disabled.<P>

<h2>Railways:</h2>

<h3>Light Rail</H3>

Light rail generally refers to a rail line, traversing city streets,  
using an electrically-fueled car, or cars, that are related to the 
size of street cars, and whose tracks are not used for heavy freight 
or passenger trains.  The term is not accurate, however, since some 
tracks under consideration for use for light rail are heavy (freight) 
rail; cars may be powered by  means other than electricity, and 
vehicles capable of operating on both track and surface roads may be 
used. Therefore, the term Fixed Guideway is a more accurate term.<P>

Despite the great interest in Capital Metros fixed guideway concept, 
not much is known about it. There are many variations on how it would  
look and what it would do. The cost or who would assume the cost is 
largely unknown. According to a report in the Austin American 
Statesman, a 28-mile system recommended by a consulting team hired by 
Capital Metro, could cost an estimated $120 to $180 million. The 
recommended proposal would use existing tracks and serve a more 
diverse community than the 24-mile system originally proposed.  
Capital Metro does not have a timeline for approval or when a bond 
election for financing might be held. To be successful, community 
involvement in planning and building partnerships for land use would 
be necessary.<P>
  
Whatever decisions are made on a fixed guideway system, the total 
impact on mass transit ridership is unknown. Plans for the development 
of such a system should consider  population density,  the 
distribution of residences and the locations of workplaces.<P>

<H3>Commuter Rail</H3>

Concern for the developing congestion on I-35 between Austin and San 
Antonio has caused The Greater Austin-San Antonio Corridor Council to 
consider the possibility of  a commuter rail service between the two 
cities. There could be both express trains and trains that make 
intermediate stops at San Marcos and New Braunfels. The goals are to 
"reduce travel time between Austin-San Antonio to under an  hour, slow 
the growth of traffic congestion and air pollution, and provide safe, 
efficient alternatives to Interstate 35."<P>

In addition, the system would provide 40,000 commuting students a 
safer alternative without parking problems, connections with San 
Antonio/Austin airports, access to a larger workforce to encourage 
industrial development, and easier access for rural residents and the 
elderly to San Antonio/Austin health care facilities. However, these 
benefits must be measured against the answers to the following 
questions:
<UL>
<LI>Can the current Union Pacific right-of-way support both commuter 
and freight rail services?
<LI>How much will it cost to build?
<LI>Who would operate the system?
<LI>Would commuter service disrupt traffic in city centers?
</UL>

Approximately $250,000 was raised from  TxDOT, VIA Metropolitan 
Transit (San Antonio), and Capital Metro to perform an origin and 
destination survey of commuter traffic in the region. The Rail 
Research Center at the Transportation Institute of Texas A & M 
University  will conduct a survey  with the Austin/San Antonio 
Corridor Council overseeing its completion. <P>

<h3>Access to  Airports</h3>

ATS policies for the design of the new airport encourages the use of 
alternatives to single-occupant commuters to the airport such as some 
forms of mass transit including buses, private shuttle. light rail, or 
commuter/regional/intercity rail.  Many air passengers will be 
traveling longer distances from their homes or offices than 
heretofore. ATS recommends the current "freeze" on private airport 
shuttles be removed in order to ensure true intermodal opportunities 
for the public.  ATS also recommends an  origin/destination survey to 
identify which areas generate the most airport passenger traffic.  
This would help determine the most efficient shuttle and transit 
service design. <P>

<H1>CONCLUSION</H1>
</center>

How do we get from here to there when:
<UL>
<LI>The Austin metropolitan area is growing at a dramatic rate?
<LI>The time to get to the workplace is increasing?
<LI>The City of Austin is close to being a non-attainment city?
<LI>It is difficult to project revenues and budget allocations for 
capital and maintenance programs?
<LI>Federal sources comprise 20 to 30% of the transportation funding?
</UL>

There is no doubt that efforts to address these problems have the 
attention of the national, state, and local citizenry.  However, as 
one Capital Metro board member observed, "The culture of Austin sees 
buses as a social service and not for the general public."  Until this 
perception is overcome, riders will continue to favor the automobile 
as the primary transportation source. <P>

Planning for the critical current and future transportation needs in 
the rapidly growing Austin area is challenging. Success requires the 
peoples confidence in their government and the cooperation of all the 
organizations responsible for transportation.<P>

<P>
The neighborhood garage sales are the first Saturday of May and
October, rain or shine. They officially begin at 8:00, but the
professional garage sale shoppers are usually done by then! The
garage sales are advertised in the Austin American Statesman and
signs are put out the day of the sale.
<P>
Here are some tips for residents participating in the sale:
<P>
If you don't have much for sale, try to get together with a neighbor
or two and combine your items. Larger amounts attract more buyers.
Baked goods, drinks, sandwiches, etc. are good for the kids to
sell. 
<P>
<I>Tips for Garage Sellers:</I>
<OL>
<LI>Attach a balloon to your mailbox or a stake at the curb to
help identify your house.
<LI>Cover up any items not for sale.
<LI>Have change-coins and dollars. Always keep an eye on your
money. Remove large bills frequently.
<LI>Large quantities attract more attention.
<LI>For multi-family sales, have all items tagged with prices
and initials. Have a notebook with several pages for each family
to keep a tally of the sales.
<LI>Decide ahead of time if you or your neighbor are negotiable
on prices. For large items, record the lowest acceptable price
in the back of your notebook.
<LI>If a customer buys something and plans to return later to
pick it up, be sure to get their name and number and give them
your address so you and they can find each other later.
<LI>After the sale, be sure to remove your items and close the
garage doors. In the past items that were left out were stolen
while the family was having dinner. And be alert for theft while
people are shopping.<BR>

<P><FONT FACE="arial"><FONT SIZE=+2><B>What exactly does Our Story do?</B>
</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">OurStory teaches young people about the importance
of an education through science camps, entrepreneurship, student exchange
groups, theater, and workshops. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial"><B>History</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">In May of 1993 Nicole Eutsey started on an uphill
journey. After teaching eighth grade English and being a GED instructor,
she realized a lot of younger people then did not understand the value
of an education. She decided to dedicate her life to uplift today's youth,
by trying to make children understand the importance and power in an education.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">She wanted especially to reach those who have been
afforded fewer opportunities and give them a chance to increase academic
self worth and introduce them to the vast choice in life. She wanted to
do this by reinforcing fundamental principles of cultural awareness, historical
example and learning through doing. Thus the creation of OurStory. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial"><B>Who is Our Story?</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">OurStory is a 501 (c) 3 nonprofit organization guided
by a board of directors and driven by volunteers. OurStory is sustained
by grants, donations, fund-raisers, and volunteers. OurStory provides educational
relevance for youth who have had few opportunities to make informed choices.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial"><B>What are OurStory's goals?</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="arial">To become fully funded statewide organization within
the next five years with the option to go nationwide and become known for
its exceptional educationally relevant experiences and articulate youth.

<head><title>Sun City Georgetown Internet/Computer Club:August</title>

</head>

<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">

<center><h1>SUN CITY GEORGETOWN</h1></center>

<center><h2>INTERNET/COMPUTER CLUB</h2></center>

<center><h3>SCHEDULE FOR THE MONTH OF AUGUST 1996</h3></center>





<b>Monday, July 29, 2-4 pm, Sales Center Annex:</b><br>

Beginners' session:  for people who are thinking about buying a computer; have decided to buy one but are unsure of what to get; who have just gotten a computer and need some help, advice, or moral support in getting started.  This will be an informal discussion and Q&A session, with more experienced persons sharing their experience and knowledge with those who are less experienced.  We hope that it will result in some mentoring arrangements in which a more experienced person arranges to provide some hands-on or personalized assistance to the less experienced.  For this to work, it's important that both beginners and some of the more experienced attend this session.  <p>



<b>Monday, August 5, 2-4 pm, Sales Center Annex:</b><br>

Beginners' Internet 101:  An introduction to the worldwide Internet:  what it is, how to use it, some of the things you can do.  The meeting will include presentation and on-line demonstrations by Peter Roll, using (he hopes) a computer-attached overhead projector borrowed from the Metro Austin Interactive Network (MAIN) so that all can see what is going on.  Although this session is aimed at persons with no previous experience using the Internet, it will be valuable for those who have some experience, and we hope that they will also attend to share their experiences and perspectives.  This the first in a four-part series on the Internet (see below).  <p>



<b>Friday, August 9, 9:00-11:00 am, Legacy Hills Park Pavilion:</b><br>

General meeting:  An open discussion of activities in which the Internet/Computer Club might engage; status reports and discussions of the Computer Lab and other computer-based facilities and services in the Community Center buildings; discussion of process and schedule for formal organization of the Club; and other related matters of interest to SCGT residents.  <p>



<b>Monday, August 12, 2-4 pm, Sales Center Annex:</b><br>

Upgrades for your Computer:  for residents who are considering upgrading or replacing the hardware and software of their existing computer.  An informal discussion and Q&A session, with more experienced persons sharing their experience and knowledge with those who are less experienced.  We hope that this will result, where needed, in some mentoring arrangements in which a more experienced person arranges to provide personalized assistance to the less experienced.  Again, for this to work, its important that both those needing such advice and assistance with upgrades, and those who have been through it and are more experienced participate.  <p>



<b>Monday, August 19, 2-4 pm, Sales Center Annex:</b><br>

Beginners' Internet 201:  SBuilding Web pages -- what is involved?  <p>



<b>Wednesday, August 21, 7:30-9:00 pm, Sales Center Annex:</b><br>  

Internet 201a:  Design and style factors in publishing electronic information on the WorldWideWeb.  

Guest Speaker:  David Riggins (Elecomm, Inc. and WebMaster of the Metro Austin Interactive Network)<p>



We hope residents with the following interests will participate in this session:

<ul>

<li>interest in learning about desktop electronic publishing and in helping to set up and maintain a SCGT Web site, including participating in the August 24 Web Raising (see below);

<li>interest in collecting and maintaining information that will be made available electronically through a SCGT Web site; these are activities drawing upon journalistic, editing, writing, and design interests rather than technical knowledge and skills.  

</ul>

At this session, we should begin serious discussion of what we'd like to see initially on a SCGT community Web site, and how to go about collecting that information.  <p>





<b>Saturday, August 24, 9:00 am-2:00 pm, Austin Independent School District Administrative Center, 1100 6th St, Austin TX:</b><br>

MAIN Web-Raising:  A counterpart to the Barn-Raisings of pioneer days.  Representatives of a dozen or so non-profit and community organizations meet with a group of volunteers who are experienced WorldWideWeb designers in a room equipped with computers and Web software.  Volunteers and Web designers pair off and, during the course of the day, prepare Web pages for each organization for posting on the Internet.  During several days after the Web-Raising, these Web pages are posted on the MAIN Web server, and the organizations each have established their presence on the Internet.  We hope to have as many SCGT residents as are interested accompany Peter Roll to this event, and have SCGT on the Internet by the end of August!!  <p>





<b>Monday, August 26, 2-4 pm, Sales Center Annex:</b><br>

Reports on

<ul>

<li>results of the August 24 Web Raising;

<li>status of plans for the computer lab

</ul>

<title>Sun City Georgetown, TX: Bridge Club</title

</head>

<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">



<center><h1>Sun City Georgetown, TX</h1></center>

<center><h2>Bridge Club</h2></center>



<p>Bridge has emerged as one of the most popular passtimes in our new community.  Almost forty strong, this group has already organized monthyly group games with luncheon, had lessons courtesy of Ann Anderson, drafted by-laws and are preparing to elect officers September 11.



<p>As currently envisioned, everyone interested in Bridge will join "The Club," which will then arrange time and setups for special interst play, such as Duplicate, Couples, Mixed, Solos, Tournaments, etc.



<p>Even if you are rusty, or have never played, come on out and help us get organized.  There are enough of us for now who have "brushed up" to pass on Ann's favor to us, and help you realize the challenge and camaraderie of this great passtime!

<center><h1>Sun City Georgetown, TX</h1></center>

<center><h1>Sun City Solos</h2></center>



It did not take long for the solo residents of Sun City Georgetown to find each other and discover the many interests we have in common.  In fact, between getting settled and enjoying the many activities, it has been hard to gather all twenty-five or so of us together at any one time to do the serious business of "getting chartered"--electing officers, forming committees, writing by-laws, etc.

<p>



If by some chance we have missed meeting you, keep your eye on our new website for both planned and impromptu doings.  If you would like to join us, just email us at <a href="mailto:jmbdip@msn.com">jmpdip@msn.com</a> aka Jo Burgess@864-0137 and somone will contact you promptly.  Also, soon we hope to have a space here for you to tell us of your ideas for local fin, and even distant fun. 

<p>



Our next meeting will be on September 4 at 6pm in the park.  Come by, pick us our roster and our interests list, and join the fun.  September 4 we will be trying to organize ourselves into committees who will research potential activities, write by-laws and select officer nominees.<br>

<a href="mailto:jmbdip@msn.com">Let us hear from you!</a>

<center><h2>Internet/Computer Club</h2></center>

The Internet/Computer Club is a place for Sun City Georgetown residents interested in computers and the Internet to learn more about these important tools and how to use them.  It's a way for those with more experience and skills to help others to learn and use effectively, even the rank beginners.  Through this Web site and through the activites and programs of the Internet/Computer Club, it's a way for members to serve the larger community and many of the other clubs by helping them use computers and networked information and communication tools to better carry out their own purposes.  And it's fun for us!   <p>

<H3>Hey <A NAME="Burger"></A>Burger Buddies</H3>
<B>September 2</B><BR>
If someone asked you what the number one favorite food in America is, best
reply the Hamburger. Even if someone doesn't ask, you need to know in case
those annoying Trivia games return. On the average, every person in America
eats more than tow hundred hamburgers each year. Some of you eat more than
you quota and you know who you are.<BR>
<BR>
If you are running behind on your burger allotment, save Monday, September
2 for a burger bonanza. But now for a bit more trivia . . . The hamburger,
as we know it, can be traced back to the German traders who took to the
Russian custom of eating raw shredded beef. The German people adopted it
for their own, calling the raw beefsteak hamburger in honor of their native
city.<BR>
<BR>
When German immigrants came to America, they brought the idea of eating
raw beef with them. These hamburgers were first cooked and put on a bun
at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis. The cooked burger
was an instant success. The die-hards who didn't convert still have their
Beef Tar Tar as an alternative.<BR>
<BR>
This year America is celebrating its 92nd year of the burger. And Labor
Day is the proper forum for this tribute. Starting at 4:00 p.m. at the Park
Pavilion, we will be broiling burgers complete with all the trimmings for
only $4.00. There will be a variety of potato chips, Ranch Style Beans and
even if you are not a burger booster come on down. We will grill a chicken
breast for you. Call 864-1212.<BR>

Well by now you should all be aware of the successful Del Webb Ask Me Program.
The Community Association is going to take this one step further. We know
that there is a wealth of information among our residents who have plenty
of ideas, suggestions or recommendations. As our community continues to
grow it is becoming more difficult for us to visit with each and every one
of you. Sometimes our office schedule does not match your needs and there
can be some awkward interruptions which are not productive for all of us.<BR>
<BR>
At the same time we also encourage you not to be a silent customer. If you
feel that there is a problem that is not being addressed, a rumor that needs
to be confronted or if you have never had the opportunity to ask the question
that is important to you, well your time has come. On Friday, September
27 at 9:00 a.m. the Community Association staff will be in the Ballroom
of the Social Center so that you can tell us what you would like for us
to know. In subsequent meetings we will offer the same Tell Me format for
smaller neighborhood groups. If you are unable to attend or prefer to submit
your question ahead of time, please feel free to write it down and drop
it in the mail. You don't need a reservation. There is no admission fee.
So come on down. Even if you don't have anything to say, you can still have
a cup of coffee with us. <HR "NOSHADE">

<H2>Growing Pains</H2>

<B>by Ken Stier</B>



<P><HR noshade><P>



As a young married couple growing up in rural Oklahoma, my wife, Carol, and I had

finally scrimped and saved enough money to put a down payment on our first house. And what a

great house it was!!! It was not very large in size but had 3 bedrooms, 1 1/2 baths and, most

importantly, 3 acres of land. One small problem......NO WATER! Oh, we had a water well. But

at only 2 gallons per minute, and my love of gardening, it might as well have been non-existent.

Baths had to be spaced an hour apart, washing of clothes was done just before bedtime and

watering of the yard and garden was not EVEN thought of. Carol and I would do our yard work

on the weekends and pray for rain; work in the garden and pray for rain; plant flowers and pray

for rain. We finally gave up and prayed that the grass and flowers would seek help elsewhere.

This help came when the city of Newcastle installed a water line just 1/4 mile from our house.

Now the only problem was the $1,500.00 it would take to hook us up to this line. So, Carol and I

would do our yard work on the weekends and pray for a bonus; work in the garden and pray for a

raise; plant flowers and hope to met Ed McMahon at our door some day. We finally scrimped

and saved enough after 2 years to hook up to the water line and have the luxury of taking a bath

any time we felt like it.<P>



Now that you have had time to take out a tissue to dry your eyes and have regained your

composure, I will get to the meat of this article. We are at a very similar situation with our Golf

Course. As you are all aware, the combination of the drought and the loss of one of our wells has

had a tremendous effect on the growth rate of the grass and other plants. Grass that would

normally receive 18-22 minutes of water per day has been receiving just 6 minutes per day!

However, Fred Yates has located a private well to purchase water from and is committed to

having the course ready for play on November 15. Although the course may not be up to his

EXTREMELY high standards on opening day, you can be assured that Fred will not rest until we

are considered the best conditioned course in the area. Things that seem small to us, such as a 10

sq. Ft. area of Brown grass, a 6 inch tall weed, a cart trail that is not PERFECTLY trimmed, all

of these will be on his list of things to be done and will drive him CRAZY until they are taken

care of in the months following our opening In addition, the possibility of cart trails only on a

few holes and utilization of the 90 degree rule are being looked at to protect the very tender

grasses. Remember that the course is a LIVING and BREATHING thing that must be nuturtured

and protected from harm as you would a small child. Some things that you can do to help are

keeping carts away from restricted areas, drive around wet areas and fill your divots with the

sand and seed mixture that we will have available at the Clubhouse. Rest assured that once the

course is healthy enough to withstand the cart traffic, these rules will be relaxed or eliminated.<P>



Finally, for those of you that are sitting on the edge of you seats; how did our garden

grow? 5,000 sq.ft. Of the BEST Okra, Green Beans, Carrots, Squash, Watermelon, Radish and

Corn you could ever want!<P>



See ya' on the Links.    <p>

<H2>Reunions </H2>

<B>by Danny McCoy</B><P>



<hr noshade><p>

 

Not far from Sun City, up Interstate 35, on the way to Fort Worth past Waco, just off the highway

is Hillsboro, the County seat of Hill County which is also known for its Southwest Outlet Center. 

Hillsboro is home to the Audie Murphy Memorial Gun & Weaponry Library (Audie Murphy, son

of a Central Texas tenant farmer, was the nation's most decorated soldier in WW II).  Oops, lets get

back to this reunion thing.<P>



Now Hillsboro may not mean much to you, but to my Uncle Amos who still lives there, it is

everything.  He is not much of a genealogy buff, but he knew how to get the McCoy Clan together. 

He knows the family tree (no sap jokes, please) without the aid of a database.<P>



Hillsboro was the site of my first real family reunion.  It was the first time that I remember where

all the families came together other than a funeral.  So, it was a fun time.  Uncle Amos didn't

actually host the event he was sort of the clan catalyst.<P>



I remember one particular summer he somehow managed to arrange to have the McCoy Reunion

at the same time the Hatfields were partying in the park.  There were contests and games for the

children - kick the can, red rover & gotcha-last;  pre-cholesterol, country food for everybody and a

constant request to pose for the camera.<P>



The miniature McCoys dominated the competition and won most every event. My mom said it

didn't prove anything since it was primarily McCoy boys against a team of nine Hatfield girls and

three males.  She didn't appreciate how hard it was to tug on a rope dangling with pre-puberty

plumpness.<P>



Although my memory is a little fuzzy, the Hillsboro greenbelts would not compare to what is

available at Sun City.  The Legacy Hills Park Pavilion is a perfect place to host a reunion.  Expansive

grounds, a 2,000 square feet covered pavilion with ceiling fans and accented lighting over looking

Berry Creek Lake.  There is even a smoker and grill available for your use.<P>



And don't think that you have to be limited to Family Reunions.  Reunions Magazine notes that

there can be schools, military and company reunions.  Reunions are unique among special events. 

They are universally anticipated with both joy and agony.  They are always moving, often cathartic -

times when memories are supreme! Nostalgia reigns.  People reconnect.  Bridges are built, fences

mended, burdens lifted.  Happiness abounds.<P>



Your Community Association staff can jump start your efforts to organize a reunion and at the

same time showcase the amenities available at Sun City.  We can help you  plan all aspects of your

gathering.  So if you feel like a mosquito in a nudist colony - Don't know where to begin.  Then

begin with your Association.<P>



The Legacy Hills Park Pavilion is available for your reunion, celebration or party needs.  The

Pavilion can be reserved for as is for as little as $50 for small groups during non-peak times and

increases depending upon the number of attendees rather it is weekdays, weekends or weekends.

So let us know what your needs are.  Our resources will astound you.<p>

<TITLE>Sun Rays September 1996: Helpful Hints from Customer Service</TITLE>

</HEAD>



<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">

                               

<H2>Helpful Hints from Customer Service</H2>



<hr noshade><p>



Here are some tips that have been passed around to help take care of your home and give it

a longer life:<P>



The most useful and popular tip is - Develop a relationship with non-abrasive glass wax. 

Preferably a liquid glass wax.  For starters if you happen to have a clear shower enclosure, apply it

to the glass. This helps cut way down on the water spots and soap scum build up.  It also helps to

squeegee the glass.  Use the wax as needed and squeegee it down after every shower.  It may sound

time consuming but five minutes now helps cut down on the spring cleaning later.  The next tip for

glass wax is to put some on a rag and apply it to all your door handles.  This can be done once every

six months.  As you use your door handles the oils from your skin will eventually break down the

protective coating on the hardware.  The same also applies to any polished brass fixtures on the

exterior of your house as once every six months the suns rays will  break down the protective finish. 

This designed to give you a longer lasting beautiful house.  It is preventative maintenance in the

same manner you would take care of your car.<P>



The next little tidbit is after you clean your coffee pot out by running vinegar through it - save the

vinegar. Take the warm vinegar and (the old box of baking soda in your refrigerator) and pour the

baking soda down the drain then the vinegar (slowly).  Now, stand back and watch the fizz!  What

this does is two fold: first,  it acts as a drain cleaner without any caustic fumes (even though it may

smell funny); second,  it's all natural and you are using the ingredients one last time.  After that is

done, rinse the rest with water.<P>



Now, what should you do when you are going to be out of town for an extended period?  I don't

know why anybody would want to leave Sun City.  Where do you go on a vacation when you are

already living one?! The following action involves closing up your home when you go out of town

for more than two weeks:



<UL>

<LI><B>Hot Water Heater</B> - Follow shut down instructions in the water heater manual for proper progress

of shut-down steps  (It is not necessary to drain the water heater).

<LI><B>Thermostat</B> - We recommend leaving your thermostat set at 78 degrees.  Cover your windows to help

keep the heat out and to prevent the sun from fading your carpet and furniture.

<LI><B>Toilets</B> - Lift lids and stretch plastic wrap tightly over the bowl to keep the trap from drying out. 

Close water supply valve under tank.

<LI><B>Dishwasher</B> - Close the door, but do not latch or lock in position.

<LI><B>Sinks</B> - Close all drains to help eliminate any sewer gases from coming back up into your home

because of lack of use, and shut off water supply valve under sinks.

<LI><B>Refrigerator/ ice maker</B> - Turn off water to the ice maker so there is not a build-up of ice cubes.  If

refrigerator is turned off, leave the refrigerator door partially open.

<LI><B>Garbage disposal</B> - After the last of the water is run, pour 1/2  to 3/4 cup of salad oil in the disposal

to keep the blades lubricated and to prevent the small amount of moisture that is always present on

the bottom from causing rust.

<LI><B>Leave pails of water in the sink and bathtub</B> - This will keep moisture in the house during the hot

summers.

</UL>



I certainly hope this information has helped, and I want to thank you for letting me bend your ear. 

If you have any helpful hints that you would like to share, please send them to my attention.  They

are always appreciated.<P>





Thank you<BR>

Randy Jackson,  Customer Service Manager.<p>

<H2>Something fishy is going on here!</H2>



<B>By Karen Frost</B><P>



<hr noshade><p>



       Big Fish, Little Fish, Fat Fish, Skinny Fish, Fish that swim around.  All these were delivered

to Berry Creek Lake at the beginning of summer. Two hundred Micropterus salmoides (Largemouth

bass) and 860 Ictalurus punctatus (channel catfish) were trucked in from Haven, Ark., in a special

live fish truck.  Along with the big fish, they brought 350 pounds of minnows, shiners and sunfish

(Pimephales promelas, Notemigonus crysoluecas and Lepomis macrochirus).  Also included were

600, 3-inch, hybrid sunfish (perch).  All this adds up to a lot of fish!<P>



       Trees and large concrete pipe have been installed on the bottom of the lake for the fishes'

 enjoyment and environmental enhancement.Fishing is allowed on the lake, but if you catch anything

(fish related) you must release it back into the lake.  Your grandchildren do not need a Resident

Fishing License if they are under 17 years of age.  If you are 65 years of age or older before

September 1, 1996, you will not need a license, but you will need to carry with you appropriate I.D. 

Resident Fishing Licenses are available for $13.00 and good for one year beginning September 1,

1996. <p>

<H3>Town Tip - Salado, TX</H3>



<hr noshade><p>



    Twenty minutes north on  Interstate 35 is Salado.  It is interesting to note that most of the north-

south travel across Texas in the late 1800's traveled this same route and came right through Salado. 

The roots of the Stagecoach Inn date back to the 1860's.  The Inn was restored in the early 1940's and

soon its reputation grew beyond the Lone Star State.<P>



    The Stagecoach recipes are still the same and the waitresses still recite the menu just as was done

in the old days when whatever was in the kitchen was the bill of fare for the day.  If you are lucky,

you might just be waited on by Ruthene  waitressing at the Stagecoach Inn for 42 years.  She has

some fascinating tidbits on the Inn.  Although the Inn always gives you a choice they serve a

complete meal.  For instance the Sunday after church special is $13.95 for an appetizer, salad, entree,

vegetables, dessert, beverage, rolls and butter.  So make sure you bring your appetite.  Their

luncheons start at $7.95 and the evening meals vary.  It is a great place to dine before the Legacy

Hills Restaurant opens up.

<H2>Are You OK?</H2>



<hr noshade><p>



If you are a homebound individual or know of an elderly individual with little or no daily contact

with neighbors or  relatives, then the Williamson County Sheriff's Department and Georgetown

Police Services offer a computerized program that will reach out and be there when you need them. 

Computer generated phone calls will be made to a residences of the participant at a time(s) specified

by the individual. Once answered, the message (automated voice of Sheriff Richards) will instruct

the person to simply hang up if everything is okay or to dial 911 if assistance is needed.  In the event

that there is no answer to the call, the computer will automatically re-dial the number at five minute

intervals.  After the second call with no response, the computer will alert the dispatch center who

will then notify the designated emergency contact person or a law enforcement officer to respond

to the residence.<P>



There is no charge for this program.  Applications are available at the Sheriff's Department,

Georgetown Police Services, Emergency Medical Services and at several county offices. 

Applications can be made by phone, in person and delivered by law enforcement officers to

residence if requested.<p><br><br>

<H2>Restaurant Preview</H2>



<hr noshade><p>



Yes, we are going to have a restaurant on site. <P>



<I>When is it going to open?</I><P>



We can't wait either, but in early October things should <B>start cooking</B>.



<I>What are the service hours? What is on the menu?  Is it casual or formal?  Will it be dine-in or

take-out?  Will there be tables with chairs and waiters who introduce themselves as Biff? Will I

have to wash the dishes?  Is Split Pea Soup on the menu?  Do I have to bring my own fork?   Will

the meals be free? Should I  make a reservation?  Do we have to eat with our husbands?  Will

there be a scratch and sniff menu?  Will there be a drive-thru window?</I>

<P>



<B>WAIT!  WAIT!  WAIT!</B>    This is way too many questions!<P>



First of all, we are all going to have to <B>improve our driving</B> so that there <B>will not be</B> a drive-thru window.  Park your cars and golf carts <B>in</B> the parking lot. <P>



   Prince Food Services has been contracted to operated the restaurant at the Legacy Hills Golf Club. 

The clubhouse will be open seven days a week.  In the beginning the kitchen service hours will be

11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m Monday and Tuesday and 11:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Wednesday through

Sunday.  Beverage service, snacks and sandwiches will be available when the hours that the kitchen

is not opened.  Alcoholic beverages will be served as provided by the T.A.B.C.<P>



The dining service will be casual table service to accommodate the golfing patrons, but upscale

enough for a business lunch or a dinner celebration.  There will be a full menu ranging from burgers,

pastas, steaks, Signature Soups, Mufffalettas, speciality salads, healthy foods, sandwiches and frozen

bar drinks.  Although we will not be serving breakfast, from time to time we will be offering a

weekend pancake special, a Sunday Brunch, omelettes made to order, Belgium waffles and much

more.<P>



   Reservations are encouraged; however, due to dining room limitations reserved seating will be

restricted during certain dining hours.  For any restaurant operation to be successful, it is necessary

to turn the tables.  So remember if you are through and others are waiting, please relinquish your

table.  You may pay by check, cash or credit charge.  You should also note that on all the food and

beverage items served at the clubhouse there will be an automatic 15% service charge and

appropriate sales tax added to your ticket. You will have the right to increase or decrease the gratuity

depending on the level of service that you receive. There will not be a service charge on take-out

meals or meals <I>to go</I>.  The service charge will allow us to keep the restaurant properly staff.  The

restaurant will also have a Daily Menu Line that you can call to get the soup of the day or the daily

special.  We can't wait for Biff to say <I>Bon Appetit</I>.<p>

<H2>Oh My Aching Back!</H2>

<B>by Ken Stier, Director of Golf</B><P>



<hr noshade><p>



Among the physical problems that golfers encounter, lower back injuries are responsible for

more days off the golf course than all others including tendinitis, combined.  Physically, the

lower back is under tremendous stress. During the acto of swinging a golf club, studies have been

done to measure the forces applied to the back during various activities.  These included

standing, sitting, lying and bending.  Also studied was rotation and flexation-rotation.  Flexation-

rotation refers to the action that your back goes through each time you swing the club.  It is not

surprising that the highest forces were seen during flexation-rotation with flexation rated second. 

Think about how much stress your back receives if you play everyday!<P>



Therefore, it is not surprising to see many golfers who have problems with their lower back

caused by one action - NOT WARMING UP!  Although this the number one reason for

temporary lower back injuries among golfers.  The following are some ways, other than a proper

warming up period, to help maintain your lower back strength:

<OL>

<B><LI></B>Build up your abdominal and lower back or parapinous muscles.  This is mainly accomplished

by sit-ips and variations of this exercise.

<B><LI></B>IF IT'S SAFE, take anti-inflammatory medications before you play which makes life a lot

easier during the round (Be sure to check with your physician before taking any medication).

<B><LI></B>Avoid letting your back cool off.  This will cause your muscles to loose their flexibility and if

you have a chronic, this could cause your back to go into spasms.  Dress warmly during the cool

months and continue to lightly swing a club if you are waiting to hit your next shot during all

seasons.

<B><LI></B>A back brace may help if you have a chronic problem. Payne Stewart wore one when he won

the U.S. Open!

<B><LI></B>Before you hit that first practice ball, do some stretching and swinging of the golf club to

generate some heat in those back muscles.

</OL>



Remember, most people have back pain.  Any back pain that persists for more than a few days

should be evaluated by  a doctor or specialist.  Don't Take Chances!  Until next month - Swing

Easy.<p>

<TITLE>POLICY ADVISORY 11-95-C: Continuing Professional Competency </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" LINK="#0000FC" VLINK="#8C9794" ALINK="#FF0000">

<CENTER>
<H1>POLICY ADVISORY</H1>
<HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=center SIZE=3 NOSHADE>
<H3>11-95-C<BR>
Continuing Professional Competency<p>

Texas State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers</H3>
</CENTER>

<H3>I Background</H3>
CPC is a voluntary professional development program 
implemented by the board  to recognize engineers for 
continuing their training and education in engineering.   A 
legislative process known as the Sunset Review has  required 
other licensing agencies without professional development 
programs to establish them on a mandatory basis.  The board 
also created Continuing Professional Competency  before this 
review occurred so that the program could be evaluated 
through voluntary participation; the Legislature will meet 
in 2003 to decide whether involvement in the program will 
become mandatory.<P>

<H3>II  The Basics of CPC</H3>
An engineer earns credit for  CPC through voluntary 
involvement in documented self-study, short courses or 
tutorials, field related seminars, continuing education or 
college courses, professional engineering associations, 
teaching classes or seminars, writing papers, articles, or 
books, examination preparation or grading, and patents.  The 
board does not approve or disapprove activities for  CPC.  
Since the program operates on a voluntary basis, it is up to 
the individual engineer to decide if the course applies for 
credit.  An engineer  can  track CPC participation by 
keeping a personal log of  the professional development 
hours earned.  Engineers may design their own CPC log or  
obtain one from The Texas Society of Professional Engineers.   
A fee may be charged to nonmembers of  TSPE for their  log.  
Their phone number and mailing address is (512) 472-9286, 
TSPE, P.O. Box 2145 Austin, Texas, 78768.<P>

<H3>III Guidelines</H3>
<B>(a)  Continuing Professional Competency. </B> The information 
set forth below is for the purpose of providing 
guidelines for continuing professional competency.  The 
purpose of the continuing professional competency 
requirements is to demonstrate a continuing level of 
competency among professional engineers.  Every 
registrant who meets these continuing professional 
competency guidelines shall be noted in the roster as an 
active participant in the Texas State Board of 
Registration for Professional Engineers' Voluntary 
Continuing Professional Competency (CPC) program.<P>

<B>(b)  Definitions. </B> Terms used in this section are defined as 
follows:
<OL>
<LI>Professional Development Hour (PDH) - A contact hour 
(nominal) of instruction or presentation.  The common 
denominator for other units of credit.
<LI>Continuing Education Unit (CEU) - Unit of credit 
customarily used for continuing education courses.  One 
CEU equals 10 PDH's.  CEU's should be converted to 
PDH's for reporting this program.
<LI>College/Unit Semester/Quarter Hour - Credit for 
ABET-approved courses or other related college courses 
are determined in accordance with Section (e) of these 
guidelines.
<LI>Course/Activity - Any course or activity with a 
clear purpose and objective which will maintain, improve, or 
expand the skills and knowledge of the licensee.
</OL>
<P>
<B>(c)  Requirements for participation.</B>  <U>Every registrant who 
participates in this program must obtain 15 PDH units 
during the annual renewal period.</U>  If a registrant 
exceeds the annual requirement in any renewal period, a 
maximum of 15 PDH units may be carried forward into the 
subsequent renewal period.  PDH units may be earned for 
the following, provided the activity is relevant to the 
licensee's professional responsibilities in engineering 
practice, management, and ethics:

<P>

<H3>I Background</H3>
Discussions took place between the Texas Natural Resource 
Conservation Commission and the Texas State Board of 
Registration for Professional Engineers during the summer of 
1995 to develop a common understanding of the definition of 
engineering.  The need for clarification arose because of 
confusion concerning the roles the scientific and 
engineering professionals have on corrective action for the 
leaking petroleum storage tank sites. The commission and the 
board agreed September 13, 1995 that the following  LPST 
Site Activities Chart will designate those corrective action 
LPST services which are considered to be geological or non-
engineering.<P>

<I>
Engineering Practice Act, Section 19, Public Work.  It is 
unlawful for this state or for any of its political 
subdivisions...to engage in the construction of any public 
work involving professional engineering...unless the 
engineering plans and specifications and estimates have been 
prepared by, and the engineering construction is to be 
executed under the direct supervision of a registered 
professional engineer. 
<P>
b) This act shall not apply to:
<BR>
1) a public work involving structural, electrical, or mechanical engineering and for which the comtemplated expenditure for the completed project does not exceed $8,000.
<BR>

2) a public work...(involving all other types of  engineering) for which the contemplated expenditure for the 
completed project does not exceed $20,000...
<p>

Section 15(c).  This act applies to all engineering in this 
state that is not exempted under this Act.  A public 
official of this state or of a political subdivision of this 
state who is charged with the enforcement of laws, 
ordinances, codes, or regulations that affect the practice 
of engineering may only accept plans, specifications, and 
other related documents prepared by registered engineers, as 
evidenced by the seal of the engineer.  A public official 
shall report violations of this Act to the proper 
authorities (the board).
</I><P>
<H3>II Background</H3>

On March 3, 1936, an explosion occurred in the mechanical 
system of a junior  high and high school in the East Texas 
town of New London.  With a death toll of 295, the explosion 
became the largest involving school children in the world.  
The state of Texas adopted the Texas Engineering Practice 
Act in 1937 to protect the safety and well being of all 
people within the educational school system.  Since the 
creation of the law, there has been some confusion over the 
roles an engineer and architect play in the supervision, 
design, and construction of  school facilities.  The Texas 
Engineering Practice Act and the Texas Architectural 
Practice Act require that engineers shall perform all 
engineering and architects shall perform all tasks 
pertaining to architecture in the construction of state 
educational facilities.
<P>
<H3>III Purpose</H3>

The need for advisory 10-95-B arose because of the growing 
number of complaints concerning school construction that 
have come to the attention of the state board.  On a 
consistent basis the cases did not employ a design 
professional,  ignored building codes, or had nonexistent 
design standards.  These actions were often justified as 
"short cuts" to reduce the project budget.  Yet, these  
"short cuts" could raise liability concerns.  Each action 
may jeopardize the safety of school children and other 
parties within the educational system.  There is also the 
added cost of correcting faulty design.  
<P>
<B>1)</B> When is professional engineering design required?<BR>
Professional engineering design is required when the 
contemplated expenditure for the completed public 
educational project exceeds $20,000;  professional 
engineering design is also mandatory when the public 
educational project includes structural, electrical, or 
mechanical engineering and the contemplated expenditure for 
that project exceeds 8,000. 
<P>
<B>2)</B> Is a professional engineer required to be on site during 
construction? 
<br>
Yes. If mechanical, structural, electrical, civil or any 
other element of engineering is involved in the project, the 
project must be constructed under the direct supervision of 
a professional engineer. 
<P>
<B>3) </B>What are some specific examples of engineering in school 
construction?
<br>
Structural engineering generally includes the design and 
construction of such things as new additions involving 
structural columns, walls or beams, foundations, retaining 
walls, stadiums, or bleachers.  Mechanical engineering 
includes heating, ventilation and air conditioning, and 
plumbing systems.  Electrical engineering includes power 
supply, wiring plans, communication systems, and computer 
facilities.  Civil engineering includes site plans, 
drainage, tracks, tennis courts, parking facilities, water 
supply and wastewater disposal.  The projects that apply 
under the Texas Engineering Practice Act are not limited to 
the examples given;  the Board staff is available to answer 
any specific questions.
<P>
<B>4)</B> What is design/build?
<br>
Design/build is when one contractor designs and builds a 
structure. This combination of roles is prohibited by an 
attorney general's opinion;  another attorney general's 
opinion also states that there must be a complete legal 
separation between the work conducted by the designer and 
the builder.  However, Senate Bill 1, 74th Legislature 
allows "design/build" under certain conditions. A letter of 
intent issued by the author of the bill requires that all 
"design/build" engineering services must still be acquired 
in accordance to the Professional Services Procurement Act 
and the designer and the builder not be a part of the same 
firm.
<P>
<B>5)</B> Can I acquire engineering services through the 
competitive bidding process?  
<br>
No. The Texas Professional 
Services Procurement Act prohibits school districts from 
using competitive bidding;  each agency must select the most 
qualified consultant and then negotiate a fair fee.  If  an 
acceptable fee cannot be negotiated, the district may repeat 
the process with the next qualified firm or firms until an 
agreement can been reached.  Engineers who participate in 
competitive bidding would be considered to be in violation 
of the Texas Engineering Practice Act and the board  rules;  
therefore, the engineers in violation would be subject to 
disciplinary action by the board. 
<P>
<B>6)</B> Can I use either an engineer or an architect as the prime 
designer on a project? 
<BR>
Yes, either an architect or an engineer may serve as the 
prime professional. Yet all engineering must be performed by 
an engineer, and all architecture not exempted  under The 
Regulation of the Practice of Architecture, must be 
performed by an architect. The prime professional should be 
responsible for designing such work within the firm, or 
subcontracting the work that cannot be legally performed 
within the firm to other professional architecture or 
engineering firms.   
<P>

Sealing Rule
<P>
Texas State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers</H3>
<P>
</CENTER>




<B>131.138.  Engineers Seals.</B>  The purpose of the engineers 
seal is to assure the user of the engineering product that 
the work has been performed by the professional engineer 
named and to delineate the scope of the engineers work. The 
board strongly encourages the engineer to utilize the 
designation P.E. on all correspondence and in conjunction 
with all engineering performed.  The seal shall be used as 
noted in this section and in other board rules.  Physical 
seals of two different sizes will be acceptable: a pocket 
seal (the size commercially designated as 1-5/8-inch seal) 
or desk seal (commercially designated as a two-inch seal) to 
be of the design shown below.  Computer-generated seals may 
be of a reduced size provided that the engineers name and 
number are clearly legible.<P>
         <B>(1)</B>  All seals obtained and used by license holders 
may contain any given name or initial combination, except 
for nicknames, at their discretion, provided the surname 
appears on the seal and in the usual written signature.  <P>
        (<B>2)</B>  Engineers shall only seal work done by them or 
performed under their responsible supervision, except as 
provided in paragraph (10) of this section concerning 
standards. <P>
        <B>(3)</B> It shall be misconduct to knowingly sign or seal 
any engineering document or product if its use or 
implementation may endanger the health, safety, or welfare 
of the public. <P>
        <B>(4)</B> It shall be unlawful for a license holder whose 
license has expired, or has been revoked or suspended to 
sign or affix a seal on any engineering document or product. <p>
        <B>(5)</B>  All seals obtained and used by license holders 
shall be capable of leaving a permanent ink or impression 
representation on the engineering work, or shall be capable 
of placing a computer-generated representation in a computer 
file containing the engineering work.  If not accompanied by 
an original signature and date, computer-generated seals 
shall be accompanied by the following text or similar 
wording:  The seal appearing on this document was 
authorized by (Example:  Leslie H. Doe, P.E. 0112) on 
(date).  Alteration of a sealed document without proper 
notification to the responsible engineer is an offense under 
the Texas Engineering Practice Act.  <p>
        <B>(6)</B>  Preprinting of blank forms with an engineers 
seal, or the use of decal or other seal replicas is 
prohibited.<P>
        <B>(7)</B>  Engineers shall take reasonable steps to insure 
the security of  their physical or computer-generated seals 
at all times.  In the event of loss of a seal, the 
registrant will immediately upon learning of such loss 
communicate in writing all facts relative to the loss to the 
executive director of the board.<P>
        <B>(8)</B>  Engineers shall affix an unobscured seal, original 
signature, and date of signature to the originals of all 
documents containing the final version of any engineering 
work as outlined in paragraph (9) before such work is 
released from their control.  Non-final documents released 
from their control shall identify the purpose of the 
document, the engineer(s) of record and the engineer license 
number(s), and the release date by placing the following 
text or similar wording instead of a seal:  This document 
is released for the purpose of (Examples:  interim review, 
mark-up, drafting) under the authority of (Example:  Leslie 
H. Doe, P.E. 0112) on (date).  It is not to be used for 
(Examples: construction, bidding, permit) purposes.  The 
use of signature reproductions, such as rubber stamps, or 
computer generated or other facsimiles shall not be 
permitted in lieu of actual signatures.<P>
        <B>(9) </B> The engineer shall sign, seal and date the 
original title sheet of bound engineering reports, 
specifications, details, calculations or estimates, and each 
original sheet of plans or drawings regardless of size or 
binding.  All other engineering work, including but not 
limited to research reports, opinions, recommendations, 
evaluations, addenda, documents produced for litigation, and 
engineering software shall bear the engineers printed name, 
date, signature and the designation P.E. or other terms 
allowed under the Act, 1.2; a seal may be added on such 
work as needed or at the engineers discretion.  Electronic 
correspondence of this type shall be followed by a hard copy 
containing the engineers printed name, date, signature and 
the designation P.E. or other terms allowed under the Act, 
1.2. <P>
        <B>(10)</B>  Work performed by more than one engineer shall be 
sealed in a manner such that all engineering can be clearly 
attributed to the responsible engineer or engineers.  
Licensed employees of the state, its political subdivisions, 
or other public entities are responsible for sealing their 
original engineering work; however, such licensed employees 
engaged in review and evaluation for compliance with 
applicable law or regulation of engineering work submitted 
by others, or in the preparation of general planning 
documents, a proposal for decision in a contested case or 
any similar position statement resulting from a compliance 
review, need not seal the review reports, planning 
documents, proposals for decision, or position statement.  
When an engineer elects to use standards or general 
guideline specifications, those items shall be clearly 
labeled as such, shall bear the identity of the publishing 
entity, and shall be:<P>

<B>(A) </B> individually sealed by the engineer; or<BR>
<B>(B) </B> specified on an integral design/title/contents sheet that bears the engineers 
seal, signature, and date with a statement authorizing its use.

<H3><CENTER> 04-96-A <BR>
Structural Engineering Relating to Custom-Manufactured Products
Including Trusses<P>
Texas State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers</CENTER>
</H3>
<H3>I Background</H3>
<P>
In response to a request from the Texas Department of Insurance,
the Texas State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers
developed Policy Advisory 04-96-A. This advisory outlines a structural
engineer's scope of responsibility in engineering projects related
to custom-manufactured products including trusses.
<H3>II Policy</H3>
<P>
1. No person may perform professional engineering in Texas unless
that person is licensed in Texas, regardless of the license(s)
held in another state or nation. Those who submit engineering
to any political subdivision of the state who are not licensed
Texas engineers are subject to criminal prosecution under Section
23 of the Act and based on the political subdivision's requirements
under 15(c).
<P>
2. The designing engineer must either personally perform the truss
(or other custom manufactured product) design or must supervise
the performance of the design process if that engineer is to seal
the design. Review and sealing of the unsupervised work of a non-engineer
is plan-stamping and is subject to disciplinary action by the
Board.
<P>
3. The designing engineer must personally determine that correct
loads are used and that calculations are performed correctly,
using appropriate and accurate mathematical models. The only exceptions
to this is when any portion of the design process is performed
and sealed by a second licensed engineer and is subsequently incorporated
into other stages of the design by the responsible engineer.
<P>
4. No unlicensed and unsupervised person can legally perform professional
engineering and no engineer can aid or abet such illegal practice.
Although unlicensed persons may legally perform engineering under
the exemptions of Section 20 of the Act, these exemptions are
not valid when the work must be submitted to any political subdivision
of the State of Texas as such submittal constitutes a direct representation
to the public to be legally qualified to engage in the practice
of engineering.
<H3>III Related Advisories </H3>
<P>
There are no related advisories at this time. Updates may be made
periodically by the Board. Date of this advisory: 04/03/96.

Materials Testing and Analysis and Transportation Engineering Services
<P>Texas State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers<BR>

</CENTER></H3>
<H3>I Background</H3>
<P>
Discussions took place between the Texas Department of Transportation
and the Texas State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers
during the fall of 1995 to develop a common understanding of the
definition of engineering as it relates to the purchase of engineering
services including materials testing and analysis. The need for
clarification arose because of confusion concerning the roles
that the scientific and engineering professionals play within
the scope of those services. On May 20, 1996, the Department and
the Board identified services which are considered non-engineering,
those which are engineering, and those which may include labor
activities that may be performed by non-engineers provided it
is performed under responsible supervision. All documents requiring
a professional engineer's services or supervision must be sealed
by a professional engineer. <BR>
<H3>II Policy</H3>
<P>
The agreed upon policy reads as follows: &quot;In consideration
of the various requirements of the Professional Services Procurement
Act (PSPA), Section 2254, Government Code and the responsibility
of the Texas State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers
(Board) to enforce the Texas Engineering Practice Act (Act) and
to regulate the practice of engineering in Texas, the Board and
the Texas Department of Transportation (Department) have agreed
to utilize the following chart of activities to identify those
activities which are not engineering and, therefore, must be acquired
through low-bid or other procedures outside the scope of PSPA.
We agree that this chart is not an exhaustive list and we agree
to continue to work cooperatively to augment this chart to address
the future needs of both agencies.<BR>
<P>
The items listed under Class 1 of the chart shall be considered
non-engineering and are not subject to the PSPA when those services
are contracted. The items listed under Class 2 are engineering
activities and must be performed under the direct supervision
of a licensed engineer as required in Section 19 and elsewhere
in the Act and Board Rules. When those services are contracted
outside the Department and professional responsibility is transferred
to that contractor, those services must be acquired under the
PSPA. However, labor associated with the performance of those
activities does not constitute the practice of engineering and
that labor may be contracted by other means if that labor is to
be performed under the direct and responsible supervision of a
licensed Department engineer or a licensed consulting engineer
acting on behalf of the Department. The items listed under Class
3 are engineering. When those services are contracted outside
the Department, they must be acquired under the PSPA without exception.
<BR>
<P>
This Memorandum of Agreement shall take effect on the latest date
of execution (May 20, 1996) by either signatory and shall remain
effective unless rescinded by formal written action cosigned by
the Executive Directors of the Department and the Board.&quot;
William G. Burnett, P.E., TxDOT executive director, and John R.
Speed, P.E., TSBRPE executive director, signed the original document.<FONT SIZE=2>

<h1>The National Historic Preservation Act</h1>


</center>
<hr noshade>


Congress passed the National Historic Preservation Act in 1966.  The law established a national policy for the protection of historic and archaeological sites and outlined responsibilities for federal and state governments to preserve our nations history.<p>

Section 106 of the NHPA requires federal agency heads to consider the effects of their actions on historic and archeological sites that are eligible for the National Register of Historic Places.  Regulations for accomplishing this responsibility have been published in the Federal Register as 36 CFR Part 800:  Protection of Historic Properties.  They detail the efforts that a federal agency must undertake to protect the historical environment.  Copies of the NHPA and 36 CFR Part 800 can be obtained from the Department of Antiquities Protection at the Texas Historical Commission.  <p>

The NHPA requires that any activity that obtains a federal permit or license, uses federal funds, or is otherwise assisted or approved by the U.S. government to comply with section 106.<p>

Examples of projects that require compliance with this law include:

<ul>
<li>federal development activities, such as a new reservoir built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers;
<li>construction of municipal waste water treatment facilities that require a permit from the Environmental Protection Agency;
<li>new highway construction by the Texas Department of Transportation that utilizes  federal funds;  and
<li>local government improvement projects to rehabilitate or demolish housing using funds from the Housing and Urban Development Agency. 
</ul>

<h1>The Antiquities Code of Texas</h1>

</center>
<hr noshade>


The Antiquities Code of Texas was passed in 1969.  It requires that the Texas Historical Commission staff review any action that has the potential to disturb historic and archeological sites on public land.  <p>

Actions that need review under the Antiquities Code of Texas include any construction program that takes place on land owned or controlled by a state agency or a state political subdivision, such as a city or a county.<p>

Projects that require review include:

<ul>
<li>reservoirs constructed by river authorities and water districts;
<li>construction of recreational parks or the expansion of existing facilitates by city governments;
<li>energy exploration by private companies on public land;  and
<li>construction by a city or county government that exceeds 5 acres or 5,000 cubic yards, whichever comes first.  If the activity occurs inside a designated historic district or affects a recorded archeological site, it needs to be reviewed, regardless of project size. 
</ul>

The description of the NHPA and the Antiquities Code of Texas has been republished at the courtesy of the Texas Historical Commission.  Staff at the Texas Historical Commission can be reached by writing to P.O. Box 12276, Austin, Texas 78711-2276 or by calling (512) 463-6096.  <p>

SAN ANTONIO, Texas, July 17, 1996 -- A San Antonio engineer had his license suspended by the state engineering board for allegedly issuing an engineering opinion on a flood prevention design for a house that was later determined to be inadequate by Hays County authorities. <p>

Amir H. Shekarchi of SA Engineering in San Antonio had his license suspended by the state engineering board for two years effective June 19, 1996, with a probationary period starting Dec. 19, 1996, for his alleged release of an engineering opinion that the board charged appears to be contrary to generally accepted engineering standards.  <p>

Shekarchi also allegedly failed to fully disclose the rationale for his conclusion of the design adequacy of a 30 inch wall of dirt surrounding the house located at 205 Mesquite Trail in Wimberley, Texas and allegedly utilized unverified data from the homeowner to certify that the house would remain unharmed during a flood. <p>

Shekarchi signed an agreed board order in which he neither admits nor denies the charges the board has brought against him.<p>

"Professional engineers must comply with Texas engineering regulations as well as the codes within each jurisdiction of the state in which they practice," John R. Speed, P.E., executive director of the Texas State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers said. <p>

Shekarchi submitted the opinion on the house to Allen G. Walther, the Hays County flood administrator.<p>

The terms of Shekarchis license suspension require him to take an ethics course sponsored by the board through the Murdough Center for Engineering Professionalism at Texas Tech University in Lubbock and provide the board with written reports at three month intervals identifying the location of the projects worked on and the type of engineering services performed.<p>

Should Shekarchi fail to complete the ethics course by Dec. 19, 1996, he could not legally assume independent control on engineering projects in Texas until the end of his suspension in June of 1998.

With 47,000 engineers licensed in 23 disciplines throughout Texas, the board receives approximately 1200 inquiries during the year concerning the legalities of practicing engineering.  The state engineering board serves to protect the safety of the public by licensing engineers, enforcing the Texas Engineering Practice Act, and regulating the practice of engineering in Texas.<P>

FORT WORTH, Texas, July 17, 1996 -- An expert witness in a court case involving leaning utility poles that provide service to the downtown Fort Worth business district has been sanctioned by the state engineering board, resulting in the suspension of his license. <p>

Dr. Philip N. Buchanan, P.E., owner of Buchanan Soil Mechanics Inc., in Bryan, Texas, had a formal complaint filed against him with the state engineering board by John C. Meinrath, Esq., senior attorney for MCI Telecommunications Corp., concerning the engineering calculations that Buchanan presented in the Texas Utilities Co. vs. MCI Telecommunications Corp. court case in Richardson, Texas.<p>

"Professional engineers are bound by Texas engineering regulations to conduct their work according to generally accepted engineering practices," John R. Speed, P.E. executive director at the Texas State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers said.<p>

Buchanan had his license suspended by the state engineering board for his alleged failure to conduct both a "before" and an "after" analysis of the conditions of pole foundations;  for his alleged failure to include the bending moment loads in calculations to determine the adequacy of the foundation design;  and for his alleged failure to use a mathematical model that accurately reflected the situation found in the field.<p>

Buchanan signed an agreed board order in which he agreed to the two-year suspension with terms for probation effective June 19, 1996.<p>

In the agreed order, Buchanan neither admits nor denies the boards charges.<p>

According to board records, Texas Utilities Co. took MCI Telecommunications Corp. to court for digging a trench line near utility poles located along the Missouri Pacific Railroad in East Fort Worth.  The Texas Utilities Co. charged that the trench being dug near the poles caused them to lean.  The poles in question were later replaced.<p>

The terms of Buchanans probated license suspension require him to take an ethics course sponsored by the board through the Murdough Center for Engineering Professionalism at Texas Tech University in Lubbock and provide the board with written reports at three month intervals specifying the identity and location of the projects worked on and the type of engineering services performed.<p>

If Buchanan meets board requirements, the entire two-year suspension will be probated.<p>

FORT WORTH, Texas, July 17, 1996 -- The state engineering board revoked the engineering license of a Fort Worth resident for issuing a misleading engineering report regarding a structural inspection he conducted on a residence at 8341 Shady Grove in Keller, Texas.<p>

B. A. Martin, a self-employed engineer of 7305 Martha Lane in Fort Worth, was charged by the state engineering board for failure to properly inspect a residence;  failure to prepare an engineering report with clear information as to the structural integrity of a residence;  and failure to respond to the board by addressing the allegations brought against him.<p>

"With a revoked license Martin will not be able to practice professional engineering in Texas," said John R. Speed, P.E., executive director of the Texas State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers.<p>

The board made numerous attempts to alert Martin of the charges brought against him and of his formal hearing date;  however, Martin chose not to attend the formal hearing on March 27, 1996, at the State Office of Administrative Hearings in Austin.  <p>

At the judges recommendation, the board officially revoked Martins license on June 19, 1996.<p>

Through correspondence with the board, Victor M. Ferreira of Keller, Texas, the current homeowner, said that although the present condition of his house places his and his wifes health and safety at risk, they will continue to live at the residence because they cannot afford to move or make the necessary repairs.<p>

According to board records, the Ferreiras obtained a structural analysis report prepared by Martin before their purchase of the home from Gregg and Norma Harless of Keller, Texas. <p>

In early May of 1995, a second review, performed by James E. Breen, P.E., of Breen &amp; Associates, Inc. in Arlington, Texas, revealed that the integrity of a pier and beam foundation had been threatened by standing water under the house and that blocks used to support the perimeter of the residence were structurally inadequate.  <p>

The Ferreiras were provided an estimated cost of $16, 550 to repair the foundation by a contractor.  They were also informed that additional expenses would be incurred to fix the walls and floors.<p>

ABERNATHY, Texas, July 17, 1996 -- In response to a complaint filed by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, the state engineering board restricted an Abernathy engineer from practicing civil engineering because of his alleged failure to provide adequate plans and specifications to update a water system in Wolfforth, Texas.<p>

Archie C. Nystel, P.E. of Nystel Realty Co. in Abernathy signed a consent order with the state engineering board in which he agreed to cease practicing civil engineering because of his alleged failure to provide pertinent information and data to complete the proposed water system improvements in a professional and safe manner for the facility board records show as Wolfforth Place Water System in Wolfforth, Texas.  The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission did not approve Nystels plans for the water system.<p>

In the consent order the board accepted on June 19, 1996, Nystel neither admits nor denies the charges the board has brought against him.<p>

"In Mr. Nystels order, he has agreed not to practice civil engineering until he passes the national civil engineering Principles &amp; Practice Exam," said John R. Speed, P.E., executive director of the Texas State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers.<p>

The Principles &amp; Practice Exam is offered twice a year throughout Texas and the United States by the National Council of Engineering Examiners.  <p>

Although Nystels consent order restricts him from performing civil engineering tasks such as designing water systems, the order does not prevent him from practicing in mechanical engineering, which is his primary area of expertise according to board records.<p>

With 47,000 engineers licensed in 23 disciplines throughout Texas, the board receives approximately 1200 inquiries during the year concerning the legalities of practicing engineering.  The state engineering board serves to protect the safety of the public by licensing engineers, enforcing the Texas Engineering Practice Act, and regulating the practice of engineering in Texas.<P>

DALLAS, July 17, 1996 -- In response to a homeowners complaint and an independent inquiry by the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington, D.C., the state engineering board suspended a Dallas residents engineering license.<p>

Robert H. Yeakey, a Texas professional engineer and owner of Robert Yeakey &amp; Associates, Inc. in Dallas had his license suspended for his alleged release of blank forms containing his professional engineers seal and signature to an unlicensed individual and for his alleged failure to provide responsible supervision on an engineering inspection of a home in North Richland Hills, Texas.<p>

"Professional engineers are required by law to place their seal, signature, and date on plans they consider complete.  Their seal indicates that they have either performed the work themselves or have provided responsible supervision of the individuals working for them," John R. Speed, P.E., executive director of the Texas State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers said.<p>

Board records show that Michael Bush, the owner of the home located at 6745 Inwood, North Richland Hills, Texas, contacted the board after he felt work that was being performed by an unlicensed individual should have been completed by Yeakey.<p>

Yeakey signed a consent order with the board which states that he agrees to a two-year suspension of his license beginning June 19, 1996, with the final 21 months to be probated.  <p>

In the order, Yeakey neither admits nor denies the boards charges.<p>

The terms of Yeakeys license suspension require him to take an ethics course sponsored by the board through the Murdough Center for Engineering Professionalism at Texas Tech University in Lubbock and provide the board with written reports at three month intervals identifying the location of the projects worked on and the type of engineering services performed.<p>

Should Yeakey fail to complete the ethics course by Dec. 19, 1996, the probationary status of his license would be rescinded and his license would be suspended for the remaining time until June 19, 1998.<p>

With 47,000 engineers licensed in 23 disciplines throughout Texas, the board receives approximately 1200 inquiries during the year concerning the legalities of practicing engineering.

AUSTIN, Texas, May 6, 1996 -- The state engineering board has sanctioned a Houston engineer for his failure to provide responsible supervision on engineering work for a Sumner Suites hotel in San Antonio.
<p>
The inquiry into J.F. Gouges involvement on the hotel project began when an engineer contacted the Texas State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers.  The state engineering board immediately opened a case regarding Gouges practice of engineering.  
<p>
The boards charges include that Gouge of J. Spivey & Associates in Houston failed to provide responsible supervision of engineering work by approving plans that were not completed by him or under his supervision and that he submitted a misleading roof truss design to the owner.
<p>
At the conclusion of the investigation, Gouge signed a consent order in which he agreed to have his Texas engineering license suspended with terms for a two-year probation starting April 17, 1996.
<p>In the consent order, Gouge neither admits nor denies the charges the board has brought against him.  The board took action on 11 cases including the complaint against Gouge during the April board meeting.
<p>
Professional engineers are required by law to provide responsible supervision of engineering work and to practice within Texass engineering regulations, said John Speed, executive director of the Texas State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers.
<p>
The roof truss design plans were prepared for the Sumner Suites hotel at 601 S. St. Marys in San Antonio.  No problems concerning the hotel have been reported to the board.  
<p>
The terms of Gouges probated suspension require him to take an ethics course sponsored by the board through the Murdough Center for Engineering Ethics and Professionalism at Texas Tech University in Lubbock and provide the board with a written plan of action concerning his future compliance with the Texas Engineering Practice Act and board rules, Speed said.  
<p>
Should Gouge fail to meet the boards terms for probation, he would not be able to assume independent control on engineering projects in Texas until the end of his suspension in April of 1998.
<p>
With 47,000 engineers licensed in 23 disciplines throughout Texas, the board receives approximately 1200 inquiries during the year concerning the legalities of practicing engineering.  The state engineering board serves to protect the safety of the public by licensing engineers, enforcing the Texas Engineering Practice Act, and regulating the practice of engineering in Texas.<P>

</CENTER>


 AUSTIN, Texas, May 6, 1996 -- In response to an inquiry by the Texas Department of Insurance, the state engineering board has obtained an agreement with a Florida resident to cease the practice of engineering in Texas.<P>

The TDI expressed concern in an August 1995 letter to the Texas State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers about whether the engineering work performed by Mehmet Y. Ilter, P.E of Florida was in accordance with Texass engineering regulations.
<P>
The state engineering board immediately opened an investigation into the engineering services Ilter was offering through Mitek Industries, Inc. in Miami, Florida for Los Fresnos Truss in Los Fresnos, Texas. 
<P>At the conclusion of the investigation, Ilter signed a consent order in which he agreed to cease the practice of engineering in Texas and acknowledged that the board will refuse to renew his license effective April 17, 1996, said John Speed, executive director of the Texas State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers.
<P>
The boards charges against Ilter include failing to provide adequate supervision of roof truss designs, affixing his Florida seal on Texas engineering plans, and using a rubber stamp replica of his signature on projects. 
<P>
Ilter signed a consent order in which he neither admits nor denies the charges the board has brought against him. The board took action on 11 cases including the complaint against Itler during the April board meeting.
<P>
"Professional engineers are required by law to provide responsible supervision of engineering work and to practice within Texass engineering regulations," Speed said.
<P>
As a result of similar cases, the board has developed a custom manufactured products policy which clarifies an engineers scope of responsibility in engineering projects such as truss designs. 
<p>
With 47,000 engineers licensed in 23 disciplines throughout Texas, the board receives approximately 1200 inquiries during the year concerning the legalities of practicing engineering in Texas.  The state engineering board serves to protect the safety of the public by licensing engineers, enforcing the Texas Engineering Practice Act, and regulating the practice of engineering in Texas. <p>

<CENTER><H1>Victoria Engineer's License Suspended</H1>
<h3>Texas State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers</h3>
</CENTER>

VICTORIA, Texas, Dec. 1, 1995 -- The Texas State Board of 
Registration for Professional Engineers suspended the 
engineering license of a Victoria engineer for his part in the 
improper design and construction of a running track in the Edna 
Independent School District. <P>
        Milton D. Bluhm of 210 King Arthur in Victoria signed an 
agreed order based on  his apparent failure to supervise the 
preparation of construction plans prepared by a non-engineering 
firm before placing his official engineer seal on the plans. 
Board records show that Bluhm is employed by Balusek-Frankson & 
Associates in Victoria. <P>
        Bluhms act of sealing documents he did not supervise 
violated the Texas Engineering Practice Act and  the board rules 
concerning proper sealing procedures.<P>
                Were seeing an increase in cases involving non-
engineering firms who offer  engineering services to school 
districts, said John R. Speed, P.E., executive director of the 
Texas State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers. <P>

        Although this particular track may function properly, 
situations like this often cost the project owners more money to 
correct under designed facilities or to pay for the cost of over 
designed facilities, Speed said.   <P>
        The board suspended Bluhms license for a period of three 
years.  Without a professional engineering license he cannot 
assume independent control of engineering work.  Bluhms 
suspension may be probated as early as October of 1996 depending 
upon his meeting specific board requirements.<P>
        School officials should beware of firms who do not  employ  
licensed  engineers on staff  because by law that firm cannot 
legally provide design services for roofing, athletic 
facilities, and many other areas of  construction to school 
districts. <P>
        As in Bluhms case, contractors cannot circumvent this by 
hiring yet another consultant to stamp the drawings;  this 
practice could cause the school board members, district staff 
and the consultant to incur additional expenses to rectify the 
illegal action.<P>
        The Texas State Board of Registration for Professional 
Engineers is a state agency that licenses engineers, enforces 
the Texas Engineering Practice Act, and regulates the practice 
of engineering in Texas.  Currently there are 47,000 licensed 
engineers practicing in 23 disciplines throughout the state of 
Texas.   <P>

<CENTER><H1>Louisiana Engineer Sanctioned</H1>
<H3>Texas State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers</H3>
</CENTER>

MOUNT PLEASANT, Texas, Jan. 24, 1996 -- The Texas State 
Board of Registration for Professional Engineers took action 
on eight Texas cases involving the improper practice of 
engineering during the quarterly board meeting in January.  
In one such case, a Louisiana engineer has received a 
sanction against his engineering license because of his role 
in the design and installation of an air conditioning 
project for the P.E. Wallace Junior High School Gymnasium in 
Mount Pleasant, Texas.<P>
        Harry C. Harbin of Shreveport, Louisiana had his 
license to practice engineering in Texas suspended with 
terms for probation during 1996.<P>
        The board charged Harbin with allowing the projects 
plans to be released to permitting officials without 
professional engineering authorization.  His partners, 
Louisiana engineers Homer Purtle, Jr., Mike Dunavant, and 
Jerry Ivey of Purtle and Associates, were involved in the mishandling of the project.<P>

        Harbin signed a consent order with the board in which 
he neither admits nor denies the charges the board has 
brought against him.<P>
        By allowing Mr. Purtle to place his Louisiana seal on 
the plans for the project, Mr. Harbin appears not to have 
followed Texass requirements for responsible engineering 
supervision, said John R. Speed, P.E., Executive Director 
of the Texas State Board of Registration for Professional 
Engineers.<P>
        The Texas Engineering Practice Act requires that 
professional engineers or P.E.s working on Texas 
engineering projects be licensed to practice in Texas.  
Purtle, Dunavant, and Ivey are licensed to practice in 
Louisiana. <P>
        The board advises school districts to check the 
licensing status of persons offering their engineering 
services.  A recent case in Edna, Texas, involved the three 
year suspension of a Victoria engineers license for 
improperly approving plans for Edna High Schools running 
track.<P>
        Harbin will have his one year suspension probated if he 
complies with board requirements, Speed said.<P>
        These include taking an ethics course sponsored by the 
board through the Murdough Center for Engineering Ethics and 
Professionalism at Texas Tech University in Lubbock and 
complying with the Texas Engineering Practice Act over the 
next year.<P>

</CENTER>


DALLAS, Jan. 24, 1996 -- The Texas State Board of 
Registration for Professional Engineers took action on eight 
Texas cases involving the improper practice of engineering 
during the quarterly board meeting in January.  In one such 
case, a Metro-area engineer will be starting out the new 
year without a license because of his role in the improper 
approval of foundation plans for a house within Creek 
Crossing Estates in Mesquite. <P>
        James Harry Rowell of Carrollton had his engineering 
license suspended for five years for numerous violations of 
the Texas engineering law and board rules.  Rowell is owner 
of a land surveying and engineering company, Harry Rowell & 
Associates, Inc. in Carrollton.<P>
        The board charged Rowell with allowing David Tuttle, 
president of Post-Tension Engineering in Dallas, to illegally perform engineered house slab designs for the companys clients.  Rowell was also charged with practicing in a field of engineering he is not competent to perform and 
failing to provide responsible supervision on the 
engineering project.<P>
        Rowell signed a consent order with the board in which 
he neither admits nor denies the charges the board has 
brought against him.<P>
        Mr. Tuttle is not an engineer, but apparently his 
company used Mr. Rowells seal to certify plans without Mr. 
Rowells supervision, said John R. Speed, P.E., Executive 
Director of the Texas State Board of Registration for 
Professional Engineers.<P>
        According to sworn depositions from Mr. Rowell, this 
arrangement may have been used on more than one house 
design, Speed said.<P>
        The Texas Engineering Practice Act requires a 
professional engineer to provide responsible supervision of 
engineering work before sealing any plans.<P>
        Rowells suspension may be probated as early as January 
10, 1999 by complying with specific board requirements, 
Speed said. <P>
        These requirements include taking an ethics course 
sponsored by the board through the Murdough Center for 
Engineering Ethics and Professionalism at Texas Tech 
University in Lubbock and complying with the Texas 
Engineering Practice Act throughout his suspension.  <P>

<h1><i>P.E. NEWSLETTER</i></h1>

<b>TEXAS STATE BOARD OF REGISTRATION FOR PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS</b><p>
<b>No. 23, February 1996</b><p>

<hr noshade>

<h3>Continuing Professional Competency</h3>

The Continuing Professional Competency Program (CPC) has experienced a successful first round.  Since its implementation in September of 1995, the board has received positive feedback on the program, CPC Coordinator Debbie Rice said. <p>  

"Engineers appreciate that the program is well-structured and that they can participate on a voluntary basis," Rice added.<p>

Monitoring Team committees have altered the program slightly since CPC's introduction in September.<p>

The Reporting Committee decided during the October meeting to allow out of state licensed engineers participating in mandatory CPC programs to submit their state's CPC reporting form to the Texas board.  The committee also made minor changes in the  board's CPC reporting  form which should make it easier to understand and complete.<p>

The CPC Monitoring Team met in November to discuss the correspondence that had been received regarding CPC, to review the statistics from the reporting forms and to approve the decision to make CPC information accessible on the Internet.<p>

The Reporting Committee decided in the January meeting that 10% of CPC participants will be randomly selected and asked to provide documentation verifying their CPC activities.  During the past six months, 4,700 engineers have registered to participate in CPC. <p>

In addition, members of the Monitoring Team and the board staff have been giving talks to different groups regarding CPC.  If an engineering group would like to have a speaker come and talk about CPC, please contact the board office.<p>

A sample CPC log  is available from the Texas Society of Professional Engineers.  To receive a copy of the log contact TSPE, P.O. Box 2145, Austin, Texas 78768, (512) 472-9286. Registrants may also design their own log to track their CPC activities.<p>

<h3>New Board Members Named</h3>

Governor George Bush appointed three new members to the board on January 17, 1995.  Ernest D. (Dave) Dorchester, P.E., Edmundo R. Gonzalez Jr., P.E. and  Danny R. Perkins will replace retiring members James K.Wilhelm, P.E., Earnest F. Gloyna, D.E., P.E. and John G. Farbes. <p>

Mr. Dorchester is an electrical engineer retired from T.U. Electric.  He graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering.  He previously served on the board from 1987 through 1991.  He has also served on the United States Committee on International Engineering Practice as a representative for the National Society of Professional Engineers.  He has been an emeritus member of the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying and was awarded the Distinguished Service Award.  He resides in Midland with his wife Mary.<p>

Mr. Gonzalez is a civil engineer and owner of Gonzalez Engineering &amp; Surveying, Inc. in Brownsville, Texas.  He graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering from Kansas State University.  He serves as  president of Brownsville's United Way Board and president of the Food Bank in the Rio Grande Valley.  He resides in Brownsville with his wife Peggy.<p>

Mr. Perkins is principal owner of ESC Polytech Consultants, Inc. in Houston, Texas.  He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Public Affairs and Master of Science in Transportation Planning and Management from Texas Southern University.  In 1995, Mayor Bob Lanier selected him to serve as  a commissioner on the City of Houston Building and Standards Commission. He resides in Houston with his wife Melanie and their two children Danielle and Danny Jr.<p>

<h3>NEWS from Executive Director John R. Speed, P.E.</h3>

<b>New Sealing Rule</b><p>

On November 21, 1995, the board instituted a new sealing rule.  It is printed on the next page along with a chart showing the appropriate sealing practices for various types of work.  We suggest that this page be posted in the offices where sealing is conducted.  

The new rule emphasizes that the engineer is to clearly convey to the client or user the scope of the work performed and who performed it.  It allows the signature and "P.E." designation to replace the seal on some unbound documents.  Although it still requires all plan sheets (bound or unbound) to be sealed, bound documents need only be sealed on the title sheet.  CADD seals and incomplete documents are covered in paragraphs (5) and (8).  <b>(<a href="../policy/advseal.htm">See Complete Details</a>)</b><p>

<b>Design/Build</b><p>

Design/build on public works conducted by political subdivisions of the state has not been legal since a 1984 Attorney General's Opinion (JM-282).  However, in the 74th legislature, Senate Bill 1 included a provision to allow school districts to utilize design/build under certain circumstances.  A letter of intent from the author of that bill further clarified that engineering services must still be acquired based on the qualifications of the provider as prescribed in the Professional Services Procurement Act.  The author also states that there can be no relationship between the designers and the contractor under any such design/build agreement.  Any contract made in violation of the PSPA is voided by Section 2254.005 of the Government Code.<p>

<b>Proposed Changes to the Exam Format</b><p>

Beginning in 1998 the format for the Civil, Chemical, Electrical, and Mechanical PE exam will change.  The examination will be divided equally in testing the depth and breadth of knowledge.  The breadth questions will cover the disciplines in general; and the examinee will choose one of the subareas of the discipline for the depth portion.  Instead of selecting questions from a larger group of questions, examinees will answer four general questions and four subarea questions;  examinees will have no choice in the selection of those questions. <p>

<b>Plan Stamping</b><p>

The board enforcement staff has been actively pursuing an increasing number of plan stamping cases;  several have resulted in significant suspensions.  All licensed engineers should understand the significance of Board Rule 131. 138 (2) and refuse to seal work that has not been performed personally or under their responsible supervision. <p>

<b>TNRCC Agreement</b><p>

In September, the board entered into a memorandum of agreement with the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission with regards to underground storage tanks.  The agreement clearly delineates which activities in the assessment and remediation process are engineering and which are non-engineering.  We would like to thank the following staff at TNRCC for helping to prepare such a significant document:  Danny Lien, P.E., Anton Rozsypal, P.E., Chet Clark, Joe Woodard, and Dan Wittliff, P.E.  These and others in the TNRCC have a very high commitment to technical excellence that will serve the public well in the years ahead.  A copy of this agreement in the form of the board's policy advisory is available from Hali Ummel, the public information coordinator for the board.<p>

 <i>(Update as of 04-01-96:  the advisory is also available from the boards Internet World Wide Web home page at <a href="http//:www.main.org/peboard">http//:www.main.org/peboard</a> )</i><p>

<b>New Discipline Examinations</b><p>

The National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying approved two new examinations, Building Architectural Engineering (BAE) and Ship Design Engineering (SDE).  The respective technical societies will be conducting a professional activities and knowledge analysis to determine the specifications for the new examinations and to develop the examinations.  It is anticipated that examinations will be offered in April of each year.  The implementation date is not known at this time. <p>

<b>Internet</b><p>

The board will have e-mail capability and a home page up by May 1996.  You may contact Hali Ummel at the board office for more details.<p>

<h3>Enforcement Matters</h3>

<b>Disciplinary Actions</b><p>

During the period July 1, 1995 through January 31, 1996, the Enforcement Division conducted  502 inquiries;  305 of those were resolved by achieving voluntary compliance.  In addition, 14 Cease and Desist orders were signed by individuals found to be in violation of the Act.  Since publication of the August 1995 Information Bulletin, the following administrative actions have been taken:<p>

Milton D. Bluhm of Victoria signed an Agreed Board Order for the suspension of  his engineering license for plan stamping.  Bluhm's three-year suspension  may be probated after the first year contingent upon his successful completion of an ethics course at Texas Tech University within 1996.   Bluhm will also need to provide the board a written plan of action describing how he will alter his activities to prevent further occurrence of the offenses for which he was charged.    <p>

James Harry Rowell of Carrollton signed a Consent Order for the suspension of  his engineering license for plan stamping.  Rowell also allowed an unlicensed individual to affix a rubber stamp replica of his signature to design plans and practiced in a field of engineering he is not competent to perform.  Rowell's five-year suspension may be probated after three years contingent upon his successful completion of an ethics course at Texas Tech University within 1996.<p>

Harry C. Harbin of Shreveport, Louisiana signed a Consent Order for the suspension of  his engineering license for allowing a project's plans to be released to permitting officials without professional engineering authorization.  Harbin's one-year suspension will be probated for the entire period contingent upon his successful completion of an ethics course at Texas Tech University within six months from the date the order was accepted by the board.   <p>

Michael McCarthy, P.E. of Sugar Land signed a Consent Order for the suspension of  his engineering license for six months with the entire period probated.  McCarthy was charged with failing to provide a copy of his engineer seal imprint after registration and failing to respond to the board's repeated request for a copy of the imprint. <p>

Gwendolyn R. Jones P.E.  of Houston signed a Consent Order for the suspension of  her engineering license for six months with the entire period probated.  Jones is charged with failing to provide a copy of her engineer seal imprint after registration and failing to respond to the board's repeated request for a copy of the imprint. <p>

<h3>License Renewal</h3>

Engineers must renew their license annually if they wish to continue to practice professional engineering.  Renewal dates are staggered into quarters so that approximately one-fourth of the state's licensees will renew every three months.  Regardless of whether a renewal notice is received, each licensee is still responsible for license renewal.  Additional fees will be charged to engineers who renew late.  Engineers who renew one day to 90 days after the deadline will incur a $20 penalty fee.   Engineers who renew for more than 90 days but less than one year after their license expires will incur another $20 penalty fee.  <p>

Many engineers received letters this past January concerning the lapse of their license.  It contained a cease and desist notice which reminds engineers to cease the practice of professional engineering until such time as their license is current.  Renewal notices are sent out 30-45 days prior to the license expiration dates listed below.<p>

<h3><a name="Engineers'_Forum_on _Continuing_Professional_Competency">Engineers' Forum on  Continuing Professional Competency</a></h3>

Nearly 5,000 engineers have registered for participation in the board's voluntary Continuing Professional Competency program since its implementation in September of 1995.  From the vantage point of  one year's experience, the board has begun an active review of  CPC  to determine the actual benefits of the program for engineers and the profession as a whole.  CPC's overall purpose is to recognize engineers for their efforts towards continuing their training in engineering.  Through communications between engineers and the board, many engineers have commented on the enrichment they have received from the program.  Yet, there also seems to be evidence of a question lurking in many engineers minds.  That question is:  "Why
 CPC and why now?"<p>

<b>CPC History</b><p>

The voluntary CPC program was initiated by the board from 1994 to 1995.   During that year, the CPC Monitoring Team, an 18 member panel of engineers from diverse engineering disciplines, developed a CPC mission statement.  Before deciding on the program's focus, the Monitoring Team reviewed emerging undercurrents in the profession such as the vast changes in technologies, a decline in understanding of the profession, and the realities of an upcoming legislative process known as the Sunset Review in 2003.  
These are the forces that primarily shaped CPC.  <p>

Yet, the CPC program has been a topic of debate since its implementation in 1995.  <p>

"There are individual and public yardsticks used to measure professional competency," past board member Earnest Gloyna, D.E., P.E.,  said. <p>

Each engineer must first maintain technical and  professional leadership and then also be prepared for the growing public review which increasingly is occurring on both national and international levels, Gloyna said.<p>

Leo Able, P.E., of  Houston, is an author of two textbooks and numerous papers published  in engineering  trade journals.  "I know from my work that some engineers are not staying current," he said.  Able would like to see CPC continue and feels the program should become mandatory, he said. 
<p>

Currently the program operates on a voluntary basis.  Yet, in 2003 the state engineering board will undergo a Sunset Review by the Texas Legislature.  The past track record of the Sunset Review has been to mandate that  licensing agencies that do not have continuing education programs implement them.<p>

"The board's plan is to let the program develop in a voluntary setting, allowing engineers to guide their own program,"  said John R. Speed, P.E., executive director  of the Texas State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers.<p>

<b>Engineers' Participation</b><p>

Engineers participating in the program find many ways within the scope of their job responsibilities to earn credit for CPC.   Wayne Nunn, P.E., of Missouri City earns his credits through researching his clients product
s and  through in-house study courses like AutoCAD training.  His  CPC studies enhance his day-to- day knowledge of piping analysis, Nunn said. He finds value in  CPC "because engineers should continue to educate themselves after college," Nunn added.<p>

Donna Manhart, P.E., of Garland said she is staying up to date and doing her job better by attending seminars at her work that count for CPC credit.  "I have met the requirements,  so why shouldn't I turn it in?", Manhart said.<p>

Walter Evans, P.E., CPC Monitoring Team member,  foresees the possibility of engineers-in-training becoming part of the CPC program.  Evans would like to see a trial period implemented where the engineers-in-training could participate on an exploratory basis before making the choice to fully
 join the program, he said. <p>

CPC's 15 required credit hours for participation can be obtained through self-study, involvement in the professional societies, writing engineering papers, teaching engineering courses, and in many cases any educational activity that enhances an engineer's ability to achieve peak performance on the job.  Since the program operates on a voluntary basis, it is up to the engineer to decide which engineering and job related activities count for CPC credit.<p>

<b>Pro's and Con's</b><p>

At a Houston branch ASCE meeting, Wayne Klotz, P.E., of Houston asked the 100  engineers present if they would still be in favor of CPC if their employer was prohibited from paying for classes or giving them time off from work to fulfill CPC credits.  After a discussion, only a dozen of the 100 engineers were still in favor of CPC, Klotz said.<p>

Joe Novoa, P.E., a past board member,  also questions the cost effectiveness of the benefits verses the expense of CPC activities.  <p>

"I have always argued that CPC as currently envisioned could cost as much as $50 million annually to the people of  Texas....for this amount of engineering effort, civil engineers could design one billion dollars worth of capital improvements every year, "  Novoa  said. <p>

Novoa calculated that by multiplying an estimated 20 hours of work expended by an engineer to meet CPC requirements at a billing rate of $50 per hour, each engineer's participation would cost $1,000.  With nearly 50,000 engineers registered in Texas, Novoa estimated that Texas citizens would have to pay $50 million. <p>

 Yet, the public's perception of an  engineer's work can not be left out of the CPC debate. To quote Earnest Gloyna, "The time and effort to maintain a visible CPC program is considerable.  However, professionalism requires societal confidence." <p>

The South Texas section of ASME distributed  a CPC survey in May of 1995 to their 4,000+ members.  In response to the survey, many  engineers indicated that their employer would cover the expense of the training.  For engineers who must pay for training individually, the survey indicated the annual average cost of participation to be on a yearly average $1,800,  based on 40 hours each year for compliance. <p>

One scenario that can help reduce the expense of earning the 15 CPC credit hours is to take a continuing education course, attend professional society meetings, and participate in a self-study activity like reading engineering books and trade journals. <p>

 This past spring Engineering Times  ran an article that reported AT&amp;T has begun cutting back approximately 40,000 jobs.    <p>

AT&amp;T  spokesman Burke Stinson was quoted in the article as saying, "...If you're an engineer with a specialty who is interested in other aspects of what's going on in the communications business you're in demand.  If you're a dogmatic engineer who doesn't take advantage of new trends, you won't be in demand...".<p>

<b>Summary</b><p>

Engineers are invited to respond to the board by letter or e-mail concerning  CPC.  Contact Debbie Rice, CPC coordinator for the board, for more information or to request  a  CPC speaker for presentations at engineering functions.   <p>

<b>New Policy Advisories</b><p>

Over  the past six months, the board has undertaken several issues of importance to various segments of the engineering community.  To address the most common concerns, policy advisories have been issued for general use.  Advisories may be obtained by contacting Hali Ummel, the public information coordinator.  The following policy advisories are also currently available on the board's home page:  10-95-A Petroleum Storage Tank Sites, 10-95 B School Construction Policy, 11-95-A Sealing Rule, 11-95-C  Continuing Professional Competency.

<b>Custom Manufactured Products (Truss) Policy</b><p>

In response to a request by the Texas Department of Insurance, the board developed Policy Advisory 04-96-A in April of this year.  The advisory outlines a structural engineer's scope of responsibility in engineering projects related to custom manufactured products including trusses. <p>

 The role of the structural engineer is not that of "reviewer" of another person's work, but it is that of the designing engineer.  When engineers place their seals on drawings, those drawings must be personally prepared or produced under responsible supervision -- a fairly stringent standard.  This reminder is especially important considering recent board enforcement actions (see Enforcement Matters).<p>

<b>Contracting Transportation Engineering at TxDOT</b><p>

On May 20, 1996, The Texas Department of Transportation and the board signed a Memorandum of Agreement that identified engineering and non-engineering services as they relate to the purchase of materials testing analysis and transportation engineering services.  It is summarized in Policy Advisory 06-96-A.  <p>

This agreement defines which specific activities are engineering and therefore subject to the Professional Services Procurement Act, and which are non-engineering and may be acquired under low bid rocedures.  Several members of the TxDOT staff have been instrumental in making this agreement possible:  Katherine L. Holtz, P.E., Jeff Seiders, P.E., Darren Hazlett, P.E., Amadeo Saenz, P.E., Roger El-Khoury, P.E., and Bobbie Templeton, P.E. <p>

We would like to publicly thank Bill Burnett, P.E., TxDOT executive director, for allowing his staff the flexibility and authority to participate in the creation of the agreement.  Interested parties may contact Hali Ummel, the public information coordinator at the board, to receive copies of the boards policy advisory concerning the Memorandum of Agreement with TxDOT. <p>

<b>Political Involvement</b><p>

In this political year, the role engineers play in the American political system has become a topic of the boards interest.  Increasingly, the board has fielded questions from professional engineers concerning donation amounts acceptable for candidates, the line between political participation and conflict of interest, and the act of running for political office.  Although the board has not issued a policy advisory, a few general comments are in order.<p>

As the American political system is often complex, the ethical questions posed by an engineers articipation in the electoral process are neither simple nor easy to define.  First and foremost, engineers are not exclud
ed from the basic democratic liberty that all Americans share to take part in the politics of our country.  The board has never indicated a desire to curtail that participation among its licensees.  In fact, board rule 
131.152(g) begins with a statement of encouragement:<p>

<i>"Registrants (professional engineers) may actively participate in elective and appointive public service in keeping with each registrants personal convictions."</i><p>

Although the rule deals primarily with those engineers seeking such positions, the board has not set forth in policy or action extensive restrictions that would prevent engineers from providing support in the elective process.<p>

Professional engineers have always participated in politics though various functions such as volunteer campaign supporters, donators of cash contributions, hosts for a candidates reception, and as city council members, school board members, Texas senators, and congressional representatives.  Within the confines of legal and ethical responsibility, the licensed engineers political involvement is open to all of these activities for participation and fulfillment.<p>

However, short and easy answers dont always address every situation.  There are many circumstances where the professional should consider the effect of his/her decision to participate.  Board rule 131.155(a) prohibits using a political contribution as an inducement to secure a specific engineering job.  Board rule 131.152(g) prohibits professional engineers in public positions from participating in a deliberation or decision in which they could profit.  Board rule 131.152(f) prohibits engineers from obtaining contracts from governmental entities where a firm employee is in a public position and is in a position to influence the award of the contract.  Although these rules might seem restrictive, the discerning engineer should notice that these rules are, in fact, no more restrictive than the rules that are already in place for the public officials themselves!<p>

One of Americas most valuable freedoms is the right to vote for any political candidate and the right for any citizen to run for office.  Yet, as professional engineers, we must also maintain an ethical approach to pursuing our own political convictions while remaining within the confines of Texas engineering regulations.  For if we dont retain our integrity as defined by our personal standards and the legal and ethical bounds of our society, we may face unwarranted scrutiny of the perceptions we create.  Texas engineers should be proud of their ethical performance in the political arena and should strive to maintain it.<p>

<b>Issues in Committee</b><p>

The Education and Industry Advisory Committees are composed of distinguished Texas engineers and deans of engineering who advise the board on various policy issues, especially those involving professional development and ethics.  These committees are currently advising the board in a variety
 of areas including: 

<ul>
<li>Goals for the board-sponsored ethics and professionalism program at the Murdough Center for Engineering Professionalism at Texas Tech University
<li>A new ethics examination for applicants
<li>The elements of  "responsible supervision" 
<li>The possible role of a "technical review committee" for board enforcement support 
<li>Policies to encourage the university engineering faculty to become licensed.
</ul>

<b>The Ad-Hoc Committees </b>are composed of board members and specially appointed ex-officio committee participants to address specific issues and make recommendations on actions to the full board:<p>

<b>The Registration Committee</b> is currently addressing the new ethics exam, engineering faculty registration, and other registration issues.<p>

<b>The Governmental Affairs Committee</b> is currently evaluating the impact of government policy actions such as the school construction elements of Senate Bill 1 and the board rules on political contributions.<p>

<b>The committee on NAFTA</b> is continuing its evaluation of the Mutual Recognition Document promulgated by the U.S., Canadian and Mexican engineering representatives and will be monitoring its potential impact on Texas.<p>

<b>The Professional Development Committee</b> is monitoring and guiding the board's ethics and professionalism program and other related issues.<p>

Each of these committees take input from the general public, licensed engineers, and other committees such as the Industry Advisory Committee.  Your input and participation is welcomed and encouraged.  Please send written comments or concerns to the board office in care of the public information coordinator. <p>

<b>Responsible Supervision</b><p>

 Although Board rule 131.18 defines responsible supervision,  questions are often posed to the board concerning specifications.  Before proceeding with a case, the enforcement staff and I look for a series of elements to establish the level of  responsible supervision.<p>

<b>1.  Active Participation - </b>The process of plan preparation, construction monitoring, system analysis or other engineering must include some level of active participation by the responsible engineer.  After-the-fact reviews that do not allow participation in the early decision-making process rarely provide adequate supervision. <p>

<b>2. Professional Control -</b> The responsible engineer must be able to exert control over every element of engineering plans, products or activities.  The responsible engineer's control must be present throughout the engineering process as well as after it has been completed.<p>

<b>3. A Supervisor/Subordinate Relationship  - </b> Although supervision may come in a variety of forms, all supervisors have one thing in common:  they have subordinates.  Responsible supervision must involve such a relationship that is clearly defined.<p>

<b>4. Personal Presence -</b> Although electronic correspondence can enable a much more extensive level of engineering practice, responsible supervision still must include direct contact between engineers and subordinates. Phones and faxes should only serve as a supplement to the relationship, not as a surrogate.<p>

The board's concern with responsible supervision is most often highlighted in cases of plan stamping.  Plan stamping occurs when an engineer certifies that the work was performed under his/her responsible supervision, when in fact it was not.  Recent board cases of plan stamping have underscored the serious nature and magnitude of the problem.<p>

Sealing engineering documents is not an end within itself.  Sealing instead implies that a process of responsible supervision has taken place or that an engineer personally performed the work.<p>

<b>New Format for Fundamentals of Engineering Exam and Principles &amp; Practice Exam</b><p>

The new format beginning this October for the Fundamentals of  Engineering  Examination still consists of a four-hour morning session and a four-hour afternoon session.  The morning exam will have 120 one-point questions that will be common to all disciplines;  the afternoon session will have 60 two-point questions in the following disciplines:  Chemical, Civil, Electrical, Industrial, Mechanical and general engineering.  Examinees will work all the questions in the morning session and only the questions in the afternoon from the discipline they have chosen.  A book containing sample questions may be purchased by calling the NCEES at 800/250-3196, extension 233. <p>

<b>Principles &amp; Practice Examination</b><p>

In the last P.E. Newsletter, it was announced that a "breadth and depth" examination will be implemented beginning in 1998 for the Chemical, Civil, Electrical, Industrial and Mechanical Principles and Practice Examinations;  however, Industrial engineering was listed in error.  The National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying specified in August that the new examination will be implemented no sooner than October of 1998 and that it will be evaluated during its creation.  The new examination format will be divided equally in testing the breadth and depth of knowledge.  <p>

The Texas board will be given a one-year notice of the details of the examination format prior to its implementation.  Additional details have not been released to the Texas board from the NCEES at this time. <p>

<b>Board Mourns Loss of Former Employees</b><p>

Funeral services were held on June 8, 1996 for Tommy Newton, P.E., an  assistant  to the executive director at the board from 1992 to 1995.<p>

Ken Wood, an investigator at the board from 1984 to 1992,  passed away on June 27, 1996.  The board and staff extend their deepest sympathy to the friends and family of these two men. <p>

<h3><a name="Board_Sponsors_Engineering_Ethics_Program">Board Sponsors Engineering Ethics Program</a></h3>

The Texas Engineering Practice Act gives the state engineering board the authority to establish standards of conduct for engineers.  Out of this power, the board implemented  a professional development program in 1989 at the Murdough Center for Engineering Professionalism at Texas Tech University in Lubbock.  The purpose behind the program is for the engineering profession to go beyond the technical requirements of protecting the health and safety of the public and consider the ethical aspects of the practice of engineering.  With the advice and assistance of the Industry Advisory Committee, the board has sponsored the development and dissemination of instructional materials, short courses, workshops and newsletters for 
engineering faculty.  To date, over 2,000 engineers have attended seminars and presentations based on engineering ethics.<p>

Examples of communication and the use of resources developed for the Professional Development Program are indicated in the following summarized list:  publication of  the "TexethicS" Newsletter; a correspondence course on ethics and professionalism (300 enrollments from 28 states);  engineering faculty workshops;  a workshop for Texas engineering deans and the Texas State Board of Registration;  and the NAFTA Forum on Engineering Practice.<p>

The hope of the board is that a higher level of ethical conduct will result and that widespread recognition of engineers as true professionals will continue. <p>

<h3><a name="Enforcement_Matters">Enforcement Matters</a></h3>

During the period Feb. 1, 1996, to July 1, 1996, the enforcement department conducted 428 inquiries;  292 of those were resolved by achieving voluntary compliance.  In addition, 29 Cease and Desist orders were signed by individuals found to be in violation of the Act and one injunctive suit was settled in district court in the boards favor.   Individuals that sign Consent Orders or Agreed Board Orders with the board neither admit nor deny the charges brought against them.  Since publication of the February 1996 P.E. Newsletter, the following actions have been taken: <p>

<b>Dr. Philip N. Buchanan, P.E.,</b> of Kemah  signed an Agreed Board Order for the suspension of his engineering license for two years.  If Buchanan meets board requirements, the  entire two-year suspension will be probated.    Buchanan had his license suspended for his alleged failure to conduct both a "before" and an "after" analysis of the conditions of pole foundations;  for his alleged failure to include the bending moment loads in calculations to determine the adequacy of a foundation design;  and for his alleged failure to use a mathematical model that accurately reflected the situation found in the field.  The terms of Buchanans probation require him to take an ethics course sponsored by the board through the Murdough Center for Engineering Professionalism at Texas Tech University in Lubbock.  If Buchanan does not complete the ethics course by June 19, 1997, the probation will be lifted and his license will be suspended until June 19, 1998.  Buchanan must also  provide the board with written reports at three-month intervals specifying the identity and location of the projects on which he worked and the type of engineering services performed during the probationary period. <p>

<b>Antoine J. Dib</b> of  Eden Prairie, Minn., had his license suspended for one year effective June 19, 1996,  based on the recommendation by the State Office of Administrative Hearings.  Dib failed to provide the board with a copy of his engineer seal imprint and failed to respond to the repeated requests by the board staff to submit a copy of the seal imprint.
 <p>

<b>J.F. Gouge, P.E.</b>, of  Houston signed a Consent Order for the suspension of his engineering license for two years effective April 17, 1996.  If  Gouge meets board requirements, the entire two-year period of his suspension will be probated.   Gouge had his license suspended for allegedly aiding and abetting the unlicensed practice of engineering by affixing his engineer seal to roof truss design drawings that were not completed by him or under his responsible supervision.   The terms of Gouge's probation require him to take an ethics course sponsored by the board through the Murdough Center for Engineering Professionalism at Texas Tech University in Lubbock and to provide the board with a written plan of action to prevent future occurrences.  If Gouge does not meet board requirements by Oct. 17, 1996, the probation will not be implemented and his license will be fully suspended until April 17, 1998.<p>

<b>Harry C. Harbin</b> of Shreveport, La., did not meet the terms of  his probation as last reported in the Feb. 1996 P.E. Newsletter;  therefore, his Texas license was suspended July 10, 1996, and will remain suspended through Jan. 10, 1997.<p>

<b>Mehmet Y. Ilter</b> of  Miami, Fla., signed a Consent Order in which he agreed to cease  practicing engineering in Texas effective April 17, 1996 for allegedly affixing his Texas engineer seal to truss design sheets that were not completed by him or were not completed under his direct supervision;  for allegedly affixing his Florida seal on Texas engineering plans;  and for allegedly using a rubber stamp replica of his signature on projects.   The  Consent Order states the board will refuse to renew his license.<p>

<b>John M. Kerr, Jr.</b>, of Fredericksburg was convicted in Kerr County District Court on July 25, 1996, of misrepresentation of being a Texas professional engineer, which is a criminal  offense.  Kerr was convicted of misrepresenting himself as a professional engineer, preparing engineered design plans for the Kerrville Bible Church, conducting an engineering inspection of a foundation system at 1150 Sidney Baker Road in Kerrville, and issuing an inspection report on which he affixed a fraudulent rendition of an engineer seal.  Although confinement was waived, Kerr was ordered to pay a fine and court costs totaling $500.<p>

<b>B. A. Martin</b> of Fort Worth had his engineering license revoked by the board based on a recommendation from the State Office of Administrative Hearings.  The board charged that Martin  failed  to properly inspect a residence;  prepared an engineering report with misleading information as to the structural integrity of a residence;  and failed to provide a rebuttal statement addressing these allegations.  The revocation became effective June 19, 1996.<p>

<b>Archie C. Nystel, P.E.</b>, of Abernathy signed a Consent Order for a formal reprimand for his alleged failure to provide adequate plans and pertinent information to complete proposed improvements for a water system in a professional and safe manner.  In the order, Nystel agreed to cease the practice of civil engineering,  including but not limited to all fresh and wastewater systems,  until he passes the civil engineering Principles &amp; Practice Examination.<p>

Amir H. Shekarchi of San Antonio signed an Agreed Board Order for the suspension of his engineering license for two years effective June 19, 1996.  If Shekarchi meets board requirements,  the last 18 months of his suspension will be probated.  Shekarchi had his license suspended for his alleged release of an engineering opinion that appears to be contrary to generally accepted engineering standards;  for his alleged failure to fully disclose the rationale for his conclusion of the design adequacy of a berm; and for his alleged utilization of unverified data from a non-registrant to certify that a house would remain unharmed during a 100-year flood.   The terms of Shekarchis probation require him to complete an ethics course sponsored by the board through the Murdough Center for Engineering Professionalism at Texas Tech University in Lubbock.  If  Shekarchi does not complete the ethics course by Dec. 19, 1996, the probation will not be implemented and his license will remain suspended until June 19, 1998.   Shekarchi must also provide the board with written reports at three-month intervals identifying the location of the projects worked on and the type of engineering services performed during the probationary period.<p>
<b>Robert H. Yeakey</b> of Dallas signed a Consent Order which was accepted by the board on  June 19,1996, for the suspension of his engineering license for two years with terms for probation effective Sept. 19, 1996, to June 19, 1998.  Yeakey had his license suspended for his alleged release of blank forms containing his professional engineers seal and signature to an unlicensed individual and for his alleged failure to provide responsible supervision over an engineering inspection of a home.  The terms 
of Yeakeys probation require him to take an ethics course sponsored by the board through the Murdough Center for Engineering Professionalism at Texas Tech University in Lubbock.  If he does not complete the ethics course by Dec. 19, 1996, the probationary period will be rescinded and Yeakeys license will be suspended until June 19, 1998.  Yeakey must also provide the board with written reports at three-month intervals identifying the location of the projects on which he worked and the type of engineering
 services performed during the probationary period.<p>

<b>How to file a complaint:</b><p>

<h3><a name="Board_Notes">Board Notes:</a></h3>

An engineering license allows Texas professional engineers to legally represent themselves to the general public as an engineer, offer consulting engineering services to private and public entities, and perform engineering design or construction on public works.  Licensed engineers must also adhere to the code of ethics and professionalism established by the board.  <p>

<b>License Renewal</b><p>

Engineers must renew their license annually if they wish to continue to practice professional engineering.  Renewal dates are staggered into quarters so that approximately one-fourth of the state's licensees will renew every three months.  Regardless of whether a renewal notice is received, each licensee is still responsible for license renewal.  Additional fees will be charged to engineers who renew late.  Renewal notices are sent out 30-45 days prior to the license expiration dates listed below.<p>

<b>Registration &amp; Examinations</b><p>

From  Jan.  1, 1996,  to July 31, 1996,  the board licensed 714 people.  This number includes persons passing the April  1996 Principles and Practice of Engineering (PE) examination.  The pass rate in Texas was 52% on the Principles and Practice Examination and 74% on the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Examination. <p>

<center><h1>Mailing Lists - List Services</h1></center>

A mailing list is a program that sends a single mail message to to many 
people at once. After you sign up on a mailing list, you will receive all 
the messages sent to that mailing list. Some mailing lists only receive one 
or two messages a day; others receive dozens. <P>

In some ways, a mailing list is like a magazine: everyone who subscribes 
gets the same thing. Imagine a mailing list as a magazine that has only one 
section -- letters to the editor -- and every recipient on the list is an 
"editor" in their own right! The magazine is published many times a day, 
each time someone sends in a letter. Some of the letters provide new 
information, while others are responses to previous letters.<P>

Before you sign up to be on a mailing list, be sure you are comfortable 
with your Email program. Your Email program is, in a sense, the filter 
through which all your interactions with the mailing list flow -- reading 
the messages that come to you and generating messages that will be sent to 
everyone on the mailing list. <P>

Most mailing list programs on the Internet automatically copy messages 
received at the list's mailing address to everyone on the list.  Some lists 
are moderated, meaning that someone screens every message sent to the 
mailing list address, and decides whether or not to send it on to the 
people on the mailing list.<P>

A few mailing lists offer digests, which are designed to prevent your 
mailbox from getting too cluttered.  A digest program combines all the 
letters sent to a mailing list during a specific period of time 
(for example, one day) and then mails out a single long letter.<P>

Almost every mailing list has two addresses, one specifically to request 
access onto and off of the list, and the other for receiving the 
mailmessages that will be distributed to everyone on the list. To get onto 
a mailing list, you send a message to the mailing list program requesting 
that your name be added. Note that you do <B>not</B> send a letter to the 
mailing list itself when you want to subscribe! The people reading the list 
do not want to know when you subscribe. This is a common mistake that 
novices make.<P>

There are many ways to get onto and off of a mailing list, depending on the 
kind of program used by the list.  Be sure to check the instructions for 
subscribing carefully, since some lists require subscription information to 
be formatted in a particular sequence. You should also learn how to 
unsubscribe, in case the mailing list is more active than you anticipated 
and you get inundated with too much mail.<P>

<B>INSTRUCTIONS</B><P>

<B>Subscribing To A LISTSERV:</B><P>

To send a subscription command to the LISTSERV via Email, send Email to the 
LISTSERV mailbox and type in the command as the first line in the body of 
the message.  You can enter additional commands if required, as long as 
you type each command on a separate line. You will get a reply via Email.<P>

To automatically subscribe to a LISTSERV, use this command:<P>

<B>subscribe listname your full name</B>

<hr>

<B>Example Of Subscribing To A LISTSERV:</B><P>


<B>To:</B> LISTSERV@VMTECMEX<br>
<B>Subject:</B> No subject needed<p>
On the first line of the body of the message enter:<br>
<B>subscribe MMEDIA-L john doe</B>

<hr>

<B>Example Of Unsubscribing From A LISTSERV:</B><P>

<B>To:</B> LISTSERV@VMTECMEX<br>
<B>Subject:</B> No subject needed<P>

On the first line of the body of the message enter:<br>
<B>unsubscribe MMEDIA-L </B>

<hr>

<B>Sending A Message To The LISTSERV:</B><P>

To send messages that you want published to a LISTSERV, send a regular 
Internet Email message to the LISTSERV address :<P>

<B>To:</B>  MMEDIA-L@VMTECMEX<br>
<B>Subject:</B> (the subject of your message)<br>
Body of Message:  Whatever you want posted on the list for everyone to 
read.

<hr>

<B>NOTE</B>: Some LISTSERVs have archived files that can be sent to you.  
The procedure is basically the same as used to subscribe except you use 
different instructions in the body of your message.  If a LISTSERV has this 
feature, you will be advised of the command(s) to send.  The command will 
likely begin with GET followed by the archive file name.

<hr>

There is a master list of LISTSERVs called the List of Lists. The following 
are examples taken from that List:

<hr>

<B>MMEDIA-L on LISTSERV@VMTECMEX</B><P>

The Multimedia discussion list has been opened in order to provide a forum 
to discuss this growing field in education and training.  It is a listserv 
list located at MMEDIA-L@VMTECMEX, please send your commands to 
LISTSERV@VMTECMEX.<P>

To subscrive to MMEDIA-L send mail to LISTSERV@VMTECMEX.BITNET
with the following command in the body or text of the mail:<P>

<title>MAIN Usenet News Groups Help</title>
</head>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">

<center><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC=main-s.gif></center>


<hr>

<center><h1>Usenet News Groups</h1></center>

Usenet news (sometimes called "net news") was one of the earliest features 
of the Internet to achieve widespread popularity, and it continues to be 
active and varied. In many ways, Usenet news is similar to mailing lists. 
The main practical difference is that, unlike mailing lists, news messages 
do not appear in your mailbox; instead, they are stored in an area on a host 
computer that can be accessed by using a news reading program. Also, 
depending upon the news group, the distribution can be wider and volume of 
news messages much greater. <P>

Usenet offers a panoply of "newsgroups" focusing on a variety of special 
interests. Topics range from cooking to biochemical engineering, with 
practically every professional interest and hobby represented in between.<P>

The general organization of Usenet is hierarchical, and each newsgroup name 
is based on this hierarchical structure.  At the highest level are general 
subject categories, such as "rec" for recreational activities, "comp" for 
computer-related topics, "sci" for other sciences, and many others. After 
the high-level general category is the second-line category; for example, 
"rec.games," "comp.unix," "sci.astrophysics" and so on. Following these 
indicators is the specific area of interest: "rec.games.chess," 
"comp.unix.bsd," and so on. <P>

Note that reading Usenet news can be a challenge at first. Unless you look 
through the new messages every day, it might be hard to follow the "thread" 
of a conversation. This is partially due to the way that news is distributed 
over the Internet. If you post a message to a newsgroup, some people may 
not see it for days, while others might see it within an hour. Thus the 
responses to your message might be widely staggered.  Also note that people 
can respond to messages sent to a news group via private e-mail.<P>

<H4><BLOCKQUOTE>If we are painstaking about this phase of our development, we will be amazed before we are half-way through. We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness. We will not regret the past, nor wish to shut the door on it. We will comprehend the word "serenity"
and we will know peace.<BR>No matter how far down the scale we have gone, we will see how our experience can benefit others. That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear. We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in others. Self-seeking will slip away. Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change. Fear of people and economic insecurity will leave us. We will intuitively know how to handle situations that used to baffle us. We will  suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could never do for ourselves.<BR>Are these extravagant promises? We think not. They are being fulfilled among us ...  sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly. They will always materialize if we work for them.</BLOCKQUOTE></H4></CENTER></td>

<BODY> <BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<H2>El Buen Samaritano's Financial Support Needs</H2>

<B>The Future<br>
	The future rests primarily on the generosity of individuals who care deeply their neighbors.</B> The government is funding less of the safety net, the poor consistently lose ground on the wealthy. We continue to work hard on behalf of the needy through service and advocacy. We want you to know what we are doing. We use the media and our in house publication <I>Nuestra Gente</I> (which translated means "Our Folks") to get the word out.

<P>

In the November 1996, the Baord of Directors, Staff and certain key volunteers expect to determine our needs for the next three to five years. A new facility is desparately needed to relieve over crowding and allow further expansion. Gifts of land or property to support this effort are being sought. This is a time of great hope and commitment to the future. We invite you to be a part of the future of EBS.<P>

If your church, community, business, group or civic organization would like to have a presentation of the work EBS does, or would like to receive our publication, please call Francisco Lopez or the Reverend Jaime Case at <!-- MailTo Tag -->
<A HREF="MAILTO:elbuen@aol.com">elbuen@aol.com</A> or (512) 441-7977 for a date. We care deeply about what we do and where our future lies.<P>

<B>Episcopal Church Support<br></B>
	El Buen Samaritano Episcopal Mission (EBS) is a social service ministry of the Episcopal Diocese of Texas mandated with "serving the poor, particularly the Hispanic, in South Austin" (Articles of Incorporation). As such a significant part of our funding comes from Diocesan institutions. Churches in the Austin Convocation were instrumental in providing the leadership and funding for the start up operations of EBS. Their continued support is also vital to our mission at EBS. We are also heavily supported by Episcopal lay and clergy who volunteer time and specialized talents to our programs, such as Hot Meals for the homeless, Women and Children's Clinic, and English Classes.<P>

<B>Other Religious Entities<br></B>
	Some of our support comes from United Methodist congregations and Jewish Temples as well as Baptist and Lutheran churches. Mostly these churches find EBS to be a good outlet for every Christian's call to serve God by serving our neighbors. Financial support has been limited from these churches.<P>

<B>Individuals<br></B>
	Individuals who give to the ministries programs on a monthly or yearly basis, through bequests and through our yearly fundraiser, the Cinco de Mayo Festival. This year we celebrate our tenth anniversary of service to Austin on May 4th, 1997 at Four Seasons Hotel from 6:00 to 10:00 p.m. $50 per person. A casual dress affair with a light supper, a brief presentation, in a beautiful setting and accompanied by beautiful music will be made to benefit the Family Health Clinic of EBS and the Development through Education Programs.<P>

	Memorial gifts are also made to EBS, and so are occasional gifts of thanksgiving. EBS depends heavily on such funds for its ability to react to the community's needs. These flexible funds allowed us in 1996 to launch a strong initiative in community and leadership development without having to search for start up grant money and without the delay that often accompanies that search and application process.<P>

<B>Grants<br></B>
	We apply for and receive small grants from corporations, private foundations and Civic group around Texas. These grants, in the range of $3,000 to 5,000, are often one time grants to begin new or  restructure or expand our existing programs. Among our grantors this year are: 3M Corporation, The Sheilds-Ayres Foundation, The Susan Vaughan Foundation, The Theodore Davis Trust, and the Junior League of Austin. We have no grants over $25,000.<P>

<B>Government Funds<br></B>
<B>	EBS receives no government funding.</B> The accounting and managerial overhead required for these funds has limited their appeal to us. In the current political climate of reduced funding, we are even less likely to pursue any governmental funding.<P>

<B>Fees<br></B>
	<B>All the EBS programs are free.</B> However, we do collect a small fee for the use of our clinic by the University of Texas School of Nursing for their Breast Cancer Screening Project. If the project were to lose its funding for the fee, we would still want them to continue providing this service to the community through our facilities.<P>

    <H1 ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Update for January 20th, 1997</B></H1>

    <P>Elizabeth received her bone marrow transplant this past Friday. For the three
       weeks prior to the transplant, she received an intense dose of chemotherapy and
       radiation to kill her bone-marrow. This is necessary to rid her
       body of the leukemia cells and make way for the donated marrow.
    </P>

    <P>Rebecca, Elizabeth's mom, says that Elizabeth's condition is too be expected at this point following
       her transplant. She is experiencing the effects of the intense chemotherapy and
       radiation, including nausea, throat and mouth sores, and radiation burns. Elizabeth
       is currently receiving medication for the pain.
    </P>

    <P>Big sister Loreal did a wonderful job donating marrow for her sister.
       She checked in to the same hospital as Elizabeth this past Wednesday, and
       the marrow was extracted on Friday morning during a 2 hour general-anesthesia
       procedure. Approximately 16 ounces of marrow was removed.
       Her family, friends and community are proud of her and inspired by her bravery.
    </P>

    <P>Loreal checked out of the hospital soon after, and spent Martin Luther King's 
       birthday at the local Mall before returning to school on Tuesday.
    </P>
    <P>The family wishes to thank all those who are donating to Elizabeth's
       <A HREF="http://www.cota.org">COTA</A> campaign. The family is
       seeking assistance to help offset the tremendous costs associated
       with a bone marrow transplant.

<H2>Divisions of Competition</H2>
Divisions have been made regardless of sex.  A skier is placed into the ability division 
that he or she has never completed (slalom) or best performance (trick &amp  jump) in a 
tournament for that year.  Skiers may elect to compete in a higher performance division 
than his/her best performance (but not in a lower division).<P>

<H3>Slalom Divisions</H3>
<H4>All Females/All Males:</H4>
Beginner (0 - 6 buoys at any speed.)<BR>

<P>
<H3>Changing Divisions</H3>
At any CASS tournament, if a skier accomplishes a performance that is into the next 
division, they will be re-classified in that division for the next tournament and for the rest 
of the tournaments for that year.<P>
<P>
All divisions will be frozen at the CASS Finals tournament.<P>
<P>
The End-of-Season Divisions will be frozen before the next-to-last tournament for 
those skiers who have skied four or more tournaments in their division.  (i.e. skiers will 
not be bumped out of their division for the last 2 tournaments)<P>
<CENTER><IMG WIDTH=100% SRC= "rope.gif"></CENTER>
<H2>CASS Scoring</H2>
<P>
The best four scores of each skier will be totaled to determine placement within each 
division/class.  Trophy(s) will be awarded in each division/class if at least one skier is 
entered.<P>
<P>
If a skier in a maximum speed group changes divisions during a CASS season and has 
skied at least 4 tournaments prior to Nationals, these scores will count toward the skiers 
original division end-of-season award.  If the skier then skis at least four tournaments in 
his/her new division after Nationals, these scores will count towards the skiers new 
division end of season awards.  Therefore, this skier can win awards in two divisions in 
one CASS skiing season.<P>
<P>
If a skier changing divisions does not have at least four tournaments prior to Nationals, 
but skis enough tournaments after the nationals to satisfy the four-score minimum 
requirement, then the scores can be combined. (Slalom only:  A skier going up in 
maximum speed will have 6 points added to each score skied at the lower speed.  A 
skier going down in maximum speed will have 6 buoys subtracted from each higher 
speed scored.)<P>
<P>
If a tie exists for the End-Of-Season Award, two trophies will be given.<P>
<P>
In events which have timing tolerances for boat speeds, wide tolerances are allowed for 
novice classes.<P>
<CENTER><IMG WIDTH=100% SRC= "rope.gif"></CENTER>
<H2>SLALOM RULES:</H2>
<H3>Slalom Pass</H3>
For the Beginner Class, the skier is not required to ski through the entrance gate.  All 
skiers, regardless of class, are required to ski through the exit gate to constitute a pass.  
If the skier did not miss any of the six buoys, the boat will make a turn and re-enter the 
course at a speed of 2 miles per hour faster.  Beginner class skiers are required to use 
the entrance gates on a return pass after the completion of a perfect pass.<P>
<P>
Scoring will be an accumulation of consecutive buoys referred to as points.  Scoring 
starts at 16 MPH for every skier.<P>
<H3>Slalom Boat Speeds</H3>
At Novice tournaments, 16 MPH is the lowest minimum starting speed for any 
division.<P>
<H3>Falls</H3>
Each Novice skier shall be given one free fall for each round of all CASS Novice 
tournaments. <P>
<CENTER><IMG WIDTH=100% SRC= "rope.gif"></CENTER>
<H2>TRICK RULES:</H2>
Both trick passes for Novice will be scored, but only the highest point value pass will be 
recorded.<P>
<CENTER><IMG WIDTH=100% SRC= "rope.gif"></CENTER>
<H2>JUMP RULES:</H2>
CASS scoring of jump will be based on the NOPS scoring system.  The NOPS score of 
the skiers best jump will be their CASS score for that tournament.<P>
<CENTER><IMG WIDTH=100% SRC= "rope.gif"></CENTER>
<H2>NOVICE JUMP:</H2>
<H3>Novice Jump Divisions</H3>
Beginner.<P>
Never jumped 45 feet.<BR>
Never jumped 60 feet.<BR>
Never jumped 75 feet.<BR>
75 feet and above compete Class C
<P>
<H3>Ramp Height</H3>
The ramp height for all Novice Jump shall be 5 feet.<P>
<H3>Boat Path</H3>
The boat path for the beginner and never jumped 45 feet groups must be between 
the ramp and the 45 foot boat guide.<P>
<H3>Boat Speed</H3>
The minimum boat speed for Novice Jump shall be 2O mph.  The maximum boat speed 
shall be 3O mph.  (The skier may not, however, select a boat speed greater than that 
permissible by AWSA rules for the skier's division as determined by age/sex.)<P>
<H3>Jumping Actions</H3>
Only two types of jumps will be allowed:  drag overs (mandatory for beginners) and 
quarter cuts.  Any novice jumper who attempts a 3/4 cut, double cut, or any alternative 
approach to the ramp other than those described below will not score a jump and will be 
DISQUALIFIED from the event for the remainder of the tournament.  Acceptable jumping 
actions are described as follows:<P>
<H4>Drag Overs:</H4>
	The skier makes his or her approach to the ramp by pulling out to the left of the 
	boat far enough in advance of the jump so as to be making no movement to the 
	left when his/her skis make contact with the jump surface and so that the skiers 
	speed while on the jump surface is not in excess of the boat speed.<P>
<H4>Quarter Cuts (a.k.a. Single Wake Cuts):</H4>
	The skier begins his or her approach to the ramp from a position no farther from 
	the ramp than the center of the boat path.<P>
<H3>Wide Triangles</H3>
For the purposes of novice jump, a wide triangle is considered to be greater than 10 
feet.<P>

<CENTER><IMG WIDTH=100% SRC= "rope.gif"></CENTER>
<P>The <FONT SIZE=4><B>Capital Area Water Ski Club (CAWSC)</B></FONT> was established in 1988 to further 
develop competitive skiing in the Austin area.  The coordination of CASS, membership 
drives, newsletter publication, tournament hostings, exhibit planning, promotional 
programs,  media coverage, and social events all fall under the operations of CAWSC.  
In 1994 &amp  1995, CAWSC also hosted the South Central Regions Junior 
Development Clinic and Tournament.  <P>
<P>
Our goal of bringing the Central Texas area into the limelight of National and 
International water skiing appears to be becoming a reality.  Each year more and more 
CAWSC members are recognized for their priceless contributions to all areas of 
competitive water skiing, as well as those members who have competed at both regional 
and national levels.  CAWSC members dedication to competitive skiing and its 
promotion has perpetuated the growth of competitive water skiing in Central Texas.<P>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG WIDTH=100% SRC= "rope.gif"></CENTER>
<P>
Formed in 1987 by Austin area skiers, the <B><FONT SIZE=4>Capital Area Summer Series 
(CASS)</FONT></B> set forth to promote competitive water skiing in a way in which <B>novice 
through advanced</B> skiers could compete successfully as they improve their skills.  
Beginners are encouraged to participate in clinics and novice tournaments.  Skiers are 
registered under their ability level which ranges from beginning competitors to national 
competitors.  Each skiers four best tournament performances from the CASS tour are 
combined to determine year end standings and awards for each ability level.  Skiers 
progress through the ability levels as their tournament performances improve.

<H1>FACT SHEET</H1>
</center>


<H3>WHAT IS MAIN?</H3>

The Metropolitan Austin Interactive Network (MAIN) seeks to promote community-network access to
information in the metropolitan area of Austin, Texas.<P>

MAIN is a non-profit corporation registered with the State of Texas, with filed formal Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.  It has received 501(c)(3) non-profit status from the Internal Revenue Service.<P>

<H3>WHO IS INVOLVED IN MAIN?</H3>

Public, academic, and private libraries, corporations, and individuals
support MAIN.  All the individuals currently working with MAIN are
doing so as volunteers.  The Board of Directors is as follows:<P>

<p>


<B>The following groups are currently supporting MAIN.</B><P>
<ul>
<li>3M Austin
<li>Advanced Micro Devices
<li>Applied Materials
<li>Austin Independent School District
<li>Austin Public Library
<li>Parachute Computing Services
<li>Sun Microsystems Computer Company
<li>Tech-Connected
<li>Texas Medical Association
<li>Turning Point Information Systems
<li>University of Texas at Austin

</ul>

<H3>WHAT KINDS OF INFORMATION DO COMMUNITY-ACCESS NETWORKS NORMALLY
MAKE AVAILABLE?</H3>

Community-access networks provide a wide variety of information
services.  Development meetings have generated the following
information ideas for services by MAIN, and these are being pursued by
MAIN's Information Resources Committee.  This list is intended to
suggest the kinds of information that could be supplied by MAIN.  The
list is not intended to set limits on types of information for MAIN,
and further suggestions will be welcomed.<P>
<ul>
<li>"Ask the Expert" (gardening, medical, legal, etc.)
<li>Adopt-A-School information
<li>Boy and Girl Scouts information
<li>Capital Metro schedules and maps
<li>Chamber of Commerce resources
<li>City Council agenda
<li>College course catalogs
<li>College registration information
<li>Community club newsletters
<li>Community events calendars
<li>Computer users support groups
<li>Environmental issues
<li>Fund-raising events schedules
<li>Homework assignments
<li>Homework hotlines
<li>Library catalogs
<li>Live music listings
<li>Movie reviews
<li>Neighborhood newsletters
<li>Parks Department (pool openings, softball schedules, etc.)
<li>PTAs and PTSAs
<li>Public Hearing schedules
<li>Real estate listings
<li>Road work in progress
<li>Sporting events

</ul>

MAIN wants to add to this list and to identify sources for these
various types of information.<P>

<H3>HAS ANYTHING LIKE MAIN BEEN ESTABLISHED ELSEWHERE?</H3>

Yes--in many places in the United States, Canada, Australia, and
elsewhere.  Community-access networks like MAIN are grass-roots
channels of communication and information sharing.  Popular examples
exist in such places as Cleveland, Ohio; Blacksburg, Virginia, with
the Electronic Village; Tallahassee, Florida; rural Montana; and
Cupertino and Santa Monica, California.  We have many experienced
systems to which to look for advice.  Other communities in Texas are
forming similar organizations, including:  Huntsville; SalsaNet, San
Antonio, North Texas State Free-Net, Dallas metroplex area; Rio Grande
Free-Net, El Paso area; and Civnet, Houston area.  A benchmarking
committee from MAIN spent considerable time examining similar systems.<P>

The Finance Committee and the Planning Committee are keeping in touch
with networks that have already started.<P>

<H3>HOW CAN I KEEP IN TOUCH WITH MAIN?</H3>


An Internet mail-list service called MAINLINE --
<A HREF="mailto:mainline@mail.tpoint.net">mainline@mail.tpoint.net</A> --- maintained by Turning Point Information Services is being used to post MAIN notices, announcements, etc.; to
subscribe, send an Email message addressed to <A HREF="mailto:mainline-request@tpoint.net">mainline-request@tpoint.net</A> 
with Subject "subscribe," "help," "unsubscribe," etc. (no quotes). <p>

<blink><b>NOTICE:</b></blink>  If your Email address is different than the one being used with your Web browser, <b>DO NOT</b> use the above feature to subscribe or post to mainline.  Subscribe and post from your regular Email service.<p>


<H3>IS MAIN A FREE-NET?</H3>

MAIN is not a Free-Net.  But MAIN definitely IS committed to pursuing
some of the important concepts associated with Free-Nets, such as the
concept of a community's sharing information and the concept of making
information accessible to the entire community.  "Free-Net" is a
trademarked term referring to an organization formally affiliated with
NPTN, the National Public Telecomputing Network.  MAIN has chosen to
be independent of such affiliations.  (<A HREF="http://www.austinfree.net/">Austin Free-Net</A>,
whose emphasis is on providing access to the Internet, is affiliated
with NPTN.  MAIN's goals are complementary to those of AFN, and MAIN
looks forward to working with AFN as AFN develops.)<P>

<H3>IS MAIN A BULLETIN-BOARD SYSTEM?</H3>

MAIN is like a computer bulletin-board system (or BBS) in that it will
provide a single computer interface to a variety of information
resources.  MAIN is intended to be an umbrella organization that makes
arrangements with a wide variety of agencies in order to facilitate
public access to reliable, timely information.  MAIN hopes to utilize
voluntary efforts from other agencies and to build itself through
cooperation, much like a community barn-raising of the past where the
modest efforts of many persons jointly produce a tangible result far
surpassing the capabilities of any one individual.  In this case, the
result will be access to information sharing for all community members
and visitors.<P>

<H3>MUST PEOPLE PAY TO USE MAIN?</H3>

MAIN's policy is that anyone should be able to use MAIN's basic
information-sharing services at no charge.  As MAIN grows, some
services may be added that will be expensive enough and valuable
enough that a fee may be charged; a possible example is access to the
Internet.  The intent is that such fees would recover costs.  MAIN is 
a public, not-for-profit organization.<P>

<H3>WHAT DO YOU GET IF YOU JOIN MAIN?</H3>

In order to support the operations of the organization, MAIN has
developed a membership-fee structure that allows both individuals and
organizations to join.  MAIN members in good standing vote to elect
the officers of the organization and participate in determining the
future directions of MAIN.  Annual membership dues are as follows:<P>

<pre>
Individual (1 vote)                Corporate (up to 3 votes)

<CENTER><H1>CASS Team Scoring</H1></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG WIDTH=100% SRC= "rope.gif"></CENTER><P>
The CASS team concept is intended to bring the camaraderie of collegiate water skiing to CASS's traditional water 
ski tournaments.  Similar to collegiate scoring, the scoring of CASS teams is such that each team member is able 
to contribute to the success of the team, no matter their skill level.<P>
<P>
CASS team scoring goes one step further in that the absolute best skier does not necessarily contribute the most 
to the team's score; each skier is scored relative to the past performances, so even a beginner can win an event 
and contribute the maximum number of points to their team's score.<P>
<P>
All three events are included in CASS team scoring.  Care has been taken to insure that having or not having a 
skier in each event will not hurt the team's score.<P>
<P>
<P>
<H3>Team selection:</H3>
<P>
New teams will be chosen each ski season.  The number (and therefore the size) of the teams is not fixed; 
whatever seems to work out best should be used.<P>
<P>
Before the general membership meeting, all CASS members who skied in the previous CASS season will be 
assigned to teams, regardless of whether they have renewed their membership.  Additionally, any new members 
will be assigned to teams (since we probably won't know until tournament time which ones are tournaments skiers 
and which aren't, we go ahead and assign all of them to teams).<P>
<P>
Assignment of existing CASS member to teams is as follows.  With N teams, the N best slalom skiers (the ones in 
38 off, then 35 off, etc. until there are N skiers) are assigned one to each team via a random drawing.  Then, the 
next N best slalom skiers are assigned similarly, then the next N, etc., until all the slalom skiers have been 
assigned to teams.  Then, trickers who did not slalom are assigned in the same fashion, then jumpers who did not 
slalom or trick.<P>
<P>
New members are assigned at random to the N teams.  As new groups of skiers are assigned to teams (such as 
non-slaloming trickers), the first assignment of skiers needs to equal out the number of skiers on each team before 
a full set of N skiers is assigned at random.<P>
<P>
The initial team assignments should be announced at the general membership meeting.<P>
<P>
At the first tournament, if there is someone on any team that is not a CASS member (i.e. a member from last year 
who has not renewed), they will be removed from their team.<P>
<P>
After the initial team assignment, new members who join CASS (or members who renew after being removed from 
their team) will be assigned at random to the teams, with preference being given to the team with the least number 
of skiers.<P>
<P>
The hope is that teams will be very dynamic, with a different group of skiers on the teams each year.<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENER><H3>Scoring:</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Individual scoring of slalom, trick, and jump is done as specified by the existing CASS scoring rules.  These 
individual scores are then used to determine the team's score.<P>
<P>
Each individual's past 10 scores (in each event) at a CASS tournament are kept, with the average of those 10 
scores being that skier's typical score.  In addition, the skier's personal best in each event is also tracked.  For 
skiers who have never skied in a CASS tournament, their score in their first CASS tournament will also be their 
typical score for that tournament (andwill become their personal best, but they will not receive the personal best 
points described below).<P>
<P>
For each event at a CASS tournament, each skier's typical score in that event is subtracted from their actual 
score in that event (resulting in a positive number if the skier did better than normal, and a negative number if they 
did worse than normal).<P>
<P>
Those numbers are then sorted, largest to smallest.  The skier with the largest number (which is the skier who 
skied best relative to their typical score) is the winner of that event, for the purposes of team scoring.  The skier 
with the smallest number (who did worst relative to their typical score) is in last place for that event.<P>
<P>
The skiers (all of them, regardless of class C/N or their speed or line length) are then ranked first through last, 
based on the sorted list of numbers.  The skier in first place receives 1000 points for their team, the skier in last 
place receives 1 point for their team, and the skiers in between receive a weighted average of 1 and 1000 (i.e. if 
there are 3 skiers, first gets 1000 points, second gets 500.5 points, and third gets 1 point).  <P>
<P>
This is done identically for each of the three events in the tournaments.  Each skier's points from each tournament 
counts toward the team's score, no skiers points are thrown out.<P>
<P>
If a skier's performance is a personal best, the team is awarded 1000 bonus points, regardless of that skier's 
placement in the event.  This provides a way to greatly improve the team's score when a member skies 
exceptionally well.<P>
<P>
In addition to keeping track of the team score, the number of individual scores which make up the team score is 
also tracked. <P>
<P>
Then, a team's score is determined by the number of points it has received, divided by the number of individual 
scores which counted towards the team score.  Therefore, a team's score will typically be in the range of 0 to 1000 
(unless several PBs were skied by a team in the first tournament).<P>
<P>
By dividing the team score by the number of individual scores, the team's score becomes the average of the points 
received by each of its members in each event in each tournament that they have skied.  Therefore, a team without 
any jumpers (as an example) will not be penalized by that fact.<P>
<P>
The team with the highest score after the scores from CASS finals have been included is the winning team.  <P>

<H2>An Overview of El Buen Samaritano Center</H2>
<FONT SIZE=4><I>1919 S. First St., Austin, TX 78704<BR>
512/441-7977</I></FONT>
<B><P>For a brief history of EBS and the demographics of our primary service area, click <!-- Link Tag -->
<A HREF="history.html">here</A>.<br></B><HR>

<H3>In a Perfect World...</H3>
<IMG Align=Right SRC="images/logo.jpg">
	In a perfect world, there would be no poverty to keep the Hernandez family from paying the rent, no need for Irma or James to learn job skills, no need for the area around South Central Austin to be improved. Children such as Sharon would not go to bed hungry, and young women like 17-year-old Angie would not be alone and pregnant. We would all speak a language Roberto could understand, and Jessie would find his job meaningful and his paycheck substantial. Most importantly, all these neighbors would work together.<P>

	But The Good Samaritan (El Buen Samaritano) who helped his neighbor so many centuries ago in another land is still needed today, here in Austin, particularly in South Central Austin. This area is one marked by high numbers of teen pregnancies, low-income families, growing student drop-out rates and numerous incidences of crime and violence. Meadowbrook Housing Project, one of the most violent-prone housing units in the city, also is located in the area. <P>


<H3>The Good Samaritan at Work</H3>

	Deep in the heart of this neighborhood stands El Buen Samaritano Episcopal Center. Sharing space with a small mission church, El Buen Samaritano opens its doors to more than 5,500 low-income and indigent individuals a year. EBS has grown in just seven years since it was founded in 1987 from a small program providing food to the poor to a multi-faceted Family Center offering a variety of health and human service programs. The driving philosophy underlying its programs is to offer a helping hand, not a hand-out. Dignity of the individual and concern for neighbors are guiding principles of El Buen Samaritano.<P>

	The people who seek assistance are in general the "working poor," those employed individuals who live on the economic edge but who do not qualify for public assistance. According to a United Way/Capital Area study, 40 percent of Austin's poor are working poor, many of whom find it difficult to make ends meet, for whom any unexpected expense, particularly medical, creates a crisis situation. In addition, a significant percentage of the area's children live in single-parent families, thus complicating an already critical economic condition.  <P>


<H3>Austin Neighbors in Need</H3>

	According to the current Census report, the area of South Austin immediately surrounding El Buen Samaritano is a largely residential area with a population of 27,193, of whom 57 percent are Hispanic. Nearly 10 percent of all households in the area are headed by a single female with poverty-level income. And the area's largest, fastest growing population segment is young, unwed mothers with children. Adding to the problems over the last 10 years has been a marked increase in crime, vandalism, gang- and drug-related activity. Now, soaring school drop-out rates and problems related to unemployment and pregnancy make the area's chronic poverty more widespread. The language barrier poses a problem for residents seeking or even knowing about assistance. Many people in the area represent the second or third generation of their families who have lived in the United States, but for whom Spanish continues to be the primary language. According to the Comprehensive Community Needs Assessment for Austin/Travis County, between 13 and 20 percent of these adults speak English poorly or not at all. In addition, a lack of education has been identified as one of the biggest local problems. According to a study by Andrew A. Dunks, "Low morale and lack of trust prevent most of the needy of this area from seeking what help is available."<P>


<H3>A Center for Help</H3>

	<I>Much of the help that is available in this area of the city is channeled through El Buen Samaritano Episcopal Center, touching three distinct areas of need:</I> <BR>
<UL><LI> Health Services for Women and Their Families
<LI> Emergency and Relief Aid
<LI> Communal Development
</UL>

<P>

<B>Health Services for Women and Their Families</B><BR>

	The Family Health Center offers prevention-oriented health care services through three evening clinics, one afternoon clinic and several specialized health care services each week. The focus of the Clinic is caring for low-income women and their families. <P>

	The Pediatric Clinic on Tuesday nights stresses well-baby exams, nutrition, immunizations, and family wellness. More than 90 children a month, from birth through high school age, receive treatment. Pregnancy testing on Wednesday evenings includes initial consultation and first examinations for expectant women. The Prenatal and Well Woman Clinic on Thursday evenings offers pre-natal care, family planning and counseling, and well-woman exams. More than 150 women are served by these clinic sessions monthly. <P>

	The Family Residency Clinic Thursday afternoons, run in conjunction with the Central Texas Medical Foundation, offers health care for men, women and children. In addition, breast cancer screening is conducted through the University of Texas School of Nursing.<P>

	Additional activities of the Clinic include preventive and educational health classes; counseling; home visits; job referrals and placements, WIC eligibility studies, help with school problems, and referrals to other agencies in the community.<P>

	A special service of the Clinic is the Mother-to-Mother program in which pregnant women who are alone are matched with women volunteer. Each volunteer may spend up to a year with a client, offering support and information both during pregnancy and after the baby is born. A volunteer also may become a birth coach, assisting the woman through delivery at the hospital. <P>



	The medical care is provided by a volunteer staff of 12 doctors and another 25 medical personnel who put in long hours after a hard day at their own offices. The Clinic Director and a clinical social worker direct the activities of the Clinic. 	All services are offered on a sliding scale fee, but fewer than 2 percent of the patients are able to pay even this minimal fee. All services are offered without regard to religion, national origin or ability to pay.<P>

	The number of people who visit El Buen Samaritano's Family Clinic approaches 20 percent of the number who visit the outpatient clinic operated by city-owned Brackenridge Hospital.<P>

<B>Emergency and Relief Aid</B><BR>

	The second area of service includes El Buen Samaritano's emergency and relief aid through its Hot Meals, Food Pantry, Children's Clothing Closet, and other emergency assistance. The EBS Food Pantry is open three afternoons a week and at any other time there is an emergency referral from other community agencies. The Food Pantry serves approximately 100 families each month, providing basic grocery items as well as information concerning other services of the Center. Bags of groceries also are taken to home-bound people who also receive hot meals delivered by EBS volunteers.<P>

	These groceries come from two major sources: Food purchased at the Capital Area Food Bank and food donated through citywide drives. A typical bag of groceries from the Food Pantry includes cereal, powdered milk, tuna, vegetables, fruit, peanut butter, soup, rice, dried beans, bread, and soap. Other items when available may include baby food, margarine, cheese, flour, pasta, spaghetti sauce, frozen meats, fresh produce, snack foods and condiments. The minimum value is estimated at $10 a bag.<P>

	Individual hot meals are served Tuesdays at noon and Sunday evenings. The Tuesday meals are served predominantly to families, while the Sunday dinner draws a large group of homeless people, since few other programs serve hot meals at that time. Information on other services available in the community also is provided to those who come to the Center. The meals are provided by Austin area church members on a rotating basis. Church groups purchase and prepare the food, deliver it to the Center, serve and clean up. At the same time, these volunteers provide good conversation and a listening ear to those who come to eat.<P>

	The Children's Clothing Closet is the only distribution center in Austin dedicated to clothes for youngsters. In addition, the Closet also offers infant and children's furniture, diapers, car seats on loan and other emergency supplies needed by families with children.<P>


<B>Communal Development</B><BR>

	Individual and community development comprises the third area of service offered by El Buen Samaritano. High on the list is assisting people, especially women, become better educated. The Center offers four levels of English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) classes, from the beginning level up through preparation for GED tests. Along the way, students, who range in age from teens to grandmothers in their 60s, are given practical advice on such things as finding the best bargains, using coupons, avoiding potential scams, and developing job-hunting skills. Children are always welcome in the classes, and many of the youngsters begin to understand English along with their parents or grandparents.<P>

	ESL classes are offered Monday and Friday mornings and again on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday evenings.<P>


<H3>The Heart of El Buen Samaritano</H3>
	At the center of the services of El Buen Samaritano are the more than 400 volunteers who offers their time and talent to their neighbors in South Austin. These volunteers teach classes, prepare meals, donate food and clothing, visit the homebound, offer personal support, and provide expert services including medical care. Youth groups from throughout the state often offer a week of their time at the Center to paint, make repairs and help organize the various areas including the Food Pantry and Kitchen. Some provide bilingual support. Others share creative talents. All the volunteers provide hundreds of hours of service to the Center's clients. El Buen Samaritano achieves extremely high levels of efficiency and service because of such broad commitment. It is estimated that for every $1 spent, El Buen Samaritano returns $3 in goods and services to the community it serves.<P>


<H3>Funding the Future</H3>
	From the moment it was opened to the present, El Buen Samaritano has benefitted from the spirit of philanthropy in the people who care deeply about their town and their neighbors.<P>

	This spirit of philanthropy in the supporters of El Buen Samaritano has enabled the Center expand in the scope and quality of its programs. This commitment has been demonstrated by the support of a number of foundations and groups including the Austin Community Foundation, the National Episcopal Church Center, the statewide Episcopal Foundation, the March of Dimes, Lola Wright Foundation, LCRA Employees Charities, Presiding Bishop's Fund, and the Trinity Grants of New York.<P>

	A significant element of financial support comes from Episcopal churches in the Austin area and from the Episcopal Diocese of Texas. <P>

	As the Center has grown, the Board of Directors has sought ways to underwrite the costs of ever-increasing services. The Good Samaritan Fund was established in 1994 to provide a comprehensive fund-development program providing the resources necessary to sustain current programs and facilities of El Buen Samaritano while planning for services that will take us into the 21st Century. This Fund is supported by individuals, families, churches, organizations, and corporations who have a deep concern for families in need. Now in 1995, the Fund is embarking on a challenging three-year fund-development program, "Partners in Caring." Partnership offers an opportunity to strengthen families, to build a better safety net for those who fall through the gaps in traditional care, to provide vital medical services, and to extend a hand to our neighbors. <P>

	A major financial plan to raise $1 million over the next three years will provide the support necessary to implement more fully the long-range plan of the EBS Board of Directors. <P>

	The current operations of the Center require approximately $325,000 annually from individuals, churches, corporations, foundations and the Austin community. These sources of income must grow to allow El Buen Samaritano to sustain its current programs and to provide for future expansion.

<H3>A Better Life</H3>
	What both volunteers and staff at El Buen Samaritano hope for is a better life for those who knock at our door. Much like the one Julia is now enjoying. Julia first appeared at the Family Health Clinic, pregnant with her third child. After the baby was born, Julia returned to visit the Pediatric Clinic and began to learn more about the services of El Buen Samaritano. She joined a woman's discussion group and eventually became its leader. She first received clothes from the Children's Clothing Closet and stayed to organize it and run it as a volunteer.  Julia also decided to get her high school equivalency certificate and enrolled in one of the EBS classes. Since she first knocked at the door, Julia has been named one of the "Five Who Care" volunteers by KVUE, Channel 24, sent to Washington, D.C., as a representative volunteer from Austin, successfully completed her GED requirements and has enrolled in Austin Community College, looking at a career in social service work.<p>

<center><h1>What are Web Raising Events?</h1></center>

In the tradition of the old barn raising parties of years gone by, web raising events bring
together a combination of the best and the brightest with the new and eager to develop
documents for publishing on MAIN's Web service.<p>

When the call goes out, many of the highest paid, best known Internet developers give of
their time and expertise to MAIN and our community.<p>

We partner new, less experienced, volunteers with seasoned veterans and spend a day
developing materials for publishing on MAIN.  This is a great way to learn from the best
how this exciting form of publishing is done.<p>

While the goal is to produce mountains of new material for MAIN, its not all work and
no play.  There is plenty of socializing and the refreshment table always has a few
gathered around it.  By the end of the day, we have accomplished much and had a great
time doing it.<p>

Below are some snap shots of the Web Raising event held on October 21, 1995.<br>

          responsibilities of Board membership if elected.  The

<CENTER><h3>ARTICLE VIII.  Indemnification</h3></CENTER>
 
<b>A.   Indemnification</b> -- Each person who was or is made a party or
is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action,
suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or
investigative (hereinafter, a "proceeding"), by reason of the
fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal
representative, is or was a director or officer of the
organization, or while a director of the organization is or was
serving at the request of the organization as a director,
officer, trustee, employee, or agent of another corporation,
trust, or other incorporated or unincorporated enterprise,
whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action or
inaction in an official capacity as a director, officer, trustee,
employee, or agent shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
organization to the fullest extent authorized by the Texas
Non-Profit Corporation Act as the same exists or may hereafter be
amended.  All such persons shall be indemnified and held harmless
by the organization against all expense, liability, and loss
(including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, taxes, or
penalties, and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement)
reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection with
the indemnified action or inaction, and such indemnification
shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or
officer and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs,
executors, and administrators.<P>
 
<b>B.   Payment</b> -- The right to indemnification conferred in this
Article shall be a contract right and shall include the right to
be paid by the organization the expenses incurred in defending
any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition;
provided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by
a director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or
officer of the organization in advance of the final disposition
of a proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the
organization of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director
or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall
ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not
entitled to be indemnified under this Article or otherwise.  The
organization may, by action of its Board of Directors, provide
indemnification and advance expenses to employees and agents of
the organization and others permitted to be indemnified by the
Texas Non-Profit Corporation Act with the same scope and effect
as the foregoing indemnification and advancement of expenses of
directors and officers.<P>
 
<b>C.   Defense against Claims</b> -- If a valid claim pursuant to the
above provisions of the Article is not paid in full by the
organization within ninety (90) days after a written claim has
been received by the organization, the claimant may at any time
thereafter bring suit against the organization to recover the
unpaid amount of the claim, and, if successful in whole or in
part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid the expense of
prosecuting such claim.  It shall be a defense to any such action
(other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses
incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final
disposition where the required undertaking, if any, is required,
has been tendered to the organization) that the claimant has not
met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the
Texas Non-Profit Corporation Act for the organization to
indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of
proving such defense shall be on the organization.  Neither the
failure of the organization (including its Board of Directors or
independent legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to
the commencement of such action that indemnification of the
claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met
the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Texas
Non-Profit Corporation Act, nor an actual determination by the
organization (including its Board of Directors or independent
legal counsel) that the claimant has not met such applicable
standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a
presumption that the claimant has not met the
applicable standard of conduct.<P>
 
<b>D.   Non-Exclusivity</b> -- The right to indemnification and the
payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance
of its final disposition conferred in this Article shall not be
exclusive of any other right which any person may have or
hereafter acquire under any statute, the common law, a provision
of the organization's Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws,
agreement, or disinterested directors, or otherwise. <P>

<b>E.   Insurance </b>-- The organization may maintain insurance, at its
expense, or provide alternative financial arrangements including
but not limited to providing a trust, letter of credit, or
self-insurance to protect itself and any director, officer,
trustee, employee, or agent of the organization or another
venture, trust, or other incorporated enterprise against any such
expense, liability, or loss, whether or not the organization
would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability, or loss under the Texas Non- Profit
Corporation Act.


 
<CENTER><h3>ARTICLE IX.  General</h3></CENTER>
 
<b>A.   Non-Profit</b> -- The organization may not engage in any
activity of a commercial nature that would violate its status as
a non-profit organization as defined in existing laws.  The
organization may not engage in any partisan political activity.<P>
 
<b>B.   Limitations of Debate</b> -- Every member of the organization
shall be entitled to speak at membership meetings on any subject
brought before the organization for consideration.  Every member
of the Board of Directors shall be entitled to speak at any Board
of Directors meeting on any subject brought before the Board. 
The Chairperson of any meeting shall, at his or her sole
discretion, have the power to limit debates.  <P>

<b>C.   Conduct of Meetings</b> -- Meetings shall be conducted according
to Robert's Rules of Order.<P>
 
<b>D.   Nondiscrimination</b> -- The organization shall not discriminate
in employment, membership, or registered use against any person
on the basis of race, color, gender, religion, creed, age,
disability, or sexual preference.



<CENTER><h3>ARTICLE X.  Dissolution</h3></CENTER>
 
<b>A.   Non-Profit</b> -- This organization is an educational and
information corporation not operated, and not to be operated, for

entitled to receive any pecuniary profit from the operation of
this organization except for reasonable compensation for serving
in effecting its purpose.<P>
 
<b>B.   Distribution of Assets</b> -- Upon dissolution or other
termination of the organization, no part of the property of the
corporation, or any of the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed

liability of the organization, and then to another non-profit
education or informational organization whose objectives are
deemed by the Board of Directors to be harmonious with the
organization and objectives of MAIN. 



<CENTER><h3>ARTICLE XI.  Amendments</h3></CENTER>
 
<b>A.   Vote</b> -- Any portion of these Bylaws may be amended by a
majority of the Board of Directors and a majority of the voting
members of the organization who cast ballots.<P>

<b>B.   Notification</b> -- Any amendment to these Bylaws requires that
an amended copy be filed with the Texas Secretary of State and
with the U.S.  Internal Revenue Service to assure continued
qualification of the organization as a bona-fide non-profit
organization for tax purposes.<P>

<h1>Vision Statement</h1>

</CENTER>

<H3>1. MISSION</H3>

     The Metropolitan Austin Interactive Network (MAIN) is a 
non-profit organization whose mission is to establish and operate
efficiently a community-access computer network.  The purpose of
this network is information sharing and communication among the
people and governmental, educational, commercial, cultural,
religious, and civic organizations, in order to enhance lives and
make the best use of community resources.<P>


<H3>2. PROBLEM</H3>

     Available to the resident of a community like the
metropolitan Austin area are a huge variety of resources and
activities.  The problem is the difficulty of learning about the
availability of these resources and activities.  As a
community-access network, MAIN will provide a central source of
information about such activities and resources, and could itself
provide much information directly.  MAIN will, further,
facilitate two-way communication among organizations and
individuals in the metropolitan Austin area, and it will do so
unobtrusively, at times chosen by and convenient to the users.<P>


<H3>3.  NEED</H3>

     Two salient characteristics of the modern world are its 
ever-increasing supply of information and the ever-increasing
complexity in means of access to information.   These
characteristics present problems that residents of the
metropolitan Austin area encounter daily.  The founders of MAIN
believe that these residents can be aided by the establishment of
a network, MAIN, whose primary purposes are:<P>

     <B>3.1</B>  To provide a source of information that is relevant to
local and regional interests and concerns, is in electronic form,
and is provided and updated by governmental, educational,
commercial, cultural, religious, and civic organizations;<P>

     <B>3.2</B>  To provide a means of communication between the
aforementioned providers of information and the residents of the
metropolitan Austin area, and among the residents of the
metropolitan Austin area.<P>

     Every day in the metropolitan Austin area there are meetings
on many topics in many diverse fields of interest, and there are
educational, business, social, theatrical, musical, and athletic
activities (to name just a few types).<P>  
     
     In the metropolitan Austin area are located numerous
libraries--public, school, and academic--that are open to the
public, and there are many more libraries and information
centers, in businesses, professional firms, and government
agencies (city, county, state, and Federal)  whose information
resources may be available to the public in appropriate
circumstances.  There are many services available to the public
from governmental, commercial, and private organizations and
individuals.  And these are by no means all the examples that
could be mentioned of activities and resources of potential
interest to residents of the metropolitan Austin area.<P>

     Through MAIN, organizations and agencies in the community
will be able to avoid trying to develop and maintain their own
expensive, single-purpose telecommunication services.   Instead,
these organizations and agencies will join together to provide
their information services as part of a single, cost-effective,
sophisticated, multi-line computer facility.  Users will not have
to search through telephone directories to try to find their way
among numerous sources of information, covering areas as diverse
as law, medicine, education, performing arts, science, and
government.  A potential future benefit of MAIN is the provision
of access to the Internet.<P> 

     It is especially important that the residents of the
metropolitan Austin area, which has become one of the foremost
centers for computers and related technology in the world, be
able to use modern, computer-based means of accessing public
information.<P>
    

<H3>4. WHO WILL BE ABLE TO USE MAIN?</H3>

     MAIN will be designed to be used by the people of the
metropolitan Austin area, as individuals and as persons working
together in governmental agencies, in educational and religious
institutions, and in civic, cultural, and commercial
organizations.  By dialing into a single telephone number,
members of the community will have a connection to information
and interaction with any of the participating organizations.  
MAIN will serve as an electronic community center, public square,
and information fair.<P>
     With respect to costs to the public, MAIN will have two (or
more) levels of services.  Primary services, which we expect to
include the great majority of the uses of MAIN, will be provided
free.  Specifically, the free services will include dial-up
access by the public to information concerning governmental
agencies and their activities; civic, cultural, and religious
organizations and their activities; educational institutions and
their activities; and community-oriented public services and
activities of commercial organizations.<P>  

     Certain special services (e.g., provision of access to the
Internet, and provision of long-term electronic storage space)
may be offered for fees.  The guidelines in establishing such
services and determining fees for them will include the goal of
keeping the fees as low as possible consistent with the need for
MAIN to recover the actual costs for such special services.<P>


<H3>5. GOVERNANCE</H3>

     MAIN will be a non-profit, tax-deductible organization. 
Classification by the Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3)
organization under the IRS Code has been sought.   MAIN is
governed by a Board of Directors, who are elected by the members
and users.<P>

     MAIN will also have an Advisory Council made up of
representatives from a variety of participating organizations and
from the general public.<P>


<H3>6.  COSTS AND FUNDING
</H3>
     Costs associated with building MAIN and maintaining its
primary services will be relatively modest.  It is confidently
expected that these costs will be covered through public and
private grants and donations, and through other fund-raising
methods that have proven successful for other community-service
organizations, including voluntary membership contributions,
community donations, financial support from information providers
when possible, and in-kind support from local computer companies.<P>

     The costs will include:  (1) purchase of the necessary
computer hardware and software, (2) the maintenance and updating
of this hardware and software, (3) the rental of telephone lines,
and (4) the wages and salaries of a small number of employees who
will be responsible for the day-to-day operations and upkeep of
the equipment and software.  Though we believe that it is
important that MAIN not have to rely solely on volunteers for the
technical operations of a service that must be quickly responsive
to its users, the tasks of providing information to MAIN and
keeping this information up to date will be carried out almost
entirely by the organizations that originate the information and
by volunteers.<P>

<H1>Public and Board Meetings</H1>


<h3>Public Meetings</h3></center>

Public meetings are open to all who are interested in MAIN and its
activities.  MAIN will holds its public meetings the second
Thursday of each month from 6:30pm till around 8:00pm. The meeting
<A HREF="/meetings.htm">location</A> may change each month.

<center><h3>Board Meetings</h3></center>

Board meetings are held regularly and are open to all who want to attend.  Unless otherwise announced, Board meetings are held at the Austin Independent School District (AISD) Offices, 1111 W. 6th Street, Suite C-200. In addition, the Board tries to eat together prior to meeting, particularly if the meeting is an evening session.  Currently, there is no set day of the month for Board meetings, but we usually meet prior to the public meetings.<p>

<center><h3>Annual Meetings</h3></center>

An annual meeting is held to bring the community, contributors, and MAIN volunteers together for a review and celibration of MAIN's accomplishments.  Details for the next annual meeting are in the planning stage.<p>


<center><h3>Web Raising Events</h3></center>

In the tradition of the old barn raising parties of years gone by, web raising events bring
together a combination of the best and the brightest with the new and eager to develop
documents for publishing on MAIN's Web service.  <p>

When the call goes out, many of the highest paid, best known Internet developers give of
their time and expertise to MAIN and our community.<p>

We partner new, less experienced, volunteers with seasoned veterans and spend a day
developing materials for publishing on MAIN. This is a great way to learn from the best
how this exciting form of publishing is done.<p>

While the goal is to produce mountains of new material for MAIN, its not all work and no
play. There is plenty of socializing and the refreshment table always has a few gathered
around it. By the end of the day, we have accomplished much and had a great time doing it.<p>

Web Raisings are held once a quarter, but we expect they will be held more often as the organization grows.<p>

<h3><A NAME="5.0 Access to Information [to be added]">5.0 Access to Information [to be added]</A></h3>


<h3><A NAME="6.0 Volunteerism">6.0 Volunteerism</A></h3>


<b>6.1 General:</b>  In order to encourage the donation of time to MAIN for
the accomplishment of specific tasks, it is the policy of MAIN to
allow prospective members to donate time to MAIN in order to qualify
themselves as members, although membership ordinarily is accomplished
through the payment of monetary dues.  Membership gained via
volunteerism rather than paying dues shall be full membership with all
rights and privileges appertaining thereto.<p>

<b>6.2 Policy Specifications:</b><p>

<b>6.2.1</b> Time donated to MAIN for the purpose of qualifying a person as a
member of MAIN will be valued according to the level of skills
required for the services performed for MAIN.  For this purpose, three
levels of skill are distinguished.  [It is important to emphasize that
in the evaluation of time being donated, the skills belong to the work
being done, not to the volunteer.  For example, a Certified Public
Accountant who spends two hours stuffing envelopes for MAIN is
donating his or her time at the Basic Skill level, not at the Advanced
Skill level, even though he or she would be capable of contributing at
the Advanced Skill level if performing accounting tasks.]<p>


<b>6.2.1.1 Basic Skills:</b>  This is the lowest level of skills.  Persons
performing such tasks as collating and stapling documents, stuffing
envelopes, using copying machines and fax machines, notifying members
of meetings, sorting mail, and the like will be deemed to be working
at the Basic Skill level.<p>


<b>6.2.1.2 General Skills:</b>  This is the intermediate level of skills.
Persons performing such tasks as word-processing, soliciting
contributions to MAIN by telephone, and entering data into
spreadsheets or databases will be deemed to be working at the General
Skill level.<p>


<b>6.2.1.3 Advanced Skills:</b>  This is the top level of skills.  Persons
performing such tasks as composing documents on behalf of MAIN,
operating MAIN's technical equipment, performing tasks requiring a
professional knowledge of accounting or other such professions, and
writing Unix programs will be deemed to be working at the Advanced
Skill level.<p>

<b>6.2.2</b> With respect to donated time, the levels of skills distinguished
by MAIN are those listed below.  The Executive Director of MAIN, or
his or her designated agent, shall be the judge of the level of skill
employed in the performance of any and all tasks performed by
volunteers.  It must be understood that volunteers will be permitted
to perform only those tasks for which they are qualified, in the
judgment of the Executive Director of MAIN, or his or her designated
agent.<p>

<b>6.2.3</b> The values associated with each level of skill may be adjusted
up or down at any time by the Board of Directors of MAIN by amending
this policy, subject only to the following restrictions:  (a) changes
of value will go into effect on the date set by the Board, but said
date may be no earlier than two weeks following the meeting of the
Board at which the change is made; and (b) at least one week in
advance of said date, the changes of value must be promulgated
electronically to the members of MAIN and made known via the general
welcoming announcement that greets persons who dial or telnet into
MAIN.<p>

<b>6.2.4</b> Time volunteered shall be verified by the MAIN member who
supervises the volunteer in the task or who received the product of
the project or task, and shall be reported to the Treasurer for the
purpose of serving in lieu of paid dues.<p>

<b>6.2.5</b> Time donated to MAIN will be valued as follows.<p>

<b>6.2.5.1</b> Volunteer time will be recorded to the nearest half hour.<p>

<b>6.2.5.2</b> One hour of time contributed at the Basic Skill level will be
valued at $6.00.  One hour of time contributed at the General Skill
level will be valued at $8.00.  One hour of time contributed at the
Advanced Skill level will be valued at $12.00.<p>

<b>6.3 Exceptions or limitations:<p></b>

<b>6.3.1</b> It is NOT expected that time spent on simple service on MAIN
committees or as a member of the MAIN Board will be considered
volunteer time as defined in this policy to serve in lieu of dues.<p>

<b>6.4 Financial Implications:</b>  As a result of this policy, MAIN may
decrease the revenues it gains from its membership dues.  No estimate
of revenue to be foregone has been made.  The MAIN Board has decided
that this tradeoff is advantageous to the health and progress of MAIN.<p>

<b>6.5 Relationships:</b>  This policy makes no new relationships nor changes
existing relationships.<p>


<h3><A NAME="7.0 Policy on Relationships">7.0 Policy on Relationships</A></h3>


<b>7.1 Definitions</b><p>

<b>7.1.1 For-profit.</b>  Any organization that is not a not-for-profit
organization and not a government organization under the following
definitions is to be considered a for-profit organization for the purposes
of this policy and all activities of MAIN.<p>

<b>7.1.2 Formal relationship.</b>  A formal relationship is a relationship
between MAIN and one or more other organizations in which a contract has
been signed or agreed to orally either by all parties or only one of the
parties.  For example, organizations that sign agreements to use MAIN to
deliver their information are in formal relationships with MAIN even
though MAIN may not have actively signed the agreements.  All formal
relationships with other organizations must be approved by the MAIN Board
of Directors.<p>

<b>7.1.3 Government.</b>  A government organization is any organization which is
a unit of or an agent of a recognized jurisdiction, such as federal
governments, state governments (to include institutions of higher
education), county governments, city governments and special governmental
districts such as school districts, library districts, and other such
jurisdictions.<p>

<b>7.1.4 Informal relationship.</b>  An informal relationship is a relationship
between MAIN and one or more organizations in which no contract has been
made either orally or in writing.<p>

<b>7.1.5 Non-relationship.</b>  A non-relationship exists in cases where an
entity's presence on an internet, in the broadest sense, is accessed
through the MAIN interface-entrance ramp.  Since no formal or informal
agreement exists between MAIN and such presences on an internet, MAIN has
no responsibilities toward those entities nor any liability for any
information or misinformation accessed or resources used.<p>


<b>7.1.6 Not-for-profit.</b>  A not-for-profit organization is one having
tax-exempt status from the Internal Revenue Service (or has such status
pending).  Without this IRS status, an organization is not a
not-for-profit organization for MAIN's purposes.<p>

<b>7.2 General.</b>  MAIN desires the synergy of cooperative relationships.  MAIN
believes that the days of "competitive advantage" have given way to the
days of "cooperative advantage." It is in the best interest of MAIN to
form relationships with all manner of organizations for the betterment of
the citizens of the Metropolitan Austin area.<p>

MAIN must look carefully at all relationships into which it enters to
ensure that its mission is furthered by the partnership and that the
citizens of the Austin area benefit.  As a not-for-profit corporation,
MAIN must be especially careful about relationships it forms with
for-profit entities so that it does not endanger its 501(c)(3) status so
that donations to MAIN remain tax-exempt.  Beyond that, MAIN must ensure
that its motives and actions are not judged by profitability, but by
benefit for the citizenry.  All formal relationships with other
organizations must be approved by the MAIN Board of Directors.<p>

<b>7.3 Specifics</b><p>

<b>7.3.1 Information relationships.</b>  MAIN will enter into formal
relationships for the purpose of providing information to the citizens of
the Metropolitan Austin area.<p>

<b>7.3.1.1 </b>MAIN is not responsible for the content, correctness,
completeness, or continuous availability of any information provided by
another organization.  MAIN is not also not responsible for any damage to
that information.<p>

<b>7.3.1.2 </b>MAIN reserves the right to sever any information relationship with
any other party or parties at any time for any reason MAIN deems cogent
unless legal obligations override this policy.<p>


<b>7.3.1.3</b> While MAIN may provide access to information for which an access
or use charge is made, MAIN will not profit monetarily (beyond any cost
recovery) from providing access to said information which a for-profit
organization makes available, nor will MAIN be the conduit through which
users of this information pay the information provider.<p>

<b>7.3.2 Donor relationships.</b>  MAIN will enter into relationships with other
organizations for the purpose of accepting money, hardware, software,
services, space, personnel resources, supplies, or other in-kind
donations.  Such donations shall be accepted by the Board on the basis of
their contribution to MAIN's mission and in accordance with MAIN's Bylaws
and tax-exempt status.<p>

<b>7.3.2.1</b> Generally, conditional donations will not be accepted, and in no
event will they be accepted if they are in conflict with MAIN's
not-for-profit status.<p>

<b>7.3.2.2</b> In the case of a donation of space, MAIN must retain a separate
identity, especially in the case of such a donation by a for-profit
entity.  MAIN will not allow itself to become linked strongly with any
for-profit entity.<p>

<b>7.3.3 Other relationships. </b> MAIN may enter into relationships with
organizations for any other purpose related to MAIN's mission provided
MAIN's not-for-profit status is in no way jeopardized.<p>


<b>7.3.4 Review of relationships.</b>  All formal relationships in which MAIN is
a partner must be reviewed at least once per year by the Board, the
Executive Director, corporate counsel, or someone delegated this
responsibility by the Board.<p>

<b>7.3.5 Publication of information about relationships.</b>  In general, all
information related to MAIN's relationships shall be made public in
accordance with MAIN's official information policy.<p>

<b>7.3.5.1</b> If however, any proprietary information that one partner does not
wish to be disclosed is contained in a formal relationship document, MAIN
shall not make said information available subject to all laws and
regulations as shall be in effect and applicable.<p>

<b>7.3.6 Publicity.</b>  To recognize donations and to announce relationships,
MAIN may make public notice of the donation or relationship only to such
extent that the publicity is not construed as advertising for a for-profit
entity.  It is incumbent upon MAIN not to appear to be merely an
advertising opportunity for a for-profit entity.<p>

<b>7.4</b> There are no financial implications in this policy.<p>

<b>7.5</b> While there are no specific relationships made or unmade by this
policy, the policy has implications for every relationship into which MAIN
enters.<p>


<h3><A NAME="8.0  Policy on Information to which MAIN Provides Access">8.0  Policy on Information to which MAIN Provides Access</A></h3>

<b>8.1  General.</b><p>

MAIN exists to provide information electronically to the metropolitan
Austin community.  Information that serves community needs is a
potential addition to MAIN, either physically or virtually.<p>

MAIN reserves the right to include or to exclude, to continue to display
or to discontinue to display any and all information on its own
machines.<p>

<b>8.2  Specifications</b><p>

<b>8.2.1</b>  MAIN, as a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization, is statutorily
forbidden to earn a profit, to advertise for-profit products, or to
become too closely affiliated with a for-profit enterprise.  Therefore,
MAIN will focus its information gathering and dissemination activities
on information from other not-for-profit organizations.<p>

<b>8.2.2</b>  MAIN is responsible for the presence of the information it
stores on its own machines and makes available electronically, but not
for its authenticity, its accuracy, or its currency.  All organizations
providing information to MAIN are responsible for its authenticity, its
accuracy, and its currency,<p>

<b>8.2.3</b>  MAIN is not responsible for, will not monitor, and does not have
the capability to monitor, review, approve, or remove information that
is not physically stored on MAIN's machines but is accessible over the
Internet. Let the user beware.<p>

<b>8.2.4</b>  MAIN can accept information from any source willing to provide
it to MAIN as long as it furthers MAIN's mission.<p>

<b>8.2.5</b>  When MAIN agrees to accept information, it will mount said
information as soon as it can, given its status as a volunteer
organization.  MAIN is not liable if it is unable to post any information
in a timely enough manner.<p>

<b>8.3  Exceptions</b><p>

<b>8.3.1 </b> There is a potential conflict between sections 8.1 and 8.2.1 of
this policy.  Where the interests of the community are best served by
making information from a for-profit enterprise accessible via MAIN
(e.g.,restaurant menus, theatre schedules), MAIN will handle each case
individually making the determination as to whether the information
can be mounted or pointed to.  In cases in which information that
emanates from a for-profit enterprise is aimed at informing the
people about community activities (even if conducted for a profit), 
MAIN will generally allow the information.  In cases in which
information that emanates from a for-profit enterprise is aimed
primarily to sell products or services, MAIN will generally disallow
the information.  The decision of the MAIN Board is final.<p>

<b>8.3.2</b>  MAIN will refuse to store and disseminate (or refuse to continue
to store and disseminate, as the case may be) any information-
regardless of its source, public purpose, or any other qualification-
that is unauthorized (e.g., is not sanctioned by the organization having
or producing the information) or illegal (e.g., infringes on copyright),
that jeopardizes MAIN's not-for-profit status, that violates MAIN's
mission or this or any other of MAIN's policies or guidelines, or that
threatens the operation or security of MAIN's system.<p>

<b>8.4 </b> This policy has no financial implications for MAIN.<p>

<b>8.5</b>  This policy potentially impacts MAIN's relationships with
information providers or potential information providers.<p>


<h3><A NAME="9.0  Purchasing Policy">9.0  Purchasing Policy</A></h3>


<b>9.1 </b>The purpose of this policy is to formalize and direct MAIN's
purchasing.  This policy is purposely broad enough to allow MAIN to spend
its funds in the best way possible given a set of circumstances, but at the
same time to specify some directions to be followed resulting in objective
purchasing.  In no case is the purchase of any good or service by MAIN to
be influenced by personal feelings of anyone in the MAIN organization,
broadly defined, or to be made on the basis of economic gain by any
individual in the MAIN organization.  Even the appearance of impropriety
must be avoided.<p>

<b>9.1.1  Administrative. </b> The President of MAIN is responsible for
determining that this policy has been followed for each purchase approved
by the Board.  The MAIN Board member, or another member of MAIN, who
proposes a purchase should refer to this policy and should inform the
President how the particular purchase fits within this policy.  The
Executive Director of MAIN is responsible for determining that this policy
has been followed for each purchase approved by the Executive Director.<p>

<b>9.1.2</b>  No MAIN Board member, employee of MAIN, or MAIN member in its
broadest sense who stands to gain financially from a MAIN purchase may
participate in a decision by MAIN to make that purchase.<p>

<b>9.2 </b> Whenever possible, MAIN will make purchases from Austin area
businesses.  It is MAIN's intent to support local vendors and to build
long-term relationships with vendors in all segments of the MAIN market.<p>

<b>9.3</b>  When possible, MAIN will purchase supplies, furniture, equipment,
other physical items, and services by soliciting prices from preferably
three, and more when feasible, reputable vendors.  In no case is a purchase
to be made after consulting only one vendor unless that one vendor is the
sole possible supplier of the needed product or service.  Formal bids must
be sought for major purchases in terms of dollar value or complexity of the
product or service to be purchased.  In making final selection, MAIN will
consider the following in this order of importance:<p>

<b>9.3.1 </b> Suitability to project goals of goods or services offered by the vendor.<p>

<b>9.3.2 </b> Price, economy, and value of individual vendor offerings.<p>

<b>9.3.3</b>  Vendor's record for quality, service, and reliability.<p>

<b>9.3.4</b>  Recommendations and/or requirements from project partners (if any).<p>

<b>9.4 </b> It is the responsibility of the Treasurer of MAIN or designate to
ensure that all of MAIN's accounting procedures are followed in the
allocation and expenditure of resources for any purchases.<p>

<b>9.5 </b> When MAIN's President, the collective Board, or the Executive Director
approves a purchase and arrangements are finalized with the vendor(s) for
delivery, it is the responsibility of the Treasurer of the Board to pay
vendor(s) as swiftly as possible after the delivery of the purchased
product or service.  MAIN should gain all possible discounts for prompt
payment and must protect MAIN's credit rating and good name.<p>

<b>9.6</b>  This policy has no financial implications per se, but its application
will have financial implications for all MAIN purchases.  Following this
policy should result in the most effective and efficient purchases
possible.<p>

<b>9.7</b>  This policy does not change any existing relationship.  Following this
policy will result in MAIN's building relationships with local vendors of
goods and services.  This policy is not designed to create a formal or
informal relationship with any one vendor except as purchasing from that
vendor under terms of this policy will create a de facto commercial
relationship, but only then for that one particular purchase.<p>

It's dinner hour and my 5-year-old is watching a rerun of 
"America's Funniest Home Videos" while I set the table. Surely this is 
harmless amusement--a kitten that thinks it's a duck, a grandpa and his 
falling-down pants, a 2-year-old impersonating Elvis. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The commercials, however, are hardly family fare. "Tonight on Larry 
Springer! Cross-dressing men and the women who love them!" Three men, 
looking as if their underwire bras are starting to pinch, sit next to 
their defiant mates. "I love him and we wear the same shoe size!" I think 
I hear one of the women say. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Mommy? Why is that man wearing a dress?" 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Click. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   I turn the channel just in time to view the last few seconds of a 
trailer for "The Relic"--people screaming, something pounding its way 
through a steel door. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Mommy? What's that?" my daughter asks. "Did something get that 
woman?" 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Click, click, click. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Finally, happily, we settle on "Jeopardy!" But first, a commercial 
break. Before I can reach for the remote control, my daughter and I 
witness a convenience store clerk as he is shot in the face by an 
assailant. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Was that pretend?" my daughter wants to know. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Tragically, it is not. It's real and is being used as a teaser for the 
news at 11. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Before the television industry gets too self-congratulatory about its 
new rating system, it needs to do some serious soul-searching about the 
way it advertises its later-evening programming. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Even before the new rating system was launched this month, I--like 
many parents--could usually figure out which programs were and were not 
kid-appropriate. "Rugrats," yes. "NYPD Blue," no. And yet even making the 
most careful television selection can't prevent what I've come to regard 
as advertising sniper fire. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   This kind of viewing--three seconds of a man and woman having sex, a 
flash of someone being gunned down in the street, the terrifying last 
seconds of a person's life--may be even more pernicious than viewing the 
program itself, where at least there is some kind of context for the 
moment at hand. Without a before and after, a troubling image becomes 
even more difficult for parents and children to discuss. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Sadly, news programs are the worst offenders. It is impossible to 
entirely shield children from the world; most parents would not do so 
even if they could. But it is irresponsible for the media to flash three 
seconds of their most lurid footage in order to entice viewers to stay up 
for the 11 o'clock news. For example, after the Oklahoma Federal Building 
bombing, when there were many questions but few answers, local news 
programs relied on the most tragic images--that of dead children being 
pulled from the debris--to keep viewers coming back for more. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   And welcome to this week's nanosecond promo: the circumstances 
surrounding the slaying of JonBenet Ramsey, the Boulder, Colo., 
6-year-old who was found dead in her family's home. There is no 
justification for leading a 30-second news spot aired during a kids' 
program with the grim finding that she had been found hands and legs 
bound and with duct tape over her mouth. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   This isn't about networks having freedom of speech. This is about them 
boosting their ratings. If it were otherwise, news organizations would 
not feel obliged consistently to air their most lurid footage without 
regard to their youngest viewers. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   At least give parents some logical framework from which to make a 
viewing decision by grouping promos with appropriate programming. If the 
network wants to air previews for "NYPD Blue" during a football game, 
that seems fine. If news organizations want to run through all the tragic 
details of Nicole Brown Simpson's death during the daytime dramas, again, 
OK. But, during an early evening program obviously geared for kids, don't 
show surveillance footage of someone being fatally shot. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   So at our house it's come down to PBS and Nickelodeon or books or "The 
King and I" on video. Either that or it's me sitting with the remote 
control pointed at the television at all times so my kids can watch a 
network TV "family hour" program without fear of being frightened by some 
way-too-adult image.

Madonna's "Evita" soundtrack has finally broken the stranglehold of 
No Doubt's "Tragic Kingdom" on the top spot of The Times' Southern 
California album sales chart. Meanwhile, soundtracks continue to do well, 
with "Romeo & Juliet" and "The Preacher's Wife" both continuing to rank 
in the Top 10 among all albums and "Rhyme & Reason" breaking into the rap 
Top 10. Moving up: The Wallflowers' "Bringing Down the Horse," which is 
No. 11 on the Southern California album chart and No. 17 nationally.

DATELINE: MENDOZA, Argentina<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
French director Jean-Jacques Annaud has made his name braving the 
elements in remote locations to make offbeat films like "Quest for Fire," 
"The Bear" and "The Lover," but nothing compares to his undertaking here, 
"Seven Years in Tibet." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The film, based on a true story, stars Brad Pitt as the legendary 
Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer, who set out to scale a peak in 
India, wound up interned in a British prisoner of war camp during World 
War II, then escaped by climbing over the Himalayas into Tibet. There he 
became an advisor to the young Dalai Lama and discovered Buddhism. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The story is set mostly in Tibet in the 1940s, which was then still a 
feudal kingdom, rooted in Buddhism, lit by butter lamps and closed to 
Western eyes. So the logical place to film would be Tibet--except that it 
has been occupied by the Communist Chinese since 1951. They forced the 
Dalai Lama--the spiritual and political leader of Tibet--to flee in 1959 
to India, and have since waged a vicious repression of Buddhist culture, 
killing monks and nuns, destroying monasteries and desecrating sacred 
books and art. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As a result, Annaud knew full well the Chinese would not be first in 
line to see his movie, let alone allow him to film it in Tibet. So he set 
his sights on northern India and spent six months scouting locales, 
preparing sets and investing close to $1 million, only to have the Indian 
prime minister's office--reportedly in response to pressure from 
China--call off the shooting last spring. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Undeterred, Annaud moved cast and crew--which includes some 150 
Tibetans, mostly from exile settlements in India--halfway around the 
globe to the Andes, an area that looks remarkably like Tibet. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Then the Chinese began reportedly pressuring the governor of the 
Mendoza province, and the Argentine government in Buenos Aires, to shut 
down the film. But the Argentines not only welcomed the project, they 
issued the travel visas that allowed the Tibetans to leave India and work 
on the film. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   That seemed to settle the issue--until Annaud a few weeks ago heard 
that he, along with Pitt and other members of the production, have been 
blacklisted by the Chinese-run Tibetan Tourism Office. They may no longer 
visit Tibet. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "It has been very amusing," Annaud says with a smile. "The Red Chinese 
have been trying to disrupt us by scaring our Tibetans, but the Tibetans 
have not been surprised at all. This has been their life. . . . They know 
the Chinese." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The Chinese, as it turns out, are just a small part of what could be 
called "Jean-Jacques Annaud and the Quest for Tibet . . . in Argentina." 
To tell the story of the self-centered, overachieving Harrer, the 
54-year-old director has rounded up an international cast--including 
English actor David Thewlis, who plays Peter Aufschnaiter, the climber 
who accompanied Harrer on his journey, and Jetsun Pema, the Dalai Lama's 
sister. (She plays her and her brother's mother.) 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   He's rebuilt ancient Tibet in elaborate sets from the Andes near 
Uspallata to the suburbs of Mendoza, a beautiful European-style city of 
700,000. The sets include a mind-boggling re-creation of a winding street 
some 220 yards long from the capital city of Lhasa, and whole rooms of 
the Potala, the legendary 1,000-room palace of the Dalai Lamas. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Annaud secured a Tibetan advisor, Tenzin Tethong, a former Buddhist 
monk and former prime minister of the Dalai Lama's government in exile, 
whom he consults on everything from prayer banners to palace protocol; 
and a group of young Tibetan monks who spend four to eight hours a day 
creating everything from intricate, 8-foot-wide sand designs to hundreds 
of small "butter" sculptures--intricate lotus flowers and other designs 
made from Tibetan butter and wax. He's even imported a herd of yaks, 
known for their long hair and prickly natures. (They bite.) 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   'Seven Years," of course, is one of two films being made that involve 
Tibet and the Dalai Lama. The other is "Kundun," which focuses 
exclusively on the young Dalai Lama growing up. It is directed by Martin 
Scorsese, just finished shooting in Morocco and will be released by the 
Walt Disney Co. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Last fall, Chinese officials reportedly threatened Disney with 
unspecified business reprisals in mainland China if the company continued 
with "Kundun." But when Disney refused to back down on the film, the 
issue died, and Chinese officials have since grown quiet. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   To date, the Chinese officials have said nothing publicly about "Seven 
Years in Tibet." (A person answering the phone at China's embassy in 
Washington said he knew nothing about the film.) 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Moving the production halfway around the globe, however, has left a 
few more gray hairs in the head of Richard Goodwin, the executive 
producer of "Seven Years in Tibet," who numbers among his credits David 
Lean's "A Passage to India." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "This has been the most political film I have ever been involved 
with," Goodwin said. "The Chinese do not want to be criticized. What they 
did in Tibet, they feel, is an internal problem of theirs and shouldn't 
be discussed with anyone." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Equally challenging have been hordes of teenage girls and paparazzi 
who have descended to this area in western Argentina, near the Chilean 
border, just to glimpse Pitt. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Indeed, the frenzy has reached rock-star proportions, as girls will 
wait for hours at the studio gates, often with their fathers as chaperons 
(this is Argentina), just to see Pitt's four-wheel-drive vehicle motor 
past. They scream and swoon even though they can't see a thing through 
the tinted windshield. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   All the attention has rendered Pitt a prisoner of his house outside 
Mendoza, which had to be equipped with a fence--built on top of the 
existing wall that rings the grounds--to keep fans from prying. (Though 
even with the hubbub, Pitt managed to keep some time for his personal 
life; he and Gwyneth Paltrow became engaged during the filming.) It's 
also earned him a lot of respect among the cast and crew: He rarely talks 
about the frenzy, let alone complain; he just does his work. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Despite the hassles, the $60-million production, planned for an 
October release from TriStar, is virtually on budget and schedule, and 
should wrap in early March. And the major reason, as virtually anyone 
from caterers to the executive producers will tell you, is Annaud. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The Paris-based director puts in 12- to 14-hour days on the set. His 
sense of adventure is infectious--and he invariably manages to surprise 
even those who have known him well for years. He may have the mind and 
look (a white mane of Harpo Marx hair and metal-rimmed glasses) of a 
French intellectual, but he holds the spirit of an American cowboy. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "What I've known in this business is a complacency among people, 
especially as you go down the road and become more successful, but not 
Jean-Jacques," Pitt says. "Here's a guy who still gets thrilled and 
excited--every day. The worse the weather gets, the happier he is. Wind, 
rain, dust in the eyes--people can't see, people are getting blown over, 
lights getting blown over. He's thrilled--'Yes, yes! I want to go now, 
this is natural. We must go now!' 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "And we don't even have to talk about his eye," Pitt says. "Any time 
he comes up to me on the set and says, 'You know, this thing, it is not 
right . . . , ' he doesn't even have to put it into words. The man 
knows." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Annaud's touch was evident the other day in the studios outside 
Mendoza, as he orchestrated the coronation of the young Dalai Lama, a 
massive scene involving nearly 400 extras, all packed into a stunning 
re-creation of the Potala's coronation room, which Tibetans call the Hall 
of Good Deeds. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Indeed, the set seems more like it has been flown in from Lhasa than 
built by hand in Argentina inside an old garlic warehouse; it rises three 
stories and covers some 9,000 square feet, most of which is filled with 
row upon row of monks, all facing forward to the throne of golden silk 
pillows, 4 feet high, where the young Dalai Lama sits, awaiting his 
crown. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Lording over all is a towering golden statue of Sakyamuni, the 
historical Buddha, sitting cross-legged on his lotus throne, decorated 
with 14 intricate butter sculptures in shades of pink, blue and cream. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Adding to the aura are banks of Tibetan butter lamps ringing the room, 
casting a haunting glow illuminating countless Buddhas staring out from 
the walls. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Annaud, dressed all in white, stands out as he darts around the rows 
of extras, attired in traditional Tibetan ceremonial silk robes, trimmed 
in brocade. He beamed enthusiasm, whether joking with the young Dalai 
Lama (14-year-old Jamyang Wangchuck, from Bhutan), who sits on a throne 
of pillows adjusting his horn-rimmed glasses, or discussing camera 
placement with his cinematographer, Robert Fraisse. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Annaud takes particular joy in attending to little things--like the 
timing between the Tibetan ceremonial band and the chanting of the monks 
in the first row. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "First the music starts, then after a few bars we want those monks to 
start with their chants," Annaud says, pointing to the row of monks. 
"Then they can start bowing." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It is eerie, in fact, how all the seemingly random elements build to 
make an emotional point. As each row bows, a wave of human flesh recedes 
from the Dalai Lama's throne and eventually focuses attention on the only 
white face in the crowd: Harrer (Pitt). He is near the last row, dressed 
in a wine-dark silk robe. He is bowing, too--and that is the point. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The entire scene--the building, people, costumes, lighting, music, 
smoke--has been orchestrated to dramatize an emotional transformation. 
The world-class mountaineer has exchanged his climbing spikes and awards 
for a robe and a sense of compassion. He is now a part of Buddhist 
culture. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As that awareness dawns, the smell of incense suddenly becomes 
evident. It is everywhere, wafting from behind the Dalai Lama's throne of 
pillows. The source of the cloud: Annaud, hidden behind the throne, 
happily waving sticks of Tibetan incense. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "I wanted to smell it," Annaud says later. "And I wanted my Tibetan 
friends to smell it, too. It is the perfume of their country and when 
they smell it, they are there." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   That attitude has characterized Annaud's career. At times, he seems 
more like an anthropologist bent on preserving lost cultures than a film 
director, dependent for his life on the box office. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   He's obsessed with what happens when one culture meets another and how 
that clash gives rise to emotional transformations. That theme--the quest 
for humanity in a world that has lost all sense of what being human 
is--is a recurrent one for him, whether the story involves a group of 
French and German colonials and Africans in West Africa during World War 
I, as it did in "Black and White in Color," which earned an Oscar for 
best foreign-language film in 1977; or a bear cub, a bear and two white 
hunters in "The Bear." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   To bring these conflicts to life, Annaud loves to create his own 
worlds. In "Quest for Fire," his epic drama about primitive man's 
discovery of fire, Annaud invented four primitive tribes. Then, with the 
help of the late Anthony Burgess and renowned anthropologist Desmond 
Morris, he created a culture--from body language to dress to 
implements--for each tribe. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   For "The Bear," which told the story of a cub's coming of age from the 
cub's point of view, Annaud spent nearly six years finding the right 
animals, training a variety of them--including a 2,000-pound Kodiak bear 
named Bart--for "roles" in the film, and scouting locations from northern 
Canada to Europe. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "I don't want my movies to be 'just a movie,' " Annaud says. "Movies 
are becoming the most important vehicle of culture, of knowledge. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Our efforts here have two levels. One is to make a very good, 
entertaining movie. The other is to make a movie that is going to be one 
of the very few to witness the culture of Tibet as it was." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Seven Years in Tibet" was challenging, even for Annaud, because for 
centuries Tibet lay hidden, accessible only by yak caravans and virtually 
forbidden to Westerners. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In fact, Harrer and Aufschnaiter--who spent nearly two years climbing 
from India into Tibet, through mountain passes at 15,000 to 30,000 
feet--were among the first Westerners allowed to live in the Forbidden 
City of Lhasa for an extended time since the early 18th century. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The Chinese crackdown hasn't helped the spread of knowledge. A good 
deal of the country was off-limits to foreigners for nearly three 
decades. And many remote parts--which human-rights groups say are being 
used for prison camps and nuclear waste dumps--still are.

   As a result, there are only a handful of accurate accounts written by 
Westerners on Tibetan life, and fewer still on the intricacies of 
ceremonial life that governed the Tibetan Buddhist world, which is 
centered on the Dalai Lama, believed to be a living reincarnation of 
Buddha. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   To solve that problem, screenwriter Becky Johnston, who also wrote 
"The Prince of Tides," spent nearly a year researching the script. She 
studied Tibetan Buddhism for eight months with a lama--a Tibetan Buddhist 
monk-teacher--in Los Angeles, toured Tibet for a month with a small group 
led by noted Buddhist scholar Stephen Batchelor, then lived in 
Dharamsala, India (headquarters of the Tibetan government in exile), for 
a month. There, she interviewed the Dalai Lama as well as members of his 
family and government. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The result was a script that had a strong dramatic line from a 
Buddhist point of view: A Westerner overcomes his ego to learn compassion 
and gain wisdom. It was also heavily laced with descriptions of Buddhist 
practices and ceremonies--and the emotional pull of Tibet. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "When you go there, you say, 'My God, you would have to be a member of 
the living dead not to have this place affect you,' " Johnston says. "The 
whole orientation of the culture is to break the ego down." 
<p>

   Annaud spent months traveling in 1994 and 1995 with his 
wife-assistant-companion and second set of eyes, Laurence, or in small 
groups with members of his production team photographing Tibet and 
Tibetan settlements in Bhutan, Nepal and India. He then had those 
photographs compiled into book-like tomes and passed out to his art and 
costume departments. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But the ultimate goal, Annaud says, was emotion rather than physical 
realities. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "What I wanted most of all was to see the country and feel the spirit 
myself--with the lamas and the monks, smell this very unique olfactory 
experience of rancid yak butter, and the soot of the butter lamps, mixed 
with the smell of incense," he says. "It becomes a very specific, 
wonderful, nostril experience." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Among the Tibetan cast are about 75 monks, many of whom were born and 
raised in Tibet, live now in monasteries in India and experienced many of 
the events portrayed in the film--such as the Chinese invasion in 1951. 
Their serene faces have earned them celebrity status in Mendoza. They 
walk the streets dressed in maroon and gold robes and Converse low-cut 
sneakers (in maroon, of course) and are often asked to pose for 
photographs. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In addition to Tibetans, Annaud has assembled a corps of experienced 
actors, including Danny Denzongpa, one of India's most famous stars; B.D. 
Wong, the Chinese American actor who won a Tony for his work in "M. 
Butterfly"; and numerous Bolivians, who bear an uncanny similarity to 
Tibetan monks. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   For most of the Tibetans, this film is more than a movie; it is part 
of their lives as practicing Buddhists. Jetsun Pema, for example, 
normally works in Dharamsala, supervising the education of about 10,000 
Tibetan children. But for her, this movie is just as important. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "You see, whatever we Tibetans are doing, we are doing for a purpose. 
The hope of every Tibetan is to go back and free Tibet some day," Pema 
says. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "So whether you are looking after Tibetan children, or acting in a 
movie that is giving more awareness about Tibet to the general public, 
it's the same thing." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Rumors circulated on the set that Annaud had pulled a remarkable coup, 
somehow managing to send a second unit into Tibet to shoot pickups that 
will eventually be spliced into the finished film--scenes even said to 
include doubles dressed as Pitt's and Thewlis' characters. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Annaud supposedly directed the scenes--by fax and phone from 
Argentina, via satellite--re-shoots and all. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "The footage is incredible," says one member of the production who 
claims to have seen the material shot in Tibet spliced into footage shot 
in Argentina. "You can't tell the difference." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But this is one topic the usually talkative Annaud is silent on. He 
won't give it more than a wry smile, neither confirming nor denying. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "I really don't have anything to say right now," he says politely. 
"Except that I think some people will find some parts of my movie very 
interesting."

Leo J. Hindery Jr., general partner and chief executive of 
InterMedia Partners, was named president of Tele-Communications Inc., the 
nation's largest cable TV operator. John Malone, chairman, CEO and 
current president of TCI, said the chief executive of each TCI business 
unit would report to Hindery. Malone had been expected to bring in a 
respected cable executive in an effort to restore the profitability of 
the Englewood, Colo.-based company. InterMedia is the nation's 
ninth-largest cable operator and is partly owned by TCI. Hindery, 49, has 
acquired a reputation for improving the San Francisco company's cash 
flow. Malone assumed the position of chairman, along with president and 
CEO, after the death of TCI founder Bob Magness in November. Separately, 
TCI said it agreed to buy the 55% of Los Angeles-based DMX Inc. it 
doesn't already own.

Excite Consolidating: Excite, which claims to have nailed down the 
No. 2 spot behind Yahoo in the volatile Internet search engine business, 
is gearing up for a retooling. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   A week ago, the Mountain View, Calif.-based start-up offered a choice 
of buyout or relocation to 12 contributing editors, 10 of them in Los 
Angeles. Excite, which has 190 employees in Silicon Valley, is preparing 
to move into larger quarters in nearby Redwood City to accommodate its 
rapidly growing work force. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Excite co-founder and Vice President Joe Kraus said the consolidation 
is to prepare the company for a strategic change in its Internet 
directory, which features reviews of popular sites on the World Wide Web. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "No way are we shrinking," Kraus said, though he declined to be 
specific about the make-over. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Last week, Excite announced revenue of $6.5 million for the quarter 
ended Dec. 31. That was 61% higher than in the previous quarter--but the 
company still lost $12.7 million for the period, including $4.3 million 
that was due to the acquisition of a competitor, WebCrawler. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Excite touted its deal to be the exclusive search engine on America 
Online, and Kraus said it is now the clear runner-up among companies that 
help people find things on the Internet via indexes and search 
technology. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But the acquisitions and other investments that have helped get Excite 
where it is certainly haven't come easy: The company lost $43.1 million 
for the year on revenue of $14.8 million. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Earlier this month, first-place Yahoo surprised Wall Street by posting 
a profit of $96,000 on revenue of $8.5 million for its most recent 
quarter.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
One hundred and fifty years ago, Russian writer Leo Tolstoy wrote a 
short story set in the Caucasus at a time when his country was locked in 
a miserable war with intractable rebels. How little some things change. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Simple, powerful, convincing, "Prisoner of the Mountains" is the 
Tolstoy plot updated to the recent conflict with Chechnya, but its story 
needs no specific time or place to be effective. A spare, poetic tale of 
the traps of conflict and fate, of how much and how little humanity 
counts for in a state of war, it could be told about any location where 
killing is casual and options for survival few. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Directed by veteran Russian filmmaker Sergei Bodrov (who had a hand in 
the script and cast his son Sergei Bodrov Jr. as one of the leads), 
"Prisoner" won the International Critics Prize at Cannes and is Russia's 
entry for best foreign language film in the 1996 Academy Awards. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Despite its official status, Bodrov's work is remarkable for not 
taking sides in the conflict. The film's measured, unsentimental 
sympathies are rather for those whose lives are fractured by war's 
pointless savageries, no matter what their political allegiance. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Bodrov Jr. plays a young crew-cut recruit named Vania, first glimpsed 
being inducted assembly-line style into the Russian army. Boyishly eager 
to serve, he asks where he's headed. "Wherever your country sends you," 
is the gruff reply. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   That turns out to be the Caucasus mountains, where the large but 
lackadaisical Russian force engages in massive drinking and random weapon 
firing, all of which arouses the contempt of the devoutly Muslim local 
people who have bitterness, feuds and long memories of their own to 
contend with. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Out on patrol in the hinterlands, Vania gets shot in an ambush, and 
only he and Sacha, another badly wounded soldier, survive the attack. 
Chained together, they're taken to a remote mountain village where they 
find themselves the personal prisoners of an unbending local patriarch 
named Abdoul-Mourat (Jemal Sikharulidze). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Played by the quicksilver Oleg Menshikov, who was Nikita Mikhalkov's 
nemesis in "Burnt by the Sun," the mustachioed Sacha is not the kind of 
person you want to be shackled to. A cocky, selfish veteran who loves 
nothing but his AK-47, Sacha is at home in the cynical ambience of 
combat. Contemptuous of his chain-mate's reluctance to kill the enemy, he 
insists, "You have to, Vania. It's war." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Not surprisingly, Sacha and Vania do not remain at each other's 
throats but form a wary camaraderie. Also to be expected is the 
relationship of sorts that forms with their guards, especially Abdoul's 
young and suspicious daughter Dina (Susanna Mekhralieva). But these 
familiar elements are handled with clarity and integrity and don't play 
out in completely expected ways. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The core of "Prisoner of the Mountains" is why these men have been 
taken captive in the first place. Abdoul's own son has been imprisoned by 
the Russians and he hopes, with a parent's defiant logic, that he will be 
able to exchange his first-born for these two foreign invaders. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But in the corrosive atmosphere of war, with not a thimbleful of trust 
on either side, what ought to be a simple trade becomes anything but. The 
villagers want the soldiers killed out of hand, the Russians don't 
believe the hostages even exist and the intractability of the situation 
narrows the possibilities for those who believe that there is value in 
even a single human breath. But, because they do believe, they can't help 
but persevere. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Beautifully shot by Pavel Lebeshev, cinematographer on a number of 
Mikhalkov films, "Prisoner" is strengthened by its scenes showing village 
customs and traditions that have endured for generations. And the acting, 
both by veteran Menshikov and newcomer Bodrov, stresses the characters' 
individuality. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But "Prisoner of the Mountains" is successful mostly because of its 
determination to trust the pared-down ruthlessness of the situation. By 
doing so, the filmmakers underline one of the truisms of Eastern European 
cinema: The best of films often come from the worst of times.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
Richard Linklater is making a career out of stalking Gen Xers. His 
first film, the $16,000 "Slacker," follows various losers and dropouts 
around Austin, Texas. His follow-up, "Dazed and Confused," spends a day 
with some aimless high schoolers in the same town. And his last film, 
"Before Sunrise," gets off a train with a young couple who'd just met and 
follows them as they wander the streets of Vienna. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Linklater, almost alone, is fascinated with that awkward stage in life 
between adolescence and adulthood where individuality is defined more by 
attitude than character, and where knowledge is just beginning to gain a 
foothold. With each succeeding picture, Linklater seemed to grow as a 
filmmaker, just as his characters became more defined and developed. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But with his fourth picture, "subUrbia," he takes two giant steps 
backward. Back to the 'burbs, back to the dazed and confused, back to 
material he has done before and much better. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "subUrbia," with a script adapted by Eric Bogosian from his 
off-Broadway play, is a darker and nastier bit of business than Linklater 
ever conjured for himself, and it is totally absent the empathy of his 
earlier films. If you dig deep enough into your psyche, you may be able 
to identify with the phony self-importance of some of its young 
characters, a clutch of post-high school friends who hang out in the 
parking lot of a convenience store. But nothing that happens in 
"subUrbia" will necessarily make it worthwhile. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The group is composed of types. There's Jeff (Giovanni Ribisi), the 
budding intellectual on the elusive trail of the meaning of life; Buff 
(Steve Zahn), a manic geek who acts freshly graduated from "Porky's"; and 
Tim (Nicky Katt), the obligatory brooding loner. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Apparently, the three buddies collect at the same place every night in 
fictional Burnfield to drink beer, argue among themselves and harass the 
industrious Pakistani couple who run the store. On this particular night, 
they're expecting a visit from Pony (Jayce Bartok), who's gone on to an 
actual career as a rock singer, and are joined in their wait by Jeff's 
perky girlfriend Sooze (Amie Carey), a would-be performance artist, and 
her depressed friend Bee-Bee (Dina Spybey), fresh out of rehab. When Pony 
shows up in his limo, with his sexually available assistant Erica (Parker 
Posey), the scene is set for a blizzard of regrets, accusations, 
rivalries, jealousies and confrontations, not to mention enough sloppy 
intellectual thumb-sucking to wrinkle the screen. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The main issue dividing the group is inertia. With the exception of 
Pony and Sooze, who naturally gravitate toward each other, these people 
are on a slacker's sabbatical, taking time off from time off, as if being 
20 is a condition, like barrel fermentation, that can take five or 10 
years. No question, Linklater and Bogosian are dealing with truths about 
that age, but they have nothing new or particularly interesting to offer, 
and they've created such an unpleasant group, it certainly isn't 
inviting.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
Fran Drescher's voice should be hooked up to an oscilloscope, 
because there are things going on there that defy explanation. The 
piggybacked harmonics, the simultaneous octaves, the symphonic whine 
disturbing the peace like a rusty razor, all lead one to suspect that 
somewhere among her multiple waves of Flushing-accented effusiveness, 
Drescher is producing sounds that only dogs can hear. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Explaining her appeal, on the other hand--either on TV's "The Nanny" 
or in its spiritual descendant "The Beautician and the Beast"--is a snap. 
Drescher's a traditionalist, basically, inasmuch as minority humor and 
self-abasement are American comedy institutions. Drescher's Lucy-Desi 
shtick is a combo platter of ethnicity (Queens' Jewish), innate absurdity 
(striking good looks married to a voice like bad radio reception) and the 
fact that she's everybody's equal, by virtue of being culturally 
hamstrung. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Of course, Drescher is also no idiot, which is why "The Beautician and 
the Beast," a lime-and-fuchsia-flavored "The King and I," is so much more 
appealing than either its premise or its trailers suggest. As beauty 
school instructor Joy Miller, Drescher is talky, sexy, inappropriate and 
smart. And until director Ken Kwapis allows sentimental seriousness to 
overtake the humor, so is the movie. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Based on the same setup as about a hundred TV sitcoms and dubious 
movies, "The Beautician and the Beast" finds Drescher's colorful Joy in 
the drab former Soviet socialist republic of Slovetzia. It's a mix-up, of 
the classically sitcom variety: Grushinsky (Ian McNeice), emissary of 
Slovetzia dictator Boris Pochenko (Timothy Dalton), has hired Joy as 
governess to Pochenko's children, thinking she's a science teacher 
("Teach it?" she says later. "I didn't even pass it"). Joy, under the 
impression Grushinsky needs a beautician, is happy to go along for the 
ride, especially since the job she really wanted--doing hair for the 
women who pick Lotto numbers on TV--has gone to someone more chichi. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Joy doesn't exactly sing "Getting to Know You," but once in Slovetzia 
she wins the children over, befriends the locals ("Svetlana! Wait up!"), 
organizes a union at one of Pochenko's factories and makes Boris steam. 
But with steaming, Boris also softens, prompting his malevolent prime 
minister Kleist (Patrick Malahide) to speculate whether there isn't room 
at the top. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   There's a romantic subplot about Pochenko's daughter, Katrina (Lisa 
Jakub of "Mrs. Doubtfire"), and an anti-government subversive, and of 
course the growing affection between Boris and Joy. Dalton, not by nature 
a comedian, is actually quite good as Boris, precisely because 
informality seems to be so hard for both of them. Everyone, however, 
comes off as stiff next to Drescher, who leaves her dainty high-heel 
marks all over "The Beautician and the Beast." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "I used to give pedicures to women who wore plastic shoes in summer," 
she tells Grushinsky. "What's a tougher gig than that?" Well, it's not 
being Fran Drescher, she of the emery-board voice and tacky charm, who 
makes this stuff about class and status seem very easy indeed.

It's hard to imagine Craig Rosenberg's "Hotel de Love" appealing to 
anyone who isn't hung up on romance novels, but if you're into unrequited 
love, this may be for you. The twist in this exceedingly minor Australian 
romantic comedy is that this time it's the men instead of the women who 
are pining away for love.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>

   Simon Bossell's Stephen tells us how he and his fraternal twin Rick 
(Aden Young) fell hard for a visiting beauty, Melissa (Saffron Burrows). 
Although only Rick has been intimate with her, both brothers are still 
obsessed with her a full decade later. Neither has been able to fall 
truly in love with anyone else. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In that time, Stephen has become a workaholic stockbroker while the 
increasingly cynical Rick has become the manager of a garish honeymoon 
hotel. (Its interiors seem to have been inspired by San Luis Obispo's 
famous Madonna Inn.) Wouldn't you know, Melissa and her fiance (Peter 
O'Brien) turn up one day, which says little for their taste in resorts. 
Also popping up for a visit are Stephen and the twins' parents, whose 
marriage has gone stale over the decades. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The young stars are attractive and capable, but "Hotel de Love" is as 
synthetic as an old "Love Boat" episode.

When in the spring of 1990 Jeanne Jordan and her husband, Steven 
Ascher, documentary filmmakers both, learned that this might be the final 
year of farming for her parents, they became determined to film this 
pivotal time in the lives of her parents, Russel and Mary Jane Jordan. 
The result is "Troublesome Creek: A Midwestern," a film as beautiful as 
it is heartbreaking, suspenseful and finally affirming. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The film premieres tonight at Raleigh Studios as part of the American 
Cinematheque's Alternative Screen series and opens Friday for one week at 
the Grande 4-Plex. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   One generation of Jordans after another had farmed the same rich Iowa 
land but, as they approached 70, the elder Jordans faced the fact that 
they were fighting a losing battle. Between the 1960s and 1990s, the 
numbers of American farmers had dwindled from 6 million to 2 million. 
Expansion in the '70s was followed by recession in the '80s. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Bureaucrats and politicians decided the farm crisis is over," 
Russel's son-in-law, whose own farm was foreclosed in 1988, says in 
"Troublesome Creek." "It isn't over, it's just got a Band-Aid over it." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The turning point for the Jordans came when their local bank was taken 
over by the mammoth Des Moines-based Norwest Banks. Norwest's impassive 
representative has no interest in the Jordans' decades of profitability 
and generations of reliability; to him, the Jordan farm simply warranted 
a "bad risk rating" and that was that. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Much to the surprise of their six children, the Jordans came up with a 
bold and courageous plan of action to save their land, including the 
ancestral Victorian farmhouse. "Troublesome Creek" keeps us on edge, 
hoping that their gamble pays off. Russel and Mary Jane love western 
movies, and their filmmaker-daughter can't help but see them as heroes 
trying to stave off the bad guys, thus the subtitle "A Midwestern." (The 
film's main title comes from the picturesque stream that rambles over the 
Jordan land.) 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In the process of making the film, the Aschers generate a tremendous 
amount of emotion and discover a great deal of meaning, which we, in 
turn, experience in watching "Troublesome Creek." On the most obvious 
level, the documentary calls attention to the fragile predicament of the 
small farmer everywhere in America. At the same time, the Aschers are 
creating a lyrical homage to the tremendous beauty of rural Iowa and a 
heartland way of life that seems quintessentially American. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The inviting interiors of the Jordan home and their family life are 
straight out of Norman Rockwell. These are the kind of settings used for 
countless "homey" TV commercials advertising everything from pickup 
trucks to kitchen and cleaning products. In many ways, the Jordans are 
the very embodiment of the American dream, one that is in danger of 
becoming a nightmare. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Yet the Jordans' predicament reveals their staunch strength of 
character, dignity and humor in the face of adversity, the solidity of 
their near-50 years of marriage and, above all, the significance of 
family in the face of the inevitability of change. "Troublesome Creek" is 
a hugely affecting experience. No wonder it became an Oscar nominee and 
took the audience award as well as the grand jury prize for documentary 
just a year ago at the Sundance Festival.

   But ya know . . . Rodney Dangerfield never gets any respect. And 
considering the people he's hanging out with in this movie, it's no 
surprise. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But then again, there may be a method to his madness. If you're going 
to star in a movie as bad as "Meet Wally Sparks"--the most inept 
collection of hoary gags, stale slapstick routines and baggy-pants comedy 
since the last "Police Academy" debacle--then why not drag every other 
tasteless hack on stage and screen down with you? 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Dangerfield, goggle-eyed and ready to tip over, is Wally Sparks, 
prototypal trash-talk TV star and stunted adolescent. He incurs the wrath 
of advertisers (which seems unlikely) for hosting programs about lesbian 
alien Elvis impersonators and "Sex After 10 Years of Marriage--Should the 
Wife Know About It?" He also becomes the target of a Southern governor 
(David Ogden Stiers), whose reelection bid becomes tied to Sparks and his 
show. The fate of a nation lies in the balance. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   What ensues, of course, is a creaky plot about cross-cultural 
collision and the eventual armistice between fundamentalist rigidity and 
media licentiousness. Also, one long Dangerfield stand-up routine 
virtually unencumbered by narrative. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Make no mistake: Like Wally Sparks himself, there is no redeeming 
social value inherent in this debut feature by Peter Baldwin, who is 
apparently--and successfully--shedding whatever wholesomeness has 
attached itself to him by virtue of his work on "The Wonder Years," 
"Newhart" and "Family Ties." What we get here is comedy of the frenetic 
phallic or flatulent variety. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Dangerfield is Dangerfield, an acquired taste; "Wally Sparks" is 
nowhere near his career-defining work in, let's say, "Caddyshack," but 
he's a known commodity. What's surprising is how many others should be 
caught up and demolished by this sweeping wave of excremental nonsense. 
Stiers, Cindy Williams, Debi Mazar, Lesley Anne Down, all supporting 
actors of some note. But then, so is Dangerfield. What "Wally Sparks" 
really needed was a star. And while I never thought I'd ever say this, 
what Wally really could have used was a Chevy Chase.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
The municipality of Blaine, Mo., "a little town with a big heart in 
the heart of the country," is about to celebrate a very special event. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   While it seems like only yesterday that an unscrupulous guide 
abandoned a wagon train after convincing the gullible travelers they'd 
arrived in California, in fact it's been 150 years since Blaine's 
glorious founding. And the town is determined to pull off an event that 
promises to be "the standard by which sesquicentennials will be judged." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   For those not fortunate enough to make it to Blaine for the 
festivities, a documentary crew is on hand to record it all for "Waiting 
for Guffman," a sly and gleeful comedy showcase that pokes clever fun at 
the American musical, amateur theatricals and anything else that's not 
nailed down. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The standard by which all mock-documentaries are judged is, of course, 
"This Is Spinal Tap," and the moving force behind "Guffman" is 
Christopher Guest, alive in our memory as Tap's lead guitarist Nigel 
Tufnel. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Guest directed and co-wrote "Guffman" (with "Second City's" Eugene 
Levy) and also stars as Corky St. Clair, the creative tornado behind 
"Red, White and Blaine," the musical pageant that celebrates Blaine in 
all its misbegotten glory. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   For there is more to this town than the legend of its accidental 
founding. There's the story of how the weary feet of President William 
McKinley led to Blaine's becoming the Stool Capitol of the World. And 
then there was the celebrated UFO sighting/potluck dinner of 1946. All of 
which has to get into "Red, White and Blaine." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Collaborating with Guest on "Guffman's" music and lyrics are his "Tap" 
cohorts Michael McKean and Harry Shearer. Together they come up with some 
splendid numbers, including the peppy "Stool Boom" and the parallel 
"Nothing Ever Happens in Blaine" and "Nothing Ever Happens on Mars." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But "Waiting for Guffman" offers more than music. We're privileged to 
be behind the scenes in everything from the choosing of the cast to the 
inevitable crises of confidence when it looks as if "Red, White and 
Blaine" might never get to pack the high school gym after all. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Which, given the kind of talent there is in Blaine, would have been a 
shame. Ron and Sheila Albertson (Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara), for 
instance, in private life travel agents who have never ventured out of 
town, have done enough local theater to be known as "the Lunts of 
Blaine." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Then there are the newcomers, like Dr. Allan Pearl (Eugene Levy), the 
tone-deaf dentist who thinks he had a relative who worked in Yiddish 
theater. Or Libby Mae Brown (Parker Posey at her most irresistible), the 
soignee Dairy Queen counter girl who wows Corky St. Clair with her 
spirited version of "Teacher's Pet." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Finally, it does all come down to the charismatic Corky, a veteran of 
too many years spent as far off Broadway as you can get. Back in Blaine 
as the high school drama teacher who wanted audiences to "feel the heat" 
in his legendary staged version of "Backdraft," Corky has the passion and 
the vision to override skeptics like music teacher Lloyd Miller (Bob 
Balaban), apparently the only sane individual in town, and get "Red, 
White and Blaine" up on its feet. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Similarly, there would be no "Waiting for Guffman" without Guest, who 
came up with the concept, gathered a sprightly group of practiced 
farceurs around him and even brought the arch Corky St. Clair, with his 
goatee, bowl haircut and perennially puzzled look, to querulous life. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   If Corky has a hidden agenda, it's that "Red, White and Blaine" could 
become his ticket to Broadway. He confidently expects the arrival of a 
certain Mr. Guffman, the representative of a powerful New York producing 
organization, sure that his show has what it takes. That may be an open 
question, but "Waiting for Guffman" will inspire no such doubts.

"Inside" is as impressive as it is almost too painful to watch in 
its depiction of the evils of apartheid carried to the extreme. Although 
set in that racist system's final years in South Africa, it is a timeless 
depiction of the horrors that can confront any individual who becomes at 
the total mercy of a monstrous regime. It also makes palpable the fear 
that can consume people in regard to those different from themselves. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Arrested for treason but without being charged, Marty Strydom (Eric 
Stoltz) is thrown into a prison run by a Col. Kruger (Nigel Hawthorne). 
Initially proud and defiant, Marty is systematically beaten so badly 
that--and given the prominence of his family in South Africa--Kruger 
determines to drive him to suicide by whatever means at his disposal. A 
trial for Strydom would only bring further international protests of the 
South African government and exposure of the hideous treatment accorded 
its political prisoners. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Just at the point--about half an hour into the picture--when Kruger 
and his guards' treatment of Strydom is becoming truly unbearable, 
"Inside" switches to the present, with a black official, known only as 
the Questioner (Louis Gossett Jr.), interrogating Kruger in regard to 
Strydom. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As a chamber drama, "Inside" could scarcely have been more adroitly 
filmed than by director Arthur Penn, working with cinematographer Jan 
Weincke and production designer David Barkham, resourceful craftsman 
both. The prison cell door's large peephole becomes the film's dominant, 
oddly obscene image, through which Marty can communicate with other 
prisoners--but also receives blasts of a Mace-like spray. Scenes inside 
cells and Kruger's office are punctuated with shots of the long prison 
corridors, their darkness pierced by pools of light from occasional 
ceiling fixtures. Similarly, Penn uses sound to vary and heighten 
Strydom's terrible predicament. "Inside's" terse 94 minutes is expertly 
paced. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The director of "Bonnie and Clyde," "The Miracle Worker," "Mickey 
One," "Little Big Man" and "Night Moves," plus a raft of Broadway 
successes, Penn has now added another important picture to this list. In 
doing so, he has inspired in his cast electrifying portrayals. Gossett 
gives us a man of controlled rage while Stoltz sustains a thoroughly 
harrowing portrait of a man facing as best he can the most horrible of 
fates. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Yet it is, not surprisingly, Hawthorne's Kruger who haunts you. It's 
not too much to say that Kruger is among the most loathsome, despicable 
men ever depicted in the movies, the very epitome of absolute power 
corrupting absolutely. Kruger is also the very embodiment of Hannah 
Arendt's famous "banality of evil"--a man possessed of a small, closed 
mind but an infinite capacity for cunning. His hatred of blacks is fueled 
by a limitless paranoid fear that, once in power, they will surely treat 
the white man the way the white man has treated them.

Michael Rymer's "Angel Baby" swept the 1995 Australian Film 
Institute Awards in every major category and won at least five other Down 
Under prizes. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   On the one hand, all this acclaim testifies to Rymer's considerable 
skill at shamelessly manipulating audience emotions with a sentimental 
and ultra-romantic treatment of mentally ill lovers, not to mention the 
potent charisma of his young stars, John Lynch and Jacqueline McKenzie. 
On the other hand, such acclaim is not an encouraging sign for the 
once-groundbreaking Australian cinema. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Dark and lean, looking like a twentysomething Sam Waterston, Lynch's 
Harry is a sweet-natured guy who lives with caring brother (Colin Friels) 
and sister-in-law (Deborra-Lee Furness) while regularly attending group 
therapy and taking drugs that keep at bay the voices that only he hears. 
He seems to be doing fine when he meets a new group member, Kate 
(McKenzie). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   She's an auburn-haired beauty with porcelain skin who was raped in 
childhood by her father and whose mental equilibrium is markedly more 
fragile than Harry's. Kate believes she is watched over by a guardian 
angel, whom she calls Astral, who communicates with her through Vanna 
White's equivalent in the Australian version of "Wheel of Fortune." She 
also believes that anybody who touches her blood has instant power over 
her. Both Kate and Harry are slaves to numerology. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The pair swiftly fall passionately in love, and they want everything a 
normal couple wants, right now. Each receives some kind of government 
stipend, and Harry talks his way into a computer job while Kate does 
laundry. They move into an apartment that looks like some sort of 
government housing structure. Harry's relatives and their therapists are 
understandably concerned that they're moving too fast, but they seem to 
be coping--until Kate becomes pregnant. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   There's the makings of a good movie here, but Rymer goes for a 
swooningly romantic Romeo-and-Juliet approach that's sure to turn off 
everyone not caught up in the movie's sugary spell. Rymer tries for a 
love-conquers-all declaration when his story is telling us the reverse: 
that love, wonderful and welcome as it is, is not enough and that those 
with mental problems need to be especially careful about being able to 
deal with powerful emotions and responsibilities. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Rymer piles on the couple's escalating disintegration so extravagantly 
that you find yourself wondering just how much the government tab will be 
for picking up the pieces of their lives. So totally self-absorbed are 
Harry and Kate, and so big a burden do they become on others, that it's a 
terrific relief when Harry's brother finally loses his temper. If only, 
alas, Harry and Kate were as real as Harry's relatives. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   When Harry and Kate make love, which is frequently, they go in for 
lots of lighted candles. When you think about it, love by excessive 
candlelight has become such a cliche that it's got to be a sure sign of a 
bad movie.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
There's a sentimental streak a mile wide in Scott Silver's "johns," 
but it's nonetheless engaging and poignant because David Arquette and 
Lukas Haas bring such vulnerability and likability to the Santa Monica 
Boulevard hustlers that Silver has written with such care and compassion. 
A tragicomic tale, "johns" is a minor film, but it fulfills its 
aspirations. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In interviewing actual hustlers, Silver came away impressed by their 
survival instincts and disturbed by their belief in the impossibility of 
friendship. The film opens with Arquette's John waking up in a park 
without his lucky sneakers, which have his life savings hidden in them. 
These were the shoes that were "going to take me places." John is a 
hustler archetype: a nice-enough-looking, outgoing, none-too-bright young 
man with self-deluding dreams of becoming an actor. We don't know how 
long he's been hitting the streets, but he's definitely beginning to look 
worn and seedy. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In contrast, Haas' fresh, boyish Donner has been hustling only seven 
weeks, learning the ropes from John and falling in love with him in the 
process. The film, which unfolds over Christmas, involves John's struggle 
to scrape up enough money to pay off a $300 debt to the menacing Jimmy 
the Warlock (Terrence Dashon Howard), and Donner's struggle to get John 
to accept his friendship and also to earn enough money to get them on a 
bus to Branson, Mo., where a cousin can provide them work and shelter as 
lifeguards at a resort. Both John and Donner, in different ways, are 
innocents, Donner surprisingly and dangerously so. As the film shifts 
into a countdown mode, it begins to fill you with the fear that these 
two, as they pursue various johns, aren't going to make it out of town 
after all. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Although "johns" grows ever more ominous, there are a number of funny 
moments along the way. Elliott Gould is very amusing as a prissy, 
romantic family man who is one of John's regulars, and so is Harper 
Roisman as an elderly man who picks up Donner and proves to be one tough, 
blunt-talking old guy. Even more deceptive is Arliss Howard's shy, 
stuttering customer, who takes John to a motel. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   There's a graceful flow and an aptly noirish look to "johns," thanks 
to versatile cinematographer Tom Richmond, but you wish that Silver had 
not allowed his cast to become at times so unnecessarily mannered. Also, 
too much is too obvious or too pointedly symbolic--e.g., the Branson 
resort is called Camelot, it is set over Christmas, etc. The film boasts 
a great Charles Brown-Danny Caron score, but some of its songs underline 
the action too heavily. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Still and all, these are familiar, far-from-fatal flaws typical of a 
first feature. On the whole, "johns" augurs well for the directing future 
of Silver, a 1993 American Film Institute graduate.

Pongo, the spotted star of "101 Dalmatians," starts his master's 
shower, gets the morning coffee going, brings in the milk, even turns on 
the computer. With an animal this capable, Walt Disney Pictures should 
have gone all out and let the dog write and direct the movie. It might 
have helped. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   A live-action remake of the fondly remembered 1961 feature-length 
cartoon, "101 Dalmatians" is one of those movies in which most of the 
energy and intelligence has gone into marketing and product tie-ins, 
leaving little left over for the picture itself. Fluffy and mild to the 
point of somnolence, it can't even get the full benefit of its strongest 
asset, Glenn Close's performance as the grasping virago Cruella DeVil. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Played with great style and enthusiasm by Close, and costumed to 
perfection by Anthony Powell, Cruella vamps around in outlandish outfits 
that include the spikiest heels, a stretch limo version of a cigarette 
holder and elaborate gloves with fingernail claws. But her zest for lines 
like "I live for fur, I worship fur" can't surmount the great wall of 
blandness that muffles this movie like a cocoon. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Though Pongo's owner has been changed from a songwriter to a creator 
of video games, "Dalmatians' " core story has remained the same. Once 
again London residents Roger (Jeff Daniels) and Anita (Joely Richardson) 
meet through the good offices of their dogs and end up married quicker 
than most people exchange telephone numbers. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Soon enough there comes the patter of small animal feet, which 
attracts the attention of Cruella (Anita's old school chum in the 
original, here her boss and a fashion designer of some repute). She 
offers to buy all 15 puppies, but an understandably suspicious Roger 
turns her down. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Hardly daunted, Cruella hires a pair of imbecile henchpersons to 
kidnap the dogs from Nanny (Joan Plowright) and add them to her already 
sizable collection. Her object, the fashioning of a one-of-a-kind coat 
from their fur, comes up against a determined effort by an animal 
alliance that includes horses, goats, raccoons and several breeds of dog. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Though the original "Dalmatians" was well-liked despite its simplified 
and now dated animation style, its key elements turn out not to be 
well-suited to this considerably longer live-action remake (as anyone who 
managed to think past merchandising dollar signs would have realized). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   For one thing, what's acceptable in cartoon form does not register in 
the same way with flesh and blood. Jeff and Anita, for instance, merely 
nice in the original, here come off, despite the best efforts of quite 
capable actors, as possibly lobotomized simpletons. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Also, it's in fact more amusing to see 101 cartoon Dalmatians than a 
similar number of live animals. And of course it's considerably more 
horrific to think about skinning real dogs than their animated 
counterparts. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   While the original did have its share of slapstick violence involving 
Cruella's cretinous accomplices, those kinds of vapid pratfall sequences 
are so reminiscent of "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York" that it's no 
surprise to see John Hughes involved as screenwriter and co-producer. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Worst of all, this "Dalmatians," as directed by Stephen Herek ("The 
Mighty Ducks," "Mr. Holland's Opus"), eliminates the original's dog point 
of view, which means that Pongo's arch observations in a superior British 
voice-over about his human "pets" are reduced to a series of random barks 
and face lickings. If that sounds like a doggone shame, it is.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
There's not much rush in Albert Pyun's "Adrenalin: Fear to Rush," a 
dull, apocalyptic would-be thriller. Pyun drives hard as a director but 
as a writer he hasn't nearly enough story to tell, although it is 
possible that his film, which clocks in at 77 minutes, has been trimmed. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Anyway, it's 2007 and there's been some sort of toxic chemical leakage 
somewhere in the former Soviet Union, and the so-called resulting 
"virulent microphage" has spread disease throughout Eastern Europe, 
apparently either killing people or turning them into psychopathic 
killers. As a result, the U.S. has started quarantining immigrants, who 
soon find it's nearly impossible to escape this limbo. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Quarantined in an abandoned, crumbling section of Boston, a young 
woman (Natasha Henstridge) has become a rookie cop but has all but given 
up hope of legally escaping the dangerous and derelict concentration 
camp. Meanwhile, she joins a veteran cop (Christopher Lambert) in a 
desperate pursuit of an infected man who has escaped a mental 
institution, and made his way into a vast system of tunnels under the 
quarantined area. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Once past this elaborate and vague setting-up of the story, 
"Adrenalin" becomes simply the cops' pursuit of the lethal crazy guy 
through a veritable catacomb of tunnels. Henstridge and Lambert work 
hard, but their roles are so one-dimensional and the entire film so 
contrived that "Adrenalin" defies you to pay attention to it. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Sections of Bratislava, Slovak Republic and apparently also Mostar, 
Bosnia, stand in for Boston ruins, which is quite a stretch, to put it 
mildly. The film's biggest plus is George Mooradian's shadowy, inventive 
camera work. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   All told, "Adrenalin," which was not screened for critics, plays like 
an exceedingly pale carbon of John Carpenter's "Escape From New York" and 
"Escape From L.A."

On the walls of Dino's Bar, where almost all the action in veteran 
character actor and freshman director Kevin Spacey's stylishly derivative 
"Albino Alligator" takes place, there are movie posters featuring tough 
guys James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart. The Cagney poster is for the 1935 
"G Men" and the Bogart, presumably, for the 1948 "Key Largo." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The title on the Bogart poster isn't visible, and with a smaller image 
of co-star Lauren Bacall on it, the film could just as well be "The Big 
Sleep" or "To Have and Have Not." But since "Albino Alligator" is all 
about honoring the spirit of old gangster movies, and "Key Largo," in 
particular, we'll make the leap. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Albino's" hotel is Dino's Bar, its Key Largo is modern New Orleans, 
and the storm keeping everyone inside, mixing the combustible elements of 
swindlers, sociopaths and frightened hostages, is the swarm of ATF 
agents--G-men!--who think they have a gunrunner cornered. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Dino's, a basement haunt that's been serving liquor since its 
speak-easy days, is about to close when three men, one bleeding and being 
carried over another's shoulder, burst in. We've already met these guys, 
hoods whose bungled robbery attempt ended in a car crash. Dova (Matt 
Dillon) is their nervous leader, Milo (Gary Sinise) is his injured 
brother, and Law (William Fichtner) is the psycho running with them. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Soon, a gun is drawn, and Dino (M. Emmet Walsh), the bar's 
mush-mouthed proprietor, his feisty barmaid Janet (Faye Dunaway) and 
three customers--a passive young man (Skeet Ulrich), a defiant older man 
(John Spencer) and a mysterious French-Canadian (Viggo Mortensen)--are 
being held hostage. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The screenplay, a first effort by 25-year-old Christian Forte (son of 
'50s pop star Fabian), offers Spacey an opportunity to blend his 
experience from both film and theater. The opening chase sequence is 
exhilaratingly choreographed. When the getaway car slams into another, we 
watch from an overhead camera, and whoever's body it is we see crashing 
through the window and landing on the car in front gets our early vote 
for stunt of the year. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Once the three men have limped inside Dino's, "Albino Alligator" 
becomes a very tight character drama, with the gang members bickering 
among themselves over the fate of their hostages. We go outside now and 
then, to see ATF boss G.D. Browning (Joe Montegna) joust with TV crews, 
but the questions carrying the story are simply who will get out alive, 
and how. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Spacey plays with the story and its characters like a kid with a 
chemistry set, mixing ingredients together and waiting for reactions. The 
most volatile combination is Law, who's itching to go on a rampage, and 
Milo, who rejects any plan that will kill hostages. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   There's another test of wills between Dova, a control freak with no 
ideas of his own, and Janet, who seems determined to push him. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The title "Albino Alligator" comes from a legend, laboriously recalled 
by Law, about the habit of alligators to sacrifice weaker members of 
their own group in order to trap and destroy their rivals. Law offers it 
as advice in a pool game, but it's so clearly intended to set up the last 
act that all we can do is guess who will be asked to sacrifice for whom. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Albino Alligator" doesn't break any new ground for the genre, but 
it's a nice first piece for Spacey. Inevitably, the interior of Dino's 
becomes a stage, and the actors are given to theatrical monologues. But 
the production is so smoothly orchestrated--with fluid camera movements 
and tightly controlled editing--that we feel as if we're in among the 
characters rather than looking on from the orchestra seats. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The performances are all solid, but Sinise, the one with the most 
stage experience, stands out. If Spacey were to have taken a role for 
himself, Milo's the one best suited for him. He left it in good hands.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
Shame on Morgan Creek for changing the title of "Thor" to "Bad 
Moon"! 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   That's because Thor, a German shepherd of exceptional intelligence, is 
the true star of this well-made werewolf movie that's appropriate 
post-Halloween fare. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Thor goes on alert immediately when Ted (Michael Pare) turns up at the 
home of his attorney-sister Janet (Mariel Hemingway), a single mother 
with a 10-year-old son Brett (Mason Gamble), who has fled Chicago to live 
in a house in a forest clearing somewhere in the Pacific Northwest. When 
Ted says to Thor, "We're two of kind," he isn't kidding. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In the pre-credit sequence we see Ted, a photojournalist on assignment 
in a jungle in Nepal, bitten and mauled by a werewolf, which kills Ted's 
lover. Plunged into a "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" predicament, Ted feels 
his only hope in resisting the blood lust that keeps turning him into a 
werewolf is to receive the love of family. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Now Janet is a terrific sister and mother, capable, self-reliant, warm 
and direct, but golly, right away five hideously mangled corpses of 
hikers turn up in the forest. Only Thor senses the great danger Ted poses 
for Janet and Brett. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In adapting Wayne Smith's novel "Thor," writer-director Eric Red, much 
to his credit, plays "Bad Moon" straight. Sure, there are places when 
you'll laugh out loud--what's a horror picture without a little comic 
relief? "Bad Moon," however, is not camp, spoof or a homage to earlier 
movies, although "Werewolf of London" (1935), starring Henry Hull, is 
glimpsed on a TV screen. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Armed with passable special effects and makeup designs that in some 
moments could have been more persuasive, "Bad Moon" is a straight-ahead 
horror picture with exceptionally well-written characters and 
well-directed actors. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Janet is a totally contemporary take-charge woman, and Hemingway is 
outstanding in her portrayal. The same goes for Pare, playing a decent 
man tormented by his losing battle with evil. Gamble's Brett is a normal 
10-year-old boy, upset and perplexed more by the increasing tension and 
anger in his dog than by his uncle's mood changes. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   If any animal can be said to give an actual performance, then it is 
the amazingly expressive Primo as Thor. "Bad Moon" is an unpretentious, 
no-fuss kind of movie that you hope will find an audience.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
"Beautiful Thing," which is two-thirds of a good film, is a tender 
coming-of-age love story set in London's Thamesmead Estates, which has 
bold, dramatic architecture that bespeaks of social progress but has the 
same lack of privacy and small quarters typical of housing projects. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Living side by side are teenagers Jamie (Glen Berry) and Ste (Scott 
Neal), neither of whom likes school or playing rugby, although Ste loves 
sports and is a good swimmer. In short, they're the kind of youths who 
are inevitably described as "sensitive," Jamie especially. That, of 
course, is virtually a code word for "homosexual." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Jamie is uncertain about his sexual orientation but, with every 
passing day, is increasingly sure that he is gay. Ste is into denial 
about his sexuality, just as he is about the abusive treatment he 
receives routinely from his father, a drunken ex-boxer, and his 
drug-dealing older brother. Ste is frequently encouraged by Jamie's 
mother, Sandra (Linda Henry), to stay overnight, which means the boys end 
up sharing a bed and gradually falling in love for the first time. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   This profoundly working-class environment is scarcely the most 
hospitable for gays. Yet Jamie has some pluses on his side. Sandra is a 
tough, vulgar 35-year-old barmaid who dreams of landing a job managing an 
attractive pub with living quarters above it. She is also a fiercely 
protective, loving and intelligent single mother. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   She has a younger lover, Tony (Ben Daniels), a spacey, sweet-natured 
neo-hippie. There is, therefore, a realistic expectation that Sandra will 
be able to take her son's sexual orientation in stride, even though Jamie 
is understandably apprehensive. On the other hand, there is a very real 
possibility that Ste's father or brother will kill Ste if he comes out in 
any public manner. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Director Hettie Macdonald and writer Jonathan Harvey, in adapting his 
own play, do a fine job of creating an engaging, credible film with a 
good mix of humor, affection and concern for its people. There is much 
fine acting, so typical of the British, with Linda Henry a powerhouse in 
portraying the strong, earthy Sandra. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Consequently, it's all the more disappointing when inexplicably, 
two-thirds through its 89-minute running time, "Beautiful Thing" starts 
coming apart and throwing its well-established realism out the window. 
Typical of this disintegration is Linda's abrupt dismissal of the loving 
Tony, who the night before demonstrated a surprisingly mature sense of 
responsibility when he stepped in and saved the life of a neighbor, a 
spunky but pessimistic young girl (Tameka Empson), obsessed with Mama 
Cass, who has tripped out on drugs. (You have to wonder if the film has 
been shortened for some reason.) 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Ironically, "Beautiful Thing," with its credibility, has earned a 
happy ending, the logical one being Linda inviting Ste to live with her 
and Jamie in their new digs. Instead it opts for a sentimental fantasy 
finish. Yet because the film is so effective for its first two-thirds and 
because it has its heart in the right place throughout, audiences may be 
willing to forgive its final third.

"Beavis and Butt-head Do America" successfully brings to the big 
screen those no-brainer nerds who have brought laughter to living rooms 
around the world for nearly four years. There's been much analysis of the 
appeal of the two geeky early-teen virgins who are fueled by raging 
hormones and who'll say anything, much of which is crude, that pops into 
their empty heads. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Yet it seems simple enough: They reassure us that there could be 
unthinking people out there who make mistakes more stupid--OK, as stupid 
as--most of us do, and they're usually hilarious while doing it. Of 
course, with their total lack of inhibition, they'll say things that many 
people feel but wouldn't dare to express, which allows for a satirical 
spin to their exploits and utterances. "Beavis and Butt-head Do America" 
has a great look, placing the boys, drawn in a symbolically rudimentary 
style, against backgrounds deftly evoked with minimal fuss. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Their creator, Mike Judge, who also provides the gurgly voices of both 
guys, and his co-writer Joe Stillman imaginatively send the duo off on 
cross-country adventures all because someone stole their TV set. A 
drunken macho guy in a motel mistakes the two as the lugs he's hired to 
knock off his wife; they in turn think that when they've been signed up 
to "do" her they figure they're about to lose their virginity at last. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   A couple of plot twists and turns later they're running around the 
country with a gizmo sewn in Beavis' pants containing a virus capable of 
wiping out all mankind. You're likely to recognize instantly the voice of 
Robert Stack, who amusingly brings his humorless Eliot Ness tones to an 
implacable agent with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms. Cloris Leachman voices a breezy old lady the boys encounter on 
their travels. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As Judge himself has said, his picture is essentially a road movie, 
and he takes Beavis and Butt-head to a beautifully detailed, sweepingly 
scaled Las Vegas and on to Hoover Dam, where naturally they unknowingly 
open the water channels, and on to the White House. All the myriad 
drawings that depict these familiar settings suggest them with utmost 
economy and lightness of touch but also with a sense of authenticity. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   While Beavis and Butt-head aren't likable, with their ferret-like 
looks and personalities, they have an essentially innocent obliviousness 
that makes you root for them to survive their constant flow of 
misapprehensions, many of them potentially lethal. God must be watching 
over these fools, who are also still basically children.

A Japanese martial arts clan is taught that a white child will one 
day appear to become the greatest ninja of them all. Sure enough, at the 
beginning of the lively, funny "Beverly Hills Ninja," a steamer trunk 
with a white male baby inside washes up on the beach near the clan's 
retreat. But the kid grows up to be hefty Chris Farley.

   Given the name Haru, he is raised by the clan's loving sansei 
(Soon-Tek Oh) alongside the master's own son (Robin Shou). But Haru is 
such a hopeless self-deluding klutz that even his kindly foster father is 
forced to admit in exasperation that, "He's fat, a fool and an 
embarrassment to ninja everywhere." (Didn't anybody think of sending Haru 
off to a sumo wrestling academy?) 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   While everyone else is off to a competition, Haru is alone at the 
retreat when a striking blond (Nicollette Sheridan) shows up looking to 
hire a ninja to tail her boyfriend (Nathaniel Parker) to a meeting at a 
nearby harbor. She explains she's beginning to suspect that he's up to no 
good--and not merely two-timing her. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   A couple of fast plot developments send Haru off to Beverly Hills to 
try to locate Sheridan, convinced she's a lady in distress, and right 
smack in the middle of Parker's complicated international counterfeiting 
schemes. That Haru one night finds himself performing at a topless joint 
is typical of his exploit. (Note: the tops stay on--this is a PG-13 
picture). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   All the elements of "Beverly Hills Ninja" are classic: The overweight 
jerk everyone has written off as a loser persists to win the day--and the 
fair lady. The slapstick and the sight gags come thick and fast, as they 
have throughout a hundred years of screen comedy, yet director Dennis 
Dugan and writers Mark Feldberg and Mitch Klebanoff keep everything light 
and bouncy. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Beverly Hills Ninja" (which wasn't screened for critics) isn't a 
thigh-slapper, but it's diverting and affectionate--a satisfying and 
sturdy vehicle for Farley that ought to please his fans, youngsters 
especially. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Pasadena stands in for Beverly Hills much of the time, as does the 
more picturesque Chinatown for Little Tokyo. But Dugan and his 
crew--ingenious production designer Ninkey Dalton and cameraman Arthur 
Albert in particular--make everything come together. There is in fact, an 
unpretentious, throwaway, let's get-on-with-it quality about "Beverly 
Hills Ninja" that is appealing and nowadays rare in Hollywood 
productions. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   While Farley carries the picture easily enough, with deft turns by 
Sheridan, Soon-Tek Oh and others, he may be a Hardy who needs his Laurel. 
This is the first picture he's done without his fellow "Saturday Night 
Live" alumnus David Spade, and it leaves us wishing that hilarious Chris 
Rock, cast as a sly Beverly Hills hotel bellboy, could have had the 
chance to emerge as a full-fledged sidekick.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
No movie could be more anti-Castro than Leon Ichaso's impassioned, 
operatic "Bitter Sugar," a harrowing depiction of the gradual 
disillusionment of a young idealistic Havana student (Rene Lavan) and his 
tempestuous romance with a beautiful dancer (Mayte Vilan). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Seething with bitterness toward Castro, viewed as a betrayer of his 
people, Ichaso calls for nothing less than the dictator's overthrow. At 
the same time, Ichaso is a strong enough storyteller to sustain his 
fervent protest with an emotion-charged drama punctuated with strobe-like 
collages and an intoxicating Caribbean beat. It doesn't hurt that "Bitter 
Sugar's" stars are talented and spectacular-looking. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Even before Ichaso's point of view makes it clear that "Bitter Sugar" 
couldn't possibly have been shot principally in Cuba, you may already 
suspect that all those Havana establishing shots are framing scenes 
staged elsewhere--Santo Domingo, as it turns out. Nonetheless, "Bitter 
Sugar" is pretty much all of a piece, with its black-and-white images 
contributing at once a serious tone and enabling a smooth integration of 
not only footage from Havana and Santo Domingo but also considerable 
archival materials. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "You must be the last Communist on Earth," remarks Vilan's Yolanda to 
Lavan's Gustavo, but that doesn't stop her from falling in love with him. 
Although naive--but ultimately more in regard to Yolanda than 
Fidel--Gustavo has armed himself in an idealism that persuades him to 
look beyond U.S. embargo miseries to a better day for Cuba. He's been 
able to do this largely because one of his university professors has been 
encouraging him to believe he's in line for a scholarship in aeronautical 
engineering at the University of Prague. (Never mind what kind of job 
opportunities he could expect back in Cuba, should he actually get the 
chance at such training.) 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Meanwhile, his younger brother Bobby (Larry Villanueva) is a rockero, 
a rock musician and political radical who dares to defy brutally 
repressive government policies, and their widowed father (Miguel 
Gutierrez) has discovered that he can make more money playing nightclub 
piano at a hotel for tourists in one week than an entire month working as 
a psychiatrist. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In contrast to the Cuban-made "Strawberry and Chocolate," which strove 
to balance criticism and cautious optimism, "Bitter Sugar" is relentless 
in its depiction of present-day Cuba as oppressive to one and all and to 
young people in particular. Significantly, Ichaso, who most recently 
directed "Sugar Hill" with Wesley Snipes, and all the key players are 
native Cubans, with Gutierrez a major veteran actor on stage and screen, 
until his immigration to the United States five years ago. There's no 
question that some viewers will find "Bitter Sugar" one-sided, but it 
certainly succeeds on its own angry, up-front terms.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
With the zesty "Blue Juice," writer-director Carl Prechezer and 
co-writer Peter Salmi have taken the '60s surfer movie and dropped it 
into a picturesque village on the Cornish coast to create a serious 
contemporary comedy about the trouble men have in growing up. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Tanned, lean and blond, JC (Sean Pertwee) would be just as much at 
home on the west coast of America as he is on the west coast of England. 
A local hero because he once dared to surf the Boneyard, where waves 
crash on lethally rocky reefs, he is so responsive to the eternal call of 
"Surf's up" that he'd rather ride a wave than make love--much to the 
frustration of his beautiful girlfriend, Chloe (Catherine Zeta Jones). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   She's eager to marry him and is beginning to think of buying the 
fast-food cafe she operates when it soon comes up for auction. JC, who's 
planning to surf around the world, finds such thoughts hopelessly boring. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   When JC's surfing buddies Dean (Ewan McGregor) and Josh (Steven 
Mackintosh) "kidnap" another pal, Terry (Peter Gunn), about to be 
married, and arrive from London for some fun and games with JC, the visit 
proves catalytic for all concerned. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Happy-go-lucky, reckless Dean has actually reached a desperate stage, 
prepared to go to extremes to find some kind of anchor in life. A highly 
successful record producer who sold out his artistic standards long ago, 
Josh has become a total cynic, especially about women. Rotund, dense 
Terry, a pub operator, feels he's in love and simply wants to settle down 
but at the same time is eager to please his hell-raising friends by going 
along with them. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Meanwhile, JC is resisting mightily the simple fact that 30 is staring 
him in the face, that in fact he is no longer a kid even if he tries to 
feel like one. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Prechezer hits just the right balance between humor and seriousness 
and is inventive in creating a series of lively, often rowdy and funny 
incidents that constantly reveal character: JC, Dean and Josh are not as 
happy as they'd like to believe they are. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Prechezer's cast is ingratiating and attractive, and "Blue Juice" is 
as buoyant as its terrific rock score. "Blue Juice" ties everything up at 
the end as neatly as "Beach Blanket Bingo," but not before eliciting some 
genuine emotion and driving home some uncomfortable truths.

"Breaking the Waves" is skillful and provocative filmmaking sent on 
a fool's errand. Personal with a vengeance, impressive enough to take the 
Grand Jury Prize at Cannes, it is not an easy film to sit through or 
forget. But what it finally offers is the flimsy illusion of profundity 
more than the real thing itself. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The first English-language film by Danish director Lars von Trier, 
"Waves" is intent on making a strong impression. Laced with tight 
close-ups and whip pans, the picture's in-everyone's-face cinematography 
(shot exclusively with a hand-held camera by Robby Muller) forces itself 
on characters and audience alike. Intentionally claustrophobic, it 
insists on our participation, repeatedly strong-arming viewers into a 
forced intimacy that compels interest without being either believable or 
persuasive. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Breaking the Waves" does have the advantage of a terribly alive 
performance by Emily Watson, a Royal Shakespeare Company actress making 
her film debut. Watson's portrait of Bess, a woman whose ability to 
believe against all reason transforms her life and that of those around 
her, is the always expressive heart of the film and the reason Von 
Trier's effort is at all convincing. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As an examination of the nature and power of faith, "Breaking the 
Waves" was likely influenced by 1955's "Ordet" (The Word), one of the 
last works by Denmark's greatest filmmaker, Carl Theodor Dreyer. But 
where "Ordet's" story of a woman brought back from the dead by the 
strength of pure belief gains power due to the simplicity and austerity 
with which its told, "Breaking the Waves' " similar story feels tarted up 
and even misogynistic due to its peculiar focus on sexual humiliation as 
the path to saintliness. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Weighing in at 2 hours and 38 minutes and broken up into half a dozen 
or so discrete chapter-like sections, "Breaking the Waves" is set in the 
early 1970s on a remote Scottish island, wind-swept and unforgiving. Its 
few inhabitants form a rigid community dominated by a dour Calvinist sect 
so stern it doesn't even want bells in its simple church. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The islanders are especially upset by the presence just offshore of 
amoral oil-rig workers from the outside world. One of them, a hearty 
roustabout named Jan (Stellan Skarsgard), has met and won Bess, and the 
film opens with the preparations for their wedding. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Even at first glance Bess is a complicated creature, headstrong with 
her emotions always close at hand. Subject to intense mood swings that 
have had her hospitalized in the past, Bess has the strength of an 
innocent spirit coupled with a susceptibility that frightens her 
watchful, common-sensical sister-in-law Dodo ("Naked's" Katrin 
Cartlidge), who knows Bess would "give anything to anybody." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Quite apart from this, Bess is convinced she can talk to God and that 
he answers back. The scenes of their two-way conversations in the spare 
church--with Bess taking both voices as the Lord sternly admonishes her, 
"You must be a good girl"--are convincing in their eerie combination of 
schizophrenia and religious belief. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The film's early sections show the marriage and its honeymoon 
aftermath and leave no doubt that Jan and Bess enjoy the kind of active 
sexual connection Dr. Ruth would approve of. But happy as they are, a 
cloud of doom hangs over this couple, fueled by the inevitability of Jan 
having to return alone to his working life on the rig. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Once he goes, Bess demands of God that her husband be sent back. Which 
he is, but paralyzed from the neck down as a result of an accident. 
Depressed and suicidal, Jan finds time to focus on the state of Bess' 
love life, encouraging her to take lovers and then come back and tell him 
about it. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   While this is nominally done with the high-minded aim of setting Bess 
free from wasting her life worrying about him, the possibility of kinky 
voyeurism as Jan's prime motivator is never convincingly disposed of. And 
when Bess starts to believe that her forays into promiscuity have a 
connection with Jan's physical well-being, the puerile nature of Von 
Trier's concerns becomes increasingly evident. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   For although its glum and grueling affect will be a comfort to those 
who want to believe that misery is the handmaiden of art, "Breaking the 
Waves" stands revealed at its conclusion as trite and even juvenile, with 
ideas about women as self-sacrificing saintly whores that are more 
embarrassing than convincing. Shallow where it would be meaningful, 
demanding leaps of faith it has not earned, this film's marriage of 
arresting technique to empty thinking is not unique, only frustrating.

Yale Strom's "Carpati: 50 Miles, 50 Years" is every bit as 
irresistible and poignant as "The Last Klezmer," his portrait of Leopold 
Kozlowski, Eastern Europe's last remaining prewar master of klezmer, 
Jewish folk music. Strom and his cinematographer-editor and co-producer 
David Notowitz traveled to the Ukraine's Carpathian Mountains, once the 
cradle of the Hasidim and home to nearly a quarter of a million Jews, 
whose population has dwindled to less than 1,500 due to the Holocaust and 
subsequent emigration. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Once part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the region became part of 
Czechoslovakia after World War I, and Jewish culture flourished between 
the wars. After World War II it became part of the Soviet Union, ushering 
in a long period of hardship, hostility and injustice for Holocaust 
survivors, and is now part of the Ukraine. Sadly, in the long run, it 
seems that Hitler and Stalin will have succeeded in eradicating Jewish 
life from the Carpathian Mountains. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In the shabby, picturesque town of Beregova in 1994 they met Zev 
Godinger, then 66 and much-beloved as "Uncle Zev," hearty, outgoing ice 
cream merchant. They also meet a clan of Gypsies, who play ancient Jewish 
music as part of their repertoire. One Gypsy musician recalls that once a 
Gypsy family could eat a whole week from earnings from playing at a 
single Jewish wedding. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As "Carpati" overflows with camaraderie and intoxicating music, Strom 
ever so gently persuades Godinger to start talking about his tragic past 
as an Auschwitz survivor, and even to travel 50 miles to his birthplace, 
Vinogradov, which he had not visited in 50 years. He does discover one 
classmate from grade school, but much has vanished, including his home. 
The few surviving Jews do not even own a Torah for his boyhood synagogue, 
just as Beregova no longer has a mohel to conduct a bris. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As he did when he got Kozlowski to visit his Ukrainian hometown for 
the first time in 40 years, Strom avoids the aura of contrivance and 
exploitation through sensitivity, respect and affection for Zev and his 
friends. Strom makes sure that audiences realize that Gypsies were also 
sent to Auschwitz and today survive in often severe poverty, and he 
celebrates their own music as much as the Jewish music they have 
preserved. What Strom, a musician himself, and Notowitz are doing so 
lovingly--and so entrancing--is to record remnants of a culture on the 
brink of extinction. As Godinger remarks, "In 10, 15 years you'll need a 
candle to find a Jew here in Carpati."

<font size=+1><b>Abortion Satire 'Ruth' Plays It a Bit Too Safe </b></font>

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
In theory no subject is off-limits to satire, and the bolder the 
choice the better--provided, of course, you have the talent, imagination 
and, most important, the courage to go the distance. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   With "Citizen Ruth," which tries to skewer the excesses on both sides 
of the red-hot debate over abortion, director and co-writer Alexander 
Payne cops out, and the result is off-putting, despite a sparkling cast 
headed by a fearless Laura Dern in the title role. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Dern is at first hard to recognize as the wasted Ruth Stoops, who in 
her small Midwestern town has been arrested 16 times for "hazardous vapor 
inhalation" and has been in treatment for substance abuse six times. Ruth 
talks a lot about being "in a bad place" and "trying to get her life 
together" but really lives to party and get high sniffing glue or 
whatever else she can inhale. When she nearly overdoses, lands in a 
hospital and then jail, she's found to be pregnant--she already has had 
four children, none in her custody--the judge threatens her with felony 
criminal endangerment if she doesn't get an abortion. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Regardless of the threat, she makes it clear she doesn't want yet 
another kid she's incapable of taking care of, but she's swiftly 
overtaken by the local chapter of an anti-abortion organization, the 
Baby-Savers. A Baby-Saver couple (Mary Kay Place and Kurtwood Smith) pay 
her bail and take her into their home. Place and Smith contribute 
hilarious caricatures of folksy born-again abortion foes, and "Citizen 
Ruth" looks to take no prisoners. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   However, the picture starts going awry early on because Payne and 
co-writer Jim Taylor haven't come to grips with the reality that you have 
to come down on one side or the other of the abortion issue, which 
doesn't allow much in the way of a middle ground beyond chastising both 
sides for exploiting indigent, irresponsible young women like Ruth. 
Basically, you either believe in a woman's right to choose or you don't. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Payne clearly believes in Ruth's right to think for herself, but in a 
stab at fair play he tries to have fun with the abortion rights group 
that tries to co-opt her from the Baby-Savers. He presents that group's 
local leader (Swoosie Kurtz) as an essentially serious, intelligent, 
three-dimensional person, but for dubious laughs he suggests strongly 
that she and virtually all her comrades are gay and are given to 
worshiping a moon goddess. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Payne at least holds his ground with Ruth, at heart an unrepentant, 
foul-mouthed reprobate with survival instincts as strong as her 
self-destructive tendencies, and Dern plays her with gusto and absolutely 
no special pleading. Burt Reynolds turns up as the Baby-Savers' national 
leader, a snake oil salesman if ever there was one, and as his opposite 
number, the abortion-rights advocate head, an elegant, take-charge Tippi 
Hedren.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
"The Crucible," Arthur Miller's play about fear of the devil on the 
loose in colonial Massachusetts, comes to the screen with powerful 
credentials: high-profile stars Daniel Day-Lewis and Winona Ryder, the 
impressive Paul Scofield and Joan Allen in supporting roles, Miller 
himself doing the screenplay and director Nicholas Hytner in his first 
film since "The Madness of King George." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   And the play itself, which debuted in 1953, has manifested a powerful 
durability, selling 6 million copies in paperback in this country alone 
and allowing Miller to recently claim, "I don't think there has been a 
week in the past 40-odd years when it hasn't been on the stage somewhere 
in the world." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But whenever a film has hysteria as its subject, as this one does, the 
danger exists that it will become hysterical itself, and "The Crucible," 
all its promise notwithstanding, falls into that trap with a demoralizing 
thud. Rife with screaming fits and wild-eyed rantings, this film is too 
frantic to be involving, too much an outpost of bedlam to be believable. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Part of the difficulty may be inherent in adapting a theater piece to 
the movies, with Miller himself noting in the introduction to his 
published screenplay that "the play wants to tell, the movie to show . . 
. the stage scene is written to be vocally projected onto an audience, a 
movie scene wants to be overheard." Which makes hysteria on film 
considerably harder to tolerate than in the stage version. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Written with an eye on the anti-Communist witch hunting of the 1950s, 
"The Crucible," as commentators take pains to remind us, continues to be 
of relevance in today's age of mindless homophobia and child abuse trials 
run amok. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   And, especially in its second half, when Lewis gets warmed up and 
Scofield and Allen do the brunt of their impeccable work, the film is not 
without its quietly effective moments. But they are too few and too late 
to make sufficient headway against the rampant tide of frenzy that is the 
film's signature emotion. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The madness starts early, as Abigail Williams (Ryder) and her cousin 
Betty sneak out of their Salem house one night in 1692 and join other 
young girls for a fairly innocent voodoo bacchanal headed by the slave 
Tituba (Charlayne Woodard). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   While most of the girls are content to wish for help with the boys 
they have crushes on, Abigail has darker thoughts in mind. But before 
it's clear what they are, Betty's father, the fatuous Rev. Parris (Bruce 
Davison) stumbles on their group and Betty is so traumatized at being 
caught she goes into a trance. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As modern Americans prefer to blame "the government" for all ills, 
their colonial counterparts put everything on "the devil," and little 
Betty's spell brings to Salem the respected Rev. Hale (Rob Campbell), a 
specialist in Satan and all his black arts.

   Fearful of being found out, Abigail and her teenage friends raise the 
stakes by insisting the evil one made them do it. The new sense of 
empowerment they feel in suddenly being taken seriously encourages them 
to scream and scream again. Soon the town is rife with accusation and 
counter-accusation, as the high-decibel charge of witchcraft is 
manipulated by adults as well as children for their own power and 
property aims.

   And Abigail, the leader, turns out to have an ulterior motive of her 
own. Though she likes to say, "I am but God's finger," she is also the 
recently banished lover of farmer John Proctor (Day-Lewis), who is trying 
desperately to reconstruct his relationship with wife Elizabeth (Joan 
Allen). How far Abigail, flush with her new authority, will go in her 
vendetta against Elizabeth and how John will respond are finally what all 
the shouting is about. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Though Ryder's performance is fatally hampered by the one-note nature 
of her part, her co-star does somewhat better. Always adept at suffering 
and looking here like the brooding hero of "Mohicans II: The Colonial 
Years," Day-Lewis gets to fully inhabit his part only in the film's later 
stages when he attempts to be the community's voice of sanity. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It is no coincidence that both Day-Lewis and Allen, finely drawn as 
the wife uncertain of her husband's love, flourish in their scenes with 
Scofield as Judge Danforth, the somber leader of a tribunal sent to 
investigate the witchcraft allegations. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Using his celebrated presence and commanding voice, Scofield 
emphasizes the sincerity in the judge and makes him a figure of 
formidable dignity and power, able to wring everything there is out of 
Miller's artificial lines. Only in Scofield's scenes can director Hytner, 
whose penchant for high emotion served him better in "King George," be 
persuaded to pitch things at a human level. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Despite these involving moments, "The Crucible" finally seems too 
schematic, more useful as an allegory than as drama, and possibly owing 
that undoubted popularity to its simplistic qualities as much as its 
insights into group psychology. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It's also interesting to note that many of the original stage 
reviewers had similar reservations about the play. The New York Times 
said, "There is too much excitement and not enough emotion in 'The 
Crucible,' " and the Herald Tribune's Walter Kerr called it "a step 
backward into mechanical parable." Those seeing the new film version will 
appreciate the wisdom of those words as much as Miller's.

At the beginning of the provocative, engrossing and often droll 
"Dadetown," the narrator explains that his crew arrived in an idyllic 
upstate New York community to make a 20-minute film called "Small Town 
America: Where the Heart Was," in which its citizens proclaim the 
unchanging joys of life unspoiled by urban ills. "The small town is the 
backbone of America," says one resident proudly. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Unforeseen events occur, however, with the filmmakers ending up 
telling a far longer and far different story than the one they had 
apparently intended. First of all, it doesn't take much probing on their 
part to uncover tensions between the longtime locals and the sizable 
number of newcomers employed by API, a high-tech communications 
corporation headquartered in a large, sleek, glass-clad structure plunked 
down in what was once a beautiful meadow. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The newcomers are clearly better-educated, more sophisticated and more 
affluent than the locals, most of whom are employed at Gorman Metal, a 
venerable paper clip and staple factory, which had its brief moment of 
glory as a World War II airplane plant but more recently had lost a bid 
for an aircraft parts contract. The API families live in lavish new tract 
homes and are eager to bring boutiques and other trendy upscale amenities 
to the town. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   No sooner does API's expansive president state that his company's 
information systems will eventually make paper clips and staples obsolete 
than Gorman announces a drastic layoff that is but a prelude to a full 
closure of the factory within a year. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Management points out that it can have 120 tons of paper clips 
manufactured in Korea, Mexico or the Philippines for what it costs to 
make but 10 tons in Dadetown. API announces smoothly that it will accept 
resumes from the laid-off workers, but it's clear that few if any of 
these blue-collar guys with few or no skills beyond operating 
metal-bending machinery have a hope of being hired. In their frustration, 
ignorance and desperation, the ex-Gorman workers threaten to rage out of 
control, making API the scapegoat. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Thus filmmaker Russ Hexter, who died in April at 27 of an aortic 
aneurysm, establishes a classic predicament in many of America's smaller 
cities and towns, in which sophisticated electronic technology is 
replacing traditional methods of manufacturing, leaving countless 
semi-skilled workers out of work and with no job retraining programs in 
view. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The irony here is that Dadetown is luckier than most: At least API 
assures its survival and promises prosperity but surely the quality of 
life that made the community so attractive in the first place will 
inevitably change. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Alternately disturbing and amusing in its depiction of human nature in 
the throes of crisis and change, "Dadetown" arrives at the Nuart with the 
proclamation: "No one will be allowed to leave the theater during the 
last five minutes of this film," the kind of old-fashioned promotional 
hype associated with schlocky horror pictures. "Dadetown" in fact is one 
instance in which it is essential to stay through the end credits.

Brad Anderson's accomplished "The Darien Gap" is one of the 
strongest offerings in the Grande 4-Plex's ongoing American Independent 
Feature series, notable for its bemused detachment, visual grace and sure 
sense of pace. It's strong enough to deserve a Westside booking. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Lyn Vaus stars most effectively as Lyn, a tall, shaggy twentysomething 
Boston layabout with a wry command of the language and a vague notion of 
making a documentary on his Generation X. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Lyn hangs out a lot, makes only the most feeble attempts to land a job 
and shows up regularly at the city's most au courant scenes, where he 
meets Polly Joy (Sandi Carroll, a vibrant actress), an attractive, 
vivacious and successful fashion designer with a nifty Beacon Hill 
apartment she eventually invites him to share. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Since Lyn is homeless, the prospect of romance combined with a place 
to stay is most attractive to him, yet this new development in his life 
ultimately spurs his process of self-discovery rather than derailing it. 
Despite their mutual attraction and intelligence, they are radically 
different; Polly is as focused and productive as Lyn is not. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As childhood memories, via Anderson's own family's home movies, wash 
over him fairly regularly, Lyn gets it in his mind that he wants to hitch 
down the Pan-American Highway to Patagonia to try to see its mythical 
giant sloths. (He must see himself in them.) There's only one hitch: that 
impassable 80-mile-long Panamanian swamp called the Darien Gap. Yet the 
loonier his dream seems to his friends, the more determined the penniless 
Lyn becomes to pursue it. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Being caught up in his dream causes him to ponder his traumatic 
experience with his father, a failed actor who always solved every 
problem by running off with his family on expensive vacations paid by his 
wealthy wife. The day would come, while Lyn was still a child, when his 
father would leave by himself and never return. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As Anderson reveals the toll that can be exacted upon children of 
divorce, Lyn in turn begins to become aware, like it or not, of how much 
like his father he really is. There's a lot of humor in "The Darien Gap," 
which has a great score featuring underground Boston bands, but even more 
wisdom and reflection.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
Kit Latura, able to absorb enough blows to disable a tank, takes a 
licking and keeps on ticking as the hero of "Daylight." What hurts him 
the most, however, are the verbal jabs from the very people he's trying 
to help, a bunch of sniveling whiners who are not worthy of the man's 
guts and expertise. What's a guy to do? 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As played by the unlikely but always game Sylvester Stallone, Kit is 
the hero as sensitive soul, someone whose skills as a motivational 
speaker and/or grief counselor are as important as his physical 
abilities. Gentle and pleading where protagonists past would be barking 
out orders, Kit prefers saying things like "Don't quit on me" and 
"Together we can do anything" to taking charge. If it sounds screwy, it 
is. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Yet another silly disaster movie, where the special effects are 
believable and the characters aren't, "Daylight" takes us to an 
underwater tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey. Nightmarish enough 
during a normal rush hour, the tunnel turns especially grim when a 
carload of hopped-up jewel thieves collides with a truck smuggling 
contraband toxic material into the Garden State. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Before that happens, we get to meet a lot of people who're going to 
wish they'd taken the bridge. Like the frustrated playwright (Amy 
Brenneman) who can't stomach Manhattan's rats and roaches. And the 
egotistical "it's exhausting being me" sportswear entrepreneur (an 
engaging Viggo Mortensen). Or the kindly tunnel guard (Stan Shaw) and a 
husband and wife (Claire Bloom, of all people) who take their dog to a 
psychiatrist. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   There's more, including a vanload of soon-to-be-escaped prisoners 
(Stallone's son Sage is one), but what is lacking in Leslie Bohem's 
programmatic script is even a single character who isn't formula all the 
way. Those people all died, no doubt, in the explosion that follows that 
mid-tunnel collision. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As orchestrated by director Rob Cohen and Oscar-winning 
special-effects supervisor Kit West, that blast is impressive. A fierce 
wall of flame engulfs the tunnel, sizable pieces of concrete crumble, 
walls collapse, and even Stallone's Latura looks impressed when the whole 
thing falls apart right in front of him. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Though he's currently working as New York's only cheerful cabdriver, 
Latura turns out to have a past as head of the city's Emergency Medical 
Services team. Soon enough he is detouring cars, tying someone's injured 
leg off with his tie and in general saving lives left and right. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It's a good thing Kit knows at once what's going on in the disabled 
tunnel, because no one else in this hectic movie has the inclination to 
explain anything to anybody, especially not the audience. There are a lot 
of shouts and murmurs about something called "the Mid-River Tower," but 
for all we know this might be a piece of real estate recently acquired by 
Donald Trump. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Despite lacking a plan of action, Kit soon finds a way into the 
disabled tunnel (through, in one of "Daylight's" better sequences, a 
monstrous series of air vents). Though he finds ways to cope with all 
manner of disasters, our guy gets no respect from the victims, who prefer 
to obsess about the murky reasons he lost his old job. Maybe driving a 
cab wasn't such a bad gig after all. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Shot extensively in Rome's Cinecitta studio, which had enough space to 
hold a life-size tunnel, "Daylight" is persuasive in its action moments 
but puny in terms of character and dialogue. Anyone who expected anything 
else is probably in the wrong theater.

Taking a scene out of the 1947 classic "Miracle on 34th Street," 
Garry Marshall's "Dear God" sets out here in the predawn of the holiday 
season with good intentions, a load of corn and not much else. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   You'll remember the scene late in "Miracle on 34th Street" where a 
postal employee gets the bright idea to deliver all those stored-up "Dear 
Santa" letters to the courtroom where a man claiming to be Kris Kringle 
stands accused of being nuts. The official recognition by the U.S. Postal 
Service is the little miracle that sets Santa free. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Dear God" burrows into the Dead Letter Office itself, five decades 
later and on the opposite coast, where a cheap Los Angeles hustler named 
Tom Turner (Greg Kinnear) and his oddball co-workers begin whipping up 
miracles for people addressing undeliverable pleas to God. There's an 
anguished mother whose sick daughter dreams of riding a horse. Another 
mother who doesn't have enough money to repair her son's bedroom window 
for the winter. A homeless man who wants the trumpet he'd pawned years 
before. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Like a squad of Stealth Samaritans, the postal workers fan out in the 
impoverished sections of L.A. to selflessly answer God's mail. And as 
word of the miracles gets around, citizens throughout the city are 
suddenly inspired to whip up miracles of their own. But opening mail, 
even in the dead letter bins marked "Santa," "Elvis," "Easter Bunny" and 
"God," is a felony, and Turner ends up in court, like Kris Kringle, in 
need of a miracle himself. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As trite as the framework is, "Dear God" might have been a charming 
holiday film, if only its miracles weren't so trite. Marshall, working 
with an unimaginative script by Warren Leight and Ed Kaplan, sets these 
events up with great fanfare, but there's no real surprise or joy in 
them. The director of "Pretty Woman" has fallen back into the sitcom mode 
of his earlier TV successes ("Happy Days," "Laverne and Shirley") and the 
jokey rhythm, interrupted by thick sentimental pauses, is all wrong. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Kinnear, whose comedy style may be described as Michael Keaton without 
the smugness, is engaging enough as Turner, a horse gambler and big-time 
slacker who takes the post office job as an alternative to jail. And 
there are nice moments between him and Maria Pitillo, playing the 
divorcee for whom he tries to go straight, that showcase his obvious 
appeal as a romantic leading man. But this is a weak choice as a 
follow-up to his well-reviewed debut in "Sabrina." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Marshall intercuts the romantic story line with the screwy antics of 
the dead letter crew. Tim Conway, playing a once-proud postman busted in 
rank for biting a dog, has a high time doing the deadpan burlesque that 
made him so popular on Carol Burnett's television show. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Tired as the material is, Conway is an irresistible trouper, and he 
delivers the film's biggest laughs. Among the other miracle workers in 
the Dead Letter Office are Laurie Metcalf, as a burned-out lawyer with an 
arsenal of facial tics; Roscoe Lee Browne, a failed musician inching 
toward retirement; and Jon Seda, as a self-proclaimed Latin lover. The 
always-entertaining Hector Elizondo has a few good scenes as the group's 
kindhearted Russian supervisor.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
Love in the extremes of wartime. Love in a dangerous, unstable 
universe where questions of nationality and betrayal predominate. Love 
that sears and scars, like the pitiless expanses of the Sahara. Love that 
heals, like the verdant countryside of Italy. "The English Patient" 
explores it all, surely, grandly, operatically. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   A mesmerizing romantic epic taken from Michael Ondaatje's Booker 
Prize-winning novel, "The English Patient" stars Ralph Fiennes, Juliette 
Binoche and a radiant Kristin Scott Thomas in a story that spans two 
continents and a single world war. "The heart is an organ of fire" is its 
theorem, and it's proved with absolute assurance. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Created by writer-director Anthony Minghella, the film echoes the 
Ondaatje book by being poetic at the core. While it inevitably picks and 
chooses among the novel's plot elements, "The English Patient" retains 
the original's elusive, evanescent soul. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It does so especially in the way it reveals itself. Nothing is 
straightforward, no story moves purposefully from Point A to B. 
Delicately calibrated between the present of Italy in 1944 and the past 
of North Africa in the late 1930s, the film's John Seale-photographed 
images create a nonlinear dream-time sensibility, mysterious, exotic, not 
quite of this world. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   And, right from the start, "The English Patient" insists on patience 
where specifics are concerned. The film opens with a ravishing visual 
prelude, as a Tiger Moth biplane, a man and a woman in its open cockpits, 
goes down in flames in the trackless desert. Who these people are, what 
they were attempting and how it relates to the magisterially unfolding 
plot are questions whose answers are doled out with artful restraint. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   That restraint is made inevitable by the partial amnesia of the 
horribly burned pilot, glimpsed being tended to by Arabs just after his 
crash and in an Allied hospital train in Italy near the end of World War 
II. Known as the English patient because of the witty asides ("I'm a bit 
of toast, my friend--butter me and slip a poached egg on top") he makes 
in that language, the man remembers his past only in fragmentary, 
ambiguous flashbacks. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Caring for the English patient on the hospital train is Hana 
(Binoche), a young French Canadian nurse from Montreal. Her essential 
goodness nearly destroyed by combat's unending cruelty and convinced by a 
series of deaths that she must be cursed, Hana decides to opt out of the 
nearly finished war. Taking the patient, her last remaining connection to 
life, and a large supply of morphine with her, she moves into an 
abandoned monastery to await his death. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The English patient's only possession is a worn copy of the Greek 
historian Herodotus. Reading to him from its pages stirs his memory, and 
gradually we discover both who the man under that mass of scar tissue 
once was and what the life he can barely remember was like. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Count Laszlo de Almasy (Fiennes) is a Hungarian explorer, an erudite 
and aloof old desert hand who's a key participant in an international 
expedition sent out by Britain's Royal Geographic Society in the 1930s to 
discover and map the far reaches of the Sahara, including the remarkable 
Cave of the Swimmers and its wall paintings. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Stiff, unbending and rusty at the social graces, Almasy doesn't know 
how to respond when his group is joined not only by jaunty Englishman 
Geoffrey Clifton (Colin Firth) but by his confident and beautiful wife, 
Katharine (Scott Thomas). Her fearlessness sets something off in him, as 
his self-possession is a challenge to her, and their attraction for each 
other, especially when she reads a provocative section of Herodotus by 
firelight, is not in doubt. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Alternating with this in Walter Murch's complex editing scheme are 
increasing complexities at the monastery in Italy, where two men arrive 
independently. Caravaggio and Kirpal Singh, known as Kip, are 
considerably more developed in the novel, but even in their abbreviated 
movie state they are essential to the story's development. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Carravagio (Willem Dafoe) is a thief turned intelligence operative who 
comes from the same Montreal neighborhood as Hana. Mysterious about his 
background and the cause of an injury to his hands, he is surprisingly 
insistent about finding out as much as anyone can about the English 
patient. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Kip (Naveen Andrews) is a Sikh serving as a lieutenant in the British 
Army with a specialty in bomb disposal. Handsome, gentle, fanatical about 
his work, he becomes attracted to Hana, and the course of their 
relationship is a counterpoint to the increasingly complicated and 
passionate liaison between Almasy and Katharine. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Born of heat, lust and dislocation, the romance between those two is 
one of great edgy relationships, a tense forbidden love that intensifies 
as the threat of war increases. Rising to crescendos of emotion usually 
reached only by tenors and sopranos, these characters are the 
beneficiaries of the luminous writing of the novel and screenplay as well 
as the expert performances of the actors, especially Scott Thomas. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   For while "The English Patient" is hard to imagine without Fiennes' 
restrained hauteur and heartbreaking good looks, it is Scott Thomas who 
makes the strongest impression. Usually in the position of stealing a 
picture with her compelling supporting work (as she did in "Four Weddings 
and a Funeral," "Richard III" and "Angels and Insects"), Scott Thomas is 
finally given the opportunity to star here. With her dyed blond hair 
creating a softer Dietrich look, she gives a gorgeous and magnetic 
performance that adds unanticipated new dimensions to an already 
formidable talent. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Finally it comes down to writer-director Minghella, whose modest debut 
film, "Truly, Madly, Deeply," didn't hint at the command of dreamlike 
mood and atmosphere on a large scale he demonstrates here. Though it may 
sound excessive at 2 hours and 42 minutes, "The English Patient" 
captivates as only the grandest and most consuming passions can. The 
heart is an organ of fire indeed.

It remains to be seen whether Eva Peron's impact on cinema will be 
as profound as her impact on Argentina, but she's certainly having her 
fair share of screen time this year. The subject of Alan Parker's 
adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical "Evita," which opens 
Christmas Day, she's also exhumed for "Eva Peron: The True Story," a film 
directed by Juan Carlos Desanzo. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>

   Argentina's official Academy Award entry for best foreign film, "Eva 
Peron" did big box office in Argentina when it opened there earlier this 
year. A weepy melodrama evocative of a South American TV soap opera, the 
film tells its story in very broad strokes; nonetheless, one must credit 
Argentine actress Esther Goris' portrayal of Peron as a vast improvement 
on the figure central to Lloyd Webber's Broadway musical in terms of 
historical accuracy. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   An illegitimate girl from the sticks who clawed her way to the top, 
Evita espoused a political ideology riddled with contradiction. Her power 
base was with the working poor, yet she purged any union leader who 
opposed her and, by the time of her death from cancer in 1952, had 
completely subjugated organized labor to government control. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   She formed the Peronista Feminist Party and was responsible for the 
passage of the women's suffrage law in 1949, but she ruthlessly squashed 
Argentina's system of charities--which were largely run by wealthy women 
of the country's traditional elite--and replaced them with a charity 
foundation of her own. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   She had the instincts of a revolutionary yet insisted on having the 
pretty things that were denied her as a child. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   These irreconcilable drives are central to Goris' interpretation of 
Evita as an angry woman who emasculated her husband at every turn and was 
not above using terrorist tactics. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In the opening scene, we find her surrounded by suited men in a 
conference room snarling, "This is no time for sucking up," to one 
colleague, then snapping, "Shut up," to another. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It's quite a spunky performance, and considering that Desanzo's film 
was made for $3 million--as opposed to Parker's, which was budgeted at 
$60 million--"Eva Peron" may well give "Evita" a run for the money.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
No one seeing "Everyone Says I Love You," Woody Allen's latest 
film, will wonder what's in it for him. What's in it for audiences is 
somewhat more problematical. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The director's 26th film, "Everyone" features extensive location work 
in Paris and Venice and allows Allen, who stars as well as writes and 
directs, to play lush romantic scenes with Julia Roberts and Goldie Hawn. 
All very nice, no doubt, but not anything viewers can take a similar 
amount of pleasure in. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Everyone Says I Love You," however, is also a musical, and that is 
one place where Allen's pleasures and ours coincide, at least for a 
while. Classic American music has always been a passion of his, and here 
he gets to use a whole pile of charming standards like "My Baby Just 
Cares for Me," "What a Little Moonlight Can Do" and Cole Porter's 
"Looking at You" in a bright and unusual way. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Because musicals are the one Hollywood genre that never manages to 
sustain a comeback, Allen's venture is a welcome one and, initially at 
least, the genial, effervescent quality of the movie's songs and dances 
enables us to forgive what turns out to be lacking in the rest of the 
picture. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Everyone's" opening number, with Holden (Edward Norton) serenading 
Skylar (Drew Barrymore) with a smooth "Just You, Just Me," establishes 
several of the movie's conventions. The singing is always pleasantly 
conversational, never showy, and the backgrounds, whether in New York, 
Paris or Venice, are always bright and shiny urban fantasies. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   And when Holden and Skylar end up looking at rings at Harry Winston's, 
the movie's delight in having full-dress production numbers ("My Baby 
Just Cares for Me" in this case) erupt in unlikely settings is evident. 
Still to come is an "Enjoy Yourself (It's Later Than You Think)" put on 
by the recently departed in a funeral home and even a chorus of "Cuddle 
Up a Little Closer" sung in Hindi. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Whenever music and dance are on screen, "Everyone" is consistently 
diverting, but the songs and numbers are progressively less able to 
disguise the haphazard, slapdash quality of the script itself. Much of 
the film's story is half-hearted, its jokes hit or miss, and what starts 
out feeling genial ends up unavoidably thin. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As narrator DJ (Natasha Lyonne) promptly informs us, hers is not the 
kind of family usually found in musical comedy. In addition to sheltered 
sister Skylar, she has a neo-con brother Scott (Lukas Haas) and 
precocious stepsisters Lane (Gaby Hoffmann) and Laura (Natalie Portman, 
who sings a beguiling "I'm Through With Love"). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   DJ's stepdad Bob (Alan Alda)--who likes to say, "Bring my will and an 
eraser," when Scott gets going--is married to DJ's mom Steffi (Goldie 
Hawn). Liberal enough to feel guilty about being wealthy, Steffi throws 
herself into volunteer work, such as a quest for "open prisons" where the 
inmates, among other things, would be free to decorate their own cells. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Although these characters are amusing enough when introduced, Allen 
the writer-director abandons his people at birth (except for a subplot 
about what happens when a Steffi-sponsored inmate played by Tim Roth gets 
out of prison)--the better to concentrate on the part of the movie that 
involves himself. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Allen plays Joe, DJ's father and Steffi's ex-husband, a writer living 
in Paris who worries, in a way Allen watchers have become familiar with, 
about his paltry romantic life. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Visiting Venice with DJ, he sees and falls in love with the lovely but 
married Von (Julia Roberts). But, in the film's most unpalatable twist, 
because DJ has been spying on Von's therapy sessions in New York (don't 
ask), she knows all about the woman's secrets and is able to assist her 
dad in seducing this happily married victim. It's even more unpleasant 
than it sounds. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In fact, watching this smarmy section of "Everyone" unfold, as well as 
a later Seine-side pas de deux with Hawn, it is difficult to resist the 
notion that Allen has concocted some of his recent scenarios ("Mighty 
Aphrodite" co-starring Mira Sorvino also comes to mind) merely to play 
love scenes with the most glamorous actresses he can corral. As the song 
goes, it's nice work if you can get it, and if you're Woody Allen, you 
can get it if you try.

If it's not a sequel, or a remake, what is "Fierce Creatures," the 
long-awaited reunion film of the cast from "A Fish Called Wanda"? 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Kevin Kline, who won an Oscar for his performance in "Wanda," is 
quoted in the production notes as calling "Fierce Creatures" "an equal." 
He must have said that before the movie was finished, before preview 
audiences held their noses and it was sent back for more work. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Fierce Creatures' " release was delayed by about a year while a new 
director, Fred Schepisi in for Robert Young, reassembled the cast and 
shot new footage. Finally, here it is, by no means the equal to "Wanda," 
but a charming mess with moments of hilarity. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The script, written by John Cleese and British critic Iain Johnstone, 
shares nothing with "Wanda," other than their vague pets-in-jeopardy 
themes, and is a far less clever concoction. But the inspiration is 
present in each of the characters. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Cleese again plays a kind of bumbling authority figure, a London zoo 
manager shocked at the attention paid him by Jamie Lee Curtis' seductive 
American. Michael Palin, no longer a stammerer, is a motor-mouthed 
zookeeper with a deep attachment to his pet tarantula. And Kline, the son 
of Murdoch-mocking media baron Rod McCain (also played by Kline) is the 
crazed egotist who doesn't know when he's not wanted. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Vince McCain is a vacuous, simple-minded character with little of the 
irresistible looniness of his ("Don't call me stupid!") Otto in "Wanda," 
and Kline mostly flails around doing shrill physical shtick. He's much 
better as the old man, a flatulent Australian empire builder whose 
buy-pillage-sell philosophy sets events in motion at his newly acquired 
Marwood Zoo. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The task facing Cleese's Rollo Lee is to get zoo profits up by 20%, 
even if it means killing passive animals to make room for the fierce 
creatures the public really wants to see. Naturally, the zoo staff isn't 
up to executing their furry friends, and mutiny is in the air when Vince 
and Willa Weston (Curtis) arrive, as emissaries of Octopus Inc., to take 
charge. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Willa's plan is to develop the zoo as a model for a chain of theme 
parks. Vince wants to merchandise the animals by selling sponsorships to 
their cages (among the sponsors he corrals are Pizza Hut, Panasonic and 
Saddam Hussein) and pocket the income. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The problems uncovered in the preview screenings of "Fierce Creatures" 
are apparent in the film's rambling, anecdotal story line. As in his 
Monty Python days, Cleese comes up with great bits, but there's not much 
forward momentum here. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In fact, the presumably new ending, with Rod McCain showing up at the 
zoo for a darkly comic showdown with his son, seems only distantly 
related to the events preceding it. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Stranger yet, the ending works, as its own extended sketch. It is 
better developed and more controlled, and in ways that can't be explained 
by good editing. The performances actually feel different, especially 
Kline's. It's as if he's finally gotten a handle on Vince and reigned him 
in just enough to make him sympathetic. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   To whomever pulled it together, nice work. "Fierce Creatures" won't 
make anyone forget "A Fish Called Wanda"--or remember it, for that 
matter--but it gets the year off to a good laugh.

Beth and George Gage's "Fire on the Mountain," which launches the 
Grande 4-Plex's "Documentary Days" series, is a most unexpected movie, as 
unusual in its subject matter as in its impact. It calls attention to the 
U.S. Army's 10th Mountain Division and the crucial role it played in 
World War II, showing how its men were transformed by their experiences 
and how they have made crucial contributions to American life over the 
past half century. "Fire on the Mountain" sneaks up on you; you could 
never guess at the outset that it would be so stirring. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Fire on the Mountain" will be followed by "Troublesome Creek," a 
portrait of a Midwestern farming family; "Predictions of Fire," a look at 
the avant-garde art movement in Slovenia; "Champagne Charlie," a study of 
controversial industrialist Charles Bedaux; and "Kids of Survival," an 
account of how a program in art training impacts a group of ghetto youth. 
Each film will play one week. 
<p>

   Less than a month before Pearl Harbor, Charles Minot Dole, who had 
created the National Ski Patrol in 1937, succeeded in persuading 
President Roosevelt to establish a military ski-mountain climbing patrol, 
which he believed could be crucial should the U.S. enter World War II. A 
number of the world's finest skiers signed up, plus many others. All went 
off to Camp Hale in the Colorado mountains for a training regimen that 
would be marked by its sheer ruggedness and by its extraordinary 
camaraderie and equality among its men. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The highlight of the training program was a six-week ordeal in which 
the men had to survive in sub-zero weather, an exercise considered the 
most grueling in all of World War II. The Camp Hale experience also 
yielded such inventions as the snowmobile and nylon rope for mountain 
climbing. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Amazingly, "Fire on the Mountain" gives us the impression that 
virtually everything that happened at Camp Hale was filmed, from 
maneuvers to off-duty high jinks. This gives the Georges much with which 
to work as they interweave the recollections of many veterans, most of 
whom ski to this day. 
<p>

   For quite awhile, it looked as if the men of the 10th might never see 
action. But in December 1944, they were shipped to Italy to rout the 
Germans from the Apennines, a monumental undertaking, also 
well-documented on film. It began with a surprise attack but evolved into 
a brutal, deadly ordeal lasting the duration of the war in Europe. At 
this point, "Fire in the Mountain" shifts gears deftly, and, before we 
realize it, we're experiencing the full measure of American heroism in 
World War II. "Fire in the Mountain" becomes a tremendous emotional 
experience because along the way we've gotten to know so many of the 
veterans. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It brings back those times when we could be unashamedly patriotic and 
profoundly proud of our military men and their sacrifices and 
accomplishments. World War II continues to lodge in our collective 
consciousness as our finest hour. Older white males in American society 
have been criticized so often and for so long as insensitive chauvinist 
pigs it is heartening to see an array of men of such clear-cut decency, 
bravery and unpretentiousness. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The Georges might well have concluded their film with victory in World 
War II. But they proceed to show us how a significant number of these men 
went on to play major roles in the sporting and skiing industries, in 
promoting conservation and in making the wilderness available to the 
disabled. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Many of these veterans returned to the scenes of battle in 1995 to 
join with their former German enemies in the name of world peace while 
marking the 50th anniversary of the war's end.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
Abel Ferrara's "The Funeral" takes us down the familiar mean 
streets of the period gangster picture as if we hadn't been there many 
times before. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Ferrara and his frequent co-writer, Nicholas St. John, typically match 
extreme ferocity (and some raunchy sex) with an extraordinary complexity 
of character and intricacy of plot. In fact, it's safe to say that in the 
American cinema, there's never been a gangster movie quite like this 
dark, dense and intimate film. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Ferrara and St. John have transformed the Mafia melodrama of revenge 
into Greek tragedy with such precision and compactness that you'd think 
they'd designed the film with Aristotle's Poetics in hand. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "They're criminals because they've never risen above their heartless, 
illiterate upbringing. There's nothing romantic about them," Jean Tempio 
(Annabella Sciorra) tells the pretty, stunned blond fiancee (Gretchen 
Mol), describing Jean's 22-year-old brother-in-law Johnny (Vincent 
Gallo). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   His corpse is laid out in a coffin in Jean's parlor in her comfortable 
Victorian home on a pleasant Yonkers street. Johnny had been gunned down 
as he left a movie palace, where he'd been fascinated by Humphrey Bogart 
in "The Petrified Forest" (1936). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   We quickly learn that Johnny's fate is not surprising, as his funeral 
ceremony triggers the flashback memories of his older brothers Ray 
(Christopher Walken), who runs the Tempios' union protection racket, and 
Chez (Chris Penn), a saloonkeeper. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Johnny is something of an intellectual who observes that "the American 
tragedy is the need for distraction" and, more important, he's a 
Communist who in the depths of the Depression has come to believe the 
Tempio family has an outright duty to protect the unions. But a rival 
gangster, Gaspare (Benicio del Toro), proposes that for $1,000 a month, 
the Tempios should ease up on protecting the workers at a factory whose 
owner is eager to make some drastic layoffs because of hard times. Johnny 
won't hear of it. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   When Johnny is gunned down, his brothers and their gang naturally 
assume that Gaspare or one of his men did it, especially when they learn 
that Johnny had been having a torrid affair with Gaspare's wife. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But what if Gaspare didn't do it, didn't even know that his wife was 
two-timing him with Johnny? The point is that the Tempios have been 
conditioned to regard revenge as a sacred duty ever since their father 
ordered 13-year-old Ray, as a rite of passage--the father even compares 
it to a bar mitzvah--to shoot dead a man who had done the Tempios harm, 
as the brothers looked on. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "The Funeral" thus becomes a study of the characters of Ray and Chez 
under extreme pressure to avenge their brother's honor. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Ray, who prides himself on his cool control and unassailable 
authority, nevertheless remarks--peering into his brother's coffin--that 
Johnny's gotten "a good break." Ray and Chez are in thrall to a 
conflicting mix of fraternal grief, Catholic guilt and Mafioso sense of 
pride and duty--a mix that is causing the emotional Chez escalating 
torment and confusion. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Although many gangster pictures are intent on depicting their 
criminals as dumb thugs, "The Funeral" presents the three brothers as men 
capable of the kind of reflection that provides no solace and shows 
Johnny and Ray to be men of clearly superior intelligence, mired in 
deadly family traditions and obligations. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The insightful portrayals by Walken, Penn and Gallo as the Tempios are 
matched by Sciorra as a woman whose two years of college provides her 
with a painful awareness and by Isabella Rossellini as Chez's devoted 
old-country wife. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Del Toro might well have fashioned his Gaspare in homage of Paul Muni 
in "Scarface," so closely does he resemble Muni in appearance and 
demeanor. Indeed, if you could say that "Scarface" was the Borgias set 
down in Chicago, as Howard Hawks described his 1932 classic, then "The 
Funeral" might be described as the House of Atreus moved to the Yonkers 
of 60 years ago.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
"Ghosts of Mississippi" starts by insisting "This story is true," 
words that tend to be a prelude to a frustrating film experience. Not 
because movies are prone to the inevitable condensing and rearranging of 
minor matters of fact--that's a given and of little importance. What 
happens in movies like "Ghosts" is more subtle, and, though 
understandable, less easy to forgive. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The story of the 1963 murder of Mississippi civil rights activist 
Medgar Evers and the attempt to bring his murderer to justice a quarter 
century later is tragic and heroic enough to deserve a wider audience, 
and both producer-director Rob Reiner and writer Lewis Colick must be 
counted as sincere in their attempt to bring it to the screen. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But the makers of "Ghosts of Mississippi" are also children of 
Hollywood, and Hollywood is not set up to tell the truth. Or anything 
close to it. The system turns complex people into paragons or fiends, 
converts subtle situations into emotional slam dunks, softens the edges 
of a story to make it easier to handle, all to quell its own 
institutional fear that anything with the messy taint of reality will 
alienate part of the audience. All of which, to varying degrees, has 
happened here. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   So even if its facts skew toward accurate, the nuances in "Ghosts of 
Mississippi" are all wrong. Unable to resist making things feel pat and 
obvious, the filmmakers have taken the drama out of what should be a 
riveting scenario, leaving nothing for an audience to become involved 
with. And it's made its characters so predictable we half expect to see 
halos over the heroes and the villain twirling a waxed mustache. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It's a further measure of how Hollywoodized this story has become that 
"Ghosts of Mississippi" plays like "A Time to Kill" on Prozac. The two 
films share many plot elements--implacable racists, courtroom 
confrontations, bomb threats to the hero's home, a blond wife who lacks 
her husband's high ideals--but "Ghosts" has smothered the potential 
emotion in reverence and self-righteousness. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   And though early publicity indicated that the first third of the film 
would deal with Medgar Evers' life and death, as it now stands "Ghosts of 
Mississippi" relegates that story to a brief prelude. Instead we're 
presented with another movie in the "Mississippi Burning" tradition that 
focuses on a heroic white person getting his eyes opened about the nature 
of his own and society's racism. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Bobby DeLaughter (Alec Baldwin), assistant district attorney in 
Jackson, Miss., is the kind of guy who doesn't think twice about using 
"Dixie" as a lullaby to quiet his daughter. But then his boss, Dist. 
Atty. Ed Peters (Craig T. Nelson), assigns him to look into the 
possibility of reopening the state's case against Byron De La Beckwith 
(James Woods). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   An unapologetic racist and white supremacist and a man so nasty "even 
the Klan is afraid of him," Beckwith was tried twice for Evers' murder. 
And since "Ghosts" opens with a sequence of him pulling the trigger, we 
know he did it. But two all-white male Mississippi juries couldn't reach 
a verdict on his guilt or innocence, and the mistrials left him a free 
man. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But in 1989 evidence of possible jury tampering leads Evers' widow, 
Myrlie (Whoopi Goldberg), to press for a new trial. And though his staff 
teases him with Lindbergh baby jokes and his wife fumes about her 
position in local society, DeLaughter gets increasingly obsessed with the 
concept of bringing Beckwith to justice. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   This does not prove to be easy. Almost every piece of physical 
evidence has disappeared, there isn't even a copy of the original trial 
transcripts, and Beckwith's alibi witnesses stand by their stories. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But with the help of investigator Charlie Crisco (William H. Macy), 
DeLaughter turns up a thing or two and presses onward, despite the 
initially lukewarm support of Myrlie Evers, who isn't sure how much she 
can trust this son of the South who even has a wife named Dixie. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Normally a warm and funny actress, Goldberg gives the kind of 
preserved-in-amber performance as Evers' widow you would expect from an 
authorized film biography of Mother Teresa. Its embalmed, worshipful 
quality does credit neither to her nor to Myrlie Evers, who in real life 
went on to become chairwoman of the board of the NAACP. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Doing the liveliest job is Woods, who appears initially as the young 
murderous Beckwith and then, with the aid of hours of makeup, as the 
73-year-old accused. It's a showy performance, all sneering and cocky 
twitchiness, and it offers the only hint of life in a somnolent piece of 
business that takes itself more seriously than what's on the screen 
deserves.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
With his handsome and compelling "Hamlet," Kenneth Branagh brings 
the Bard's greatest tragedy passionately alive on the screen. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Instead of trying to compete with such acting and directing geniuses 
as Laurence Olivier and Orson Welles, Branagh does what no one else has 
done before, and that is to present Shakespeare's full text on screen. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   What's more, he has done it with remarkable clarity and meaning, 
resulting in a two-part film with a combined four-hour running time 
presented with an intermission after about 2 1/2 hours. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It is a testament to Branagh's dedication, long experience with 
Shakespeare and sense of the cinematic that he allows us to immerse 
ourselves in Shakespeare's profound meditation on the human condition 
without "Hamlet" seeming as long as it actually is. To accomplish this, 
Branagh has made some inspired and crucial artistic decisions. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   He reset the play to an unspecified year in the 19th century, roughly 
in its third quarter. This brings the tragedy closer to us in time but 
long enough ago for the Shakespearean dialogue to sound natural. It also 
makes for a gorgeous period piece with Tim Harvey's superb sets and 
Alexandra Byrne's equally rich costumes. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Designed in the elegant Scandinavian neo-classical style, the sets are 
dominated by a vast mirror-lined, balconied throne room, enabling 
cinematographer Alex Thomson to encircle and dart around the actors with 
fluidity. To give "Hamlet" epic scope, Thomson (an assistant cameraman on 
"Lawrence of Arabia") shot in 65-millimeter film, to be projected in 70 
millimeters. The Duke of Marlborough's immense Blenheim Palace serves as 
Elsinore's exterior. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Branagh's use of the full text is neither academic nor self-indulgent, 
and it provides a richer context for the tragedy that is set in motion 
when Gertrude (Julie Christie), the queen of Denmark, and her husband's 
brother Claudius (Derek Jacobi) become lovers and poison the king. When 
Hamlet, the king's son, hears reports that the ghost of his father has 
appeared to palace guards, naming his killers, he vows revenge. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The complete text allows a virtually unique opportunity to appreciate 
fully the political setting of the tragedy, with the practical, pragmatic 
Norwegian Fortinbras (Rufus Sewell) waiting in the wings to assume the 
throne intended for the idealistic, reflective Hamlet. It also takes the 
full measure of the perfidy of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Hamlet's 
close friends. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Branagh has described his production as "color-blind, 
nationality-blind, accent-blind," and this approach has by and large paid 
off impressively, but not without a couple of miscastings. Jack Lemmon as 
the palace guard Marcellus, who utters the famous "Something is rotten in 
the state of Denmark," and Gerard Depardieu, in the tiny role of 
Polonius' servant Reynaldo, are too ill-at-ease with the rhythm and 
cadences of Shakespearean English to be effective. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   On the other hand, Charlton Heston, with his extensive experience with 
Shakespeare, is a magnificent, commanding Player King, playing opposite 
Rosemary Harris' impassioned Player Queen in yet another sequence 
enriched by the restored text. Billy Crystal is a rascally First 
Gravedigger, especially sharp in his exchanges with Branagh. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The British actors in the key roles are as luminous as one would 
expect. One would never know that Christie has never before played 
Shakespeare, so perfect a conflicted Gertrude is she, and Richard Briers 
brings serious dimension to Polonius, concerned father to Hamlet's 
ill-used Ophelia (Kate Winslet). Briers reveals him to be unsophisticated 
and naive, rather than the "tedious old fool" Hamlet regards him to be. 
Brian Blessed is a splendid Ghost, but Branagh presents him in much too 
literal a fashion. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Branagh's Hamlet soars theatrically, burning with rage but not with 
much ambiguity and none of the strong sense of the incestuous passion for 
his mother that made Olivier's Hamlet controversial in its day. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Yet Branagh's interpretation of the Melancholy Dane is in keeping with 
his entire approach to the play: to illuminate it and make it as 
accessible as possible to the best of his considerable abilities as a 
director, adapter and actor. Branagh has succeeded admirably in attaining 
his goals. Like Shakespeare surely did, he knows how to put on a good 
show.

"Hype!" is a remarkable first film for L.A.-based director Doug 
Pray. An impressively even-handed documentary on the Seattle music scene 
begun in 1992 and completed four years later, it's a brilliant synthesis 
of social anthropology and entertainment. For those whose knowledge of 
the Northwest music scene begins and ends with Nirvana, "Hype!" is an 
excellent introduction to the roiling subculture that produced that late, 
great band. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   With the exception of Pearl Jam and Soundgarden, the 23 Seattle groups 
showcased in the film are largely unknown, yet almost all are eminently 
watchable. Pray captured some terrific performances in his film, which 
also includes rare, recently discovered footage from 1991 of Nirvana 
performing its signature song, "Smells Like Teen Spirit," for the first 
time. It's a big musical moment. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   However, "Hype!" is ultimately not about music; rather, it's a somber 
meditation on the dark underbelly of capitalism. The freedom that made it 
possible for the Seattle scene to grow is the same freedom that allowed 
it to be plundered, and the plundering that's occurred there during the 
past five years is what Pray set out to chronicle. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Structured in the standard "rockumentary" form that alternates 
performance footage with talking head interviews, "Hype!" derives much of 
its charm from the wonderfully likable bunch of goofballs Pray elected to 
interview. Talk about a motley crew! These are some of the worst-dressed 
people you're likely to see in a film this year, or any year, yet they 
all deliver beautifully articulated, trenchant observations. Apparently 
you have more time to think when you're not worrying about making fashion 
statements. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Seattle's is a very young scene (even the handful of participants in 
their 30s favor the dress and demeanor of nerdy 15-year-olds), and as 
such, it has the strengths of youth--namely idealism, enthusiasm and 
irreverence. One deduces that the reason this scene was so vibrant in its 
infancy was because early on nobody gave a damn because nobody had 
anything to lose. Chaos and silliness reigned supreme then, and the 
unspoken creed seemed to be that the show wasn't over until the hall was 
in shambles. The chaos was benign in those days, and the community was a 
close-knit one with everybody on equal footing. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   With the meteoric rise of Nirvana in 1991 that all changed, of course. 
In getting to know the scene that played a role in shaping that group's 
front man, Kurt Cobain, one gets a glimmer of insight into the intense 
ambivalence about stardom said to have contributed to his suicide in 
1994. Reiterated repeatedly in "Hype!" are the radical notions that not 
every American wants to be rich and famous, and that the musicians in 
Seattle were infinitely happier before their scene was "discovered." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   That "discovery" meant Seattle was devoured by the popular press ever 
on the lookout for the next big thing, and invaded by record company men 
who unleashed a torrent of money into the scene. What else could come 
next but heroin--yes, that came too, and when heroin shows up playtime is 
over. By the close of the film, you get the sense that the hard-core 
music lovers who launched the Seattle scene will carry on bloodied but 
unbowed, but the story in "Hype!" is nonetheless not a pretty one. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   One takes a modicum of comfort, however, in the knowledge that it's 
simply a reflection of the way cultural energy works when it comes to 
music. Vital underground music scenes are the result of a somewhat 
random, roving convergence of forces, and it's easy to list the cities 
this force has passed through--in the past 20 years alone, we've seen it 
happen in Athens, Austin, Minneapolis and L.A., to name a few. "Hype!" 
suggests that the storm has begun to subside in Seattle, so it may be 
heading to your town soon.

A good fiction writer looking for inspiration could do worse than 
to take a stroll through Central Park and just keep his eyes and his 
imagination open. As we used to hear, there are 8 million stories in the 
Naked City, but the hundreds you'll find on any given day in Central Park 
are there for a reason. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Take those old guys over there on the bench, yelling at each other. 
One black, one white. Are they friends or enemies, what are they arguing 
about, and why are they here, day after day? 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Playwright Herb Gardner claims to have happened onto that precise 
scene in Central Park and was so fascinated by the questions and answers 
that popped into his head that he dropped everything else to write his 
hit Broadway comedy "I'm Not Rappaport." The play opened in New York in 
1986 and has been produced all over the world since. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Now, it's a movie, adapted and directed by Gardner himself, 
co-starring wily veterans Walter Matthau and Ossie Davis, and though it 
loses something in the transition, it's a holiday gem. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   So, who are these old guys, as Gardner imagined them, and what do they 
have to say to each other that has captivated audiences on six 
continents? Friends? Not at first. Enemies? Not quite. And why do they 
end up on the same bench every day? Therein lies the tale. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Matthau's Nat and Davis' Midge spend large parts of their days in 
Central Park because it's there, and they have nothing better to do. And 
they share so much of their time together because any kind of 
relationship is better than none at all. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   At an earlier time, Nat and Midge wouldn't have noticed each other. 
But both are now 81, reasonably healthy and mentally alert, and wrestling 
with the overwhelming notion that their lives have become disposable. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Nat's daughter Clara (Amy Irving) is convinced by his erratic behavior 
as the neighborhood rabble-rouser that he should either come to live with 
her family on Long Island or move to a seniors' home. Neither option is 
acceptable to a man still clinging to his self-image as a spirited, and 
useful, revolutionary. 
<p>

   Midge, who's been the superintendent of a nearby apartment house for 
nearly a half-century, is being forced out by the building's new owners. 
For him, that building, and its older tenants, are the only family and 
identity he has.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   So, Nat and Midge use each other as wobbly props, finding through 
their give-and-take some stimulation, through their grudging affection 
some purpose and through a series of dramatic events a sense of 
brotherhood. Among those events: recurring run-ins with a park punk 
(Guillermo Diaz) who extorts money from the elderly in exchange for their 
safe passage; an improbable scheme to rescue a young woman (Martha 
Plimpton) from her ruthless drug supplier (Craig T. Nelson); and Nat's 
histrionic efforts, passing himself off as a lawyer, to scare Midge's 
boss into saving his job. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Gardner would have done well to abandon the drug rescue operation, 
which has Nat dressing up as a Mafia boss and trying to intimidate 
Nelson's streetwise dealer with B-movie dialogue. In a film that is 
otherwise grounded in realism, the idea is preposterous, and the violent 
end to the sequence is much too jolting. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The great strength of "I'm Not Rappaport," on stage and on the screen, 
is what takes place on that park bench, where Nat comes each day to try 
to hook Midge with elaborate hoaxes about his exciting past as, among 
other things, a Cuban spy and a Hollywood mogul. The truth, once Nat 
reveals it, is such a letdown that Midge rejects it out of hand. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   These old pros play wonderfully off each other. It's good to see 
Matthau do something besides grumpy old men shtick with his pal Jack 
Lemmon. You can forget what a fine actor he is. There's plenty of shtick 
for him to do as Nat; the title refers to an old vaudeville joke, and 
there is an air of burlesque to many of Matthau's monologues. But he's 
creating an entire life in two hours, and of someone we come to care very 
much about. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Davis' role is less developed in the script. Midge, to continue the 
vaudeville analogy, plays the straight man to Nat's meandering whimsy. 
But he is also the pivotal character. It is his reactions to Nat that 
move the story toward its subtle epiphanies. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Davis, with that molasses baritone and his darting, intelligent eyes, 
grounds "I'm Not Rappaport" in ways that make that park bench look like 
home to all of us.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
The ridiculous 14 years that it's taken Michelangelo Antonioni's 
sublime "Identification of a Woman" to open here merely underlines the 
timelessness and modernity of one of the world's greatest living 
directors. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   All that keeps it from seeming brand-new is that the color is sadly 
beginning to fade from the inimitable images captured by master 
cinematographer Carlo di Palma. Antonioni has charged those images with 
emotion and meaning through a vision that goes beyond a melding of 
composition, movement and performance and is the mark of great directors 
as different from him as John Ford and Orson Welles. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   That it has taken "Identification of a Woman" so long to arrive is no 
reflection on its quality but on the increasing vagaries of the 
distribution of foreign films that have left fine films by the likes of 
Jean-Luc Godard and Federico Fellini in continuing limbo. "Identification 
of a Woman" has been in good company. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Tomas Milian stars as Niccolo, a successful film director whose wife 
has just left him and who seeks a relationship with a woman that will 
actually mean something to him and who can inspire him in his work. (No 
wonder he stares at a still of Louise Brooks.) Niccolo's quest allows 
Antonioni to contemplate how difficult it is for people in general, and 
men and women in particular, to know each other. Since it's Antonioni 
doing the contemplating you can be sure that there will be an awareness 
of the society, indeed the universe, in which we and Niccolo live. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In the course of this mesmerizingly beautiful film Niccolo pursues two 
different yet elusive women, both exquisite and distinctive. 
"Identification's" tone is sober, as are all Antonioni films, yet we can 
appreciate the irony in the stories of both Mavi (Daniela Silverio), an 
aristocrat with a feline look and poise, and the warmer, more relaxed Ida 
(Christine Boisson). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   No one but Antonioni could have made this film, and the way in which 
it has been staged is breathtaking in its impact. Mavi takes Niccolo to a 
party in an ancient Roman palace with rooms of incredible antique luxury 
filled with magnificently gowned women and formally dressed men. 
Antonioni lets camera movement and cropped images convey Niccolo's 
increasing restlessness and disdain for an aristocracy that he finds 
suffocating. Much later on, the camera will pan up Niccolo's body to his 
face and follow his gaze out a window to peer down at Mavi on the street 
below; moments later the camera repeats the movement to reveal that Mavi 
has gone. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Only a genius could make this sequence poignant and not merely a 
stylistic flourish. That's because Antonioni is able to inspire his 
actors to give of themselves to an extent that they can sustain his 
supremely visual style. He leaves us with the thought that we may have to 
learn to understand the universe before we can have a hope of 
understanding ourselves. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Playing with "Identification of a Woman" is "Blow to the Heart" 
(1981), made by Gianni Amelio and a worthy precursor to such major Amelio 
films as "Stolen Children" (1993) and "Lamerica" (1996). It is a subtle, 
involving psychological drama about a father (Jean-Louis Trintignant), an 
urbane Milan university professor, and his precocious, straight-arrow 
teen-age son (Fausto Rossi). Their relationship becomes strained as the 
son increasingly senses a decided ambiguity in his father's attitude 
toward one of his students, gunned down as a political terrorist.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
As depicted in Richard Attenborough's "In Love and War," young 
Ernest Hemingway is anything but earnest. Cocky, conceited and 
self-absorbed, the novelist-to-be is played by Chris O'Donnell as the 
last person you'd expect to find in love with anyone but himself. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   And in truth there is so little convincing passion in this tepid story 
set in northern Italy during the closing days of World War I that "In 
Love and Snore" might be a more appropriate title. Glossy, genteel, 
conventional through and through, "In Love" likely never would have made 
it this far if Hemingway wasn't one protagonist and Agnes Von Kurowsky, 
the model for the heroine of his "A Farewell to Arms," wasn't the other. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It's Aggie (brightly played by Sandra Bullock) we meet first, a 
26-year-old American Red Cross nurse who looks so pristine that a small 
Italian boy thinks she's an angel from heaven. Devoted to her work, she 
is indifferent to the admiring glances she attracts from older locals, 
though other nurses are not above noticing that "these Italian gents sure 
are gallant." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Some miles away, brash 18-year-old Red Cross volunteer Ernie Hemingway 
(he lied about his age to get in) is bored with his assignment manning a 
coffeepot. So he bicycles to the front lines to hand out cigarettes to 
Italian soldiers and ends up getting shot in the leg, the first American 
casualty in that country. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Naturally Ernie is taken to Aggie's hospital, where she notices that 
gangrene is starting to set in. No slouch in the medical department, 
Aggie applies a new irrigation technique to the wound and even changes 
the mind of the suave Italian doctor (Emilio Bonucci) who wants to 
amputate as a precautionary measure. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   No sooner does Ernie regain consciousness than he starts to put his 
teenage hustler moves on Aggie. Other men are interested in her as well, 
including Ernie's pal Henry Villard (nicely played by Mackenzie Astin) 
and the good doctor, who turns out to be an aristocrat with a palazzo in 
Venice with a heck of a view of the Grand Canal. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But for reasons that three separate screenwriters (Allan Scott, Clancy 
Sigal and Anna Hamilton Phelan) have been unable to make either clear or 
convincing, Aggie has eyes only for Ernie. Never mind that he's a fatuous 
jerk too irrepressibly juvenile for words, never mind that Aggie 
accurately says, "You are such a child, when are you going to grow 
up?"--the movie treats him like the catch of the decade. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Part of the problem is that there is little on-screen chemistry 
between the two leads. O'Donnell's character is so busy being stuck on 
himself that any emotion he directs toward anyone else seems just a 
reflection of that self-love. And Bullock, who looks completely at home 
in period dress, never seems much more than bemused by the person she and 
everyone calls "Kid." Plus the supposed eight-year difference in their 
ages, of which a great deal is made, is not visible at all to the camera. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Adding to this difficulty is the script's determination to spend much 
of its time showing the buildup to this romance and its sour aftermath. 
The actual love affair itself is treated so briefly and cursorily it is 
hard to take it as seriously as we're expected to. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The main source for this story is "Hemingway in Love and War: The Lost 
Diary of Agnes Von Kurowsky" co-authored by the real-life Henry Villard, 
a book that apparently takes the view that this relationship ran into 
problems because Agnes didn't have the courage to keep her commitments to 
a too-much younger man. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   What we see on screen is something very different, not a grand amour 
that floundered but an inconsequential liaison that was obviously never 
meant to be. Instead of blaming Aggie for her lack of nerve, we feel like 
congratulating her for a narrow escape from a life with Mr. Attitude. Not 
even Richard Attenborough of "Gandhi," maybe especially not Richard 
Attenborough of "Gandhi," can make a moving love story out of such 
unpromising material.

cliffhanging predicament after another. "First Strike" is a diverting 
follow-up to "Rumble in the Bronx," which was also directed by Stanley 
Tong and which also had wide distribution in an English-language version. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Relax, have fun," says Jackie's commanding officer, "Uncle Bill" 
(Bill Tung, veteran comedian and perennial Chan sidekick), allowing the 
CIA to dispatch Chan on a plane to the Ukraine, where he is to observe 
closely a beautiful young Russian. Upon the plane's arrival in an unnamed 
city, he dutifully turns over to his CIA contact his notes listing the 
times the woman went to the restroom. He's off to a good night's sleep 
and a return flight to Hong Kong the next day. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Of course, he never gets any rest, because the Russian woman is 
involved in a plot involving a stolen Ukrainian nuclear warhead. In no 
time, Jackie finds himself snowboarding over Ukrainian mountains and 
posing as a stilt-walking priest in an elaborate Chinatown funeral 
procession in Brisbane, Australia, where he winds up fighting for his 
life in a shark tank. These are just a couple of the flashier moments in 
Chan's nonstop derring-do as he pursues a rogue CIA agent (Jackson Lou). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The plot is terrifically complicated, which is typical for the genre. 
That the film has been dubbed into laughably primitive English makes it 
all the harder to follow, but this is ultimately no big obstacle to its 
enjoyment. (This dubbing could pose a problem in Chan's more serious 
films, however.) As always, Chan displays a balletic grace in his 
elaborate martial arts stunts, performed with the knockabout humor of a 
born clown. Interestingly, one of the film's most delightful moments is 
one of the simplest. It occurs when Chan nonchalantly eases himself down 
a brick wall, bracing his legs against a convenient palm tree. Intricate, 
awesome stunts are a Chan trademark, but it's his unpretentious, boyish 
charm that ensures Jackie Chan's position as one of the giants of the 
international cinema.

As a top agent at Sports Management International, Jerry Maguire 
has always wanted more. More clients, more money, a more desirable 
girlfriend, possibly even more phone calls than his daily average of 264. 
Then one day there is no more, and Jerry Maguire can't even guess what 
will happen next. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As a filmmaker, Cameron Crowe has always wanted a different kind of 
more. Starting with his script for "Fast Times at Ridgemont High," he's 
been pushing for more character and less convention, smarter comedy and 
sharper relationships. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But Crowe's quirky debut films as a director, "Say Anything" and 
"Singles," weren't all there, leaving audiences convinced of his ability 
but dissatisfied with the results. Now, with "Jerry Maguire," that 
promise is realized. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   With the cooperation of Tom Cruise, being all he should be in the 
title role, "Jerry Maguire" shows how to use Hollywood stars and 
traditional romantic comedy forms to build something satisfying and 
personal. So much the opposite of high concept that attempts to boil it 
down to a sentence (or a coming attractions trailer) miss the point, this 
is a wholly unexpected film, as heady and surprising in its humor as in 
its emotional texture. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Utilizing an offbeat story arc that trusts us to be savvy, "Jerry 
Maguire" also finds the space to deal with what the worship of money and 
success is doing to cultural values and, almost incidentally, to offer a 
believable look at the pluses and stresses of interracial friendship. Not 
bad for what might be mistaken for a charming little romance. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Crowe's core idea, and one of his shrewdest, was to place all of this 
where it fits best, in the world of professional sports, where honesty 
and trust are suspect and the victory at all costs ethos covers all 
manner of cutthroat sins. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Jerry Maguire is not only of this world, catch-phrases like "no one 
said winning was cheap" allow him to flourish in it. With his practiced 
grin and high-wattage confidence, Jerry's shark-in-a-suit persona is, 
initially at least, perfectly in line with the characters Cruise has 
played in the past--what "Top Gun's" Maverick would look like with 
briefcase in hand. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Then, late at night in his millionth hotel room, something happens. 
Maguire has "a breakdown or a breakthrough" and writes a feverish 
manifesto titled "The Things We Think and Do Not Say: The Future of Our 
Business" that questions his firm's greedhead policies. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Naturally he's fired within a week by protege-nemesis Burt Sugar (a 
cruelly funny Jay Mohr). Making it worse, in a sequence of manic comic 
brio, Sugar works the telephone like a virtuoso, insisting that "it's not 
show friends, it's show business" and grabbing all of Maguire's clients. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Not quite all his clients, it turns out. Maguire still has an outside 
shot at retaining top NFL draft pick Frank Cushman (Jerry O'Connell). But 
the one athlete he has for sure is also the one client he might not have 
minded losing, Rod Tidwell (a brash success for "Boyz N the Hood's" Cuba 
Gooding Jr.). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   A wide receiver in the last year of his contract with the NFL's 
Arizona Cardinals, Tidwell makes up for a lack of height with a 
larger-than-average attitude. A nonstop talker dismissed by his team as a 
locker room malcontent, Tidwell decides that Maguire is the man to 
renegotiate his next contract into the eight-figure range he has no doubt 
he deserves. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Paralleling his lone client is the one person Maguire convinces to 
leave with him when he's drummed out of SMI. Accountant Dorothy Boyd 
(Renee Zellweger), a low-level drone he has barely noticed, and a single 
mother to boot, was so touched by that late-night mission statement that 
she quits and agrees to an uncertain position as Maguire's entire office 
staff. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The kicker for Jerry Maguire in his new stripped-down life is that, as 
all his ex-girlfriends testify, he cannot stand to be alone. "Great at 
friendship, bad at intimacy" is how he puts it, and watching the 
directions his enforced closeness with Dorothy Boyd and Rod Tidwell take 
him is this film's great pleasure. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   While the one-line "hotshot gets fired and faces consequences" outline 
of "Jerry Maguire" is nothing new, the film itself is fresh and 
refreshing due to Crowe's outstanding script (he spent four years on it, 
counting well-spent time for research) and his ability as a director to 
bring everything to life on screen. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Jerry Maguire's" actors are key here, starting with Cruise, who shows 
a willingness to explore the darker implications of his usual persona 
that parallels in a romantic comedy way what John Wayne did in "The 
Searchers." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As loved by the camera as any actor of his generation, Cruise starts 
with the familiar but expands to show his character in extremis, with the 
self-confident grin pushed to the cracking point. It's his ability to 
play this both ways that keeps the question of whether Maguire can become 
a recognizable human being an open one all the way to the end. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The buzz around co-star Zellweger has been intense ever since she was 
plucked from the independent film world to play opposite Cruise, and it's 
a pleasure to say she's worth the advance praise. Sensual and offbeat, 
with great relaxed comic timing and the ability to glow without being 
glamorous, Zellweger's way with the interplay of feeling and humor makes 
her the film's emotional center. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Surrounding these two is a remarkable supporting cast, starting with 
the irresistible Jonathan Lipnicki, the only movie kid you'd really want 
in your own life, as Dorothy's son Ray. Also outstanding (in addition to 
those already mentioned) are Kelly Preston as Jerry's girlfriend, Bonnie 
Hunt as Dorothy's sister and Regina King as Rod's wife, all benefiting 
from Crowe's ability to write characters that are real and distinct, each 
alive in their own particular way. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The argument can be made that Crowe's four films form a chronological 
progression from "Ridgemont High's" teen crises to "Jerry Maguire's" more 
intractable grown-up situations. Yet it's this film's satisfying premise 
that even as adults we're all capable of receiving what the Bob Dylan 
song played over the final credits promises, a little "Shelter From the 
Storm." Even Jerry Maguire.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
Arnold Schwarzenegger is in so much trouble in Brian Levant's 
"Jingle All the Way" that Phil Hartman, playing a smarmy neighbor, 
exclaims, "You can't bench-press your way out of this." Given the leaden 
nature of the material, Schwarzenegger probably couldn't even bench-press 
the script. Who talked the Big Guy into this? 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Jingle All the Way" is "Last Action Hero" without the laughs. It's 80 
minutes of frantic mugging, of silly pratfalls and clown fights, of ideas 
lifted from other children's movies, design schemes from Macy's 
Thanksgiving Day Parade and characters from Toys R Us, all patched 
together without an innovative stitch of its own. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Jingle" is a movie as a catalog of Christmas gift ideas. That parade 
scene, in the streets of Minneapolis, features every perennial from Gumby 
to Winnie the Pooh, plus such recent additions as the Mighty Morphin 
Power Rangers and the stars of "Toy Story," and the film's and the 
parade's star--Turbo Man! 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Turbo Man, a red-and-gold rocket-powered figure, is the new Saturday 
morning superhero and the hottest toy in America. Every dad worth his 
son's adoration bought one early, before it was sold out. Not Howard 
Langston (Schwarzenegger). This father, who may be the only person real 
or imagined to fit the description of workaholic bedding salesman, plumb 
forgot, and with his 7-year-old son's Christmas at stake and his wife's 
patience growing thin, he spends Christmas Eve trying to buy, beg, borrow 
or steal one. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   What follows is a string of slapstick sketches, with Howard and 
another 11th-hour shopper (Sinbad) fighting each other as they scramble 
from toy stores to shopping malls, finally ending up in the midst of that 
very Macy's-like parade. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The showdown, which has Howard inadvertently turned into Turbo Man 
himself, is the only clever device in the film, but the special effects 
are shockingly cheesy for a Schwarzenegger movie. It's as if director 
Levant, whose past triumphs include "Beethoven" and "The Flintstones," 
wanted the movie to reflect the artifice of the plastic toys. Quite an 
aesthetic goal. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The performances are uniformly awful, but in fairness to the actors, 
their scenes and screenwriter Randy Kornfield's dialogue give them little 
to work with. Schwarzenegger has shown a good sense of humor in past 
films, but he is completely miscast in a role that only Jim Carrey might 
have pulled off. The movie's comedy is all physical, and there isn't an 
actor with physical comedy skills to be seen. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Hartman, the star of NBC-TV's "NewsRadio," is a talented comedian and 
impressionist, and he has a few good moments as Howard's next-door 
nemesis, a divorced parent so thoughtful he bought his son both Turbo Man 
and a reindeer for Christmas. But he's playing a character that would 
wear out his welcome in a five-minute sketch on "Saturday Night Live." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In even less effective roles, Jim Belushi shows up as a black-market 
Santa, Martin Mull as a radio station deejay and Robert Conrad as a 
hard-nosed cop having recurring run-ins with Howard.

"Joseph Conrad's 'The Secret Agent' " from Christopher Hampton is 
such a dense, faithful and absorbing adaptation of the great writer's 
1907 novel about an attempt to blow up the Greenwich Observatory that you 
must be prepared to pay exceedingly close attention to it or risk losing 
your way. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   A study in character and fate rather than an exercise in suspense, it 
has a cast as unusual as the film itself, headed by Bob Hoskins, Patricia 
Arquette, Gerard Depardieu, Robin Williams (billed coyly as George 
Spelvin) and Christian Bale. It has the same authentic sense of period as 
Hampton's "Carrington." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   We're plunged into a narrow Soho side street on a dark night in 1886. 
Inside a notably discreet and spacious porn shop, its burly proprietor, 
Verloc (Hoskins), is conducting a meeting of anarchists as his 
mother-in-law (Elizabeth Spriggs) is preparing to move from the family 
living quarters upstairs; a stagecoach awaits her outside. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Although we learn that she no longer wishes to impose upon her kindly 
son-in-law--and also finds it awkward to invite anyone in for tea, 
considering the nature of what the shop sells--we never understand why 
she's moving in the dead of night. But don't let this odd beginning 
distract you. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   For such an ordinary-seeming man, Verloc is leading a complicated 
life, secretly working as an agent for the Russian Embassy but also 
informing the London police. Verloc adores his pretty and much younger 
wife, Winnie (Arquette), who has married him out of a need for security 
for herself and especially her beloved, slightly retarded brother Stevie 
(Bale). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   You have the feeling that despite the husband's lines of work, life is 
pretty comfortable for the Verlocs, with Winnie proving to be a concerned 
and affectionate wife. Then the Russian Embassy's new First Secretary 
(Eddie Izzard, deliciously nasty), a man of surpassing arrogance, has a 
new assignment for Verloc, at once stupid and potentially disastrous. 
Outraged that Britain has become such a haven for radicals, he symbolizes 
the kind of elitist that the Russian Revolution would overthrow 30 years 
later. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "The Secret Agent" becomes a study of how individuals cope with 
calamity as they struggle against fate. Why Verloc would ever involve his 
easily obedient but scarcely reliable brother-in-law defies 
comprehension, and it leaves us with the inescapable conclusion that 
Verloc really is not very bright. At the same time, Winnie proves to be a 
tiger in a crisis but also fatally naive. Depardieu's Ossipon is key 
among Verloc's anarchist friends--a man clearly attracted to Winnie--and 
Williams' Professor, an explosives supplier, is a truly scary 
proto-fascist. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Hampton knows how to get performances out of his cast, with Hoskins 
and Arquette excelling in the lead roles as individuals far more 
vulnerable than either could probably ever realize. Since "The Secret 
Agent" is a work in which irony constantly compounds irony, you wish that 
Hampton had considered taking a step back, slowing down a bit and letting 
it all sink in. As it is, "The Secret Agent" is the kind of film that 
demands you to grab on to it and hold on for dear life.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
At the beginning of the beguiling "Kolya," a middle-aged bassist 
(Zdenek Sverak) is slyly lifting the skirt of his colleague with his bow 
as she's singing "The Lord's Prayer." They are part of a quintet of 
musicians who perform at funerals at Prague's vast Art Deco municipal 
crematory. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Sverak's Louka is a happy-go-lucky, trim, middle-aged bachelor, once 
with the Czech Philharmonic, who lives in a picturesque garret with great 
views of the ancient heart of the city. His standard line, practiced 
mainly with married women, is to pick up a phone and say, "I suddenly 
felt lonely, and who do you think I thought of?" Deeply cynical about 
Czech society and politics, especially as Russian tanks commence rolling 
in at the advent of Czechoslovakia's 1989 Velvet Revolution, Louka is 
determined not to take life too seriously. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Still, he does need a new car, which leads him to agree, for a price, 
to marry a pretty young Russian woman in order for her to gain Czech 
citizenship. But no sooner does the transaction take place than she's off 
to Germany to join her lover, leaving Louka with her 5-year-old son, 
Kolya (Andrej Chalimon). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   You can pretty much take it from there: the nonchalant Louka suddenly 
thrust with the responsibility for a bright, adorable child whom he comes 
to love like a son--and who calls him "Daddy." We've seen this sure-fire, 
heart-tugging kind of comedy many times over, but Sverak, who also wrote 
the script, and his director-son Jan, really know how to give it that 
warm, ironic Mittel Europa charm and subtlety, with a dash of wry 
political satire. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Kolya" is a crowd-pleaser like last year's "Il Postino (The 
Postman)," and the Sveraks, whose "Elementary School" was a 1991 best 
foreign film Oscar nominee, play with your emotions with such finesse and 
shrewdness that you can only admire their skill and go along with them. 
They never go too far, and they know how to use the tumultuous time in 
which their story is set to give it edge and poignancy. Members of the 
Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. apparently thought so too, awarding the 
film the Golden Globe for best foreign language film; "Kolya" is also the 
official Czech Oscar entry. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Chalimon is irresistible, and the deft Zdenek Sverak is surely going 
to score extra points with older audiences simply for showing how 
attractive a man at 55, silver-haired and bearded, can be. With the 
further pluses of luminous cinematography and a soaring, emotional score, 
"Kolya" can't miss.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
"La Ceremonie" is vintage Claude Chabrol: elegant, brisk and lethal 
in its assault on the obliviousness of the haute bourgeoise. The 
self-absorbed, often hypocritical upper-middle class has been a favorite 
Chabrol target for going on 40 years. But his droll, darkly humorous 
thrillers seem ever richer in their characterizations--and, in this 
instance, in the never-stronger sense that time really is running out for 
the privileged amid a widening gap between the haves and have-nots. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Yet in this adaptation of a novel by Ruth Rendell, Chabrol's 
bourgeoise has also never been so discreetly charming. Jacqueline 
Bisset's Catherine Lelievre is a stylish, well-mannered beauty who lives 
with her debonair businessman husband, Georges (Jean-Pierre Cassel), in a 
large, isolated country estate. They both have children from previous 
relationships: Catherine, a son (Valentin Merlet), and Georges, a 
daughter (Virginie Ledoyen). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The Lelievres are very likable people, at ease with their privileged, 
terrifically tasteful existence. Catherine is especially warm and 
winning. She's self-possessed and unpretentious, yet that extra effort 
she devotes to making sure her husband is pleased with the way she runs 
the large household suggests that she may feel that she married above her 
station and must express, perhaps unconsciously, constant gratitude. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Chabrol is such a subtle filmmaker that this may be reading too much 
into Catherine's character, but in any event she is awfully glad to land 
Sandrine Bonnaire's Sophie as her new housekeeper. Sophie is a dour young 
woman, a bit brusque but surpassingly efficient and capable, a real 
self-starter. But when Sophie crosses paths with Jeanne (Isabelle 
Huppert), a post office employee in a nearby village, a disgruntled 
busybody, they form a bond with consequences neither could predict at the 
outset. Sophie grows less pleasant to deal with, but Catherine doesn't 
want to rock the boat: How could she ever replace such a gem? 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Since "La Ceremonie" is one of those pictures you have to be careful 
about not giving too much away, let's just say that it's no wonder 
Huppert and Bonnaire shared the best actress prize at Venice last year, 
creating women the Lelievres have not an inkling about what makes them 
tick--and ticked off. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Too long away from the big screen, in the United States at least, 
Bisset is a radiant and easily commanding presence, as always. And 
Cassel, a New Wave pioneer like Chabrol, is as perceptive and effortless 
an actor as ever. Ledoyen and Merlet blend in effectively with this 
quartet of seasoned screen actors. Clearly the work of a major screen 
artist in all its aspects, "La Ceremonie," which has an evocative score 
by Chabrol's son Mathieu, is sleek--and shocking. It was named best 
foreign film of 1996 by the Los Angeles Film Critics Assn.

For 70 years Al Hirschfeld's whimsical caricatures of theater 
performers and celebrities have enchanted readers, primarily of the New 
York Times, with whom Hirschfeld, 93, only recently signed a contract. As 
Lauren Bacall told Hirschfeld at one of the glittery Broadway openings 
where he's long been a fixture, "You're an American institution." Indeed. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   With Susan W. Dryfoos' "The Line King: The Al Hirschfeld Story," he 
has received the warm, witty and comprehensive documentary he deserves. 
Dryfoos brings to Hirschfeld's life and career unique credentials. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Since 1983, Dryfoos, the great-granddaughter of the New York Times' 
legendary publisher Adolph S. Ochs, has been director of the paper's 
history productions, and her oral history project with Hirschfeld the 
same year became the basis for this film, some 10 years in the making. 
When it was completed, her husband, producer Daniel Mayer Selznick, set a 
deal with Castle Hill to distribute it. (Selznick's grandfather, pioneer 
film producer Lewis J. Selznick, made Hirschfeld head of his art 
department when Hirschfeld was still in his teens.) 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In 87 minutes Dryfoos acquaints us with the vigorous, hearty, 
white-bearded Hirschfeld, who talks easily and humorously of his clearly 
quite wonderful life, which began in St. Louis in 1903 and included a 
sojourn in Paris in the '20s. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   He started out as a sculptor, became accomplished in watercolors and 
lithographs, but it was his flair for caricature that caught famed 
Broadway publicist Richard Maney's attention, thus launching him on the 
career that continues to this day. It's awesome to realize that 
Hirschfeld's drawings span Florence Reed (in "The Shanghai Gesture," 
1926) to the cast of "Rent" and beyond. (Hirschfeld sketches during 
rehearsals.) 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Hirschfeld has traveled widely and has had many rich and varied 
experiences, but the professional anchor of his life has been his work 
for the New York Times, which by the late '20s wanted his contributions 
to its theater section to be exclusive. A Hirschfeld caricature is 
immediately recognizable for airy, feathery scrollwork and, in its 
exaggeration of its subject's features, is notably lacking in cruelty. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Still, not everyone has been happy with Hirschfeld's likenesses, and 
the elegant Kitty Carlisle Hart asks with a good-natured shrug, "Why did 
he have to make me look so ugly?" And when you see the drawing in 
question you do see what she means. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   On the other hand, Carol Channing credits Hirschfeld's caricature of 
her for the revue "Lend an Ear" (1948) with establishing her on Broadway. 
(Hirschfeld says he likes to draw people with highly distinctive features 
like Channing, Orson Welles and Jay Leno.) Katharine Hepburn sees her 
features as perfect for caricature and regards Hirschfeld's treatment of 
her over the years as hilarious. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   After his divorce from the gorgeous showgirl Flo Allen, Hirschfeld in 
1943 married Dolly Haas, the beguiling German actress-singer-comedian, a 
major star in Europe until the rise of Hitler. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Gradually, Haas allowed her career to fade to devote herself to her 
husband, advising him on his work and hosting many a memorable dinner. 
She bore him a daughter, Nina, whose name Hirschfeld traditionally 
"hides" in his work, often innumerable times. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Dryfoos provides exceptional context for her consideration of 
Hirschfeld's extraordinary life and work through a thicket of succinct 
observations from arts critics, friends, colleagues and family--Haas, who 
died in 1994, is a key contributor--plus some of the freshest archival 
footage, including Hirschfeld home movies and travelogues, you could ever 
see. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   There is of course a generous sampling of Hirschfeld's work, which has 
grown leaner over the years. "The Line King" offers a nod to Margo 
Feiden, the dynamic, colorful Manhattan gallery owner who deserves more 
credit than she receives in the film for her longtime role in 
establishing and promoting Hirschfeld as a serious artist and cultural 
commentator.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
Kirk Harris describes Jimmy Ray, the young man he plays in his 
engaging, serious "Loser," as having "nowhere to go and getting there as 
fast as he can." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Yet Harris, in his directorial debut, makes the getting there 
involving. This $38,000 movie is rough around the edges, but it has a 
sound, thoughtful psychological validity and an ever-mounting sense of 
inevitability that command attention. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Jimmy reflects about his late mother: "If she had lived, things might 
have been different. . . . " Unfortunately, she died in giving birth to 
him, and his embittered, alcoholic Viet vet father (Norman Saleet) has 
been an abusive, hating parent. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Nevertheless, both he and his older brother (Jonathan Chaus) still 
live with their father in a drab tract house in a dull, small town (El 
Monte, in reality). Once the brothers shared a dangerous aimlessness, but 
now the older brother has straightened out and is attending junior 
college, which makes Jimmy feel more adrift than ever. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Taking place entirely during one summer day, "Loser" follows Jimmy, 
who is filled with more anger and frustration than he's prepared to 
handle, in his half-hearted attempt to raise the $800 he owes the local 
drug supplier (Jack Rubio). In the wake of a friend's death from an 
overdose, he's been using more drugs than he's been selling. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The strength of "Loser" lies in how Harris has been able to depict 
Jimmy convincingly backing away from any number of possible sources of 
help during the course of the day. Jimmy simply hasn't enough inner 
resources, hasn't had enough love and caring in his life and is filled 
with too much despair to resist proceeding down what he likely knows on 
some level is relentlessly self-destructive. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Harris, who is as good an actor as he is a writer and director, is 
able to make us care about Jimmy without resorting to special pleading. 
(On one count Harris underestimates his ability to tell a story with a 
camera: Too much of Jimmy's soundtrack narration is flat and redundant. 
Erasing all but essential exposition could only strengthen the film as a 
whole.) 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   With his mother having named Jimmy and his brother after her favorite 
actors, James Dean and Marlon Brando, respectively, and with their father 
bearing the name Nick Ray, Harris is clearly going for a "Rebel Without a 
Cause" for the '90s--and he succeeds more than you might imagine.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
For the graceful, poignant "Losing Chase," Kyra Sedgwick signed on 
as executive producer, lined up her husband, Kevin Bacon, to direct and 
got the formidable Helen Mirren to play the juiciest role. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In front of the camera, Sedgwick then proceeded to extend her own 
range as an actress. No one could accuse her of relying on her beauty. To 
the contrary, under Bacon's unobtrusive direction, Sedgwick plays 
beautifully with the considerably more experienced Mirren. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Sedgwick plays Elizabeth Cole, a Sarah Lawrence graduate in creative 
writing who's been hired by Beau Bridges' Richard Philips as a companion 
for the summer to his wife, Chase (Mirren), who is recuperating from a 
serious mental breakdown--"collapse" is her word for it--at their 
spacious, weathered old cottage in Martha's Vineyard. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   You have to wonder if Chase hasn't been released from the hospital 
prematurely. She greets Elizabeth with maximum nastiness and scathing 
contempt. Elizabeth may be taken aback, but she's not daunted. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In time we learn why she's able to roll with the punches as capably as 
she does. Ever so gradually, Chase commences to stop resenting 
Elizabeth's quiet take-charge presence and to respond to her unfailing 
calm and kindness. Elizabeth not only charms Chase's two young sons 
(Michael Yarmush, Lucas Denton) but also reconciles them with their 
mother. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Soon Richard feels he can return to work in Boston. Yet there's a 
hitch: As daily existence in the Philips household grows more idyllic, 
Chase, an unsparingly honest woman, realizes that she is falling in love 
with Elizabeth. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   What happens after this is for sure not going to please everyone. Yet 
if "Losing Chase" strikes you as conservative it nonetheless rings true 
to the lives and characters of its people, which is more important than 
being politically correct. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Losing Chase" evolved as a 90-page novella for a Bard College senior 
project by Anne Meredith, who happened to be a friend of Sedgwick's 
brother Nicco, who in turn brought it to his sister's attention. Meredith 
then adapted her novella to the screen. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In the hands of a lesser actress Chase might seem a little 
underwritten, but the role gives Mirren plenty of space to suggest by the 
sheer force of her presence the plight of a woman of tremendous 
individualistic spirit who nonetheless felt compelled, as have millions 
of other women, to marry a nice, devoted, none-too-imaginative man "just 
to fit in," only to feel her life suffocating her. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Mirren is just the actress to persuade us that Chase could evolve from 
a haggard, hateful wretch to a stable, attractive woman. Chase also 
proves strong enough to enable Elizabeth to confront her own troubled 
past. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As a loving man out of his depth, Bridges is as impressive as Mirren 
and Sedgwick. Yarmush, as the mercurial older son, and Denton, as the 
sweet-natured younger one, round out a potent ensemble. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Losing Chase," which was shown on Showtime in August, is an elegant, 
thoughtful film and an accomplished directorial debut for Bacon that 
inspires admiration and invites reflection.

Larry Bishop, the writer, director, co-producer and featured 
performer of the gangster farce "Mad Dog Time," is the son of comedian 
Joey Bishop, and was in his teens when his dad and his pals Frank 
Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford--the "Rat 
Pack"--were in the prime of their middle-age adolescence. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   This is important background, because with his first film, Bishop is 
doing some sort of hipster homage to the self-adoringly cool style of the 
'60s Rat Pack movies "Ocean's 11" and "Robin and the Seven Hoods." The 
movie's soundtrack features the voices of Sinatra, Martin and Davis, with 
songs recorded in the '60s, and among the ensemble of familiar faces is 
former Rat Pack member Henry Silva.

   "Mad Dog Time" is technically a better movie than those earlier 
pictures. It's better written, more slickly filmed and, with a cast 
filled out by Richard Dreyfuss, Jeff Goldblum, Ellen Barkin and Diane 
Lane, it's better performed. What it's missing is the goodwill that Rat 
Pack fans brought to the theater with them 30 years ago. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Bishop's quirky movie, about the maneuvering for power in a mob whose 
leader, Vic (Dreyfuss), is in and out of mental institutions, has to earn 
the audience's indulgence, and its humor is a bit too precious to 
accomplish that quickly. There's a sense throughout the film, an empty 
feeling actually, that we're not just expected to get the jokes but to be 
in on them. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   For those with a heap of patience and a taste for black comedy, "Mad 
Dog Time" does begin to pay off in the second half. The violence is both 
extreme and extremely over-the-top. The shootouts play like backyard 
charades, with a lot of excessive noise, melodramatic falls and noble 
death-rattle speeches. And, occasionally, some of it is funny. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The story, such as it is, follows Mickey Holliday (Goldblum), an 
unflappable mob trigger-man, as he ices rivals in a series of quick-draw 
duels, tries to balance his day-night affairs with the Everly sisters 
(Barkin and Lane) and keep interim mob boss Ben London (Gabriel Byrne) in 
line until Vic returns from the asylum. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Goldblum's understated cool is the film's great asset. The quick-draw 
scenes, with Mickey sitting across from his opponent at matching antique 
executive desks, are surreal sendups of the western shootout, and 
Goldblum's demeanor is a blend of menace and sexy confidence. It's as if 
Jack Palance had been taken over by the spirit of Cary Grant. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In contrast, Byrne's performance has the subtleties of a roof 
collapse. Ben is all over the place, talking in bad rhymes and mad riffs, 
a raw nerve in search of a sedative. But not even a bullet or 10 can keep 
him down. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Dreyfuss, whose company produced "Mad Dog Time," doesn't show up until 
late in the film, and then has little more than an extended cameo. Seen 
in briefer cameos are Burt Reynolds, in another of his late-career 
reptilian roles; Gregory Hines, as a stylish don; Richard Pryor, as Jimmy 
the Gravedigger; and Rob Reiner, as a cackling taxi driver.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
Some directors envy Alfred Hitchcock's feeling for suspense, John 
Ford's way with westerns or perhaps Ernst Lubitsch's sly romantic touch. 
Not Tim Burton. He wants to be Edward D. Wood Jr. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Best known as the director of the first two "Batman" pictures, Burton 
a few years back made "Ed Wood," a loving homage to the 1950s filmmaker 
considered a colossus of ineptitude for making his own peculiar movies 
his own peculiar way. Now, with "Mars Attacks!," Burton has in effect 
remade "Plan 9 From Outer Space," Wood's signature work, on a budget. A 
very big budget. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Probably the most expensive movie ever to be inspired by a set of 
bubble gum cards, "Mars Attacks!" is also Tim Burton at his Tim 
Burton-est, which means that it's a kind of hipster stunt, with bursts of 
mild humor outnumbered by a retro taste for the bizarre and the weird. 
Why it was thought sane to invest a reported $100 million in such an odd 
and particular sensibility is a question even Martians might ponder. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Given that they're both involved with invasions of nasty aliens, "Mars 
Attacks!" makes an interesting mirror image to "Independence Day." While 
that unintentionally silly film replicated an earnest 1950s sensibility, 
"Mars" is all '90s cynicism and disbelief, mocking the conventions that 
"Independence Day" takes seriously. And while "ID4" wanted you to notice 
its hot new special effects, most of "Mars' " computer-generated work 
intends to capture the visual spirit of the '50s. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Given this mocking quality, it's to be expected that a running theme 
of "Mars Attacks!" is the ongoing stupidity of most Americans, starting 
with President James Dale (Jack Nicholson), who views the ominous 
approach of silvery Martian saucers as a splendid photo opportunity. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Despite grunts of protests from warmongering Gen. Decker (a 
consistently amusing Rod Steiger), the president is encouraged in this 
benevolent line of thought by scientist David Kessler (Pierce Brosnan) 
who smugly insists, between puffs of an extra-long pipe, that "an 
advanced civilization is by definition not barbaric." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Out in the rest of America, people aren't thinking much straighter. 
Las Vegas casino promoter Jack Land (Nicholson again, to less effect) is 
intent on raping the environment while his New Age wife, Barbara (Annette 
Bening), is worried about her chakras. And Topeka, Kan., doughnut clerk 
Richie Norris (Lukas Haas) thinks it's all kind of neat, even as his 
mother growls: "I'll tell you one thing, they're not getting the TV." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   They, of course, are the Martians, and in the imagination of Burton 
and British screenwriter Jonathan Gems they are a duplicitous and 
particularly unsavory bunch who speak in sharp, unintelligible barks and 
bleed green ooze when things are not going well. Despite wonders of 
computer animation, these doll-like creatures never look particularly 
real, which is probably what Burton intended in the first place. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Lots of recognizable names make little more than cameo appearances in 
"Mars Attacks!," including Glenn Close and Natalie Portman as the 
president's family, Martin Short as his press secretary, Danny DeVito as 
an irate Vegas gambler, and Sarah Jessica Parker and Michael J. Fox as a 
pair of rival television journalists who help break the invasion story. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   And, just like Ed Wood, Burton likes to gather together unexpected 
actors he for one reason or another has developed a fondness for. So 
singer Tom Jones and his hit "It's Not Unusual" get prominently featured, 
as do blaxploitation veterans Jim Brown and Pam Grier. Even fellow 
directors Barbet Schroeder and Jerzy Skolimowski are featured in brief 
bits. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   This all sounds clever enough but in truth, "Mars Attacks!" is not as 
much fun as it should be. Few of its numerous actors make a lasting 
impression and Burton's heart and soul is not in the humor but (remember 
the "Batman Returns" backlash) in deadpan postmodern horrors, of which 
this film has a few. A believer in twisted, disaffected camp, Burton 
loves to lure viewers in and then whipsaw them into a lurch of revulsion. 
Kind of like those pesky Martians.

There is a core of substance in "Marvin's Room," and persuasive 
acting to back it up. Which makes it a special pity that the filmmakers 
didn't trust viewers to have the necessary intelligence to figure that 
out for themselves. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Instead of clarity and restraint, Jerry Zaks, a respected theater 
director in his film debut, has chosen to emphasize the piece's gimmicky 
cornball humor. And instead of respecting the audience's sensitivity, the 
film uses an egregiously syrupy score by Rachel Portman to cue every 
emotional response like a sitcom laugh track. As a result the film's 
actors have to fight against the sentimental thrust of "Marvin's Room" 
just as much as characters they play fight against one another. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It's a tribute to how good the film's trio of stars is that they force 
the film to be more natural and honest than it wants to be on its own. 
Diane Keaton and Meryl Streep relish playing off each other as Bessie and 
Lee, sisters who have not been in contact for 20 years, and Leonardo 
DiCaprio, after a mannered start, does equally well as Lee's sullen 
teenage son Hank. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   One reason the actors do so well is that the late Scott McPherson's 
script, based on his admired play, revolves around a pair of meaty 
themes. The first and most apparent is family hatreds, how the anger you 
feel toward close relatives--parents, brothers, sisters, whatever--can 
torment and burn like no other anger on Earth. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The second strain is more slow in developing, but more lasting: the 
benefits of being a caregiver, what the play calls "the gift of giving 
love." McPherson, who died of complications of AIDS in 1992, was very 
specific in interviews about relating this theme to the ongoing epidemic, 
and its notion that people are fortunate to have the opportunity to give 
love even if it's not reciprocated is a powerful one. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Though he's not visible in the play, the film presents us with a 
flesh-and-blood Marvin (Hume Cronyn). He's the barely there paterfamilias 
of a Florida family, bedridden and dying for 20 years, "taking it slow," 
daughter Bessie notes mordantly, "so I don't miss anything." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   For all those years Bessie has looked after her father and her Aunt 
Ruth (a misused Gwen Verdon), a ditsy aunt who is too scatterbrained to 
do anything but watch soap operas. But now Bessie has been diagnosed with 
leukemia, and her best hope of treatment lies in a bone marrow transplant 
from one of three possible donors: her sister and her two nephews. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Always angry and on edge, with the sensitivity and compassion of a 
post, Lee is a hard case who fled Florida when her father had his stroke. 
Now a single mother living in Ohio and hoping to get her life together 
via a degree in cosmetology, Lee's idea of quality parenting is yelling, 
"I said, 'Stop it,' " so it's no shock she's having trouble with her 
eldest son. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Trouble is perhaps too mild a word for what's going on with Hank. Age 
17, he's burned the family house down and is now a resident of a state 
mental hospital. Hank has inherited his mother's mulish sullenness and 
though he agrees to accompany her and his brother Charlie (Hal Scardino) 
to Florida, he refuses to commit to having his bone marrow tested. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Given this as a backdrop, it's to be expected that toes get stepped on 
at the reunion, starting with Bessie's greeting of her estranged sister: 
"Look at you. . . . Are you that old?" Family emotions, as someone says, 
are like a big bowl of fishhooks, difficult to grasp individually. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Though comedy is an intrinsic part of the play, director Zaks has not 
found a way to translate it effectively on screen. All the characters 
inserted for comic variety--from Verdon to Robert De Niro's Dr. Wally and 
his manic brother Bob, played by Dan Hedaya--are more than awkward, 
they're irritating because they get in the way of the film's main 
satisfaction. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   That would be enjoying the ensemble acting as the newly reunited 
family comes to grips with one another. Playing the frumpy, uncertain 
Bess, Keaton is enormously touching, and Streep must have had great fun 
with the bitch on wheels part of Lee. As for DiCaprio, who slides a 
little too easily into the morose Hank's shoes, he too gets more real as 
the film goes on. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Despite the quality of the performances, "Marvin's Room" remains a 
mixed bag. It is too stagy too often, and there is that weakness for the 
obvious, like using a drive by the ocean to symbolize zest for life.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
Since "Metro" stars Eddie Murphy and since it opens in a quiet 
week, this stale action thriller may well attract audiences who can't get 
enough of Murphy or mindless, bone-crunching violence, no matter how 
totally uninspired and credibility-defying the circumstances. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Cast as a San Francisco police department hostage negotiator, Murphy 
is his usual witty, charismatic self, which serves only to underline how 
inferior this film really is. There's just got to be better action 
scripts out there for Murphy, and in the wake of the acclaim he's accrued 
for "The Nutty Professor," he ought to hold out for them. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   By-the-numbers doesn't begin to describe how cliche-ridden Randy 
Feldman's script is. Once past a not-bad opening sequence set in a bank, 
in which Murphy's Scott Roper demonstrates how fearless and skilled a 
negotiator he is, "Metro" pretty much runs out of gas. What story there 
is is set in motion when Roper's pal, a veteran lieutenant (Art Evans, 
ever-reliable), is slain. Sure enough, the enraged and grief-stricken 
Roper is forbidden to work on the case. But wouldn't you know, there are 
more twists and turns involving a vicious and elusive crook (Michael 
Wincott) who manages a $10,000 heist in jewelry from the venerable Shreve 
& Co. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   There needs to be a moratorium on star policemen like Roper bursting 
into squad rooms like a tornado every time they enter and police captains 
who tell such stars they can't work on their friends' murders when we 
already know they will anyway. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Equally predictable is that Roper will be estranged from the woman in 
his life; very few movie policemen over the last 25 years have had 
stand-up wives or girlfriends. Since Roper's girlfriend Ronnie (Carmen 
Ejogo) is a San Francisco newspaper photographer, you would think that 
she would understand how central Roper's work is in his life. You would 
also think that, if she had trouble dealing with this, she'd back off at 
the first hint that her own life could be in danger, instead of drawing 
closer to him. Ejogo deserves a lot of credit for making Ronnie as 
plausible as she does. Not much is made of Roper's new partner, a 
deceptively nerdy type played affably by Michael Rapaport. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Then there's the inevitable set-piece chase scene, which in this case 
involves a runaway cable car--hey, it's San Francisco--and is a stunt 
work tour de force, but which is way out of proportion for this movie's 
meager material. The streets of San Francisco are strewn with so many 
wrecked cars over such a wide area that this catastrophe has got to be 
the city's worst disaster since the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989 or 
maybe even the 1906 quake and fire. Yet no one ever refers to this major 
occurrence once it is over. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   No effort has been stinted in polishing this painfully derivative 
picture as if it were a diamond instead of strictly paste. Director 
Thomas Carter keeps things moving, Fred Murphy's camera work gleams, but 
at three minutes short of two hours, "Metro" seems drawn-out and 
wearying. Well, here's something, at least: It does leave you mildly 
curious as to why the bad guy is called Michael Korda--the very name of a 
noted author and editor in his own right.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
In the title role of "Michael," a beguiling, joyous holiday comedy, 
John Travolta has a great entrance. Paunchy, unshaven, wearing only 
shorts, he clomps down the staircase of an old house in the middle of a 
venerable Iowa motel owned by an eccentric widow (Jean Stapleton). Oh 
yes, he's also sporting a pair of sizable white-feathered wings. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Eagerly waiting to meet him are a team dispatched from a Chicago-based 
supermarket tabloid by its volatile editor (Bob Hoskins): a cynical 
ex-Chicago Tribune star reporter (William Hurt), a good-natured staff 
photographer (Robert Pastorelli), the photographer's dog (who is the 
paper's mascot), and a purported angel expert--an aspiring country 
singer-composer (Andie MacDowell). Whether or not Michael, who says he is 
in fact the Archangel Michael, who dispatched Lucifer from heaven, is for 
real or a fraud, the journalists are to bring him back to Chicago for the 
tabloid's big Christmas story. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Director Nora Ephron and her co-writers, sister Delia plus Pete Dexter 
and Jim Quinlan (the latter two wrote the original story), bring a smart 
contemporary sensibility to the hokum, hilarity and heart-tugging that 
have made for many a classic Hollywood entertainment. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It's a consistently inspired blend of fantasy, romantic comedy and 
road movie as the quartet makes its way by car from Iowa to Illinois. As 
the journey unfolds it becomes clear that the Ephrons, Dexter and Quinlan 
have also written some lovely roles in which the cast is most winning. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Indeed, "Michael" might well prove to be as phenomenal as "Phenomenon" 
for Travolta, who brings out all the sweetness and earthiness in the 
angel--of course, we believe he's an angel--in one delicious scene after 
another. When he's not dancing, barroom brawling, coming on to waitresses 
or fighting a bull, he's boasting about his creations: e.g., marriage, 
waiting in line ("Before that, everybody milled around") and even pie. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   His exuberant message is simplicity itself: Enjoy life to the fullest. 
For all his boisterousness, he's a subtle maneuverer, as Hurt's Quinlan 
and MacDowell's Dorothy, a most attractive couple, are falling in love 
before they know it. Pastorelli is a thoroughly engaging sidekick, 
Stapleton a delight and Teri Garr a boldly arbitrary small-town judge. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Ephron knows how to make every element of the film work for her, for 
on one level "Michael" is an appealing homage to roadside Americana. The 
mood of amusing nostalgia is reinforced by Randy Newman's exhilarating 
score, which incorporates lots of apt standards and a song that's just 
right for the circumstances: "Heaven Is My Home," which he's heard 
singing with Valerie Carter. It's not for nothing that those 
knowledgeable chroniclers of vintage American pop culture, Jane and 
Michael Stern, get thanks in the end credits. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Production designer Dan Davis and his associates have done such a 
spot-on job in re-creating that Americana that the script never has to 
refer to anything beyond Michael's longing to see the world's biggest 
ball of twine or the largest nonstick frying pan. In turn, John Lindley's 
fluid cinematography is wisely unobtrusive: What with lots of starry 
acting amid nostalgic settings there's lots going on visually at all 
times. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Early on Michael explains that he can't change the nature of the 
world, that he can only perform "small miracles." "Michael," which could 
so easily have been too silly or too sugary, is itself a small miracle.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
"The Mirror Has Two Faces," the title claims, and why not? But 
Barbra Streisand, who directs and plays the lead, has only one face, that 
of the star. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   For Streisand's followers, that will present as little difficulty as 
it would for fans of action heroes like Jean-Claude Van Damme or 
Sylvester Stallone. Seeing "Mirror" underlines how reliably Streisand 
provides "Yes, I Can" wish-fulfillment fantasies for the emotionally 
downtrodden that parallel what Sly and the Muscles From Brussels do for 
the physically limited. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   For those not under Streisand's spell, however, her insistence on 
being always alluring makes "The Mirror Has Two Faces" more 
problematical. Because it is just Streisand's inability to show herself 
in a less than flattering light that undermines the dramatic structure of 
the story she is apparently trying to tell. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Written by Richard LaGravenese and based loosely on a 1959 French film 
with the same name, "Mirror" is a romantic comedy that looks to be about 
a frumpy duckling who doesn't know she's beautiful enough to be a 
potential swan. It's a time-tested concept that is sandbagged by 
Streisand's refusal to play it more like an actress and less like a star. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In fairness, Streisand tries to be bedraggled for a bit. Columbia 
University professor Rose Morgan is introduced wearing an unflattering 
facial mask, and in short order has to cope with her madcap meddling 
mother (Lauren Bacall) and a whiny and persistent suitor (Austin 
Pendleton). And when she goes to the wedding of glamorous sister Claire 
(Mimi Rogers) to handsome Alex (Pierce Brosnan), she wears an outfit that 
is strictly thrift shop. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But a classroom scene that explodes with the intensity of mass student 
worship announces the end of that experiment. Even though the script 
continues to treat her like she's a doormat, Streisand's Rose, as 
photographed by Dante Spinotti and his replacement Andrzej Bartkowiak, 
never looks less than the accomplished and attractive woman she is. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Given this, it makes no kind of sense that fellow Columbia professor 
Gregory Larkin (Jeff Bridges) would pick Rose's photograph (sent in by 
Claire) from a pile of answers to his personal ad specifically because 
there was no chance of falling in love with her. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   (This is not, parenthetically, a gender-based problem. One of the 
difficulties with the recent remake of "Sabrina" is that while William 
Holden was indisputably hunkier than Humphrey Bogart in the original, it 
needs a lot more than a homburg hat and a pair of glasses to make 
Harrison Ford look less desirable than Greg Kinnear.) 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Why a handsome guy like Gregory Larkin would place a personal ad 
searching for companionship only is another story. A bow-tied professor 
of mathematics, Gregory has taken 14 years to write his latest book, 
"Absolute Truth?," because being in a physically exciting relationship 
flusters him to the point of paralysis. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Looking for a platonic coupling that will enable him to forget about 
the demons of the flesh, the professor thinks he's found a kindred soul 
when he investigates Rose by sitting in on one of her classes and hears 
her speak fondly of the traditions of courtly love: "They took sex out of 
the relationship. What was left was a union of souls." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Though her thoughts are not as pure as Gregory wants to believe, a 
friendship-based relationship, equal parts snowball fights and 
discussions of the Twin Primes Conjecture, works well enough for awhile. 
But Hollywood wouldn't be Hollywood if it didn't insist that complicating 
thoughts of sex find a way to force themselves back into the equation. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As an actor Streisand proves again that she's an experienced farceur 
who knows how to handle her laugh lines. And as a director she 
concentrates on pleasing her fans by placing herself in archetypal 
revenge situations, including giving the boot to a guy she thought she 
wanted when he finally comes around, and, in the scene the film was 
constructed around, finally presenting herself out of the chrysalis, 
looking more glamorous than all the other women in the cast combined.

   Aside from this, "The Mirror Has Two Faces" is more stodgy than 
frothy, weighted down by several dramatic speeches about what's important 
in life that feel tacked on. Applause should go to Jeff Bridges, who does 
the best he can with his ability to be anybody in a film constructed 
around a performer who finally can only be herself.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
In the title role of Albert Brooks' "Mother," Debbie Reynolds 
returns to the screen triumphantly in a major role for the first time in 
27 years. Reynolds, who remains a Las Vegas star trouper, is fondly 
remembered for the classic "Singin' in the Rain" (1952) and for her 
tremendous screen popularity, especially in the '50s, in other musicals 
and frothy comedies. Only rarely has she had the chance to reveal a more 
serious side, and "Mother"--although it, too, is a comedy--is one of 
those times. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Brooks, who wrote his script with Monica Johnson, casts himself as an 
L.A.-based science-fiction novelist, John Henderson, who's just gone 
through his second divorce and is beginning to suspect that there's a 
connection between his distant relationship with his mother and his 
failures with women. What to do but hit the road and return home to his 
widowed mother, Beatrice (Reynolds), at her comfortable family home in 
Marin County? 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Pretty, 60-plus Beatrice seems glad enough to see her son but is taken 
aback at his determination to reconstruct his old room and settle in 
until he feels he's straightened himself out. The results are funny yet 
tremendously telling: This is not only one of Reynolds' best movies but 
also one of Brooks' best efforts. What wonderful powers of observation 
Brooks has, and what a knack he has for reminding us of how people 
allow--and use--petty annoyances with one another to distract them from 
truly connecting on important levels. His and Johnson's script gets it 
right from the beginning with mother and son differing over the merits of 
not eating meat and how long you can freeze a salad. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Gradually--and without losing its sense of humor--"Mother" makes us 
aware of how easy it is for parents and children not really to know one 
another. John seems to be reasonably successful as a writer but is not as 
rich or as close to his mother as his younger brother Jeff (Rob Morrow, 
very funny), an aggressive sports agent who is married with two children. 
To be sure, John eventually uncovers what he believes to be a significant 
reason why his mother may unconsciously resent him, but the real point is 
that John simply needs to get to know his mother much better than he 
does, to feel that she may actually love him, in order to understand and 
feel better about himself. Beatrice, in turn, might benefit as well. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   All this unfolds in an essentially comic mode that takes a bemused 
look at Beatrice, opinionated, set in her ways, baffled by electronics, a 
bit distracted and absent-minded. Yet there's nothing cutesy in Reynolds' 
performance. Her Beatrice can be defensive, adept at deflating her son, 
and is amusing in her seemingly supreme imperturbability, yet underneath 
there's a strong, honest woman. Reynolds' self-confidence and old pro's 
perfect timing play beautifully against Brooks' usual neurotic mensch 
character. (At 49, Brooks is a little old to pass for 40; Reynolds is a 
sensational-looking 64.) 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   This well-crafted film is exceedingly sensitive, balanced and scaled 
in all its aspects. Everything is in proportion, nothing seems forced or 
excessive, and "Mother" achieves the quality of effortlessness that is 
the mark of true art.

If you suspect that U.S. presidents spend more time thinking about 
who they are and how they can exploit their job than on running the 
office, your cynicism will jibe nicely with that of Peter Segal's "My 
Fellow Americans." Of the four egocentric presidents we meet in the 
course of the movie, two are feather-nesting felons, one is an abject 
whiner and the last is a womanizer who seems to have gotten elected by 
kissing babes. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   And this is not a true story. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "My Fellow Americans" is a gang-written comedy that doesn't have a 
political bone in its body, or much evidence of a funny one, either. It's 
an "Odd Couple"-style buddy movie about of a pair of mutually loathing 
ex-presidents forced to team up against a White House conspiracy to have 
them killed. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Judging by the amount of up-yours! dialogue, the script was almost 
certainly written with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau in mind. And Lemmon 
is on hand, as that penny-pinching whiner Russell P. Kramer (R-Ohio). But 
what would be the Matthau role, arrogant lecher Matthew Douglas 
(D-Mass.), is filled instead by James Garner. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The switch is not bad. Garner is a good light-comedy actor, too seldom 
seen in film, and he adds elements of charm, physical stature and good 
looks that make him far better suited to his Kennedyesque character than 
the rumpled Matthau would be. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Nevertheless, the movie plays exactly like the half dozen 
Lemmon-Matthau movies, with two contrasting personalities badgering each 
other while fighting to conceal pangs of affection. Think of "My Fellow 
Americans" as "Grumpy Ex-Presidents," and you've got the picture. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   When we join them, Kramer and Douglas, career rivals who have beaten 
each other in back-to-back presidential races, are deep into post-power 
depression, whiling away their time writing irrelevant books and trying 
to figure out how they lost faith with the people. Meanwhile, current 
President William Haney (Dan Aykroyd) is facing even bigger troubles: An 
old kickback scheme is about to resurface, and his advisors are offering 
to cook some books and deflect the blame to Kramer. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   After some incredulous quick twists and turns, Kramer and Douglas find 
themselves stranded in the backwoods of the Deep South, trying to avoid 
armies of pinstriped agents and get back to Washington to blow the 
whistle. On the way, they'll meet true citizens of every stripe, 
including gay marchers and lesbian bikers, and endure almost every cliche 
of the on-the-road buddy movie--all the while hurling adolescent slams at 
each other that would amuse only Beavis and Butt-head. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Why, after the Nixon tapes and the Kennedy exposes, anyone would be 
shocked to hear presidents swear or show open lust is a mystery, but 
we'll pause here to acknowledge this truly historical moment in political 
film comedy: 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "My Fellow Americans" is the second movie in a week to wring a joke 
out of JFK's White House assignations. In "Mars Attacks!," a leering 
staff assistant guides a voluptuous woman (in fact, a Martian in drag) to 
the "Kennedy Room," which is equipped with stereo and a circular bed. 
Here, Garner's President Douglas confides to Kramer that he'd enjoyed 
quickies behind the hidden "Kennedy door" in the presidential study. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   There are, amid the pratfalls and penis jokes, a few harmless laughs. 
The filmmakers haven't inserted a hint of a political message, unless 
John Heard's imitation of a brain-addled vice president upsets a few 
Quayle fans. Wasted in the cast are Lauren Bacall as Kramer's sturdy wife 
and Sela Ward as a Washington TV news personality.

Nothing says more about the many ways the American family is 
disappearing than the zeal with which Hollywood has zeroed in on the 
results. "First Wives Club" and its revenge of the original spouse 
scenario touched a nerve, and now comes "One Fine Day," a slick romantic 
fantasy for single parents who fear they'll always have to go it alone. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Like "First Wives," "One Fine Day" is fortunate in its casting. Not 
only does it have Michelle Pfeiffer, whose gift for this kind of business 
was visible as far back as "Married to the Mob" and "The Fabulous Baker 
Boys," but it marks the emergence of George Clooney as a major romantic 
star. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The confident Clooney, "ER's" hospital ward heartthrob, didn't play to 
his strength when he debuted in the ultra-violent "From Dawn to Dusk," 
but it's different here. With his thick eyebrows and perpetual 5 o'clock 
shadow, Clooney possesses considerable roguish charm and handles himself 
with practiced aplomb. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Not only do Pfeiffer and Clooney play well together, their negative 
chemistry is also strong, which makes the plot's insistence that they are 
enemies from the moment they meet a conceit that does not have to be 
taken on faith. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Given this, it would be nice to say that "One Fine Day" lives happily 
ever after, but it's difficult to take as much pleasure in the finished 
product as the casting anticipates. Directed by Michael Hoffman, this 
film does not care to be original, falling back on cookie-cutter plot 
elements that give the finished product an unbecoming mechanical sheen. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   With a pair of versions of the Gerry Goffin-Carole King rock standard 
(by Natalie Merchant and the Chiffons) serving as bookends, "One Fine 
Day" takes two single parents fearful of the opposite sex through a 
12-hour time span so hellacious a pair of screen-writers (Terrel Seltzer 
and Ellen Simon) were needed to fill in the details. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Melanie Parker (Pfeiffer), a lower-echelon architect at a 
distinguished New York firm, has a 5-year-old son named Sammy. His 
schoolmate Maggie is the daughter of Jack Taylor (Clooney), the kind of 
"God, I love this town" newspaper columnist that movies are so fond of.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   On the day in question, both kids are supposed to take a Circle Line 
cruise around Manhattan, but a series of misadventures has them miss the 
boat and throws the parents unhappily together. Melanie can't stand 
Jack's infantile, "I'm just a big kid" personality, while he's had enough 
of superwomen who get snooty if you try to open the door for them.

   Making things worse, both Melanie and Jack have big career days in 
front of them. She has to make a major presentation to a client; he has 
to hold together the usual "I love this town" story about the mayor, 
garbage and the mob. Out of necessity, not love, they agree to pool their 
limited time and engage in tag-team baby-sitting. If you're thinking 
everything goes smoothly, you do not have a future in Hollywood. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As the children in question, Alex D. Linz and Mae Whitman are 
acceptable, but "One Fine Day" spends too much of its time on tiresome 
kid misbehavior of the most obvious "Gosh, Mom, I spilled juice on your 
blouse" variety. This stuff does not stay funny for long, and it points 
up how dependent on the most obvious situations and most arbitrary and 
frantic coincidences so much of the plot is. Given the divergent credits 
of the two writers (Selzer did the offbeat "Chan Is Missing" and "Dim 
Sum," while Simon the treacly "Moonlight and Valentino"), that's not a 
surprise. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Still, despite feeling like its moments have been micro-managed for 
maximum audience response, "One Fine Day" often passes for a pleasant 
diversion. But with actors so suited to each other, it's too bad the film 
didn't give them more original material to work with.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
West Memphis, Ark., is a quiet community of 28,000 in a region 
where a local TV station boasts of being one of the "good neighbors you 
can turn to." Here in this east Arkansas version of conservative, 
small-town U.S.A., just across the Mississippi River from Tennessee and 
urban Memphis, folks speak in twangs, God is not just for Sunday and 
families gather for outdoor barbecues that spill over with frivolity and 
cute little Huck Finns. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Three of them--8-year-olds Steven Branch, Christopher Byers and 
Michael Moore--are presently on the screen, their nude bodies as rigid 
and alabaster-pale as museum statues, beside a shallow creek in Robin 
Hood Hills, a clump of woods along a busy interstate. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Accused of slaying these second-graders in a grisly, ritualistic 
sacrifice are three odd-behaving teenagers whose passion for heavy-metal 
music and black clothes stamp them as Satanists. Obviously devil 
worshipers, obviously guilty. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   So begins HBO's "Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood 
Hills," another stunning crime documentary from Joe Berlinger and Bruce 
Sinofsky, whose earlier "Brother's Keeper" on PBS was about as good as 
nonfiction films get. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Just as mesmerizing, but darker, more troubling and much longer at 2 
1/2 hours, is "Paradise Lost," a banner of tattered Americana that 
Berlinger and Sinofsky artfully unfurl, again minus narration, by joining 
verite sequences and formal interviews into a twisting, serpentine tale 
of intriguing ambiguity and paradoxes. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   These guys really can tell a story, in this case a revealing X-ray of 
a small community that addresses the universality of human 
contradictions, all of it to a background of heavy metal by Metallica. 
The band donated the music because, according to HBO, it shares the 
filmmakers' belief that the case against the defendants was deeply flawed 
and circumstantial. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Berlinger and Sinofsky consider "Paradise Lost" a companion to 
"Brother's Keeper." The latter was a 1992 film set in rural New York, 
where four aging, unworldly bearded brothers had lived weirdly on their 
dairy farm--even sharing the same bed--without much outside contact or 
notice until one died and another was accused of murdering him. In a 
startling tactic, the prosecution implied that creaky Delbert Ward and 
his dead brother were lovers, but his neighbors stood by him and he was 
ultimately acquitted, an eccentric but apparently innocent man riding his 
flatbed off into the sunset. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   How are these companion films? Because one community rejected 
stereotypes, the other, West Memphis, embraced stereotypes, filmmakers 
Berlinger, 40, and Sinofsky, 34, said by phone from New York recently. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The stereotyped defendants in "Paradise Lost" are Jessie Misskelley 
Jr., 17, described in the film as having an IQ of 72; baby-faced Jason 
Baldwin, 16; and Damien Wayne Echols, 18, who is Jason's best friend and 
reportedly is interested in so-called "white magic." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Seemingly the dominant member of the trio, Damien is a bizarre 
narcissist who wears his dark hair almost girlishly swooped to one side 
of his round face, and at one point during a break in his trial is shown 
obsessively preening with a hand mirror used to search for bombs under 
courtroom seats. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The police claimed to have a confession from Jessie implicating Jason 
and Damien. It didn't help that Damien was also the name of the 
antichrist in those popular "Omen" movies about demonic evil. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "If these kids lived in Manhattan, people wouldn't have looked twice 
at them," Sinofsky said. But West Memphis isn't Manhattan. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Berlinger and Sinofsky learned of the case through a New York Times 
article just after the teenagers were charged in 1993. Instantly 
convinced that "these kids were pretty much guilty," Berlinger said, they 
flew south to scout film possibilities. The local media were pouring it 
on, he said, at one point not only asking one of the victims' mothers how 
she felt celebrating Mother's Day without her murdered son but also 
spewing a steady barrage of stories about rumored blood drinking, 
demonology and homosexual orgies on the part of the defendants. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "The portrait of them was so black, so monstrous, that we bought into 
the stereotype," Berlinger said. "And when we first saw Damien turn to us 
and the rest of the press in the courtroom, there was a chill, as if he 
was Hannibal Lecter. While we were down there, there was never a voice in 
the dark saying these kids didn't do it. Not until we met their families 
and saw the humanity of their families was a whole different picture 
visible for us to see." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   That picture is available to the TV audience tonight, as is the 
perspective of the prosecutors and victims' families. The film raises 
questions about the prosecution's case but never delivers its own 
verdict. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Meanwhile, the filmmakers' camera is omnipresent, in jail and in 
lawyer-client strategy sessions, chronicling trials (Jessie was tried 
separately from Jason and Damien), intimate chats (such as Jessie's phone 
conversation with his girlfriend) and anger pouring from parents. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   None more so than from Christopher's mother, Melissa Byers, almost in 
meltdown when expressing to the lens her venom toward those she believes 
murdered her son: "I hate these three. And . . . the . . . mothers . . . 
that . . . bore . . . them!" 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Even more explosive are sequences with Christopher's stepfather, Mark 
Byers, a wild-talking zealot in a Bunyan-esque beard and snakeskin 
boots--one moment sweetly singing hymns in church from the pulpit, the 
next pumping bullet after bullet into a fat pumpkin that he envisions 
being the accused slayers ("Hey, Jason, I want you to smile for this!"). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Fascinating curves appear without warning, one coming when "Paradise 
Lost" discloses that someone prominent in the film inexplicably has given 
a crew member a gift of a knife on which there appears to be dried blood. 
Omitted from the film is the crisis that Berlinger and Sinofsky say this 
created for them, fearing that this could be one of the knives used on 
the victims (no murder weapons had been found). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "We felt we might have to shut down," Sinofsky said. "We felt that by 
turning this knife over to the police, we would be exploding all the 
trust we had built up with the people, and that doors we had taken so 
long to open would now be shut. Also, we didn't want to get sucked into 
our own story." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Ultimately, he said, the filmmakers acted responsibly by heeding "this 
little voice called civic responsibility" and turning over the knife, 
whose link to the case is never quite clarified in the film, 
unfortunately. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As it turned out, the incident did not sour the filmmakers' relations 
with the good neighbors of West Memphis. In fact, almost as mystifying as 
the knife is how a couple of Jewish guys from New York were able to 
parachute into a Bible Belt realm so alien to them and, over time, 
establish such rapport that they and their camera were granted 
astonishing access in the courtroom and behind the scenes. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The access issue created a brouhaha at a screening of "Paradise Lost" 
for lawyers in New York last month, the attendees including two members 
of the O.J. Simpson criminal defense team, Peter Neufeld and Barry 
Scheck. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "I'm appalled," the New York Post quoted Scheck as bellowing when the 
film ended. "This case was not tried in court, it was tried on HBO." The 
Post said another attorney agreed, calling the film "media manipulation." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Berlinger and Sinofsky, who were there, confirm the Post account, 
noting, however, that the West Memphis trials occurred more than two 
years before tonight's premiere of their film and insisting that their 
filming of intimate lawyer-client chats did not influence the course of 
the case. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Just how much even the most unobtrusive TV camera alters reality is an 
ongoing question to which there is no easy answer. As for media 
manipulation, though, Scheck and other attorneys on both sides of the 
Simpson case would know something about that.

John C. Young's "Parallel Sons" has much that is impressive, but is 
such a downer that it leaves you wondering whether its overwhelmingly 
tragic climax is fully earned or overly predetermined. On the other hand, 
what happens in the unfolding of its story is all too credible, even if 
its telling lacks that all-crucial quality of unrelenting inevitability. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Gabriel Mick's Seth and Laurence Mason's Knowledge Johnson are highly 
engaging individuals from vastly different worlds. Seth is a tall, rangy 
20-year-old living in a small, isolated Adirondacks town where, he 
observes, "everybody's interchangeable." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Nobody could say that about Seth, who has long blond dreadlocks and 
has turned his farmhouse bedroom into a shrine to African American 
culture. While the locals accept Seth, who after all is a native, they 
would surely have trouble dealing with his homosexuality, which he has 
yet to come to terms with himself. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Seth, who apparently hasn't been anywhere, understandably wants out 
and not just because of his sexual orientation. His widowed father 
(Graham Alex Johnson), proprietor of the local gun shop, feels so 
overtaxed he's not about to sign a financial agreement that would allow 
Seth to attend NYU as an art major. Besides, the father sees nothing 
wrong with a nearby college and considers an art major too impractical 
anyway. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Consequently, Seth is a far from happy guy when he crosses paths with 
Knowledge, a wounded escapee from some kind of minimum-security prison. 
We never really learn why Knowledge is in prison, but we do know that 
he's haunted by the fact that his little brother shot himself fatally 
with his gun. In any event, Seth's just the person to hide Knowledge in 
the family cabin and nurse him back to health. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The way in which trust, friendship and, finally, mutual attraction 
grow between these two bright, free-thinking young men is tender and 
amusing, but of course there's an underlying tension about their ultimate 
fate in an environment that grows increasingly dangerous the longer they 
remain in it. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In the meantime, they're not so different despite the divergence of 
their worlds and beyond their shared sexual orientation. Knowledge is a 
reflective young man from Brooklyn whose dream is to become a paramedic. 
The film's lightest moment occurs when, during the day when no one's 
around, Knowledge sneaks into the farmhouse and comes upon Seth's 
bedroom, confounding him completely. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Young elicits completely natural portrayals from Mick and Mason in the 
well-written parts he has created for them, and they are most impressive 
young actors. "Parallel Sons" is finally not so much a love story or a 
gay drama as it is, intentionally or not, an anti-gun protest. Even if 
you agree wholeheartedly in its sentiments, you have to wish the message 
were contained within the movie instead of overwhelming it.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
At the beginning of her elegant and illuminating "Paris Was a 
Woman," documentarian Greta Schiller declares that in the first quarter 
of the 20th century, the Left Bank of the City of Lights was a magnet for 
women from all over America and Europe, with its "promise of freedom," of 
"a life filled with literature and art." Schiller goes a long way toward 
balancing the image of Paris between the wars as a male paradise for the 
likes of Hemingway and Fitzgerald. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Starting with Gertrude Stein, whose experimental writing influenced 
Hemingway, and her lover Alice B. Toklas, virtually all of the key 
figures in Schiller's film were lesbians, yet Schiller and her writer 
Andrea Weiss acknowledge this with a reticence bordering on reluctance. 
Surely, since virtually all of them did become famous in literature and 
art, some exploration of the connection between their sexual orientation 
and their creativity could be significant. But the film does not go much 
beyond remarking that with them, "the Muse took human form." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Schiller, however, is nonetheless invaluable for giving us an idea of 
what these women were like and why they remain important. We're told that 
between 1906-09 only Stein and her brothers purchased Picasso's 
paintings, that the Steins in effect created the world's first collection 
of modern art and that Stein and Picasso were kindred spirits. We learn 
from Janet Flanner, who was the New Yorker's peerless Paris correspondent 
for nearly half a century under the pen name Ge^net, that Toklas was 
Stein's muse, enabler and cook--and also that "Alice had malice." 
(Apparently, Toklas was not above quipping about Stein picking up young 
women in the basement restroom of the Galeries Lafayette!) 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Given equal importance with Stein and Toklas are booksellers Adrienne 
Monnier and Sylvia Beach. Schiller credits Monnier with establishing the 
lending library concept in France and with encouraging Beach, an American 
who became her employee and subsequent lover, with establishing her own 
nearby bookstore, the famous Shakespeare and Company, which became a 
literary haven for decades. Beach is well-remembered for publishing the 
widely banned "Ulysses," only to have James Joyce eventually break his 
contract with her, leaving her facing bankruptcy. Also key are American 
heiress Nathalie Barney, who for several generations ran a celebrated 
salon, and her lover of 62 years, painter Romaine Brooks. A less happy 
relationship was between writer-journalist extraordinaire Djuna Barnes 
and alcoholic artist Thelma Wood. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In regard to Barney, Schiller was fortunate that she was able to 
interview Barney's longtime housekeeper, Berthe Cleyrergue, a woman of 
wit and perception who helps suggest how supportive all these women and 
others could be of one another despite the natural occasional clashes and 
differences in temperament. One of the few survivors of this group is 
noted photographer Gisele Freund, who comments incisively on her friends 
and colleagues. The modest Beach and the astringent Flanner both lived 
long enough to give TV interviews from which Schiller could select key 
sequences. Stills, first-rate archival footage and recordings of Monnier, 
Toklas and Stein round out the richness of "Paris Was a Woman."

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
In its excesses and extravagances, its fascination with sex, 
religion, celebrity, bad taste and making a whole lot of money, there is 
no more American story than that of combative pornographer and Hustler 
magazine publisher Larry Flynt. So it's poetic and appropriate that an 
immigrant director, Czech-born Milos Forman, has had the clarity to turn 
it into a provocative and engrossing motion picture. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Working from a shrewd and pointedly funny script by Scott Alexander & 
Larry Karaszewski, the team responsible for "Ed Wood," Forman's 
contributions have enlarged "Larry Flynt" in ways other filmmakers might 
not have managed. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The most obvious is having an eye for casting and a zest for mixing 
professionals with real people, an openness to using folks such as 
political consultant James Carville and Flynt himself (playing a 
hard-nosed judge) in cameos. And having the nerve to choose rock star 
Courtney Love to play opposite Woody Harrelson and being rewarded with a 
live-wire piece of work, both kinetic and kittenish, that stands as one 
of the most original performances of the year. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Forman, witness films from "Loves of a Blonde" through "One Flew Over 
the Cuckoo's Nest" and "Valmont," also has a willingness to tolerate 
ambiguity. Despite his name in the title, "The People vs. . . . " is not 
interested in glorifying Larry Flynt, quite the opposite. It rather 
delights in showing how this crass and cold-eyed hustler, a man of wildly 
contradictory and often offensive urges and impulses, ended up, to his 
own great surprise as much as anyone's, doing something significant for 
society. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   What Flynt finally did was take a legal dispute with the Rev. Jerry 
Falwell about a noxious Hustler ad parody (showing the reverend losing 
his virginity to his mother in an outhouse) all the way to the Supreme 
Court. The top court's unanimous 1988 ruling, for the first time granting 
1st Amendment protection to parody, is considered a free speech landmark. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In this area, too, "The People vs. Larry Flynt" benefits from having a 
filmmaker who lost his parents to the Nazis and grew to adulthood under 
Communist censorship. While it's hard to imagine native-born directors 
getting worked up about 1st Amendment rights they take for granted, 
Forman's life experiences turn those freedoms into issues he can be 
passionate and persuasive about. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   All this is yet to come when "The People vs. Larry Flynt" opens in 
1952 in a decrepit shack in the woods of East Kentucky, where 10-year-old 
moonshiner Larry (helped by his 8-year-old brother Jimmy) is so intent on 
making a buck that he doesn't hesitate to physically attack his alcoholic 
father for "drinking my profits." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Twenty years later Larry (Woody Harrelson) and Jimmy (real-life 
brother Brett Harrelson) are still chasing the main chance, this time by 
running go-go dancers through a series of unimpressive Hustler Clubs in 
Ohio. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The men's magazine starts as a simple newsletter for the clubs, but 
Flynt, who enjoys getting worked up, soon turns messianic in his 
determination to topple Hugh Hefner by printing the most graphic shots of 
genitalia he can get away with. His own most satisfied customer, Flynt 
harangues his dubious confederates, many of whom have trouble telling 
even-numbered pages from odd, by holding up the rival publication and 
screaming, "Who is this magazine for anyway? Seven million people buy it, 
but nobody reads it. Playboy is mocking you." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   About this time Larry meets too-young dancer Althea Leasure, a brazen 
erotic sprite whom Courtney Love, alternately vampish and vulnerable, 
invests with a natural blowzy sensuality. Bisexual, easily bored, 
invariably jealous, Love's Althea and Woody Harrelson's shrewd, 
promiscuous Flynt are no Hallmark card, but the actors connect 
beautifully and make the couple's love for each other vivid and 
undeniable. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Almost immediately, Flynt's off-putting magazine gets him in trouble 
with the authorities, introducing him to Alan Isaacman (Edward Norton), a 
committed civil liberties lawyer (and composite of several Flynt 
attorneys) who starts to educate his client (and the audience) about the 
overarching importance of constitutional rights. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   A different kind of trouble is provided by evangelist and presidential 
sister Ruth Carter Stapleton (played by TV anchor Donna Hanover). With 
her flirtatious encouragement, Flynt's life takes another unexpected turn 
as he becomes the unlikeliest of born-again Christians. This is much to 
the despair of Althea, who rightly points out that "nobody on this planet 
wants religion and porn together." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Everything changes yet again in 1978, when Flynt is shot leaving a 
Georgia courthouse, an attack that leaves him paralyzed below the waist 
and increasingly addicted to painkilling drugs, which become a problem 
for his wife as well. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Flynt and Althea relocate to Los Angeles ("we ought to move somewhere 
perverts are welcome" is his wry rationale), where outrageous courtroom 
antics like showing up in an American flag diaper and tossing oranges at 
a judge demonstrate Flynt's ability to turn everything into a circus and 
a travesty. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Though Woody Harrelson's intensity and charisma make Flynt magnetic, 
he is more terrifying and self-destructive than someone we admire, which 
is the film's point. His chaotic story mirrors "The People vs. Larry 
Flynt" in being without conventional boundaries, a saga that could only 
happen in a country where, as Flynt himself puts it, "everybody gets 
their shot, even a pig." His may have been the classic unexamined life, 
but "The People vs. Larry Flynt" does us all a favor by scrutinizing it 
to memorable effect.

"The Portrait of a Lady" is a marriage of opposites, a potent 
joining of the dispassionate psychological complexity of the novelist 
admirers called the Master and an assured and assertive director who 
relishes the intensity film provides. Like many relationships, it sounds 
improbable but it succeeds. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The redoubtable Henry James, whose nearly 600-page novel was published 
in 1881, does not readily translate to the screen. Aside from "The 
Innocents," a Deborah Kerr-starring version of "The Turn of the Screw," 
the most memorable attempt is "The Heiress," an adaptation of the novella 
"Washington Square" that stars Montgomery Clift, Olivia de Havilland and 
Ralph Richardson and is nearly half a century old. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Jane Campion, on the other hand, as her success with "The Piano" 
shows, is completely modern in sensibility with a vigorous gift for 
cinema and the ability to make any kind of story completely her own. This 
"Portrait of a Lady" and its melancholy tale of emotional manipulation 
and despair belongs as much to her as to James, a situation that may 
upset the author's devotees but will not be noticed by viewers who 
haven't made the novel's acquaintance. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Written by fellow Australian Laura Jones (who also wrote Campion's 
earlier "An Angel at My Table" and the Gillian Armstrong-directed "High 
Tide"), this "Portrait" is determined to see Isabel Archer, the book's 
celebrated heroine here played by Nicole Kidman, as a modern woman. As 
Jones' script states on its opening page, "she could be today's girl, but 
happens to live in 1870." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   This is not as much of a stretch as it may seem. Though such Jamesian 
strands as the conflict between American innocence and European 
experience are not pressing concerns today, other themes--like the plight 
and status of women in male-dominated societies--are issues that have 
hardly gone away. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   To Isabel Archer, newly arrived in England, Europe is not the old 
country but the promised land. Invited over from America by her wealthy 
uncle Mr. Touchett (John Gielgud) and his wife (Shelley Winters), she is 
oblivious to the importance of form and ritual, the duplicity and 
artifice that make up so much of the business of continental society. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Rather Isabel is so taken with life's possibilities that she 
preemptively turns down a marriage proposal from the completely eligible 
Lord Warburton (Richard E. Grant) just as she had turned one down from 
his American counterpart Caspar Goodwood (Viggo Mortensen). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Instead of marrying, Isabel wants to throw herself into the world in 
search of meaning and danger. Headstrong and assertive, she likes the 
sense of not knowing what lies ahead and fiercely tells one and all that 
"it's not my fate to give up." But this determined sense of purpose 
aside, as a young woman alone Isabel is more innocent and more at risk 
than she knows. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Much taken with this combination of naivete and spunk is Isabel's 
cousin Ralph Touchett (Martin Donovan). A consumptive who is too rich and 
too ill to work, Ralph arranges with his father for Isabel to inherit a 
considerable sum of money, enough to make her bright plans for the future 
a possibility. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Also attracted to Isabel Archer is the enigmatic Madame Serena Merle 
(Barbara Hershey), a worldly wise American friend of Mrs. Touchett's 
whose own dreams have come to so little she insists "a woman, it seems to 
me, has no natural place anywhere." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Madame Merle determines, for reasons that only gradually become clear, 
to introduce Isabel to her own great friend in Florence, Gilbert Osmond 
(John Malkovich), an imposing aesthete considered to be "the incarnation 
of taste." A widower with a daughter being raised in a convent, Osmond is 
an icy man who uses words like daggers, but to Isabel "the beauty of his 
opinions" cancels his other sins. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It is this symbiosis between a headstrong naif who is not as clever as 
she thinks and these bloodless co-conspirators that "Portrait of a Lady" 
details. It's a psychological horror story, with an overmatched heroine 
in as much mortal danger as any of Dracula's potential victims, a story 
told here with spareness, strength and precision. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Though "Portrait's" satisfactions don't have much to do with surprise, 
the argument could be made that the performances of the two leads could 
use some fine-tuning. Kidman is the picture of clarity, purpose and 
single-minded intelligence as Isabel, but also colder than she perhaps 
needs to be. The same is true for Malkovich, whose previous screen 
history makes him too obviously villainous too soon. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Yet despite this the effectiveness of "Portrait of a Lady" is 
impressive. Campion has put together a strong visual team of previous 
collaborators, including cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh, production and 
costume designer Janet Patterson and editor Veronika Jenet. And she has 
added a diverse and impressive cast and her own capacity for vivid 
filmmaking, for joining arresting images to a knack for conveying 
intensity on screen. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   And though Campion is inevitably no less than the co-star of her 
movies, she also can, as she did with Holly Hunter in "The Piano," coax 
the performance of a lifetime out of actors. Here the beneficiary is 
Hershey, who does magnificent work as the anguished, manipulative, 
unhappy Madame Merle. The rest of "The Portrait of a Lady" may not be up 
to this high standard, but it is never less than absorbing either.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
"The Preacher's Wife" is one Christmas picture that actually is in 
the spirit of the season. It's warm, sentimental, amusing yet serious, 
bringing fantasy to bear upon the painfully real. An inspired reworking 
of "The Bishop's Wife" (1947), it has that sense of family and community 
and uplift that make '40s movies like "It's a Wonderful Life" such 
evergreen treasures--and it also has Denzel Washington and Whitney 
Houston in full dazzle. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Lord, I'm a little tired. I sure could use some help," says the Rev. 
Henry Biggs (Courtney B. Vance), pastor of St. Matthews Baptist, a 
venerable African American church somewhere on the Eastern seaboard. 
Biggs is faced simultaneously with having to close his church's youth 
center because of a lack of funds, trying to keep a local teen from going 
to prison for a crime he did not commit, facing the loss to a distant 
foster care program of a boy his own small son has come to regard as a 
brother, and, as a final straw, the bursting of the church's ancient 
boiler. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Biggs is talking to himself, but he is overheard by God, who 
immediately dispatches the well-dressed angel Dudley (Washington) to work 
some miracles. The trouble is Biggs understandably has difficulty 
believing that Dudley is who he says he is. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In his attempts to help Henry regain his faith and belief that he can 
make a difference in the lives of his parishioners, Dudley feels that 
Henry first must realize he's letting his marriage to the beautiful and 
dutiful Julia (Houston) suffer. In the meantime as Henry struggles 
manfully with the overwhelming demands placed upon him, Dudley discovers 
that Julia is the ideal woman who escaped him during his brief earthly 
existence. Julia, who unlike Dudley is only human, can't help but respond 
to the attentions of so handsome and courtly a man when her edgy husband 
has so little time for her. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Washington and Houston, who has plenty of opportunities to sing as 
leader of St. Matthews' gospel choir, are among the most attractive, 
charismatic actors on the screen today, and they are terrific here. Yet 
the film's story is not that of the preacher's wife but the preacher 
himself, and the film's key figure is in fact Biggs. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In updating Robert E. Sherwood and Leonardo Bercovici's original 
script, writers Nat Mauldin and Allan Scott have created a decent, 
stressed-out contemporary husband and father with whom practically 
everyone can identify. As anyone who saw Vance on stage in his 
Tony-nominated portrayal of the brilliant impostor in "Six Degrees of 
Separation" will recall, he is a young actor of extraordinary reserves 
and concentration. It is a pleasure to watch him, under Penny Marshall's 
consistently wise and judicious direction, command the screen with such 
passion and intelligence. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Marshall in turn surrounds her stars with more wonderful people. Among 
them are a scene-stealing Jenifer Coleman as Julia's canny mother; 
Loretta Devine as Henry's secretary, who at first fears Dudley has come 
to replace her; Gregory Hines as an avaricious developer; Lionel Richie 
(in his film acting debut) as the operator of a local nightclub; and 
little Justin Pierre Edmund as the Biggses' son. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Atmosphere is crucial in "The Preacher's Wife," and the filmmakers 
drew from various authentic locations that are at once nostalgic and 
gritty. The film's actual church and adjoining manse are splendid, 
spacious turn-of-the-century structures in Yonkers, N.Y., with miles of 
oak woodwork, paneling and carved detailing. Such buildings exist in 
older areas of cities across the country--areas where men and women like 
Henry Biggs do battle daily with the ravages of crime, poverty and drugs 
and really could use a miracle.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
Steve Prefontaine was, to crib a line from Bruce Springsteen, born 
to run. And to win. The ultimate competitive animal, he finished first in 
more than 75% of his races and remains the only person ever to hold the 
U.S. records in every distance from 2,000 to 10,000 meters. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But there is another side to this charismatic runner, who knew he was 
good and wasn't fearful about sharing the knowledge. Prefontaine became 
an early spokesman for athletes' rights and helped put Nike on the map by 
accepting its sponsorship when it was just a wee Oregon company. More 
poignantly, Steve Prefontaine died in an automobile accident when he was 
24 years old, leading to his apotheosis as the James Dean of track and 
field. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It's taken more than 20 years, but Hollywood has finally caught up to 
Prefontaine's appeal, and for a while two projects were, yes, racing to 
reach theaters. A Robert Towne-directed version called "Pre" starring 
Billy Crudup is scheduled for fall release, well behind the current 
"Prefontaine." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Directed and co-written by Steve James, the director of "Hoop Dreams," 
and co-produced and photographed in Super 16-millimeter by his "Hoop" 
partner Peter Gilbert, "Prefontaine," not surprisingly, takes a 
documentary approach to its story. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   This means that it not only starts off with newsreel footage and 
shoots as much as possible in a loose, hand-held style, but also frames 
the narrative around talking head shots of actors--often in unconvincing 
aging makeup--playing key participants in Prefontaine's life who comment 
on the man they knew. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   While documentaries like "Hoop Dreams" come with the grittiness of 
reality automatically included, dramatic films have to manufacture their 
own, and "Prefontaine" can't. Though it is always pleasant and agreeable, 
this film has the bland and undemanding texture that characterizes movies 
made for network TV. Worshipful without really trying to be, it's more an 
illustrated scrapbook than an involving motion picture. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The man who "turned distance running into a blood sport" grew up in 
Coos Bay, Ore., not sure where to channel his fearful determination to 
succeed. The discovery of running answered that question, though 
Prefontaine (played by look-alike Jared Leto) does find time to have a 
sweet relationship with down-home girlfriend Elaine Finley (Laurel 
Holloman). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The two go to the University of Oregon where Pre, as everyone calls 
him, switches romantic allegiances to the more upscale Nancy Alleman (Amy 
Locane) and comes under the tutelage of irascible coach Bill Bowerman (R. 
Lee Ermey), a crusty autocrat who, believe it or not, has a caring heart 
under that gruff exterior. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It's Bowerman who moves Pre from the mile to the less publicized 
longer distances, correctly assuring him that, with his personality, 
he'll make everyone care about these races. In a kind of sporadic inside 
joke, Bowerman, who went on to co-found Nike, is seen continually 
experimenting, not always successfully, with different kinds of homemade 
running shoes. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The turning point in Pre's young life is his participation in the 1972 
Munich Olympics, both his memorable 5,000-meter race against Finland's 
Lasse Viren and his emotional response to the massacre of Israeli 
athletes. One result was his determination to fight the Amateur Athletic 
Union (here presented as a mythical organization called the ATU) to gain 
conditions comparable to those of cosseted European athletes. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Though "Prefontaine" takes a certain amount of power from its 
protagonist's personality and the events he lived through, Steve James' 
script (co-written by Eugene Corr) is filled with overly familiar 
situations and lines like "He ran his heart out" and "Nobody can coach 
desire." Equally self-evident is that nobody can ensure that a memorable 
story will get the kind of nuanced treatment it deserves.

The numbers finally don't add up on "Ransom." A persuasive thriller 
for most of its length, it stumbles in its attempt to become an upscale 
version of "Death Wish" and other vigilante dramas and ends up derailing 
with a soft thud.

   The story of the lengths a distraught father, played by Mel Gibson, 
will go to get his kidnapped son safely home, "Ransom" is a departure for 
director Ron Howard. "Apollo 13" notwithstanding, Howard is known for 
softer fare, but he turns out to be reasonably effective at building 
criminal tension, hooking an audience and reeling it in. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Having a story that is a universal nightmare hasn't hurt either. 
Written by Richard Price and Alexander Ignon and based on a little-seen 
1956 film starring Glenn Ford, "Ransom's" "pay up, we've got your child" 
plot is craftily put together with an eye toward terrorizing concerned 
parents nationwide. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   At the center of things is Tom Mullen (Gibson), head of Endeavor 
Airlines, a company he founded and nursed to its current strong position 
servicing 32 countries. Surrounded by the trappings of success (Manhattan 
penthouse, warm friendship with the mayor, Rene Russo's beautiful Kate 
for a wife), Tom is feisty enough to cause 10-year-old Sean (Brawley 
Nolte, Nick's son) to comment: "It seems like someone's always mad at 
you." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Crosscut with an elegant party introducing Tom and his family are 
shots of a meanly furnished room, complete with handcuffs chained to the 
bed, the chamber of horrors being prepared for Sean. Soon enough he is 
snatched and an electronically altered voice on the telephone demands $2 
million from Tom in the de rigueur unmarked bills. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   While there is a generic quality to Howard's direction, the initial 
stages of "Ransom" get the job done nicely. The script carefully parcels 
out its twists and surprises, virtuoso cinematographer Piotr Sobocinski 
(who shot "Red" for Krzysztof Kieslowski) makes things visually 
interesting, and the director, thankfully not looking to make a companion 
piece to "Seven," keeps the proceedings restrained. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Once again moving back and forth between criminals and victims, 
"Ransom" shows us the kidnapping's aftermath from both points of view. 
The five-person gang, rife with the kind of dissension that no movie 
evildoers can avoid, is well-defined, with fine actors like Lili Taylor 
and Liev Schreiber in the lawbreaking roles. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Back at the Mullen household, experienced FBI agent Lonnie Hawkins 
(yet another excellent performance by Delroy Lindo) has all he can do to 
keep the level of parental hysteria from going off the charts. As crises 
arise and nightmare piles on nightmare, Tom and Kate get increasingly 
frantic, going over the edge into emotional chaos as they try to decide 
what tactic will work best to bring their son back alive. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   At a certain point, more because that's what it says in the script 
than anything else, Tom opts to take matters into his own hands, a 
decision that frankly hurts the film. For one thing, the decision plays 
as stupid and implausible in its attempt to make a virtue out of a kind 
of stubborn willfulness that would be more appropriate, and equally 
unappealing, in a tiresome 2-year-old. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Just as troublesome is Gibson's fitness for the kind of vigilante role 
that the menacing Charles Bronson, not for nothing called "Il Brutto" by 
the Italians, was effective in. Though he has the air of the rascal about 
him and was certainly formidable in the "Mad Max" movies, Gibson at this 
point in his career has a softer persona. He's better suited to being the 
painfully distraught parent than the fatuous jerk "Ransom" unconvincingly 
insists is acting like the perfect hero.

If you can buy Penelope Ann Miller as a doctor of evolutionary 
biology, you can buy just about anything, and that certainly includes the 
fusion of genetics and voodoo behind "The Relic." But Peter Hyams' film 
isn't about fact, or even narrative fiction. It's about sound and light, 
and for much of the time its reliance on purely visceral terror keeps one 
plastered to one's seat--and, except for the occasional involuntary 
outburst, very, very quiet. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It's a thrill ride, of course, one with an overly generous helping of 
gross-out shots and alarming cuts. Miller, as the pert and principled Dr. 
Margo Green, may be rather hard to accept as one who spends her life 
among bone-scouring beetles and fund-lusting lab wonks. But the all too 
rarely seen Tom Sizemore as Lt. Vincent D'Agosta--who's investigating the 
gruesome murders at Green's Chicago museum--is believably beleaguered. 
Hyams' own cinematography (he does double duty here) is for much of the 
time a masterwork of half-light and the sound--"The Relic" should be seen 
only in theaters equipped for it--may be the real star of the picture. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Hyams the director ("Sudden Death," "Timecop," "The Star Chamber") 
operates at too much of a fevered pitch for things not to eventually get 
out of hand--accelerating violence and horror eventually hit maximum 
velocity and warp into nonsense, no matter how erudite the script. But 
for much of the movie, apprehension prevails. And that's because "The 
Relic"--imagine "Predator" crossed with "Phantom of the Opera"--operates 
on the most basic, and soundest, of dramatic principles: What we can't 
see is always the most terrifying thing of all--far scarier than anything 
cooked up in the makeup department of a Hollywood studio, or on its 
computers, either. Not knowing what's behind the string of stunning 
eviscerations/decapitations--the creature haunting the institution 
(exteriors were shot at Chicago's Field Museum) is after the hypothalamus 
of its victims, which requires some cranial intrusions--is key. Once we 
see it, it loses much of its attraction. But, hey, there's a lot in life 
that works exactly the same way. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "The Relic" suffers from some of the stock inanities of the 
science-horror genre: Two scientists, for instance--in this case Green 
and her mentor Dr. Albert Frock (James Whitmore)--talking to each other 
but really talking to us, because they already know the stuff they're 
explaining to each other. And while "The Relic" isn't as guilty as some 
films on this point, do people whose lives are in peril tell this many 
jokes? And will someone please explain why characters in movies who are 
caught up in the police investigation of a murder--the murders of 
co-workers, at that--act as if they're being subjected to the world's 
biggest inconvenience? In Green's case, it makes her look like the most 
self-absorbed creature alive (except for the monster, perhaps) and that's 
obviously not Hyams' intention. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Easier to swallow are the objections from museum director Ann Cuthbert 
(Linda Hunt) that the investigation is going to delay the museum's gala 
opening of its show on myth and superstition--which will provide major 
funding, as well as the kind of crowd scenes necessary for a truly 
climactic blood bath. The gala also allows Miller the opportunity to 
spend the second half of the movie in a little black something that shows 
off her legs. The symbolic surrender of her high heels just prior to the 
ultimate confrontation is a bit much, but the point is made: Don't mess 
with a woman in need of grant money, no matter how skimpily she's 
dressed.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
Formidably insincere, obsessed with appearances and armed with 
well-developed systems of humiliation, the 18th century milieu of 
"Ridicule" sounds a lot like today's Hollywood, with a key difference: 
the joy taken in language and the focus on wit as the key that opens 
every door. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Set at the Versailles court of Louis XVI in 1783, just six years 
before the revolution, "Ridicule" relishes its chance to play around with 
words. Witty, intelligent and quintessentially French, it is an unusually 
involving costume drama that takes us into a decadent world few will know 
existed, a place where "vices are without consequence but ridicule can 
kill." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As exposed by screenwriter Remi Waterhouse and director Patrice 
Leconte, the king and his court thrive on icy disdain. Cutting people up 
is their main pastime, destructive wit the weapon of choice, and since 
the wrong word can ruin someone absolutely and even lead to exile, 
mastery of language couldn't be a more serious business. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   New to this system is provincial nobleman Gregoire Ponceludon de 
Malavoy (Charles Berling, the publisher in "Nelly and M. Arnaud"). A man 
of the modern age who believes in the power of science, he is determined 
to drain the malarial swamps of his native Dombes region and save his 
peasants. But he needs the approval and support of the king to get the 
job done and Versailles is the only place that can be accomplished. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Thin-lipped and prone to earnest hopes about "opening the king's 
eyes," Ponceludon is viewed with mocking disdain by this dissipated 
world. Though he has a more-than-agile tongue, he doesn't know the 
territory, which is why a chance meeting with the Marquis de Bellegarde 
(smooth veteran Jean Rochefort) proves critical. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Bellegarde takes a liking to the young man and determines to help him 
with the politicking and mental dexterity necessary to gain the ear of 
the king. Don't laugh at your own remarks, he advises, don't indulge in 
puns and, above all, "be witty, sharp and malicious and you'll succeed." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It's not quite so simple, of course, for in an aristocratic cesspool 
like Versailles getting on the wrong side of powerful people is always a 
danger. Ponceludon almost immediately offends a viper-like cleric 
(Bernard Giraudeau), but he also attracts the favorable notice of the 
formidable Madame de Blayac (Fanny Ardant at her most persuasive). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   A flirtatious woman of the world, alternately calculating and 
seductive and thought to be the mistress of the king, Madame de Blayac 
would be a powerful ally for anyone, especially a novice. But her aid 
doesn't come without its costs and as Ponceludon gets caught up in 
calculations and intrigues, the possibility arises that he may become as 
heartless as everyone else in pursuit of his goal. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   All this becomes more complicated with the arrival of Bellegarde's 
beautiful daughter Mathilde (Judith Godreche), who displays a no-doubt 
historically accurate penchant for low-cut frocks and a passion for 
scientific experimentation, both of which catch Ponceludon's eye. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   An independent, free-thinking woman, Mathilde has difficulties of her 
own. Intent on finding the funding for her work with a primitive diving 
suit, she is on the verge of a mercenary marriage to a lecherous old man. 
Ponceludon disapproves of both her suitor and her scientific bent, but 
strong-minded Mathilde is as used as he is to getting her own way. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Director Leconte, whose eclectic previous work includes "Monsieur 
Hire" and "The Hairdresser's Husband," has found a rare balance between 
the warmth of traditional romance and an acid portrayal of a corrupt, 
disdainful world that is unaware of the apocalypse it is headed toward. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Ideally cast across the board, "Ridicule's" success always comes back 
to Waterhouse's literate, bracing script, the result of considerable 
research into the French court. Leconte has said that reading it gave him 
"the sensation of actually entering the 18th century by a hidden, rarely 
used door." His handsomely appointed film makes that door accessible to 
everyone, and crossing the threshold is an experience to savor.

There's something about Wes Craven's sensational "Scream" popping 
up in a thicket of year-end prestige releases and holiday pictures that's 
as subversive as the movie itself. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It's sensational in both senses of the word: a bravura, provocative 
sendup of horror pictures that's also scary and gruesome yet too 
swift-moving to lapse into morbidity. It risks going way over the top, 
deliberately generating considerable laughter in the process. It ends up 
a terrific entertainment that also explores the relationship between 
movies and their audiences, specifically--but hardly 
exclusively--teenagers who love the kind of horror pictures Craven 
specializes in. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In essence it's the familiar tale of a serial killer terrorizing an 
affluent, picturesque small town, the epitome of nostalgic Americana. In 
this instance the unknown killer wears a black shroud and a white mask 
whose pained expression recalls that of the tormented face in Edvard 
Munch's famous painting "The Scream." This murderer, who loves to call up 
young women to terrify them before killing them, is especially savage and 
elusive. He--or she--is so busy that the corpses start piling up before 
local authorities are aware of all of them. "Scream" and its villain move 
faster than a wildfire. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Although the film has alphabetical billing, its star is Neve Campbell, 
whose Sidney barely escapes with her life when the killer invades her 
home, almost a year to the day that her mother was raped and killed. 
Sidney identified the murderer, now on death row, but feisty tabloid TV 
reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), quickly arriving on the scene, 
starts Sidney thinking that she may have made a mistake. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As suspense builds, young horror movie-nut Randy (Jamie Kennedy) 
remarks that the police ought to look at some horror pictures, "Prom 
Night," an early and potent Jamie Lee Curtis flick in particular, to 
understand that everyone should be considered a suspect. Writer Kevin 
Williamson, who clearly knows the genre inside out, and Craven succeed in 
keeping us guessing the identity of the killer and suspecting literally 
everyone, even Sidney, at one time or another. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Craven and Williamson are a dynamic duo and they give their largely 
youthful cast a thorough workout. Campbell and Skeet Ulrich, who plays 
Sidney's boyfriend, both made an impression in the effective and popular 
supernatural thriller "The Craft" earlier this year and are clearly 
gifted and resourceful actors, an observation that applies to all their 
young colleagues. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Cox and David Arquette, as a naive local cop, also register strongly 
and so do Drew Barrymore (as Sidney's best friend) and Henry Winkler (as 
the local high school's principal). Key to "Scream's" success are 
endlessly resourceful cinematographer Mark Irwin and Patrick Lussier's 
razor-sharp, no pun intended, editing. Loaded with insider references and 
jokes, "Scream" is deftly summed up by the villain: "Movies don't create 
psychopaths, movies make psychopaths more creative."

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
Before there was Larry Flynt, there was Al Goldstein, publisher of 
Screw Magazine and host of the cable-access show "Midnight Blue," two 
legendary mainstays of Manhattan's X-rated scene. Goldstein apparently 
became the first man ever to beat a federal obscenity charge--before 
Flynt even started publishing Hustler. Arrested 19 times by his own 
count, Goldstein is proud that he's never cut a deal with a prosecutor. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As with Flynt, Goldstein is important in the cause of 1st Amendment 
rights. But his story, told in Alexander Crawford's documentary 
"Screwed," makes "The People vs. Larry Flynt" look like "Pollyanna." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Clearly a shrewd, reflective man of superior intelligence, Goldstein 
can use four-letter words with the effect of a blowtorch. He's famously a 
no-holds-barred kind of guy, and filmmaker Crawford has wisely understood 
that nothing less than a no-holds-barred documentary will do. Crawford 
follows Goldstein everywhere, including the sets of the X-rated movies he 
makes. "Screwed" is as blunt as its subject. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Crawford also puts Goldstein in the context of his audience. He spends 
time with a heavyset young man searching for a hooker, with an older man 
interested in sadomasochistic sex and with a one-legged man who collects 
pornography, who says, "A world without pornography is a world without 
imagination." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Brooklyn-born Goldstein, who held down a variety of jobs before 
launching Screw in 1958 with $150, calls his magazine "a compendium of 
everything sexual" and he calls "Midnight Blue" more "revenge than 
entertainment." By this Goldstein means that the program's concern with 
sex gives him a chance to blast anyone who angers him, especially 
hypocrites. "I don't defend porn as much as I defend porn's right to 
exist," he says. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Goldstein has been honing his bombastic public persona for so long you 
sense that he probably means to be in total control of how he comes 
across on film. It is possible that he may not like that you come away 
from "Screwed" with a sense of just how much like he is to many of his 
readers and viewers: middle-aged, seriously overweight and not very 
successful with women. Indeed, as the film unfolds he's experiencing the 
breakup of his fourth marriage. Yet he also seems to want us to take 
seriously his own longing for love. At one point, he says, "I am the 
audience Screw targeted." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   He is an angry man, and much of that anger is directed at women as 
well as hypocrites on the issue of sex. A man who has known him a long 
time remarks, "He's a terrible enemy and a wonderful friend." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Crawford waits until nearly the end of his film to ask Goldstein what 
the price of being Al Goldstein has been. Goldstein, who tells him that 
it is his best question, replies, "No one takes you seriously. . . . 
They're amazed you ever read a book. . . . You're regarded as a cartoon 
character with no depth. . . . You make yourself into a joke so that no 
one can hurt you."

"Set It Off" is pulp with a purpose, a heist film with more than 
guns and ammo on its mind. Like the characters it presents, this film 
ends up with dreams it can't deliver on, but just having the desire to do 
something different makes it a project worth paying attention to. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Conceived as a kind of "Thelma & Louise" times two, with four African 
American women turning to bank robbery as the only way to solve their 
problems and get satisfaction from a hostile system, "Set It Off" is 
strongest at its core, the relationship between its heroines. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Played by Jada Pinkett ("The Nutty Professor"), rapper Queen Latifah, 
Vivica A. Fox ("Independence Day") and newcomer Kimberly Elise, these 
characters are always convincing as four lifelong friends from the mean 
streets of Los Angeles. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Their relationship has the kind of believability the rest of the film 
does not manage, and the bond between them is often all there is to carry 
us through the minefield of genre contrivances that are the obstacles to 
"Set It Off's" being taken seriously. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Because a quartet of female bank robbers is not the usual thing, 
screenwriters Kate Lanier and Takashi Bufford have ended up overdoing it 
when constructing the reasons for the women to turn to crime. The basic 
tack is to take the things each person cares about most and have them 
threatened or destroyed by the rules of an unfeeling society. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Stony (Pinkett) is devoted to her younger brother and determined to 
get him through college. Frankie (Fox) has worked hard to get a good job 
at a downtown bank and wants to rise through the ranks. Tisean (Elise) 
thinks only of her baby son. Only Cleo (Latifah), a rowdy lesbian who 
lives largely to party, needs little excuse to search for some extra 
cash. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The plan to take on banks starts half-seriously, with the women 
reacting to a local robbery with a joking "if those crackheads could rob 
a bank, we can." But once their lives have been seriously disarranged, 
they start to think of it as "just taking away from the system that's 
screwing us anyway." Except they don't say screwing. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Set It Off" picks up steam once the robberies begin in earnest. 
Director F. Gary Gray, whose last film was the small-scale comedy 
"Friday," probably relished the opportunity to work on flashy action 
stunts like crashing a Suburban through the window of a target bank. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Set It Off" also has a pleasant but predictable romantic interlude as 
Stony catches the eye of a Harvard-educated "buppie" bank executive at 
one of the branches she's casing. Suavely played by Blair Underwood, this 
guy is not only the soul of politeness and sensitivity, he even cooks. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Though he is obviously talented, Gray is also 26 years old, and "Set 
It Off" is characterized by the youthful director tendency to be 
overambitious, to try to squeeze every possible movie moment into one 
finite film. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   He can't resist, for instance, shoehorning in what turns out to be a 
quite amusing comic parody of "The Godfather," in which the four women 
sit around a big conference table, call one another names like 
"Cleo-menza" and discuss in Marlon Brando-type Italian accents what their 
plan of attack will be. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   One of "Set It Off's" least convincing aspects is the dogged police 
pursuit that hunts them down as the women consider the inevitable last 
big job. Though the film is finally a prisoner of its genre conventions 
and its reliance on coincidence, we've come to care enough about this 
quartet that we do wonder, as we should, whether there will be a way out 
for any of them, and what the price of that might be.

refuseniks drink tea and contemplate their screen-savers. Suddenly a 
gunman enters and systematically slaughters the staff--all except one, 
who throws the assassin a curve by hiding his tea setting in a sideboard.

   "Three Days of the Condor"? No, and it's not quite Robert Redford 
either. The one with the highly coveted info is Theodore Bikel, playing 
another Eastern Bloc intellectual, who draws Corvette-driving, 
basketball-playing presidential advisor/frat boy Bobby Bishop (Charlie 
Sheen) into a nasty nest of clandestine government and anti-American 
subterfuge.

   "Shadow Conspiracy" is one of those movies that would make you ask, 
"Where do they get this stuff?," except you probably know the answer 
already. "Condor." "The Parallax View." Any of Hitchcock's "wrong man" 
movies. In one scene, a marquee advertising "Touch of Evil" tries to 
implicate Orson Welles in this mess, and the relentless killer played by 
Stephen Lang seems straight out of "Terminator II." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Speaking of which: The recently resuscitated Linda Hamilton is in the 
cast, as a member of the White House press corps with bad taste in hats 
and even worse taste in men--she and Bishop have a history (of course), 
which intrudes itself on an already crowded narrative. Desperately, the 
two try to outrun the traitors at the high end of the governmental food 
chain who want to usurp the president (Sam Waterston) by any means 
necessary and install a government that best resembles their idea of 
civilization. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Did we mention "Seven Days in May"? How about the Ollie North trials? 
It hardly matters. The overriding problem with "Shadow Conspiracy," which 
was never meant to be taken seriously anyway, is that there isn't an 
appealing person in it. Donald Sutherland, as the White House chief of 
staff, looks as if he's prepping for "The Jack Kevorkian Story." Ben 
Gazzara, as the vice president, reminded me a lot of Dick Morris. 
Hamilton and Sheen deserve each other and Gore Vidal, in a cameo as the 
crooked Congressman Page, seems to be mortified, probably because he's 
found himself in this movie. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Watching the direction of George P. Cosmatos--who's been responsible 
for "Rambo II," "Cobra" and "The Cassandra Crossing," as well as the far 
more palatable "Tombstone"--one begins to admire Lang's efficiency as a 
trained killer. You might even root for him. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Cosmatos' chase scenes are perfunctory exercises that generate little 
or no suspense. The first chase comes too soon (because you know it's too 
early for the hero to die), and others come too late (because the nation 
must survive and Bobby's the only one who can save it). There's even a 
pursuit inside the White House and its network of subterranean tunnels 
that is not just prolonged but in defiance of several laws of physics. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   And as each member of the cast tries, none too successfully, to 
convince us there are vital matters at risk here, the howlers multiply, 
as do the lines for the exits.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
Robert Byington's "Shameless," also known as "Sin Verguenza," is a 
rightly disturbing and venturesome first film of more interest for what 
it portends for Byington than for what it accomplishes--although that in 
itself is considerable. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It has the edgy, shot-from-the-hip, no-budget feel of countless other 
independent films (it's in black and white), yet leaves you with the 
feeling that you've experienced a highly personal, unwavering and 
distinctive vision. As his title suggests, Byington is presenting a view 
of contemporary society in which it's easy for young people to have no 
sense of right and wrong. That his three central figures are all or 
partly of Latino descent and therefore most likely to have had some 
exposure to Roman Catholicism allows Byington to underline this lack and 
at times to suggest an unconscious longing for moral certainties. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   They are all students at a Texas university, where Myers (Scott 
Rhodes), a teaching assistant in a course in architecture, is attracted 
to Imalia (Natalie Karp) but who diverts him to her seemingly more 
innocent roommate Arcadio (Carmen Nogales). What evolves is a tenuous, 
restless triangle, with Myers finding Imalia's chronic case of petty 
thievery a terrific turn-on. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Byington captures quite well the fragmented, conflicting sense of 
cultural identity and occasional bigotry experienced by these three, 
especially Imalia, who asks: "What is your mother tongue if your mother 
is Spanish but won't speak it in the house?" 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It is doubtlessly significant that Imalia steals, among countless 
other items, a cheap plaster Madonna she has a hard time selling for $10. 
Byington is too smart to excuse Imalia's larcenous behavior on ethnic 
confusion yet makes it clear that she seems to be living in a moral 
vacuum. Neither he "explains" Imalia nor does she herself. Instead, 
Imalia takes a defiant, don't-mess-with-me stance that comes across with 
a riveting, emphatic quality, thanks to Karp, a most commanding young 
actress. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The challenge that "Shameless" and other films similar to it presents 
is in involving us with people there really is no reason to care much 
about. That the moody, sardonic "Shameless," which has an exciting 
soundtrack showcasing Austin bands, is not easily dismissed says 
something for quality and force of Byington's talent.

It's a rainy night and a man is walking in the downpour, soaked 
through and talking much too fast. He's one of the legion of the mentally 
unstable--erratic, intriguing, even frightening--that city dwellers 
instinctively avoid, and when he stumbles into a piano bar in Perth, 
Australia, at the beginning of "Shine," everyone wishes he hadn't. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Lurching around with his nervous inability to focus, the intruder 
seems to know he's balanced on the cusp of madness. "Got to stop talking, 
got to stop, got to stop, it's a problem, isn't it, is it a problem?" he 
babbles super-fast, but he can't slow himself down. For his voice is his 
only companion, and all that high-speed chattering is compensation for 
terrible loss. "Tragedy," he mutters to himself as the bar's owner drives 
him home, "ridiculous tragedy." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The man's name is David Helfgott, and though no one suspects it, he 
least of all, that rainy night is a turning point in his life. Based on a 
true story and widely anticipated since its gangbusters premiere at the 
Sundance Film Festival, "Shine" goes backward to reveal the ferocious 
battles that made David a casualty and forward to show the unimagined 
experiences life still holds for him. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   David's path in either direction is not usual or foreseeable in its 
specifics. In broad outline, however, it's more familiar. Focusing on the 
crossover between genius and madness, "Shine" is one of those 
exhilarating depictions of the power of love and the resilience of the 
human spirit that sounds doomed to overflow the borders of cliched 
emotionalism. Miraculously, it doesn't. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Perhaps the great disservice Hollywood has done modern moviegoers is 
refusing to trust them in matters of the heart. In the hands of the 
studios stories like this are so brazen in their manipulation they make 
us simultaneously angry and ashamed of our finer feelings. As told by 
Australian director Scott Hicks, screenwriter Jan Sardi, cinematographer 
Geoffrey Simpson, editor Pip Karmel and a gifted group of actors, "Shine" 
reverses the trend. It's a throwback to the best of old-fashioned 
Hollywood movies, able to move an audience without insulting it in the 
process. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   There is a piano in the room of the adult Helfgott (prominent 
Australian stage actor Geoffrey Rush), and its presence triggers an 
extended series of flashbacks, starting in the early 1950s. It's then 
that a tiny pianist (7-year-old Alex Rafalowicz) so astonishes well-to-do 
Ben Rosen (Nicholas Bell), one of the judges at a local talent show, that 
he tracks the prodigy down and offers to help with future lessons. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   What he gets is not gratitude but fear of all outsiders from the boy's 
mother and sisters and stony hostility from Peter Helfgott, whose almost 
first words about David, a somber "He is my son," turn out to have the 
most awful and pervasive significance. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   For Peter Helfgott, magnificently played by Armin Mueller-Stahl, is a 
man turned by personal and world history into a rigid and willful tyrant 
with his son. Taught to be unbending by a father he despised for keeping 
him from music, he has focused the terrible weight of his frustrated 
ambitions on the frail boy. And as a refugee from the Holocaust who 
believes "in this world the weak get crushed like insects," he is 
unbending in his determination not to "let anyone destroy this family." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   At those moments when "Shine" threatens to get gooey, the integrity of 
Mueller-Stahl's chilling performance invariably stops it cold. A 
terrifying, terrorizing bully who forces his son to repeat "I am a very 
lucky boy" again and again, this monster father is also--and this is 
critical--a painfully human beast who clandestinely hugs his son in the 
dark of night. Perhaps most frightening of all, when Peter says, "No one 
will love you like me," he believes it. With a father like this, no 
scenario is beyond possibility. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   When we turn to David as a teenager (now played by "Flirting's" Noah 
Taylor), his advancement as a pianist is set off by a kind of regression 
on the emotional front. Awkward, vulnerable, feeling "I'm never really 
sure about anything," David is graceful and fully alive only in front of 
the keyboard. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   And always there looms the figure of Peter Helfgott, possessively 
insisting, "I know, David, what is best because I am your father." The 
more David threatens to break free, the more the leash is tightened, and 
the twitches in the boy that prefigure what we've seen of the man become 
more and more apparent. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The combination of situations that finally converge to drive David 
over the edge and what happens to him after that rainy night benefit from 
the intuitive restraint of director Hicks, who has a background in 
documentaries, and his determination to keep the story's maudlin 
possibilities at arm's length. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Shine" is also enlivened by its anachronistic willingness to proclaim 
the power of classical music. Piano competition is treated as "a blood 
sport" and the ability of Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3, the film's 
centerpiece, to derange the unwary is insisted on. "The piano is a 
monster," says music professor Cecil Parkes (an effortlessly heroic John 
Gielgud). "Tame it or it will swallow you whole." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Playing the adult David Helfgott, keeping the balance between ensuring 
the character's humanity and seeing that his madness does not unravel 
into mere winsome eccentricity, is a difficult task and Geoffrey Rush, 
selected by Hicks for his experience with the large emotions of 
Shakespeare, handles the challenge superbly. The confidence and grasp 
David exhibits when he sits down at the piano spills over to the rest of 
the film, and in the process "Shine" is transformed into popular 
filmmaking at its smartest and most persuasive.

Billy Bob Thornton's "Sling Blade" is a mesmerizing parable of good 
and evil and a splendid example of Southern storytelling at its most 
poetic and imaginative. It marks the feature directorial and solo writing 
debuts for Thornton, who also stars. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   That it is so stunningly original and powerful will come as no 
surprise to anyone who saw 1992's "One False Move," in which Thornton 
played a congenial small-town sheriff and which he wrote with Tom 
Epperson for director Carl Franklin. The tension, the sense of surprise, 
the dark power of the past and the affection for the locale and its 
people that characterized the earlier film are all in full force in 
"Sling Blade." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   We meet Karl Childers (Thornton) just as he is to be released from a 
state mental institution somewhere in the South. ("Sling Blade" was 
filmed in Benton, Ark., in Thornton's native state.) Karl, who is mildly 
retarded, has been incarcerated for 25 years after having slain, at the 
age of 12, his mother and her lover when he caught them in the act. The 
head of the institution (James Hampton) sees to it that Karl, a whiz with 
small engines, gets a job and shelter in his nearby hometown at a machine 
shop. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Hunched over and speaking in a monotone growl with lots of "uh huhs," 
Karl is met with kindness. He strikes up a friendship with a fatherless 
boy, Frank Wheatley (Lucas Black), whose widowed mother Linda (Natalie 
Canerday) invites him to move into her garage. But as Karl becomes part 
of the Wheatley family, the situation becomes increasingly tense, thanks 
to Linda's lover Doyle (Dwight Yoakam). Sober, Doyle is merely a petty 
tyrant who likes to make life miserable for Frank; drunk, he is downright 
dangerous, nasty and violent. Right from the start Vaughan (John Ritter, 
all but unrecognizable), Linda's devoted gay boss at the local dry-goods 
store, warns Karl that Doyle is a monster. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Sling Blade" is a strong, devastating film that could have been even 
stronger had more screen time been devoted to Linda and Doyle and less to 
Karl and Frank, whose friendship is more readily credible and 
established. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   We're made to understand that Linda is lonely, that available men are 
clearly in short supply in her town and that Doyle has his seductive, 
remorseful side and that she can feel his torment. (Like Karl, Doyle has 
apparently had a horrific childhood.) But Doyle, thanks to Yoakam's 
terrifying portrayal, is so scary so much of the time that you have a 
hard time understanding how Linda can stand to have him in her life. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   We just don't get to know Linda well enough to understand how a 
good-hearted woman, who can have Vaughan as her best friend and take in 
Karl, can put up with Doyle, a snarly, physically abusive, world-class 
homophobe, bigot and tormentor of her son. We can only assume she is in 
ultimately profound denial over Doyle, despite her actions and remarks to 
the contrary. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It says something for Thornton's forcefulness as a filmmaker and the 
skill of his cast that "Sling Blade," so very well-photographed by Barry 
Markowitz, can sustain such puzzlement over Linda. "Sling Blade" catches 
you up so firmly in its world that you find yourself accepting whatever 
Thornton presents right up to its deeply ironic finish. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Thornton is totally persuasive as Karl, a simple wise man in the 
classic screen tradition, and so is country music legend Yoakam, whose 
acting career has been developing over the past several years. (As Doyle 
he even has to come across as a terrible musician.) 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Ritter, with whom Thornton appeared regularly on the "Hearts Afire" TV 
series, expresses not only his devotion to the Wheatleys but also the 
anguish at being gay in a small town. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Black, Canerday, Hampton, Robert Duvall as Karl's father and J.T. 
Walsh as a mental patient also impress. Contributing strongly to making 
"Sling Blade" a captivating experience is Daniel Lanois' exceptional 
score--alternately ominous, folksy and passionate, which could also serve 
as a description of this alternately tender and frightening film.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
The first words spoken in Terry George's potent IRA drama "Some 
Mother's Son" are by then-newly elected British Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher, who, apparently stating her position on the "Irish problem," 
quotes St. Francis of Assisi: "Where there is discord, may we bring 
harmony. Where there is error, may we bring truth. Where there is doubt, 
may we bring faith. And where there is despair, may we bring hope." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Action, of course, speaks louder than words, and in Thatcher's first 
year, the British government set out to destroy popular support for the 
IRA in Northern Ireland with a get-tough policy that would lead to the 
deaths of 10 IRA prisoners in the 1981 Irish hunger strikes and focus 
worldwide attention on the cruelty of the English hand in Ulster. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Some Mother's Son," co-written by Jim Sheridan and George, who'd also 
teamed up on the script for "In the Name of the Father," dramatizes the 
strike from the perspective of two husbandless women whose sons are 
united in the fast. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Kathleen Quigley (Helen Mirren) is a teacher at a small Catholic 
school who is apolitical, nonviolent and oblivious to her son's passions. 
Annie Higgins (Fionnula Flanagan), a crusty farmer, is not only aware of 
her son's IRA activities, but also, with the fresh memory of another son 
killed by the British, encourages and supports them. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   When Gerard Quigley (Aidan Gillen) and Frank Higgins (David O'Hara) 
are arrested and convicted for their roles in an IRA rocket assault on 
British troops, Kathleen and Annie form an uneasy alliance that--as their 
sons' fates are joined with those in the prison hunger strike--becomes 
something that transcends politics and taps into the nature of maternal 
love itself. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   George, in his directing debut, does a remarkable job of balancing the 
parallel stories--the relationship between the moms, and life for their 
sons inside notorious H-Block. Kathleen, Annie and their sons are 
fictional characters, as are most of the priests, British officials and 
IRA leaders we meet. But the political details are historical fact. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Some Mother's Son" follows Thatcher's opening comments with the 
announcement by a chillingly eager young government official (Tom 
Hollander) of a plan to "isolate," "criminalize" and "demoralize" IRA 
members. They'll isolate them by cutting off border routes and creating 
surveillance walls around suspected IRA pockets. They'll criminalize them 
by refusing to acknowledge the IRA as a political entity. And they'll 
demoralize them by recanting an earlier agreement to treat imprisoned 
members as POWs. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It was this last measure that produced the hunger strike. Led by Bobby 
Sands (John Lynch), who would be martyred as the first to die, IRA 
prisoners issued a list of five demands, which merely amounted to a 
restoration of their previous political prisoner status. But the Thatcher 
government held firm, and the only way for the life of a fasting inmate 
to be spared was for his family to order that he be force-fed. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   That's the dilemma ultimately facing Kathleen and Annie, as their sons 
weaken and lose their ability to speak for themselves. Do you honor your 
child's principles or your own instincts? This is powerful stuff. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Mirren and Flanagan give wonderful performances, playing women forcing 
themselves to find common ground, and the filmmakers mitigate their clear 
anti-British sentiments with the condemnation of violence on both sides. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Many political scientists hold the view that the Irish problem may 
have no solution, but when Kathleen Quigley, at the peak of her outrage, 
reaches down to stop her younger son from throwing a rock, it's a quietly 
profound gesture of reason. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Whoever is hit by the rock--or the bullet--is some mother's son, and 
the morale here is that until everyone can empathize with the surviving 
victims of violence, peace can't even exist as a goal.

"Space Jam" whimsically teams basketball superstar Michael Jordan 
and cartoon icon Bugs Bunny in a blend of live-action and animation 
containing more rowdiness and broad humor than vintage Looney Tunes 
charm. Amazingly, this handsome, ingenious Warner Bros. comedy marks 
Bugs' feature debut in a leading role. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Shrewdly, producer Ivan Reitman's raft of writers makes all the 
maneuvering required to bring these two giants of sports and popular 
culture together a key part of the fun, while legendary commercials 
director Joe Pytka brings maximum impact and pace to every moment. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Space Jam" also looks great, with veteran cinematographer Michael 
Chapman's palette well-matched with the rich colors of the cartoon 
sequences created by Warner's feature animation division under its 
producer Ron Tippe and his vast number of artists and technicians. The 
idea has been to bring back the whole Looney Tunes crew, right down to 
Tweety and Pepe Le Pew, and place them in a contemporary setting. The 
special effects, created by Cinesite under Ed Jones' direction, are 
suitably impressive. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Space Jam" has Jordan playing himself, announcing his 1993 retirement 
from basketball and his switch to baseball, with its less-than-stellar 
results the source of much good-humored joking. Meanwhile, on another 
planet the evil promoter Swackhammer (the gleeful voice of Danny DeVito) 
decides that his Moron Mountain theme park could be perked up by the 
Looney Tuners and thereby dispatches a five-member alien team to Earth to 
kidnap Bugs and company. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Thanks to a convenient sense of fair play, the aliens, known as 
Nerdlucks, agree to a basketball game to decide the Looneys' fate. But 
there's a hitch: The diminutive Nerdlucks have magically siphoned off the 
talent of NBA stars Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Muggsy Bogues, Larry 
Johnson and Shawn Bradley and morph them into the Monstars, a team of 
giants that loom like a stand of redwoods. You've guessed it: Bugs 
figures that only Michael Jordan can save their day. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Adults will know where "Space Jam" is heading, although they may need 
to guide younger kids through plot convolutions along the way. Still, the 
filmmakers make the getting there pretty entertaining, though scarcely 
subtle, taking care to send the message to youngsters that it takes heart 
as much as skill to win. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Pytka, whose first feature was the hilarious but neglected 1989 
horse-racing comedy "Let It Ride," has enabled Jordan to relax and play 
himself without a trace of self-consciousness. His warmth and 
unpretentiousness set off his formidable physical presence and grace. 
Wayne Knight plays an unctuous baseball team publicist and Theresa Randle 
is seen briefly as Jordan's wife. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Former basketball star Larry Bird and an uncredited Bill Murray add to 
the laughs as Jordan's golf partners, and Billy West heads the fine cast 
of the cartoon voices, playing Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. "Space Jam" is 
no "Who Framed Roger Rabbit," but it works well enough.

This is a test. This is only a test. Can anyone outside the 
hard-core faithful tell the "Star Trek" movies apart? One featured 
whales, but was it "Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home" or "Star Trek V: The 
Final Frontier"? And at this late date who remembers just what it was 
that made Khan so angry in "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"? 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   That blurring is not likely to happen with "Star Trek: First Contact," 
the eighth movie in a series that may yet see more episodes than Andy 
Hardy. Blessed with clever plot devices and a villainous horde that makes 
the once-dread Klingons seem like a race of Barneys, "First Contact" does 
everything you'd want a "Star Trek" film to do, and it does it with 
cheerfulness and style. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Still working largely with the cast of the now-defunct "Star Trek: The 
Next Generation," "First Contact" has all the paraphernalia Trekkers 
(apparently the name of choice) have come to expect: Lights flash, 
temporal vortexes get created and people say cutting things like, "You do 
remember how to fire phasers?" 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   And, as created by a core of "Trek" veterans (including, among others, 
producer Rick Berman, director and co-star Jonathan Frakes, writers 
Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore, and production designer Herman 
Zimmerman), this movie's themes place it squarely within the boundaries 
of Gene Roddenberry's original "Star Trek" culture of one-world idealism. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   And did anyone mention those villains? Making their big-screen debut 
are the Borg, bad to the bone and proud of it. Part human, part synthetic 
(and realized with appropriate menace by costume designer Deborah Everton 
and makeup wizard Michael Westmore), these unstoppable high-tech zombies 
are not just making conversation when they tell their adversaries, 
"Resistance is futile." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   So arrogant they take no notice of anyone not in attack mode, so 
flexible they adjust and overpower any weapons system, the Borg are 
master assimilators, determined to glom onto, absorb and destroy all life 
forms in the galaxy. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   They're so good at it, in fact, that on the TV series the Borg 
temporarily assimilated Enterprise Capt. Jean-Luc Picard. "First Contact" 
opens with a powerful visual reference to that experience, what the 
"Trek" people are calling "the longest pullback in science-fiction 
history," as Matthew Leonetti's camera goes (via 120 feet of dolly track 
and sharp special-effects work) from a close-up of Picard's eye to his 
puny place in the unimaginably large Borg Collective. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Because of that experience, when the Borg invade the Federation in the 
24th century, Picard is kept away from the front lines. But he finds a 
way to join in and eventually discovers the Borg headed toward Earth and 
into the past, to mid-April 2063 to be specific. Their nefarious scheme 
soon becomes obvious: to change history by stopping First Contact, the 
great day when humans on Earth sent up a rocket at warp speed and 
connected with the rest of the solar system. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Naturally, Capt. Picard is not amused. In fact, the commander is 
almost never amused, but as played by the exceptional Patrick Stewart, 
whose wide range includes Shakespeare and Dickens, his presence and 
ability to say "Get off my bridge" like he means it is formidable. If 
whoever first beamed him onto the show isn't getting profit participation 
from dollar one, there is no justice in the Federation. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   At this point, "First Contact" splits in two. The softer part of the 
film moves to Earth, where a team is sent to find Zefram Cochrane 
("Babe's" James Cromwell), the man who invented warp drive, and his 
partner Lily Sloane (Alfre Woodard), and help them get their epoch-making 
rocket airborne. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Picard stays back on the Enterprise, trying to fight off an attempt by 
the rest of the elusive Borg to take over his ship. Though they pride 
themselves on their collective consciousness, the Borg turn out to have a 
fabulously evil, Medusa-like queen bee (a convincing Alice Krige), and 
her encounters with both Picard and human wannabe Lt. Cmdr. Data (Brent 
Spiner) are delicious and chilling. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   A page-turner with the right kind of pulp sensibility, "First Contact" 
works in cultural references from "Moby Dick" to Steppenwolf's "Magic 
Carpet Ride," and a way has even been found to get the Vulcans back into 
the picture. If the "Star Trek" brain trust continues turning out movies 
like this one, living long and prospering is not going to be a problem.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
Does any film dealing with the Holocaust invariably become a 
Holocaust Movie? It seems a natural process of attrition: The gravest 
aspect of a thing tends to overwhelm it, contain it, direct it, until the 
subordinate characteristics fall away like rain. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Is it the same with a man? That's the question--one of the 
questions--at the heart of "The Substance of Fire," Daniel Sullivan's 
adaptation of Jon Robin Baitz's play, in which the central character's 
accomplishment, intelligence, sophistication and sense fall victim to a 
Final Solution of guilt and memory. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Can Isaac Geldhart (Ron Rifkin), the owner of an upscale New York 
publishing house, preserve his company, his family, his self-respect, and 
remain true to his sense of guilty obligation? He sees himself as 
something less than a Holocaust survivor--the rest of his family died 
while he survived in an Anne Frank-ish garret--and has an obsession with 
Nazi ephemera. He is also stubborn, prideful, thoroughly offended by 
popular culture, and when given the choice of marketing what he thinks is 
trash or seeing his imprint go under, forges ahead with plans to put out 
a four-volume work on Nazi medical experiments. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   His children--Aaron (Tony Goldwyn), who works with him; Martin 
(Timothy Hutton), a professor of landscape architecture at Vassar; and 
Sarah (Sarah Jessica Parker), star of a "Sesame Street"-style TV 
show--balk. Aaron proposes they publish a trendy novel by his lover, Val 
(the always effective Gil Bellows), and is dismissed. Martin sides with 
Aaron, Sarah sides with Dad, then she sides with Aaron--they're not the 
swiftest group, and present one of the more unconvincing gene pools since 
"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But as Isaac, Rifkin is simply transcendent, giving what is the most 
accomplished performance of the year. Re-creating the stage role that won 
him Obie and Drama Desk awards in New York (where the play was mounted at 
Playwrights Horizon and Lincoln Center before moving to the Mark Taper 
Forum in Los Angeles), he makes Isaac exasperating, irritating, 
infuriating, endearing, but above all else noble, even when Isaac's mind 
begins to disintegrate. A 30-year veteran of stage and screen, Rifkin has 
seldom if ever been given this kind of opportunity. He responds by 
dissolving his other self completely, fully possessing the character and 
soul of Isaac Geldhart. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   He does not, however, have a completely successful movie around him. 
Part of the problem is the play, the second act of which has apparently 
been rewritten, but which doesn't ultimately work. Motivations are 
unexplained, characters are less than defined. History--in a play that 
spins on history--is incomplete. How, for instance, did Isaac become such 
an affluent member of New York's literati with such a lack of business 
acumen? If his suicidal pursuit of excellence is solely based on the loss 
of his wife (played in flashback by Barbara Eda-Young), it might have 
been better explained. If his dismissal of Val's pop-noir novel is even 
partially based on the fact that Val and Aaron are lovers, that might 
have been explained as well. There are numerous reactions, outbursts and 
tantrums that are disconcertingly overblown and incongruous. Director 
Sullivan never fully removes the play from the stage and some of his cast 
seems to want to play to the cheap seats. With the exception of Rifkin's 
acting, subtlety goes wanting. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But Rifkin makes the experience more than worthwhile. He's the 
American Paul Scofield, the part that elevates the questionable whole, 
and gives "The Substance of Fire" the substance it has.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
With his terse, intricately structured "Thieves," France's 
formidable Andre Techine reunites his "Ma Saison Preferee" stars 
Catherine Deneuve and Daniel Auteuil and continues his exploration of 
thorny family relationships--and this time, an even thornier menage a 
trois as well. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The result is a somber, darkly witty, engrossing film with a driving, 
relentless pace. Right away you sense Techine is going to take you to 
some moment of emotional truth, the nature of which is as unpredictable 
as life itself. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In their earlier teaming, Deneuve and Auteuil were a sister and 
brother whose personalities clash when confronted with a crusty, 
independent mother felled by a stroke. This time Auteuil has a brother 
with whom he tangles, and the way in which Deneuve enters the story is 
just one of its many surprises. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Auteuil's Alex is a glum, prickly policeman in Lyons, where his 
ruthless older brother Ivan (Didier Bezace), a gangster, runs a 
nightclub. The irony is that a young woman, Juliette (Laurence Co^te), he 
lets off on a shoplifting charge also has a slightly older brother 
(Benoit Magimel), who Alex does not know is Ivan's second-in-command in 
the gang. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The further irony is that when Juliette and Alex commence an affair, 
he does not learn till somewhat later that she's also in a serious 
romance with her beautiful philosophy professor, Marie (Deneuve), the 
woman Juliette sees as her role model. Events force the street-smart but 
anti-intellectual Alex and the brilliant, highly cultured Marie to come 
to tentative terms with each other in the name of Juliette's best 
interests, just as the brother and sister did in "Ma Saison Preferee" in 
regard to their mother's welfare. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Craggy-featured and capable of ferocious concentration and intensity, 
Auteuil is always terrific at playing profoundly emotionally impacted 
men. He's an edgy actor, and you suspect that Deneuve, consummately 
skilled actress that she is, loves the challenge of the sharp byplay 
Auteuil presents. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Alex and Juliette (who is also played with maximum vulnerability and 
defiance by Co^te) are people with low self-esteem, and Alex figures that 
what makes their affair so hot is their mutual contempt for each other. A 
divorced mother and grandmother who lives modestly, Marie, in an 
encounter with her ex-husband, reflects that marriages can't endure 
unless the couple has found a way of expressing rage. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In telling his tightly coiled tale, Techine leapfrogs from the point 
of view of one character to the next, moving back and forth in time in 
the process, a technique that adds both suspense--the film on one level 
is a murder mystery--and dimension to its many people and their 
complexities. As he has done throughout his 25-year, 13-film career, 
Techine uses provincial settings for the freshness their relative 
unfamiliarity offers while resisting opportunities to take 
self-consciously beautiful shots such locales often present. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Techine is daring in his use of coincidence, but it pays off 
handsomely because he's been able to make it set off the exceedingly 
complicated and contradictory emotions most people feel in regard to 
themselves and those they love, and beyond that, the eternal 
inter-working of fate and choice. "Thieves" further assures Techine's 
place in the front rank of international filmmakers.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
Raoul Ruiz's "Three Lives and Only One Death" is a sly, droll, 
deliciously intricate fable contemplating the human personality in all 
its mystery and presenting Marcello Mastroianni with one of his most 
challenging acting opportunities. In the surreal world of the 
ever-audacious Ruiz, people are usually not what they seem and fate works 
more dramatically in the lives of his people than in our own. Yet in 
heightening human experience Ruiz fires our imagination, asking us to 
consider the possibility that life is richer, more ironic and darkly 
funny than we may realize. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The leisurely "Three Lives" is in fact highly demanding. But don't 
worry about getting lost in its twists and turns of plot, for everything 
becomes clear--or reasonably so--in its darkly bravura finale. "Three 
Lives" doesn't require another viewing to enjoy it, but surely it would 
seem lots clearer the second time around and would afford an opportunity 
to appreciate Ruiz's skill in foreshadowing. Although operating on a far 
more intellectual level, "Three Lives" is like an Agatha Christie 
mystery: In retrospect, you realize there were clues all along. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In essence, Ruiz presents Mastroianni first as a traveling salesman 
who informs a man (Feodor Atkine) that he is in fact the onetime husband 
of the man's wife (Marisa Paredes)--and has been living directly across 
the street from them in Paris for the last 20 years in an apartment 
inhabited by fairies with supernatural powers. Then we encounter 
Mastroianni as a Sorbonne professor (of "negative" anthropology) who 
abruptly drops out to become a beggar. Then we discover Mastroianni as a 
butler at a mansion unexpectedly inherited by a poor young couple (Chiara 
Mastroianni, Marcello's look-alike daughter, and Melvil Poupaud). In 
"Three Lives' " final sequence, Mastroianni appears as a rich businessman 
whose imaginary family suddenly materializes in Paris for a visit. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Mastroianni segues from one situation to the next with the bemused 
aplomb of which he is a master, accepting every amazing development as 
Ruiz makes us aware of how subjective reality really is. "Three Lives" is 
an exquisite film that leaves us feeling confounded and disturbed--and 
suggests that this may well be the right response not only to it but to 
life itself.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
Though it's one of the first films out in 1997, "Turbulence" feels 
like yesterday's movie. Its plot dynamics, its dialogue, even its special 
effects, are familiar for having been employed time and time again. And 
usually to better effect than they are here. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Not for the makers of "Turbulence" is the spending of tens of millions 
of dollars on computer-generated imagery. Most of the special effects 
this time around come from simply shaking parts of the set with a 
venerable device called a gimbal. Hey, it may be old-fashioned, but it 
works. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   What's being shaken but not stirred is a 747 airplane headed from New 
York to Los Angeles. Because it's Christmas Eve (and because it's cheaper 
to film that way), the plane is almost empty: just an elderly couple, a 
rogue skateboarder and a couple of other folks. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Things don't stay quiet for long. Entering the plane en masse are four 
burly federal marshals escorting a pair of menacing criminals in chains: 
a bank robber named Stubbs (Brendan Gleeson) and convicted killer Ryan 
Weaver (Ray Liotta). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Actually, Weaver doesn't seem all that menacing. Though he's earned a 
reputation as the Lonely Hearts Strangler for having raped and killed 
five women, he insists he's innocent and seems solicitousness itself as 
he makes small talk with stewardess Teri Halloran (Lauren Holly). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Herself recently disappointed in love, Halloran insists to co-worker 
Maggie (Catherine Hicks) that Weaver "doesn't look like a serial killer," 
a judgment matched in acuity only by whoever told the Titanic's captain 
he didn't have to worry about icebergs. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Small as the group on the plane is, it's too large for screenwriter 
Jonathan Brett's purposes, and soon enough everyone else on the flight, 
from the pilots to the passengers and crew, have been disposed of one way 
or another, clearing the aisles for a cat-and-mouse game between the only 
two actors whose names can be found above the title. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As the unstable Weaver, who, it turns out, is so angry at the tough 
cop who arrested him (Hector Elizondo) that he doesn't care if he lives 
or dies, Liotta gives a performance that does nothing more than echo the 
legion of screen madmen who've come before him. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The same could be said for Holly's Teri, not the first woman to look 
distraught and terrified as a madman chases her around an aircraft and a 
major storm shakes everything up. Why she ends up having to both hold him 
off and try to land the plane in her underwear is something a special 
issue of Ms. Magazine might be devoted to. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Veteran director Robert Butler, whose career (mostly on television) 
extends all the way back to "The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes," has not 
managed to lift this predictable drama out of the ordinary. Though it's 
fortunate for Teri that the plane is on automatic pilot during most of 
her struggles, it's unfortunate for the audience that the picture is 
similarly situated all the way to the end.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
Gena Rowlands glows in her son Nick Cassavetes' endearing "Unhook 
the Stars" as a woman coming to the realization that she's reaching a 
crossroads in her life. A beautiful, wise, 60ish widow, Rowlands' Mildred 
has stayed on in the large old house where she has raised her son and 
daughter, but as life goes on with its constant and unexpected changes 
she comes to feel increasingly left behind and alone. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   No wonder, then, she jumps at the chance at baby-sitting J.J. (Jake 
Lloyd), the nice little 6-year-old who lives across the street. One 
morning, J.J.'s mother, Monica (Marisa Tomei), knocks on Mildred's door 
in sheer desperation. Stuck in a split-shift job at the local creamery 
and having just thrown out her husband (David Thornton) the night before, 
Monica can't believe her luck in finding someone so willing to help her 
care for J.J.--on a regular basis and for free. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Millie is a vibrant, take-charge type, a good storyteller who even 
makes working through an encyclopedia as much fun as baseball--well, 
almost. And just as Mildred and J.J. become best friends, so do the 
elegant, poised Millie and the loud, edgy, relentlessly foul-mouthed 
Monica. It's a joy to watch such accomplished actresses play two 
seemingly different women form such a firm bond. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But taking a broader, deeper perspective, Cassavetes and his 
co-writer, Helen Caldwell, move beyond their celebration of friendship, 
as warm and appealing as it is, to propel Mildred into a confrontation 
with herself, an awareness that it would be very easy to slip prematurely 
into a lonely old age. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Like his late father, John, Cassavetes is an actor-oriented 
director--but then he's been an actor himself. He has a sure sense of 
structure: The unfolding of Mildred's life is most effective, but he 
needed to fill in the background more fully. We know very well what his 
people are like and have a sense of how they got that way, but we'd also 
like to know how they earn their living. We also need to know more about 
Millie, who seems to have no life at all until J.J. comes along. Has she 
no friends or social activities? If so, why not? 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Nonetheless, Rowlands is in her usual top form, and so is Tomei. In 
Millie's scenes with her grown daughter (Moira Kelly), who's going 
through a hostile, independence-craving stage, and her upwardly mobile 
son (David Sherrill) with a snooty wife (Bridgette Wilson), we can see 
that she probably was too bossy with her daughter and too indulgent with 
her son--and that Millie's smart and honest enough to accept herself as a 
less-than-perfect human being. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But Millie strikes a French Canadian trucker, Big Tommy (Gerard 
Depardieu), whom she meets in a bar while out on the town with Monica, as 
a "real woman." You're eager for more of Depardieu and Rowlands, two 
nonpareil performers of the cinema, together. On the other hand, 
Depardieu's relatively small screen time does lend the film a certain 
subtlety. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   There's no question that in his first feature as a director Nick 
Cassavetes reveals the influence of his father, and certainly he's 
learned the importance of depth of character from both parents. Yet you 
have the feeling in this tender, often funny film that this Cassavetes is 
definitely his own man.

How wonderful it would be to be able to dismiss Emilio Estevez's 
"The War at Home" as being a little late in the game, as it deals with 
the agony of a returning Vietnam vet. That it is set in 1972, however, 
simply drives home its question of whether America really has taken 
responsibility for sending its sons and daughters off to a war that 
President Eisenhower himself warned against. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   According to the National Veterans Foundation, some 500,000 Vietnam 
veterans still suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, and it 
estimates that 34% of America's homeless are Vietnam veterans. "The War 
at Home" leaves you wondering how many more have gone untreated and to 
what degree such suffering has been heightened by the widespread 
ambivalence toward our most unpopular war and those who fought it. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   This is strong stuff, but "The War at Home" goes beyond its bristling 
broadside against the cruel plight of so many Vietnam veterans to present 
a portrait of the Middle American family at once as critical and 
compassionate as that of a Sinclair Lewis novel. If self-absorption is 
the abiding sin of Estevez's Colliers, just think how this tendency has 
worsened among us in the past quarter century. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Estevez stars himself as Jeremy Collier, a Vietnam vet who is 
transported back into the deadly jungles of Vietnam every time he walks 
in the woods behind his parents' comfortable suburban Texas home. Jeremy, 
who has made a stab at attending a nearby university, is consumed with a 
psychic pain that threatens to drive him around the bend as his family 
prepares to celebrate Thanksgiving. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   His father, Bob (Martin Sheen), the local GM dealer, is concerned 
about his son's state of mind but absolutely cannot comprehend why the 
profoundly embittered and guilt-ridden Jeremy can't put the past behind 
him and get on with his life--as he was able to in the aftermath of World 
War II. Bob, however, is fundamentally a know-it-all, old-fashioned man 
of the house whose word is law. He's a man who belongs to one of the last 
generation of white males who could succeed without much education. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Jeremy's mother, Maurine (Kathy Bates), is narrow-minded--she's not 
about to watch "Cactus Flower" on TV with that wicked Ingrid Bergman--and 
caught up in domestic routines yet down deep feels neglected by her 
family who in fact pay her little attention, perhaps because she's such a 
shrill, trivia-ridden bore. Jeremy's psych major younger sister Karen 
(Kimberly Williams) has heard something about veterans having "serious 
adjustment problems," but when she reaches out to Jeremy in a way he 
finds superficial she becomes solely concerned about her hurt feelings. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The Colliers have in their midst a son who's a potential time bomb 
ticking away but are fundamentally into wavering between denial and 
obtuseness. It occurs to none of them simply to ask him, "What was it 
like?," or that he is in dire need of professional help. In the Colliers' 
collective view all he really needs is to straighten up and fly right. 
The consequences of being "sent to a place where we fought only to stay 
alive" seem far beyond their interest, let alone comprehension. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Yet "The War at Home"--which writer James Duff adapted so deftly to 
the screen from his play "Homefront" that its theatrical roots don't 
occur to you--embraces rather than condemns the Colliers. They're all too 
human in their ignorance and pride yet are loving people. But will they 
ever be capable of responding to Jeremy in his increasing desperation? 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Estevez is a haunting Jeremy, and his ability to direct other actors 
(including his father) in highly complex and contradictory roles is 
formidable. Sheen, Bates (who brings a crucial saving humorousness to 
Maurine) and Williams all excel, and "The War at Home" offers a quartet 
of performances that are among the year's best. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "The War at Home," underlined effectively with Basil Poledouris' 
subtly elegiac score, is a confident, straight-ahead no-nonsense movie 
that delivers its message relentlessly with maximum impact.

What do you know about Robert E. Howard? When Arnold Schwarzenegger 
was becoming a movie star in the "Conan the Barbarian" movies in the 
early '80s, there was a resurgence of interest in the original creator of 
the pulp fiction hero. But for those of us merely passing by the 
phenomenon, the only thing that seemed to stick in our minds was that 
Howard was the guy who killed himself when his mother died. That's not 
exactly what happened. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But Howard definitely had an unusual attachment to his ailing mom, 
and, if Dan Ireland's "The Whole Wide World" has the story right, it was 
a relationship that destroyed any chance of his having a normal life. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "The Whole Wide World" is actually the story of Robert E. Howard 
(Vincent D'Onofrio), as told by Novalyne Price (Renee Zellweger), a young 
schoolteacher who befriended and fell in love with Howard in the mid-'30s 
and, half a century later, wrote about it in a memoir, "One Who Walked 
Alone." It's a story purposely written to debunk the myth of Howard as a 
mad genius, but in fact, one that perpetuates it. That's not necessarily 
bad. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   If the story, adapted by first-time screenwriter Michael Scott Myers, 
has been gilded by the years, it at least aims for another side of the 
truth. D'Onofrio plays Howard as a loud, boastful, insecure, socially 
awkward mama's boy who, in the presence of someone who doted on his 
talent and his imagination, became a bashful adolescent. If that's 
Price's rebuttal to all those attacks on his character, we may safely 
split the difference. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In any event, "The Whole Wide World" is a fascinating account of those 
years in rural Cross Plains, Texas, where the reclusive writer hammered 
out scores of the kind of action-adventure tales that reportedly made him 
the most popular American fiction writer of the late '20s and early '30s. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Price's relationship with Howard begins in 1933, when they're 
introduced by her former boyfriend. To everyone else, Howard is the town 
weirdo, but Price is an aspiring writer herself, with rejection letters 
to prove it, and she can't resist the opportunity to quiz a pro. Howard, 
in turn, can't believe his luck in having a pretty and intelligent woman 
interested in him. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   What follows is a strange and strangely moving love story. It's not 
exactly unrequited--they show physical affection, eventually, if just a 
kiss--but Howard is too emotionally constricted, too bound to his 
domineering mother (a wonderful Ann Wedgeworth), to allow it to evolve 
naturally. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   When Novalyne impetuously kisses him, after a year or so of 
quasi-dating, he collects himself, and gives her a speech, right out of 
the mouth of one of his macho characters, about being too footloose to 
take a wife. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Ireland, a producer making his directing debut, has taken on a tough 
assignment, with a love story that builds tension without providing a 
moment of release or a sliver of optimism. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   What he has is two terrific actors and the faith that they can make 
the journey worthwhile. Zellweger, who has audiences eating out of her 
hands as Tom Cruise's co-star in "Jerry Maguire," is a dream here, as 
well. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   There's a depth of honesty and intelligence in Zellweger's faintly 
Asian eyes that attracts and holds our attention like few actors can. She 
more than holds her own with Cruise, and here, she seems to rein in 
D'Onofrio every time he threatens to fly off the screen. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It's still a wildly eccentric performance that D'Onofrio gives; Howard 
is so loud at times, you'll be wishing you could get your hands on his 
volume control. But at other times, when Howard's desperation for 
Novalyne leaves him literally tongue-tied, D'Onofrio's expression melts 
your heart. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In the end, "The Whole Wide World" probably doesn't provide any real 
insights into Howard's personality. Mad genius may be as close as 
anybody's going to get to an explanation for a man whose facile prose 
dazzled H.P. Lovecraft himself, and who did, in fact, kill himself when a 
doctor told him his mother's condition was hopeless. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But if Novalyne Price, now 88 and living in Louisiana, got something 
off her chest, it's our pleasure.

For those who have not had the experience, watching Baz Luhrmann's 
brash take on "William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet" simulates having a 
teenager in the house. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Like flaming youth everywhere, this film is loud, exuberant and 
excessive, but it has enough positive energy and dizzying high spirits to 
make it irresistible. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   A wild-in-the-streets version of the classic romance that is desperate 
not to be your father's Shakespeare, this "Romeo" follows in the path of 
Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 film by having youthful actors, Leonardo 
DiCaprio and Claire Danes in this case, playing the protagonists. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But director and co-screenwriter Luhrmann, working with many of the 
key creative people that made his "Strictly Ballroom" debut so special, 
has done nothing else familiar. Juiced to the max and drenched in style, 
this "Romeo," mad about its image-a-minute visual agenda, is sure to 
infuriate as much as it delights. But the film can't be bothered to slow 
down for your reaction, and it never forgets its duty to be alive on the 
screen. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Given this all-around bravado, squealing tires and dance-hall rhythms 
at no extra charge, it is especially gratifying that Luhrmann and 
co-screenwriter Craig Pearce have stuck to the play's original language, 
albeit trimmed and tailored to suit situations Shakespeare couldn't have 
imagined. While memorable line readings are not the rule, the unusual 
staging--for instance, putting the opening "Do you bite your thumb at us, 
sir?" Montague-Capulet face-off at a self-service gas station--is 
inventive enough to send viewers back to the text to see how they did it. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   And though "Romeo & Juliet" is an assault, it's a well-planned one, 
thought out to the smallest detail in the service of a unifying 
conception Luhrmann (who has mounted elaborate opera productions back 
home in Australia) calls "a created world." His mythical city of Verona 
Beach is unequal parts past, present and future, smartly shot by Donald 
M. McAlpine in and around Mexico City, an environment that has the 
combination of violence, passion, extremes of wealth and poverty and the 
omnipresence of religion that the production demanded. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Unsettling from the beginning, the film's opening image is a 
newscaster on a TV set, reading the play's prologue about "Two 
households, both alike in dignity" with a "Star-cross'd Lovers" logo 
behind her on the screen. The back-story of the rivalry between Ted 
Montague (Brian Dennehy) and Fulgencio Capulet (Paul Sorvino) is shown 
MTV newsreel style, with bold tabloid headlines like "YOUTHS BRAWL" 
tossed into the mix. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Tightly edited by Jill Bilcock and unwilling to be discreet in 
anything, "R&J" introduces its characters with giant letters on the 
screen, like Romeo's cross-dressing friend Mercutio (Harold Perrineau) or 
his enemy Tybalt, "Prince of Cats" (played with a fine malevolence by 
John Leguizamo). And while the Capulets tend to dress in varities of 
tailored black, the surfer-type "Montague boys" wear gaudy, loose-fitting 
Hawaiian shirts courtesy of costume designer Kym Barrett. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   No visual detail in production designer Catherine Martin's hands is 
too insignificant to be put to use in creating a world that is both 
internally consistent and out of control. Good Father Laurence (Pete 
Postlethwaite) has a huge cross tattooed on his back and some of the 
Montague boys have that name tattooed on their bald skulls. Juliet's 
suitor Paris becomes Dave Paris, on the cover of Time as "Bachelor of the 
Year," and though everyone carries automatic weapons, they all have model 
names like Sword, Rapier and Dagger, so a character can demand, "Give me 
my long sword," and not be anachronistic. There's even a delivery service 
called Post Haste. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The film's showiest scene is the costume ball at Capulet Mansion, a 
Fellini-inspired affair where Romeo and Juliet meet. We've already 
encountered them individually, and when they memorably catch sight of 
each other on opposite sides of a wall-long tropical fish tank, he in a 
knight's shining armor, she with an angel's wings, we know they're going 
to be smitten. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   DiCaprio's Romeo is a sensitive scribbling boy poet, a brooding rebel 
favored with rock star close-ups. Though DiCaprio is coming off a couple 
of ill-chosen projects ("The Basketball Diaries," "Total Eclipse"), he 
pulls himself together here and does what needs to be done. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Better still, the performance of the film, in fact, is Danes' Juliet. 
A veteran of TV's "My So-Called Life" as well as "Little Women," Danes 
goes from strength to strength here. Her Juliet has a freshness, 
directness and simplicity that is just what's called for. And she makes 
the Elizabethan language sound more natural than the latest slang. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Though his film is often too loud and refuses to forget about low 
comedy (especially in Miriam Margolyes' role as Juliet's nurse), director 
Luhrmann's film knows enough to slow down and be quiet when this dreamy 
couple, the only natural people in an artificial world, steal their 
moments alone. There's no love like young love, at least as far as the 
movies are concerned, and "Romeo & Juliet" is where it all began. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * MPAA rating: PG-13, scenes of contemporary violence and some 
sensuality. Times guidelines: an extremely intense experience.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
It's just a bit sad when a legend fades. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   So it is with "Prime Suspect," Granada Television's series of 
fictional stories about the turbulent career of Jane Tennison, a whiz of 
a senior British police detective (played marvelously by Helen Mirren) 
whose rise in the London ranks has been slowed by jealous male rivals and 
her own personality, which at times is irritating and self-destructive. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As is "Prime Suspect" itself, unfortunately. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   At its best, it's been extraordinary, standing in a tiny stratosphere 
of elite television drama worthy of bronzing. Thank the Brits, for 
nothing on U.S. television has outperformed this import. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Then there's the melted-down "Prime Suspect," which describes two 
previous efforts and a chunk of the latest, "Prime Suspect 5," an 
ultimately disappointing two-parter (totaling four hours) arriving on 
"Masterpiece Theatre" Sunday. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Always a pain in the rear to somebody, the now-50ish Detective Supt. 
Tennison has been exiled to Manchester, where she finds herself heading a 
murder probe involving the drug culture and getting the usual reluctant 
support from some of her subordinates. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Some of Guy Andrews' teleplay has an arresting edge, and director Phil 
Davis keeps things interesting throughout Part 1 and the first half of 
Part 2, with Tennison blundering into another unwise affair and making 
other missteps (the kind that humanize her and increase her appeal) while 
trying to keep pace with a local crime lord who delights in taunting her. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As always, there's her own boss to contend with, and this time also a 
traitor, whose identity seems rather obvious, and certainly should be to 
someone as perceptive and susceptible to paranoia as Tennison. Yet 
inexplicably, she's in a fog. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Much worse, the concluding hour is a catastrophe that transforms 
Tennison (whose attributes have always been cerebral) into an action cop 
who single-handedly and suicidally charges after a crazed killer in a 
madcap finale that resonates formulaic plotting. The old Tennison would 
have walked out. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Steven MacKintosh works well as the story's psychopath, and Julia Lane 
and David O'Hara are persuasive as Tennison's underlings. And there is 
Mirren--the one constant throughout "Prime Suspect," since its inception 
in 1992--whose intelligence has never faltered, even when in recent years 
the writing behind her has. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Although you hate to see a female protagonist as formidable as 
Tennison check out, it may now be time for her to leave, before "Prime 
Suspect 6" turns her into Batgirl.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
The best love stories are those that bring bittersweet qualities to 
unlikely combinations of characters in unexpected settings. And "Old 
Man," a "Hallmark Hall of Fame" special on CBS Sunday, is a love story 
that, in its own way, brilliantly fits that definition. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Based on a William Faulkner short story, the tale chronicles the 
odyssey of a convict and a pregnant woman as they attempt to escape the 
raging flood waters of the Mississippi River (the "Old Man" of the 
title). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Horton Foote's superb script mixes the pair's Odyssey-like journey 
with occasional tinges of "The Defiant Ones" and "Of Mice and Men." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Like the linked characters in "The Defiant Ones"--J.J. (the convict) 
and Addie (the pregnant woman)--are initially forced by circumstance to 
stick together for their very survival. And J.J., emotionally injured by 
the circumstances of his imprisonment, is trapped, much like "Of Mice and 
Men's" Lennie, within the wounding that lies beneath his outer shell. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But the greatest blessing of the script (as well as John Kent 
Harrison's direction) is its willingness to show the story rather than 
tell it, to allow space and time for the actors to do more than speak 
their lines. The dialogue between Addie and J.J. is minimal. Yet the body 
language, the exchanges of looks, even the inarticulateness of the 
characters, serve to create a flow of intense emotional power. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   J.J., portrayed with extraordinary, understated reserve by Arliss 
Howard (who recently starred in TNT's "The Man Who Captured Eichmann"), 
is a virtual cipher at the start of the picture. In Howard's rendering, 
J.J.'s emotional reality gradually unfolds with a dignified stoicism 
entirely consistent with the character. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Jeanne Tripplehorn ("Basic Instinct" and "The Firm") brings 
understanding and intelligence to her interpretation, transforming Addie 
into the perfect foil for J.J. as she slowly begins to understand the 
shielded nature of his inner reality. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The intimate cinematography of Kees van Oostrum and the atmospheric 
settings (in actual Louisiana bayous) detailed by production designer 
Patricia Norris provide a look and a feel that is more characteristic of 
a theatrical feature than a television special. And Lawrence Shragge's 
lush score--with its appropriate touches of period music--is the perfect 
soundtrack for one of the season's most engaging dramas. 
<p>

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
A person who was directly influential upon the conclusion of World 
War II and who simultaneously was instrumental in the invention of the 
century's most powerful technology might be expected to have a name that 
is familiar to every schoolchild. But it's a virtual guarantee that 
neither schoolchildren nor schoolteachers are aware of the identity of 
Alan Turing. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Yet Turing was the British mathematician who was directly responsible 
for breaking the German secret code, "Enigma," thereby making it possible 
for Allied forces' successes, and who, simultaneously, conceived and 
built a prototype for the electronic computer. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The tragedy behind Turing's anonymity is revealed in "Breaking the 
Code," a brilliantly written and acted "Masterpiece Theatre" presentation 
adapted from Hugh Whitemore's play of the same name (which was, in turn, 
based upon a book by Andrew Hodges). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Starring as Turing, the veteran English actor Sir Derek Jacobi gives a 
rich, multilayered performance that is a high point in an already 
illustrious career. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Turing's mathematical brilliance was obvious from the time he was a 
schoolboy. Equally apparent was the fact that he was gay during an era 
when English law vigorously prosecuted anyone indiscreet enough to come 
out of the closet. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But Turing's value to the war effort, and to the critical need to 
crack the German code, made him a special case. Protected from the 
highest level--Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered that he be given 
every necessary resource and that his privacy be shielded--Turing 
successfully completed his wartime work. After the war, however, and 
despite warnings that his sexual life was now under government scrutiny, 
he carelessly acknowledged one of his intimate relationships to a police 
officer. It was the beginning of the end to the career of a man who 
should be acknowledged as one of the century's great minds. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Whitemore's script is theater-like, with many slowly unfolding scenes 
in which the sterling cast of players is allowed to bring character and 
substance to their readings. Jacobi is, as always, brilliantly memorable 
in a part that seems to fit him like a second skin. Richard Johnson, as 
Dillwyn Knox, Turing's boss in the cryptography unit, adds subtle 
dimension to a character who is more complex than he seems. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Most compelling of all, the production reaches beyond Turing's 
personal tragedy to touch upon essential enigmas, not of secret codes, 
but of human interaction. At one point, Knox provides the story's ideal 
subtext in a quote from philosopher (and friend of Turing's) Ludwig 
Wittgenstein: "When all scientific questions have been completely 
answered, the problems of life will remain completely unanswered."

"All you need is a paper bag and a mushy apple." With these words, 
a cheerful, 40-ish woman with cropped blond hair, surrounded by all 
manner of craft materials, introduces adults to the joys of homemade gift 
wrap. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   No, it's not Martha Stewart, although the comparison is a natural. 
This maven of mushy apples, "chocolate clay," "gooey goo" and other arts 
and crafts is Donna Erickson, who makes her public-television debut 
Sunday in "Donna's Day," a lively, terrifically useful "creative 
parenting" series. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Erickson, a Minneapolis-based syndicated columnist and author, aims 
her activities, tips and encouragement at parents and caregivers of 
children, from toddlers to teens, to help them find togetherness in 
playful quality time. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Her homey set is colorfully chaotic: a refrigerator laden with kids' 
art and chairs, tables and shelves stacked with papers, boxes, paints, 
cloth, cooking utensils and myriad other items for craft use. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In her first show, Erickson demonstrates making gift wrap with painted 
vegetables, fruits and toy truck tires. She offers activities for 
siblings suffering from the new baby blues. Juice glasses become candle 
holders with a stained-glass look, a fish--deceased--is painted and used 
to make arty prints on T-shirts, and homemade pasta is kid-friendly. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Future shows revolve around "birthday flags" for special occasions, 
chocolate roses, puzzles made out of children's art and photos, snow 
globes, sandpaper crayon art, Swedish pancakes and, well, you get the 
idea. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Erickson interweaves parenting pep talk into the mix: Share what you 
love with your kids, remember small milestones, give yourselves credit. A 
sincere, cheerful presence--her anecdotes even sound 
spontaneous--Erickson doesn't preach or bubble with manufactured 
enthusiasm. Don't be surprised if you can't resist slapping some paint on 
sliced mushrooms or squishing green goo through your fingers even if you 
don't have kids.

If, as statistics show, a majority of the nation's teenagers are 
sexually active by age 18, and HIV infection in the United States is 
increasing most rapidly among teenagers, clearly there's a problem. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   What to do about it is where parents, educators, religious leaders, 
politicians and teens themselves differ, giving rise to a variety of 
preventive and educational efforts targeting young people. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   One such effort is the subject of a thought-provoking program tonight, 
"Sex and Other Matters of Life and Death," a profile of STAR Theatre in 
New York, which takes a performance approach to the problems of teen 
pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Part of an HIV/AIDS prevention program at Mount Sinai Hospital, STAR 
(for Sinai Teen Art Resources) Theatre, founded by health educator 
Cydelle Berlin, is a group of young actors who bring explicit dramatic 
sketches, humor and question-and-answer sessions about adolescent 
sexuality to schools and youth organizations. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Directed by Roger Weisberg, the film covers a year in the life of the 
company, from auditions, performances and audience responses to clinic 
visits, soulful retreats and members wrestling with their own sexual 
behavior issues. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The immediacy of Berlin's concern is clear: Sadly, her daughter has 
AIDS. Most vividly, the film underscores how difficult it is to deal with 
the realities of sexual issues in the face of both adult and teenage 
ignorance and denial.

<font size=+1><b>Celebrating Altman's 'Kansas City' Music </b></font>

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
Robert Altman's film "Kansas City" was not exactly a box-office 
success, despite the picture's gritty look of 1930s authenticity. But 
Altman is probably right on target when he says, "The music will outlive 
the movie." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   His "Robert Altman's Jazz '34," shot concurrently with the film for 
PBS' "Great Performances" series--and including a great deal of footage 
used in the picture--vividly confirms Altman's praise for the steaming, 
atmospheric swing sounds that bring the movie to life. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Although it is initially structured as a kind of documentary, with 
voice-over by Harry Belafonte (who starred in the theatrical "Kansas 
City" film) and occasional narration by others who recall the era, the 
heart of the program is a series of numbers performed by an all-star 
lineup of young musicians. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Among the many who perform prominently are saxophonists Joshua Redman, 
James Carter, Craig Handy and David "Fathead" Newman Jr., trumpeter 
Nicholas Payton, pianists Gerri Allen and Cyrus Chestnut, drummer Victor 
Lewis and bassists Christian McBride and Ron Carter. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It's hard to go wrong with a lineup like that, and there isn't a 
single false note in a program of tunes that includes such swing classics 
as Lester Young's "Tickle Toe," Bennie Moten's "Moten Swing" and Coleman 
Hawkins' "Queer Notions." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In the film, the players were asked to assume impressions of famous 
players--Redman as Lester Young, Handy as Coleman Hawkins--without 
necessarily attempting to simulate their styles. It works beautifully. 
What emerges is a series of performances, both improvised and structured, 
that bring a startling degree of youthful, contemporary vigor and 
imagination to the familiar swing styles of the '30s. And the 
presentation is enhanced by the authentic costuming: pinstriped suits, 
ties, fedoras, and, in Redman's case, Young's famous pork-pie hat. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The hour show is filled with musical gems--tenor saxophone encounters 
between Redman and Carter, and Redman and Handy, stylish piano from Allen 
as Mary Lou Williams, a gorgeous bass duet between McBride and Ron 
Carter. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Finally, the sound is superb and accurate. Altman insisted upon 
filming everything "live" rather than taking the more familiar route of 
having players pretend to play their instruments to an audio playback. 
The result is a sense of aliveness and participation that reaches out and 
pulls the viewer into the music. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   First-rate jazz, brilliantly played, visualized and produced.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
Critics, I confess, often apply their severest standards to the 
most ambitious and admirable undertakings, not always expressing their 
gratitude that the thing was undertaken at all. It is an ironic 
compliment to the ambition of the work, but the compliment is a 
well-disguised blessing, and one the creators would generally be willing 
to do without. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   So it is with the new television adaptation of Carson McCullers' 1946 
novel "The Member of the Wedding," which comes to USA cable at 9 tonight. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As a play, it ran 501 performances after premiering on Broadway in 
January 1950, with Ethel Waters as the housekeeper, Berenice, and Julie 
Harris as 13-year-old Frankie Addams, coming of age with pain and 
unhappiness in 1944 Georgia. Waters and Harris repeated their roles in a 
fine 1952 film directed by Fred Zinnemann. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The newest version was written and produced by David W. Rintels and 
stars Alfre Woodard and Anna Paquin, with a beguiling newcomer, Corey 
Dunn, as Frankie's 6-year-old cousin John Henry. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The production, ably directed by the veteran Fielder Cook, is in fact 
an ambitious and admirable undertaking, an uncommon gift to television 
viewers. It has been gently opened up to reflect the town and the wedding 
itself (after which Frankie insists she will join her GI brother and his 
bride on their honeymoon and in their later lives). Rintels has been 
painstakingly faithful to the spirit and text of McCullers' work. The 
author's words, heard voice-over, set the scene and conclude the story. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   And McCullers' text, half a century later, still rings with a 
universal validity in its portrait of a bright, special, motherless girl 
at the brink of adolescence--a reluctant loner, partly angry, mostly 
frightened and uncertain about her prospects, her nature, even her 
sanity. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "I've always been an 'I person,' " she says in one of McCullers' 
insightful lines (even if it seems almost too literary and insightful for 
young Frankie). Her wish beyond all others to become a "We person" may 
well resonate with a lot of adolescents (and their elders, remembering). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The "yes, buts" about the film are real enough, but they have to be 
weighed against the virtues. As in much television drama, the images have 
a carefully lit, color-drenched quality, the vividness perhaps required 
for the small screen but engendering an impression of artifice rather 
than reality. The dialogue, often near-poetical and sounding more like 
the voice of the mature writer looking back, frequently suggests the 
printed page, or indeed the stage, and makes it difficult for the actors 
not to be perceived as actors acting. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Woodard copes with the challenge with great skill. She is younger than 
Waters was in the role and it makes this Berenice less a grandmother 
figure and more a near-contemporary, with a closer comprehension of 
Frankie's emotional state. Her singing of "His Eye Is on the Sparrow" 
(which Waters chose as the title of her autobiography) makes a rather 
stagy but touching scene. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Paquin, an Oscar winner for 1993's "The Piano," catches very well 
Frankie's sudden veerings between raucous tomboy with dirty elbows and 
the woman-to-be impatient to get there. The accents of her native New 
Zealand have disappeared behind the accents of the Deep South. A little 
too deep (especially against Woodard's more softly modulated language).

In an inadvertent and fascinating juxtaposition, two documentaries 
on two networks today complement each other with two very different 
approaches to profiling the complex and risky life and times of 
teenagers. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   If you can, tape this afternoon's "ABC Afterschool Special: Miracle at 
Trapper Creek," about teenagers who fit to a T society's uneasy, negative 
stereotype of their age group and are being given a second chance to 
succeed. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Watch it after you've seen "The Class of 2000," tonight's CBS News 
special. This remarkably moving, frequently uplifting program captures 
the reality of what most teenagers are: prickly, maddening, delightful, 
rude, passionate, painfully vulnerable to hurt and danger and desperately 
in need of parental caring and guidance. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Few documentaries about teenagers have so vividly put adults in the 
shoes of "ordinary" kids as does CBS' microcosm of American adolescence, 
shot at a racially, socially diverse high school in Harford County, Md. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Profiling a variety of students as they maneuver through the mine 
field that is the ninth grade, this documentary, anchored by "This 
Morning's" Mark McEwen, reveals the pain and exuberance of being 14 years 
old. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   You might cross the street if you saw Steve coming down the street, 
blasting his heavy-metal music and sporting a half-shaved head and dyed 
black hair. But you'd miss the fact that he's sweet and articulate and a 
gentle, loving brother to his mentally disabled sister. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Handsome athlete Kris fits the image of a tough jock on the football 
field. You might not suspect how earnestly he works to overcome dyslexia, 
or how important his parents and siblings are to him, or what sustenance 
he takes from his church. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The students here--girls and boys from various backgrounds--talk about 
sex, the environment, peer pressure, loyalties to friends and their 
determination to succeed. They worry about loneliness, racism, grades and 
their parents' well-being, no matter how defiantly they wrangle with 
them. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   A brief segment that compares high school students in China with their 
American counterparts is interesting but shallow--the conclusion is that 
American youth may actually do better in the long run because they're 
allowed to be creative and independent--and it's almost an intrusion. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>

<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Fundamentally, "The Class of 2000" is a reminder that "teenager" is 
not a dirty word, and that young people want and deserve to be cared 
about and to be helped to avoid the worst hurts and temptations of 
adolescence. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   That feeling is locked home by ABC's "Miracle at Trapper Creek," about 
older youths who made all the wrong choices, or had wrong choices made 
for them. Now they are attempting to put deeply troubled lives behind 
them at a Job Corps facility in Montana. There, under strict discipline, 
young people with criminal records, histories of drug abuse, abusive 
families and other ills try to earn their high school diplomas, learn a 
trade and find some hope.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
William Styron is one of the country's most distinguished literary 
figures. His novels "Lie Down in Darkness," "The Confessions of Nat 
Turner" and "Sophie's Choice" have classic status and permanent places in 
the academic curriculum. He is rightly honored on the distinguished 
"American Masters" series tonight. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The trouble is that writers are hard to get on film. The moving finger 
writes, but not very telegenically. Performers are another matter. Like 
the recently profiled Danny Kaye, they bring a visual scrapbook of tapes, 
clips and interviews through which a producer can romp barefoot. Save for 
the occasional extrovert like Norman Mailer, writers work in unseen 
solitude. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In "William Styron: The Way of the Writer," we see Styron at his 
yellow pad (no crossings out, no caretted insertions), speaking or 
reading voice-over from his work as he strolls in a garden, pauses on a 
riverside dock, drives, walks a childhood street. Stock footage, 
including the launching of a wartime ship in his native Newport News, 
Va., carries a slight air of desperate reaching. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   There are lively interviews with his author friends Carlos Fuentes, 
Peter Matthiessen and Arthur Miller, with Meryl Streep from "Sophie's 
Choice" and with Styron's charming wife and daughters (also glimpsed as 
children in funny but un-captioned family films). Would there were more. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   A touch of controversy is provided by Harvard professor Henry Louis 
Gates Jr., who, like many black intellectuals, was less than enchanted by 
Styron's appropriation of the rebellious slave Nat Turner. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The central fact of Styron's later life was a sudden, severe and 
almost suicidal depression that fell upon him like a curse and stayed in 
place for several years. It is dealt with in the program (as it could 
hardly not be) but at a literary level, including a quote from 
Baudelaire, rather than in a more visceral account of what the ordeal was 
like and how at last it ended. (He published a book about it, "Darkness 
Visible," in 1990.) The less abstract telling might have carried a 
measure of encouragement for others who grapple with depression. The 
choice may well have been Styron's. Even as writers go, he is a private, 
guarded man. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Mary McDonnell is the unseen and almost too-quiet narrator and 
occasional reader from Styron's books. Variety Moszynski was the 
writer-director, Claire Patry the producer, with Susan Lacy, Lawrence 
Pitkethly and Frederic Bourboulon as executive producers.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
Given her tumultuous and rebellious off-screen past, Shannen 
Doherty might appear well cast as the lead vocalist of a supposedly 
alternative rock group called Dead Pink. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But neither Doherty nor her fictional band exhibits much of a rock 'n' 
roll heart in the NBC thriller "Friends 'Til the End," which airs 
tonight. Dead Pink sounds less like an edgy alternative outfit than like 
a bland, '70s era bubble gum pop concoction. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Allowing the former "Beverly Hills, 90210" teen idol and "Party of 
Five's" Jennifer Blanc to handle their own singing chores also does 
little to give the film hip credibility. Both have rather thin, colorless 
voices that subvert any suggestion that the two actresses and the 
characters they play are in any way budding vocal talents. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In "Friends 'Til the End," Doherty's Heather Romley and Blanc's Zanne 
Armstrong are bandmates and college classmates. Zanne is the manipulative 
and deranged student who plots to take over the identity of the popular 
and benevolent Heather. Whacked-out Zanne sets out to steal Heather's 
bass-playing boyfriend as well as her positions as sorority sweetheart 
and focal point of the ascending Dead Pink. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Basically, "Friends 'Til the End" is intended to be a contemporary 
rock 'n' roll remake of the 1950 film "All About Eve," which finds the 
life of an aging actress gradually being appropriated by a crafty and 
ruthless up-and-comer. But unlike the superbly written and crafted Joseph 
Mankiewicz classic, this clunky TV movie tends to inspire viewer 
skepticism rather than viewer involvement. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Too much emphasis is placed on an upcoming battle of the bands contest 
at Los Angeles' Billboard Live. The members of Dead Pink treat the 
competition as an almost once-in-a-lifetime chance for the group to 
impress record industry talent scouts. It's an unrealistic simplification 
of how new bands rise in the rock ranks. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Friends 'Til the End" would have been better suited as a kitschy 
satire a la "Heathers" (another film in which Doherty played a girl named 
Heather). Instead, this is a flat and humorless work without much of a 
brain.

Sometimes, gold mines aren't all they're cracked up to be. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Mike Judge will tell you that. He's made a mint, not to mention an 
entire career, out of two 14-year-old cartoon idiots named Beavis and 
Butt-head. But even as this animator meets his greatest success--breaking 
box-office records and getting unexpectedly good reviews for his December 
feature film debut "Beavis and Butt-head Do America"--he's eager to leave 
the two controversial Texas twits behind for a while. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "I don't know what else is left for Beavis and Butt-head," Judge says 
with a tired Texas drawl across a long-distance phone line. "I need a 
long break from it, to tell you the truth." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Not that he's sitting around idly. Fox has ordered 13 prime-time 
episodes of his new animated half-hour comedy "King of the Hill," which 
premiered Jan. 12 after "The Simpsons." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "King of the Hill" also centers on a family--this one an everyday 
brood living on the fringes of some Texas urban center, where they try to 
maintain the good ol' life of Little League, barbecues and Willie Nelson 
music amid modern society's increasing sophistication. The Hills aren't 
hicks, but they're not movin' on up either. And they're not dumb. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "It's nice to have characters that actually can comment on something, 
that actually can have motivations and figure things out," says Judge, 
after five seasons of "B&B" on MTV animating "two 14-year-old males 
trapped in a juvenile, vulgar state of mind. There's just a lot of things 
you can't do, just 'cause they're Beavis and Butt-head." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   If anything, "King of the Hill" looks like a tonic for those folks who 
either couldn't cotton to the teen pair's immature meanderings or who 
were actively offended by their disdain for adult propriety. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The Fox show centers on a hard-working heartland family man named Hank 
Hill ("I provide the people of this community with propane and propane 
accessories") who liked the world just fine the way it used to be. Hank 
gripes about such societal changes as automotive "gender confusion" where 
"this truck don't know if it's a truck or a car, it's got so many fancy 
add-ons," and he just gets more worked up than ever when a social worker 
warns him about his "anger mind-set." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Hank is a kinda common-sense conservative character," says Judge, 34. 
"He's nostalgic for simpler times in America, and he reacts to the 
irritating aspects of life in America in the '90s, and it makes him wanna 
kick somebody's [behind]." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Not to get too philosophical," adds Greg Daniels, the show's 
co-creator and a veteran "Simpsons" writer, "but I think a lot of things 
are happening in America with the difference between the haves and the 
have-nots growing greater. There's the sense that I think people on the 
coasts are spinning off into their own elite worlds and leaving a lot of 
people behind. I think there may be some resonance to Hank's point of 
view in the country." 
<p>

   The characters are distinct--from Hank's bluster (Judge does the 
voice, as he does both Beavis' and Butt-head's) to the levelheaded smarts 
of his wife, Peggy (voiced by Kathy Najimy). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   If Hank Hill seems a particularly sharp personality, maybe it's 
because, "I guess I identify with him a bit," Judge admits, especially 
"in the things we've done in the series where he gets kinda irritated 
with everyday, annoying things. I've always wanted to do something with 
that."

They're back, in all their ridiculous glory: Edina and Patsy, 
madcap heroines of "Absolutely Fabulous," a BBC comedy series that has 
found a considerable cult following here in the States. Edina and Patsy 
are frivolous, foolish and irresponsible, and there's hardly a substance 
on Earth they haven't abused--and yet, in some nutty way, we love them. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The series is the inspired creation of Jennifer Saunders, who writes 
it and stars as Edina, with the invaluable Joanna Lumley as Patsy. 
They're two working gals in London who seem never to work but spend lots 
of time shopping, drinking, stumbling and falling down. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Comes now what is billed as the series finale, a two-hour special 
called "Absolutely Fabulous: The Last Shout," in which Edina is 
momentarily distracted when her daughter Saffron (Julia Sawalha) decides 
to get married. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Last Shout" can be seen Sunday night on Comedy Central, the prankish 
cable channel. To celebrate the event, Comedy Central will precede the 
film with an all-day marathon of past "Ab-Fab" episodes starting at noon. 
If your cable system doesn't include Comedy Central in its lineup, and 
you're a fan of the show, not to worry. "Last Shout" will be available in 
home video stores as of Monday morning, right after the TV premiere. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Like its two central characters, the plots for "Ab-Fab" tend to be 
models of disorganization. The proposal of marriage from Saffron's 
boyfriend doesn't occur until more than 20 minutes in, after Edina and 
Patsy have had plenty of time, and champagne, to lavish on themselves. 
Patsy goes to sleep each night with an unlit cigarette between her lips 
so that it's right there in the morning when she wakes up. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Edina is on yet another of her quests for self-fulfillment as the 
story opens. She's floating in a tank with what she calls a dolphin but 
which looks much more like a whale. Soon her townhouse is beset with the 
usual bedlam: Her dear dotty mother (June Whitfield) brings home a couple 
of strange codgers wearing T-shirts that say things like "I don't do 
cookies" and "I'm spending my kids' inheritance." And the lunatic 
evangelist played by Mo Gaffney returns, this time in hiding from the 
Scientologists. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In the midst of the madness, Saffron is a lovely beacon of sanity, 
though it does seem odd that after all these years she is still mortified 
by her mother's wanton excesses. Edina is against the marriage until she 
realizes the boyfriend's parents are a famous and wildly wealthy couple: 
"These people are so megaconglomerate, one small withdrawal and 
Switzerland goes Third World." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Edina and Patsy also go to a French ski resort for a slapdash vacation 
that consists mainly of more drinking. Patsy endlessly rides the lift, 
but Edina actually attempts to ski. On the brink of a cliff, she has a 
near-death experience and a heavenly vision appears to her: '60s pop star 
Marianne Faithfull, looking pretty heavenly indeed. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Even people who've never seen "Absolutely Fabulous" have probably seen 
shows influenced by it. The relationship of Cybill Shepherd and her 
female pal on CBS' "Cybill" is clearly a rip-off of Edina and Patsy. Fox 
tried its own imitation earlier this season, "Lush Life," but that bomb 
was dropped after only a few airings. Saunders and Lumley still hold the 
patent. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Much of Edina and Patsy's behavior is, on the surface, deplorable or 
at least illegal. Their drugs of choice include pot and cocaine. They're 
vain, childish and rude. What, then, makes them so curiously refreshing? 
Perhaps it's that in a world of constant warnings, preachments and 
admonitions, a world overpopulated with moralizers and scolds, they do 
exactly and recklessly what they want. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   They are heedless, hedonistic and unashamed, and if they have no 
marketable skills, they do have, in Noel Coward's famous phrase, "a 
talent to amuse." The girls are back in town, and the town is better for 
it.

There is no actress in television more gifted at comedy than Tea 
Leoni. Hence the herculean effort it must have taken to neutralize her in 
NBC's version of "The Naked Truth," a comedy that spent last season (its 
first) on ABC. To say nothing of poorly served Holland Taylor, another 
skilled holdover from the ABC series that introduced a sleazy celebrity 
tabloid named the Comet. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The calamity is especially noteworthy in that "Naked Truth" has at 
least temporarily been granted the prized time period between NBC monster 
hits "Seinfeld" and "ER," ensuring it tonight the same enormous sampling 
given its predecessor, the first-season Brooke Shields comedy, "Suddenly 
Susan." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Talk about humdrum comedy and creative bankruptcy. Add "The Naked 
Truth" to the blur of sitcoms that have opened their seasons by having 
insecure office employees panic in response to management changes. In 
this case, the interloping executive is George Wendt, who has toppled 
from a "Cheers" bar stool into the more sobering role of Les Polansky, 
the Comet's new editor in chief by virtue of its purchase by his family's 
meat business. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Thus Leoni's divorced Nora Wilde gets reluctantly shifted from staff 
photographer to advice columnist, and Taylor's embittered, acid-tongued 
Camilla Dane is dumped as head of the paper and limited to being a gossip 
columnist. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It appears the Comet is going almost legit. By having Les insist that 
it print only truth, the producers are depriving the paper of the noxious 
personality that gave "The Naked Truth" its occasional bite last season. 
And only rarely is the leggy Leoni, meant to be the sun of the Comet, 
able to show off her distinctive, grandly gawky physical style amid a 
stultifying flat script that finds her making peace between Les and 
Camilla. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   A second episode--in which Tom Arnold turns the tables on Nora after 
she writes negatively about him, and two of her colleagues pretend to be 
gay to curry favor with Les--is mostly just irritating. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Leoni is too talented to be counted out after just two episodes, but 
too talented, also, to be squandered on a series that appears faceless in 
a crowd of comedies.

DATELINE: NEW YORK<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
The curious thing about this dance documentary is that no knowledge 
of dance, or any interest in it, is needed for the viewer to find it 
engrossing. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Granted, "Bill T. Jones: Still/Here" offers a behind-the-scenes look 
at the creation of a dance work (the celebrated "Still/Here" by 
choreographer-dancer Jones). But the film, which airs on PBS tonight, 
even more brilliantly shines a light on people struggling with life's 
most fundamental mystery: mortality. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "The thing that makes this film different than a show on PBS about 
health or therapy," Jones says, "is that there was an artist making this 
one, and he is asking questions about mortality in the way an artist 
would ask them. That puts an interesting spin on it." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Helping with that spin were Jones' collaborators: Bill Moyers, a 
veteran journalist who shared thoughtful exchanges with Jones that 
centered much more on life and death than on dance steps, and the film's 
executive producer, David Grubin, among whose many works are PBS 
documentaries on U.S. presidents, including "FDR," "LBJ" and the 
forthcoming "Truman." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Usually, a choreographer is going to create a dance in his mind, then 
work with his dancers to explain what he imagined," Grubin notes. "But 
this time, Bill T. Jones did a funny thing. He went out into the world 
and said to people, 'Show me how you express pain or happiness or desires 
or fears. But don't tell me just in words. Show me with a gesture.' 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Then he took those gestures to his dancers, who embroidered on those 
movements and constructed a dance out of them." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Like the finished dance, the film addresses people who are not sick, 
dispensing the accumulated wisdom of others facing death.

It won't make anyone forget Charles Kuralt, but "Coast to Coast" is 
a nice, upbeat addition to CBS and to prime time's burgeoning universe of 
newsmagazines. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Mostly detouring around large urban centers, it opens with an 
appealing segment by reporter Jennifer Laird and producer Shari Levine 
about an Idaho farmer who goes airborne in a one-seat open-cockpit plane, 
heading a formation of endangered cranes in hopes of teaching them to 
migrate with other wild cranes. The footage is swell, the story 
inspiring. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The premiere also includes a worthy triumph-over-adversity piece by 
reporter Cynthia Bowers and producer Liza Finley on a St. Louis 
psychiatrist once afflicted by the same mental illness ("I used to hear 
voices") she treats in some of her patients, and an interesting but 
flawed profile of the colorful, coarse-talking 74-year-old mayor of 
Utica, N.Y., whose autocratic style angers other city leaders. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   He jokes to reporter Bernard Goldberg about his crumbling, bankrupt 
city: "I had an awful dream last night. I dreamed that I was mayor of 
Utica." Yet the story, produced by Lee Zeidman, never explains the 
reasons for Utica's decline or exactly how the mayor plans to rejuvenate 
it beyond ridding streets of cigarette butts.

   Good things are ahead in future episodes, including reporter-producer 
David Turecamo's seven-day experiment affirming the kindness of rural 
Iowans, many going out of their way to be nice to him even though he's a 
stranger. "In every case when I asked why they helped," he says, "it was 
always something they learned from their parents." No schmaltz, just 
America on its best behavior.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
If you're already fearful about your financial future, PBS' 
"Frontline" presentation tonight, "Betting on the Market," is like a big 
dose of anti-Prozac: You're bound to feel much worse after these 60 
minutes are up. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Based partly on Joe Nocera's highly readable 1994 book "A Piece of the 
Action: How the Middle Class Joined the Money Class," the show is 
preoccupied with two ideas. First, that Americans are invested in the 
stock market like never before, mainly through mutual funds; and second, 
that this unprecedented investment may be a huge societal mistake. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   With the help of "average" investors and some of Wall Street's most 
quotable denizens--including Fidelity mutual funds' Peter Lynch, Money 
magazine's Jordan Goodman and author Peter Bernstein--the program paints 
the public's love affair with stocks as a hopelessly dysfunctional one. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   People invest, we're told, only because they have no choice, because 
in a world where job security is a memory and Social Security is probably 
a myth for many, Americans' only chance of living well is to build up a 
large nest egg. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   And because stocks have been by far the best investment over the long 
term, we are "afraid not to be in" the market, the show explains--even 
though, by many classic yardsticks, the 1990s bull market is overheated 
and overdue for a major decline that could wipe out much of our 
collective nest egg, at least temporarily. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Damned if we do and damned if we don't is the message here, and no 
solution is proposed. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As a chronicle of what brought the public into the market in such 
large numbers, there is plenty to appreciate in this program. Its 
weakness is that it is heavily tilted toward the bears' side, which is 
that the public and the mutual fund industry are fueling a gigantic 
market bubble that will, sooner rather than later, burst and maim most 
investors. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Unfortunately, the important fundamental reasons why the stock market 
has gone up so much--spectacular corporate earnings growth and continued 
low inflation and interest rates--are given short shrift. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   So too is the idea that, however long in the tooth this bull market 
may be, there is no law that dictates it must end soon. The perversely 
beautiful thing about the stock market is that it is always full of 
surprises, and it is less likely to satisfy history than to rewrite it.

England's graying BBC is said to be having its problems, but none 
is so large that the network can't still deliver a witty little gem the 
likes of Sunday's single-night "Masterpiece Theatre" offering. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Rarely is such gorgeous attention to detail lavished on so slender a 
project. Yet "A Royal Scandal" is plump with pleasure, all bewigged and 
bewonderful, its 52 minutes of sophisticated smiles purporting to be the 
"true story" of an earlier Prince and Princess of Wales even more 
ignominious than the present British cutups. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Although parallels between the two sets of royals are obvious, the 
misdeeds of Charles and Diana are almost quaint compared with the future 
King George IV (Richard E. Grant) and his earthy German wife, Caroline 
(Susan Lynch), whose 1794 arranged marriage of fiscal convenience (to 
benefit indulgent, free-spending George) is a mismatch from the start. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In this grand script by Stanley Price, at least, their tragically cold 
and distant relationship yields biting humor and commentary on the 
manners of the age, as George spends nearly the entire marriage trying to 
extricate himself from it, even as Caroline initially seeks to win 
acceptance by him and his pompous court. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Their bawdy, rambunctious conduct and intense rivalry and bitterness, 
swelling to a climactic courtroom battle, are described in a droll 
narration by Ian Richardson. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   For extravagantly perfumed and wardrobed George, it's nausea at first 
whiff when meeting the unfragrant, unglamorous woman he has reluctantly 
agreed to marry in hopes of reducing his massive debts. The wedding 
rites, with George all red-eyed and tipsy, are especially funny. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As is much of what follows, thanks also to the crafty work of Lynch 
and especially Grant (ever the superb farceur) and the ease with humor by 
director Sheree Folkson. All earn credit for this sly royal blast.

Although the title is a warning that sugary cuteness may lie ahead, 
young children can do a lot worse than to tune in Saturday to the new 
educational preschooler series, "Tots TV," a British import combining 
puppetry, live-action and animation. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Aside from intermittent stickiness, the show gets high marks for its 
gentle spirit and careful adherence to principles of early childhood 
development. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The Tots are three puppets of varying hues who live in a quaint 
cottage in the woods with their donkey (a real one) and are unseen by 
human beings. Tom, who wears glasses and is more or less the trio's 
leader, has blue hair; Tiny has green hair; and red-haired, 
Spanish-speaking Tilly has her words repeated in English by the other 
two. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Each show includes the Tots at play, their observations of an adult 
animal expert named Jane and their forays into the real world--to see how 
things work or how they are made or to view children in various 
situations. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   On the down side, the Tots, who are voiced somewhat oddly by adults, 
are given to inane giggling and cloying dialogue--not a plus for parents 
who wince at Barney for the same reasons. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But by example, the Tots and the show as a whole admirably encourage 
curiosity and imagination, civility and self-esteem.

We have come to expect a John Merrow documentary on education to 
have the salutary effect of presenting a cool-headed, generously 
even-handed look at even the hottest of controversies. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   And "In Schools We Trust," his examination of the constant 
tug-and-pull that has characterized the 150-year-long relationship 
between the public schools and the society they are meant to serve, 
fulfills that expectation--perhaps, in this case, to a fault. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It is always journalistically more challenging to take the long view. 
It's easier to pit one party to a controversy against the other or to 
take sides than it is to try to hold the interest of viewers--or 
readers--with a dispassionate history lesson. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   So it is admirable that Merrow has tackled that task in this case. 
Airing tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28, "In Schools We Trust" reminds us 
that the schools always have been expected to serve larger social 
agendas--in addition to teaching children to read, write and compute. 
Furthermore, the criticism of public education heard today echoes the 
concerns of the past that schools were not up to the task. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Assisted by such astute educational historians as Diane Ravitch, a 
professor at New York University, and David Tyack of Stanford University, 
Merrow recalls that, at the turn of the century, schools were given the 
job of "Americanizing" immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe. 
Later, post-Sputnik, they were to help close the apparent technological 
gap between the United States and Russia. And, since the early 1980s, 
they've been expected to turn out students who would ensure the nation's 
economic competitiveness. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Today, the menu of strategies for carrying out that goal is a long 
one--and Merrow quickly summarizes several: national standards, publicly 
funded vouchers, new ways of assessing student progress. But, consistent 
with the documentary's historical perspective, he resists the impulse to 
say which of these seem most promising. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Although it is what allows Merrow to show us how current debates fit 
into the historical context, that neutrality will no doubt leave some 
viewers feeling unsatisfied.

The dying words of Kurtz, the pivotal character of Joseph Conrad's 
novella "Heart of Darkness," summarize a thoroughly bungled, unwieldy, 
interminable six-hour TV rendition of his cosmic longer work, "Nostromo": 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "The horror! The horror!" 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The darkness turns out to be "Nostromo." An ambitious colossus filmed 
in Cartegena, Colombia, over six months, it opens the winter season of 
"Masterpiece Theatre" on PBS. Partners in this production are England's 
BBC and Boston's WGBH-TV in association with RAI of Italy and TVE of 
Spain, a collaboration about as seamless, it appears from the result, as 
the United Nations. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Although published in 1904, "Nostromo" is remarkably durable as a 
commentary on economic imperialism and the emptiness and corruption of 
politics and politicians on all levels; Conrad's message about 
exploitation of the weak by the powerful still resonates across the 
generations. Faces may change but much harder to alter is the basic 
fabric of societies whose lower classes historically march to the tune of 
high finance and the privileged elite. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Conrad's metaphor is Constaguana, a fictional South American republic 
where even the virtuous are ultimately corrupted by greed, and whose 
major economic asset is a silver mine owned by a British family that's 
being reopened after a decade of closure following a bloody worker 
rebellion. That opening episode of violent defiance, a sharp jolt that 
shatters a deceptively languid, sweltering calm at the mine, just may be 
the production's best sequence, raising hopes that evaporate in the 
coming hours. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Thereafter, the narrative fibrillates, gasping, gurgling and never 
quite catching its breath, while following the misfortunes of 
Constanguaneros largely through newly arrived mine owner Charles Gould 
(Colin Firth) and a magnetic Italian emigre (Claudio Amendola), who heads 
the local dockworkers and whose nickname, Nostromo, means "our man." 
Gould, the silver miner, is not a bad sort, but his trickle-down 
benevolence is conditional, just as Nostromo's almost mythic heroism 
turns out to be not everlasting. Meanwhile, Gould's wife, Emilia (Serena 
Scott Thomas), is a suffering idealist, and a lump of a local physician 
named Monygham (Albert Finney) is hopelessly debauched and drunken. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The "Nostromo" crowd is much larger than this, however. And, director 
Alastair Reid is unable to give cohesion to the story's thicket of 
players, nor sort out the causes they and their numerous factions 
represent, nor improve Conrad's unsatisfying ending. It's doubtful that 
anyone who has not read "Nostromo" will know from John Hale's porous, 
disjointed screenplay what is happening at any given point. There is a 
civil war, but no clear vision of who is fighting whom or where or for 
what. There are random generals and a fortress, a new president said to 
be coming through the mountains but never getting through. Characters 
appear, then inexplicably vanish for long sections of the story. It's a 
melting pot that just keeps melting, an odyssey so swollen and slow that 
the last of its three segments is in danger of being lapped by the 
previous century. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Only Thomas is at all persuasive; Amendola, especially, is such a hunk 
of stone that Nostromo's reputation for charisma appears to have no 
basis. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The scenery is exotic and the music arresting. You'd trade both, 
though, for clarity.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
You've got to respect a TV movie that allows its Native American 
characters to speak in their own language while requiring viewers to read 
subtitles. Like a small-screen version of "Dances With Wolves," CBS' 
"Keeping the Promise" (which airs Sunday at 9 p.m.) is careful to respect 
and honor the American Indian culture it portrays. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But that's not to say that this 18th century frontier drama even 
remotely approaches Kevin Costner's Oscar-winning film in overall 
quality. Though well-intentioned, "Keeping the Promise" is nevertheless a 
stiffly executed work that lacks commanding verve or style. In other 
words, it's imbued with the same, flat visual and character definition 
that signifies so many made-for-TV films. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It doesn't help that some of the early colonial settlers here tend to 
speak in a formal manner that comes across as excessively wooden. Keith 
Carradine is particularly ill-suited to his role as the adventurous 
family man, Will Hallowell. He simply doesn't convey his character's 
tough stoicism effectively. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Keeping the Promise" does contain a plot that's moderately involving, 
if unimaginatively laid out. The film basically begins with Will and his 
13-year-old son Matt traveling from a small town in Massachusetts to 
uncharted Maine, where Will has purchased land. Matt (Brendan Fletcher) 
is subsequently forced to protect the family's new property and freshly 
built cabin by himself so that his father can return home to retrieve his 
mother and two younger siblings. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Almost immediately, matters go awry for the Hallowell family. Back in 
Massachusetts, infant James and mother Anne (Annette O'Toole) contract 
typhoid fever. Meanwhile, Matt falls into a river while pursuing an 
unscrupulous trapper who has stolen his father's prized rifle. The 
unconscious boy is pulled from the water by an American Indian elder who 
then nurses him back to health. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Matt's dealings with the Penobscot tribe is the most engaging element 
of "Keeping the Promise." The local Native Americans teach him invaluable 
survival skills; in exchange, the blond boy helps the youngster Attean 
(William Lightning) learn how to read English. The Penobscot people 
realize that, for their own benefit, they must learn how to decipher the 
white man's written treaties and land grants. It's unfortunate that the 
evolving relationship between Matt and Attean is so awkwardly and 
obviously executed. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Keeping the Promise" has a number of compassionate and educational 
things to say about the difficult but proud lives of both the Native 
Americans and the European settlers of the 1700s. These points just 
needed to be made within a more creative and compelling dramatic context.

USA Network, cable's home to sitcom veterans "Duckman" and "Weird 
Science," introduces two new comedies this weekend that are neither ducky 
nor scientific. Unfortunately, they are merely dim and dumb. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The first is "Lost on Earth," a mirthless half-hour starring Tim 
Conlon, a star of Fox's short-lived "Wild Oats." Conlon plays David Rudy, 
an Albuquerque TV reporter whose on-air gaffe with a chimpanzee (don't 
ask) results in a demotion leveled by his stern, ratings-conscious boss 
(Paul Gleason). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   David, who is sleeping with the boss' daughter (Stacy Galina), avoids 
dismissal by agreeing to anchor a show featuring a gaggle of grotesque 
puppets. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   While bemoaning his fate, the sarcastic David discovers these garish 
pieces of foam are actually aliens who were stranded here while exploring 
the universe. And how does he know that? Why, they can talk, of course. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   More's the pity since little that comes out of their mouths is either 
clever or funny. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Too silly for adults and too coarse for kids, "Earth" is a lost cause. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Equally unrewarding is "Claude's Crib," an interracial "Friends" about 
a hip-hop landlord balancing the demands of his twentysomething boarders 
and hectic personal life. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Claude Brooks is the African American star, creator and co-producer of 
this clunky comedy set in a two-story house that was inherited from his 
character's deceased grandmother. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   One of the tenants is a hapless white guy (Matt Champagne) who never 
dates. Another is a slothful Asian (James Wong) who likes to eat, watch 
TV and roller-blade while waiting for rent checks from the Far East. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In the opener, two women--a naive Midwesterner (Jennifer Aspen) and a 
headstrong aerobics instructor (Tembi Locke)--contend with Claude's 
sexist attitude while applying for a room. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Those who relish smart, sophisticated dialogue are advised to go 
elsewhere. At one point, for example, the Asian Des tells Claude, "If I 
wanted a job, I'd still be in Taiwan making clothes for Kathie Lee 
Gifford." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   And if I wanted a snooze, I'd still be watching this show.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
The much-anticipated Metropolitan Opera debut of Cecilia Bartoli 
arrives on PBS tonight, and it's a treat. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Her vehicle is Mozart's "Cosi Fan Tutte," her role, the maid Despina, 
is usually considered (and treated) as a secondary character, but is here 
elevated to (at least) equal importance with the other principals. The 
Roman mezzo-soprano even gets a cute star entrance, towing a huge set on 
stage single-handedly, grinning and singing the line, "It's wretched to 
be a maid." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   That Despina's prominence in this production is partially accomplished 
by exaggeration--and even distortion of the letter of the opera--will 
bother few. In the broadcast (taped last February), this is most readily 
seen in the camera work, which appears bent on recording every reaction 
on Despina's face even when she's on the sidelines. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   And at the show's end, when the five principals are singing their 
paean to reason, we are squarely focused on a non-singing Despina, first 
fear and then shock on her face over being duped. She really isn't that 
important here. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Still, it's impossible to resist the exuberance that Bartoli brings to 
the undertaking, and she sings to perky perfection. Her comic turns--as 
the mesmerizing doctor (donning a big nose, Coke-bottle glasses and a 
fright wig to go with a nasal twang) and the notary (done with an 
American accent)--are full of youthful verve. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The rest of the cast sparkles too. Carol Vaness, a formidable Tosca at 
L.A. Opera last month, practically steals the show with her strongly felt 
and nuanced Fiordiligi (her "Come scoglio") is especially virtuosic and 
heroic). Thomas Allen smirks beautifully as the duplicitous Don Alfonso. 
Susanne Mentzer, Jerry Hadley and Dwayne Croft bring fluency, flair and 
sensitivity to their roles. Notable as well are the tightness and 
unselfishness of the cast's ensemble singing, alive to rhythm, blend and 
meaning. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Presiding in the pit, James Levine seems to relish every subtle detail 
of Mozart's rich orchestration (caught nicely by the miking), the Met 
Orchestra responding with luxuriously polished yet vital playing. Levine 
rightly favors a virtually complete "Cosi" --the broadcast lasts well 
over three hours. So have a cup of coffee, because it's worth the long 
haul.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
"A Celebration of America's Music" arrives bearing a label that is 
both misleading and ironic: the first network jazz special in 25 years. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   CBS, for one, ran a jazz special in the mid-'70s, "The Cool and 
Groovy, Hot and Heavy, All Star Jazz Show," that was loaded with major 
jazz talent. The real problem with "A Celebration of America's Music," 
however, relates not so much to its questionable assertion of rarity as 
it does to the way in which it has been produced. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Typically, the show is front-loaded with artists and celebrities whose 
association with jazz is minimal. Bill Cosby, who both understands and 
loves the music, was a perfect choice to emcee the program. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But what connection do Jon Secada, Sinbad and k.d. lang have with 
jazz? Not much. Yet there they are: Secada singing with Tito Puente, 
Sinbad doing a comedy routine, and lang singing "Black Coffee" 
(presumably considered a jazz classic by the producers). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Which is not to say that the show is lacking ample jazz talent. It is, 
in fact, loaded. But virtually every potentially rewarding performance is 
either saddled with oppressive production or squeezed into painfully 
truncated time segments. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   A promising opening featuring tenor saxophonist Joshua Redman playing 
"Caravan" is blown away by a group of utterly superfluous dancers doing a 
routine that should never have made it past the rehearsal studio. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The dancers are missing from Wynton Marsalis' bright salute to Louis 
Armstrong--one of the show's better numbers. But an appearance by the 
"Tribute to Miles Davis" group, with Wallace Roney, trumpet; Herbie 
Hancock, piano; Ron Carter, bass; and Tony Williams, drums, is so short 
that each player barely manages to solo for a phrase or two before having 
to step aside. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Yet overly generous space is allocated to a much-deserved, but 
too-long salute to Quincy Jones, as well as to a melodramatic rendering 
of " 'Round Midnight" by singer Nnenna Freelon. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It's probably just as well that the show is titled "A Celebration of 
America's Music," without a specific mention of jazz, even though it was 
produced in association with the 10th anniversary of the Thelonious Monk 
Institute of Jazz--one of the music's most vital supporters. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But it's unfortunate that ABC couldn't allow the music to speak for 
itself, without benefit of assistance from celebrities who--regardless of 
their other talents--have no business taking up valuable space in a 
program in which artists such as Hancock, Carter, Marsalis, Puente, Joe 
Williams, Pat Metheny, Marcus Roberts, Clark Terry and others are given 
far too little time to display their world-class wares.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
"Harambee" is the Swahili word for unity. It's also the title of a 
touching drama about African American cultural identity and one family's 
struggle to deal with neighborhood violence. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   This unequivocally instructional work (which airs tonight on KCET and 
KOCE) aims to teach viewers about the principles surrounding Kwanzaa, the 
African American celebration that is observed annually between Dec. 26 
and Jan. 1. "Harambee!" is divided into seven sections. Though the film 
tells one linear story, each of its segments encompasses a different 
Kwanzaa tenet whether it be Kujichagulia (self-determination) or Ujamaa 
(cooperative economics). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The drama's rather formal construction can't help but create a certain 
classroom-like ambience that some might find off-putting. But for the 
most part, writer-director Fracaswell Hyman manages to circumvent this 
problem by creating very human characters who are forced to confront the 
all too real troubles of the inner city. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Harambee!" is very much a tribute to the power of the African 
American woman. Yvonne Barnes (Brenda Pressley) is a loving mother whose 
husband's death has left her with the difficult task of raising her 
11-year-old son JoJo (Aaron Beener) and teen-age daughter Shanora (China 
Jesusita Shavers) by herself. She fights valiantly to keep her kids from 
being consumed by the destructive gang elements that stalk the streets of 
her low-income Brooklyn neighborhood. Yvonne, her endearingly spunky 
mother Queenesther (Novella Nelson) and sister Maxine (Paula Newsome) 
make up the film's trio of caring women. All seem to gain great strength 
from one another. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But "Harambee!'s" unmistakable message is that familial love isn't 
enough to solve the drug and violence problems that plague many black 
urban communities. Faced with a largely ineffective city government and 
police force, a number of the law-abiding folks in Yvonne's neighborhood 
decide to unite at the local Kwanzaa celebration. The noble ideals 
surrounding the weeklong observance--from universal brotherhood to 
collective work and responsibility--are firmly presented in the film as 
ways in which to uplift African American communities. They are messages 
well worth heeding. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Initially, it is the bright JoJo who is the most enthusiastic member 
of his family when it comes to exploring these new ideas. With the help 
of Chimbuko (the late Howard Rollins), a former drug 
addict-turned-community activist, Yvonne, Queenesther and Maxine all 
eventually become Kwanzaa supporters. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   * 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   There's an engaging sweetness at the heart of "Harambee!" In a way, 
this is very much an old-fashioned movie espousing traditional ideas 
about love, forgiveness, courage and perseverance. But director Hyman 
also has one foot firmly planted in a more complex reality. For instance, 
Shanora's delinquent boyfriend Flex is presented as a negative symbol; 
yet he's also portrayed as a product of a larger social system that's 
often weighted against people of color. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Call "Harambee!" a thought-provoking and educational drama for the 
whole family.

Prequels can be the most calculated form of television, often 
little more than artificial efforts to cash in on the success of earlier 
programming. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But "Timepiece," a holiday drama, is an exception. Based on Richard 
Paul Evans' book of the same title, it is a warm and appealing chronicle 
of the period preceding "The Christmas Box," an earlier Evans book that 
was transformed into one of 1995's best-rated seasonal films. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The tale depicts the love story of Mary--an elderly widow in the 
original "Christmas Box" picture--and David during the wartime years of 
the 1940s. Their idyllic marriage, unmarred by a difficult problem that 
Mary brings to the relationship, nonetheless is headed toward tragedy. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   David's warm friendship with Lawrence (in a typically powerful 
performance by James Earl Jones) creates deep schisms in the racially 
divided community in which they live. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   When Lawrence is placed in an untenable situation as the direct result 
of those schisms, David is forced to make a tough decision to support his 
friend, regardless of the consequences. Morally unable to make any other 
choice, he and his family become the targets of one of the town's angry 
bigots. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   What makes "Timepiece" an exceptional film, however, is not so much 
its unfolding drama as its entirely believable effort to discover 
courage, decency and resolution beyond the destructive elements of 
violence and hatred. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Kevin Kilner invests the part of David with a convincing sense of 
honor and decency. And Naomi Watts, making her American television debut, 
portrays Mary in a fashion that provides a perfect linkage to the 
character as it was rendered in "The Christmas Box" by Maureen O'Hara. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The picture is bookended, appropriately, with scenes in which Richard 
Thomas--who starred in "The Christmas Box"--makes a connection to the 
present day via an antique watch that eventually plays an important part 
in the story. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Marcus Cole's direction is good enough to become utterly transparent, 
and Richard Fielder's script, despite some occasional too-quick leaps of 
time and place, convincingly tells Evans' poignant story.

He's stronger than Mike Tyson, he gets his clothes at the Big and 
Tall store and he gets bored with the same old people--that's how some 
kids see the Almighty in HBO's "How Do You Spell God?," a moving mix of 
animation and live action that emphasizes not the differences that divide 
us but the commonality that connects us. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Inspired by the book by Rabbi Marc Gellman and Msgr. Thomas Hartman, 
the uplifting special features many thoughtful young children--Muslims, 
Christians, Jews and members of other religions, plus a few 
agnostics--talking about their visions of God, life, death, heaven and 
sin. They express their faiths and puzzlements, grappling with the same 
questions and contradictions as their elders. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The difference, they agree, is that adults fight about religion; "kids 
don't." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Some of the children have cancer. They speak of a faith that keeps 
them going or they question why God lets them suffer when they have done 
nothing "bad." Their drawings and stories are featured in animation. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Interspersed throughout is "The Tale of the Watch," a cartoon 
featuring the rabbi, the monsignor and a Buddhist monk in a harmonious 
illustration of belief, as each finds a lesson of faith in a pocket 
watch.

Darkly comic, quirky and bittersweet, "Edith Ann's Christmas," 
featuring that 6-year-old observer of life created by Lily Tomlin and 
writer Jane Wagner, is a terrific animated holiday special. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Tomlin gives Edith Ann just the right blend of pathos and spunk, and 
the Bob Kurtz & Friends animation is enjoyably offbeat, but it's not for 
anyone looking for ho, ho, ho jollity. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   This smartly written half-hour finds Edith Ann suffering guilt because 
she told about her older sister's latest tattoo, and the ensuing parental 
fallout caused the defiant, spike-haired, body-pierced teenager to run 
away. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   While the family worries--when Mom and Dad go to bed, they lie awake, 
with tears sliding down their faces--Edith Ann prepares to act in her 
school's Christmas pageant. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The pageant is a fund-raiser for the town's "latest" drive-by shooting 
victims, Edith Ann's critically injured classmate and his dog Shorty, who 
has lost his back legs. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Yes, it's grim. It's also tellingly funny, as Edith Ann's teacher 
struggles with her "yo-yo" smoking habit, Dad is amazed the school board 
is allowing the kids to do a religious holiday program, the local tattoo 
parlor owners show Christmas spirit in their own nightmarish way and 
Edith Ann, between cleverly animated flights of fancy, decides to give 
the Christmas story a happy twist--there is room in the inn--and brings 
hope not only to her family, but to the whole town.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
James Woods is rapidly becoming television's contemporary version 
of Jimmy Stewart--always the perfect choice for a story about an ordinary 
man facing an extraordinary moral dilemma. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In "The Summer of Ben Tyler," an atmospheric look at a small Southern 
town in 1942, Woods is called upon to bring strength and character to the 
role of Temple Rayburn, a struggling young lawyer. And he succeeds 
superbly, with a deceptively laid-back but riveting interpretation that 
builds inexorably toward its inevitable emotional climax. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Woods' character, Rayburn, and his wife, Celia (in a warmly 
sympathetic rendering by Elizabeth McGovern), have complicated their 
lives dramatically by taking in Ben Tyler (Charles Mattocks), the 
retarded orphan son of their late African American housekeeper. It is a 
gesture of charity that stretches the limits of local acceptability in 
the still-segregated '40s to the breaking point. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Rayburn's professional prospects, nonetheless, begin to climb when he 
is asked to run for the state Senate by the town's leading citizen, 
Spencer Maitland (Len Cariou). Before the election takes place, however, 
Rayburn is asked to defend Maitland's son, Junius, who has killed an 
elderly woman in a car accident. When Rayburn discovers that the charges 
are true, he must make a choice about whether to go forward with the 
case, knowing that his decision will powerfully impact both his political 
future and his legal career. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It remains for the mentally "slow" Tyler, in his infinitely wise, 
infinitely loving way, to help put Rayburn on the right track. Mattocks, 
making his network television debut, plays the tricky role with dignity 
and conviction. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   To the credit of writer Robert Inman and director Arthur Allan 
Seidelman, Rayburn's eventual decision--as well as the consequences he 
faces--remains well within the social fabric of the story's period 
setting. But the moral issue he faces, as well as a subtext about the 
importance of family, are timeless elements in a story which, like the 
best Jimmy Stewart outings, ultimately refuses to be confined to its own 
era.

A fun-loving big man with an engaging personality, Sinbad is well 
suited to play the title role in HBO's lighthearted comedy-western "The 
Cherokee Kid," which premieres tonight. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   A little corny and essentially family-friendly is an apt way of 
describing this moderately entertaining film and its star. It's simply 
difficult not to like Sinbad, who tends to come across in this movie like 
an overgrown kid. Even when he's stumbling around the film as a terribly 
inept gunslinger-in-training, you laugh with him and not at him. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Plot-wise, "The Cherokee Kid" offers one major surprise but not many 
others. Sinbad plays a farm boy whose parents are killed by ruthless 
railroad men. Raised thereafter by a pacifist reverend and his wife, he 
nonetheless vows to exact revenge on the man responsible for shattering 
his family. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Luckily, this natural-born klutz is taught by a number of colorful 
outlaw characters. Burt Reynolds turns in a marvelous comic performance 
as the eccentric mountain man, Otter Bob. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Otherwise, the film's humor is definitely a hit-or-miss proposition. 
The relationship between the Cherokee Kid (he's one-quarter Cherokee) and 
his theatrical sidekick Juan Nepomuceno Cortina (A Martinez) would seem 
to offer plum comedic opportunities. But the jokes and gags involving 
these two key characters tend to fall flat. A group of potentially 
outrageous renegade nuns is also underutilized. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "The Cherokee Kid" basically allows the genial Sinbad to play a 
variation of himself. To his fans, that in itself may be enough to make 
this movie a worthwhile experience.

"Loosely Mozart: The New Innovators of Classical Music" sounds like 
the name of an undergraduate course aimed at attracting young listeners 
away from pop. In fact, it's the title of a PBS "Great Performances" 
special featuring singer-conductor Bobby McFerrin, pianists Chick Corea 
and Marcus Roberts, and a string trio consisting of Yo-Yo Ma, Mark 
O'Connor and Edgar Meyer. And it's a title obviously designed to counter 
New York City's long-running "Mostly Mozart" concert series. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   What's really significant about the label, however, is that it has 
almost nothing to do with the content of the show, which consists of a 
few remarks from McFerrin and three performances by players based in 
jazz, pop and classical. Entertaining? Yes. Innovative? Except for the 
show's final segment, there is very little that can be considered what 
McFerrin describes in the opening as innovative. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Corea plays the Mozart D minor piano concerto (No. 20, K. 466) with 
McFerrin conducting. As on their current Sony recording of the work, it 
opens with a brief vocal improvisation by McFerrin, followed by a Corea 
musical impromptu before the concerto proper actually begins. Beyond 
Corea's improvised cadenzas and McFerrin's often overly dramatic 
conducting, however, the performance is simply brisk, workmanlike and 
straightforward. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The second segment, with Ma, O'Connor and Meyer, is based upon a 
loose, flowing work by O'Connor that dips in and out of American 
traditional folk idioms. Most of it is appealing and articulate, and Ma 
and Meyer, classical musicians, play with unusually relaxed rhythmic 
freedom. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But it remains for Marcus Roberts' radical revision of George 
Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue" to finally bring the program into focus. 
Bursting with improvisation (in some cases, a bit too much), swinging 
with jaunty, New Orleans panache, the performance is not so much 
innovative as it is revealing--a take on the "Rhapsody" that brings it 
back to its root sources. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The program has been photographed with great concern for detail, with 
some especially interesting overhead shots of Corea's keyboard during the 
Mozart, and meticulous coverage of the many different soloists 
participating in the Gershwin performance.

David Bowie's reputation as a dilettante and dabbler might make 
this plunge into the now  sounds of techno look like a jump onto the 
youth bandwagon. But of all the genres the slippery artiste has 
appropriated through the years, this is one that he can claim with some 
authority. After all, he pioneered synthesizer sound-scapes on his 
late-'70s trilogy with ambient guru Brian Eno, and more recently his 
"Heroes" got the remix treatment from Manchester dance collective 808 
State.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Although hyper beats and mechanized tones dominate first impressions 
of "Earthling," the techno aspects are ultimately more a dynamic element 
than a way of life. Bowie fuses them with the direct, aggressive playing 
of his regular band. The results are sometimes forced and sometimes 
pallid, but when the frantic tempos and synthetic textures mesh with the 
current Bowie style, things can get invigorating.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Instead of reinforcing the detachment and alienation implied by the 
electronics, Bowie frequently counters those qualities with rich, 
expansive melodies. Evoking the early "Man Who Sold the World," they 
trace the contours of a troubled idealism and wary hopefulness, while the 
cryptic, sometimes purely random imagery suggests a world full of 
conflict and tension. If nothing else, "Earthling" adds some good miles 
to the distance from his '80s doldrums.

Too often, retro rock stylings serve to camouflage weak songs or a 
lack of character. Not so with Redd Kross, which has spent the better 
part of 18 years rejuvenating vintage rock elements with a distinctively 
wry joie de vivre. The Los Angeles quartet's latest is no exception; the 
Beatles-esque vocals, glam-rock swagger, Bowie-like quirks and 
proto-metallic crunch only enhance these gutsy tunes. Redd Kross plays a 
free show at Aron's Records on Tuesday at 7 p.m.

Rocketing to No. 1 both in England and on KROQ, this mysterious 
ditty is the single of the moment--though that moment may be 1985. The 
electronic pulse and altered vocals today sound quaintly anachronistic, 
yet the song is maddeningly catchy with its toe-tapping beat, indelible 
melody and teasing, gender-ambiguous lyrics.

Barbed or benign? Wise guys or sages? Pavement has done a fine job 
of muddying the waters, allowing its reputation as ironists and 
pranksters to short-circuit--or at least put a delay mechanism on--the 
apparent sincerity of its music. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   There is a mocking stratum somewhere in Stephen Malkmus' plaintive 
vocals, and a fondness for the enigmatic in the lyrics, but beyond that, 
Pavement is, pure and simple, a group of inventive and relevant writers 
and players. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The band might evoke a gallery of role models, but its musical scent 
remains purely and distinctively Pavement. The closest kindred spirit 
might be Beck: Both unreel long strings of imagery, and both concoct a 
disarming blend of charm and mystery. Pavement has more the feel of a 
rootsy rock band, though, its moments of guitar distortion and electronic 
adornment notwithstanding. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Brighten the Corners" has more focus and reach than its predecessor, 
"Wowie Zowie," and its surreal, often funny yarns explore more tellingly 
the facets of '90s malaise. The music's ultra-casual feel is deceptive: 
Melodies this rich and abundant, rock-guitar interactions this dynamic 
and a melancholy this deep and earned don't come easy, and they don't 
come from slackers.

Iconoclastic Christian, vegan and techno's first star, Moby has 
wearied of dance and rave as techno and its dance subgenres win spins on 
MTV and an outpouring of cheers in Rolling Stone. So techno's 
high-profile wizard has delivered a rock album. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   A far cry from the soaring "Everything Is Wrong"--Moby's practically 
flawless 1995 record that seemed poised to turn the music world inside 
out--"Animal Rights" is a dark, brooding album of mostly abrasive, 
industrial-punk guitars. In sync with the harsh sounds, the theme of 
betrayal rules this record. Moby gorges on brutal love and just plain not 
caring. Instrumentals such as "Dead Sun" and the soothing violin number 
"Now I Let It Go" feel like dry heat, but mostly the feelings are 
extravagant and harsh. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "You made me a life of hell / I can't live with no one else," Moby 
cries fiercely on the scorching "Someone to Love." Along the same 
emotional lines, "Heavy Flow" pulses angrily, like a red alert. The first 
single is "That's When I Reach for My Revolver," a song by the Boston 
band Mission of Burma with the standout line "The truth is not that 
comfortable." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Moby may be reaching for a new kind of truth, and it is both 
disquieting and thrilling to hear his thrashing about. But be warned: 
It's never comfortable.

The piano is the essential jazz orchestra, an instrument with 
timbral richness, percussive energy and harmonic lushness. It can scream, 
shout and stride as easily as it can whisper, imply and float. These 
three new albums reveal the remarkable range of qualities that can be 
generated by the instrument when it is in the hands of talented artists.

   Scott's recording features the piano in settings that range from 
richly rhythmic quartets to hard-driving horn ensembles. In many 
respects, it harks back to the early work of other composer-pianists such 
as Horace Silver and Andrew Hill. Scott not only is a fine, driving 
pianist but he is also a first-rate composer who has a convincing touch 
with instrumental timbres. He can write funk-driven lines such as "The 
Heretic" and immediately counter them with a gently hovering melody such 
as "What Words Will Never Say." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Equally important, he has assembled a program that is filled with 
unusual, sometimes offbeat touches. The theme from "I Love Lucy" is not 
something one expects on a jazz album, yet Scott invests it with charm 
and swing. Ornette Coleman's keening "Lonely Woman" theme is transformed 
into a propulsive swinger featuring the alto saxophone of Kenny Garrett. 
On other tracks, Branford Marsalis, reaffirming his excellence as a jazz 
saxophonist, plays a prominent role.

   Titling an album the "Art of the Trio" is risky; adding "Vol. 1" to 
the title might easily be interpreted as arrogance in a young performer 
such as Brad Mehldau. But the playing, despite Mehldau's obvious 
affection for Bill Evans, is indeed artful. Appropriately, it stresses 
intuitive interaction with bassist Larry Grenadier and drummer Jorge 
Rossy, regular accompanists for the last couple of years, but it also 
allows plenty of room for Mehldau to stretch out and display his own 
rapidly burgeoning improvisational abilities. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   His most appealing quality is his capacity to bring an almost 
vocalized lyricism to the way in which he articulates a melody; it brings 
an irresistible romanticism to his renderings of tunes such as "Blame It 
on My Youth" and "I Fall in Love Too Easily." Other standards--"I Didn't 
Know What Time It Was" and "Nobody Else but Me"--emerge in solid, 
straight-ahead rhythmic grooves. Mehldau's originals are not quite up to 
the same level, but his playing everywhere is superb. At his best, he has 
the breakout potential of his former musical associate Joshua Redman. 
<p>

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   If anyone can exploit the full orchestral capabilities of the piano, 
it's a veteran player such as George Shearing. "Favorite Things" is a 
solo album, and he uses it to present a series of tunes as classically 
styled etudes and rhapsodies. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   This is thoughtful music, occasionally leavened--in pieces such as 
Stephen Sondheim's "Anyone Can Whistle"--with the lighthearted wit that 
has always been Shearing's stock in trade. Others take different paths: 
"My Favorite Things," for example, becomes a kind of Scarlatti sonata; 
"Angel Eyes" is dark and brooding, touched with traces of Liszt, and the 
interpretation of "Taking a Chance on Love" was inspired, Shearing says, 
by the Brahms E-major Intermezzo. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   It's fun for the listener, in fact, to guess the source of Shearing's 
inspiration for each of his readings. Fascinating performances, all of 
them, they manage to walk the tightrope between classical music and jazz 
without a single misstep.

Smacking of a prepackaged dance-hall Monkees, this English group's 
music and publicity (which whittles the Spice Girls down to the fashion 
vixen, the cute innocent, the sport hotty, etc.) feel shamelessly 
one-dimensional--even if it's all in the name of fun. Peppered with some 
prefab street attitude, this is a sassy yet never smart album tailor-made 
for radio stations who miss the old Madonna.

   "Wannabe," the first single and a runaway hit, is a bubblegum hip-hop 
confection of rapping lifted off Neneh Cherry and Monie Love albums, 
canned grooves and musty beats, and a first taste of what the Girls call 
"girl power": "If you wanna be my lover, you gotta get with my friends." 
The rest is Stevie Wonder, Lisa Stansfield and Wham! rehashed as bland 
sitcom pop.

In one of the more imaginative spins on the endless and mostly 
silly lounge music revival, Rhino has given us a cross-section of the 
music you might have heard if you'd spent a few nights in Vegas showrooms 
in the '50s and '60s. There are some moments worth remembering, including 
Louis Prima & Keely Smith's good-natured "That Old Black Magic," Bobby 
Darin's snappy "Lazy River" and Eartha Kitt's always-fun "C'Est Si Bon." 
Mostly, however, the roster--from Wayne Newton and Paul Anka to Jerry 
Vale and Liberace--reminds you of the passive adult music that led to the 
rock 'n' roll revolution.

Steve Earle believed so much in the songs of the late Townes Van 
Zandt that he once vowed to stand on Bob Dylan's coffee table to tell him 
that Van Zandt was the best songwriter in the world. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Van Zandt's work includes such marvelous tunes as "Poncho & Lefty" and 
"To Live Is to Fly." But he also deserves gratitude for his role in 
convincing his colleague Guy Clark to pursue music full time. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Sadly, Clark's name is no better known among pop fans than Van 
Zandt's. But Clark, too, is regarded by his peers as one of the great 
writers of contemporary pop music. Indeed, one could imagine Van Zandt 
once wanting to get up on Dylan's table to proclaim Clark's talents. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Among the artists who have recorded Clark's songs or sung his praises 
in interviews: Johnny Cash, Emmylou Harris, Vince Gill, Lyle Lovett, 
Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson and U2's Bono. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   There is much in this collection, drawn from Clark's two albums for 
RCA in the mid-'70s, that reminds one of Van Zandt--from the mix of 
country, blues and folk strains to the strong literary sensibility of the 
lyrics. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Both men's songs frequently are filled with such character and detail 
that they seem like short stories. Clark's "Desperadoes Waiting for a 
Train," "Train 1947" and "She Ain't Goin' Nowhere" would fit nicely in a 
journal of prize-winning Texas prose. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Born in west Texas in 1941, Clark fell in love early with music, but 
his lawyer father instilled in his son the importance of a solid, secure 
job. The youngster was taught that music simply was too risky a career. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Clark worked at various "real jobs," including art director at a 
Houston TV station, before Van Zandt inspired him to focus on music. 
Clark moved to Los Angeles in the early '70s with hopes of getting a 
recording or publishing contract, but it wasn't a happy time. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The Texan found Los Angeles too big and impersonal, so he headed for 
Nashville. But the stay in L.A. inspired a song--about how good it felt 
to be leaving town: "L.A. Freeway" became a modest pop hit for Jerry Jeff 
Walker in 1973. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Though Clark's voice was too ragged for country radio, RCA executives 
were so impressed by his songs that they signed him to a recording 
contract anyway. He was in his mid-30s when his debut album, "Old No. 1," 
was released in 1975. It stands now as a mini-classic in the Texas 
songwriting tradition. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   After leaving RCA, Clark went on to record worthy albums for other 
labels, including the warmly philosophical "Boats to Build" for Elektra 
Records in 1993. But this early work represents the foundation of his 
career.

Recorded on tape in New York City between 1956 and 1959, these 
digitally remastered performances document the remarkably versatile and 
stylish Czech-born pianist Rudolf Firkusny, who died three years ago at 
age 82. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   A student in his earliest years of composer Janacek, Firkusny was an 
elegant and aristocratic musician--often called patrician--who played a 
huge repertory and kept in touch with many composer-colleagues--including 
Martinu and, less famously, Philip Glass. These three CDs (out of a 
series of six), representing the tip of the repertorial iceberg, reflect 
the middle of the road works Firkusny seemed to specialize in for three 
generations of piano followers. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Delicacy and logic characterize the pianist's fluent Chopin playing, 
which seldom reaches a high level of self-expression or heroism, yet 
thoroughly touches the composer's quiet rhetoric. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Somewhat more passion but the same sort of distancing marks Firkusny's 
playing of solos by Brahms. Best on this disc is the self-effacing yet 
poetic pianism and model chamber-music manners shown in the two sonatas 
of Opus 120. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Violist Primrose is well past his prime here, but Firkusny's 
articulate and unfaltering piano-playing never fails to sing. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   At a time when Debussy's esoteric side seems to dominate consideration 
of his compositional virtues, it is nearly startling to rediscover the 
composer's shallow works, pieces filled with cuteness and character, and 
as far aesthetically from "Pelleas et Melisande" as Debussy ever got. 
Firkusny retains his personal elegance, yet the treacle overflows.

Although originally intended as a piece of music theater, "King 
Gesar," written for narrator and chamber ensemble, is meant to evoke 
storytelling around a late-night campfire, and this recording manages 
that better than any staging might. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Gesar is a hero-king of Tibetan legend. Lieberson, an all-American 
composer with an academic musical background, has devoted his life to 
Tibetan Buddhism, and his music increasingly reflects that devotion with 
joyous immediacy. Here, it does so with colorful and powerfully dramatic 
instrumental effects and a dynamic narration rhythmically declaimed. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   There are also star turns for cellist Yo-Yo Ma and pianists Peter 
Serkin and Emanuel Ax, all of whom had such a good time that they have 
since asked Lieberson for new solo vehicles. Lieberson has that effect on 
performers--and audiences. The playing and speaking (Omar Ebrahim is the 
narrator) are irresistible. The composer conducts.

This is a splendid recording of an arcane but historically 
important and moving work. Stefano Landi (1587-1639) was among the 
composers who first experimented with drama and music, but what he came 
up with is more like a sung play than opera. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As play or opera, the story line of "Il Sant'Alessio" (Saint Alexis) 
is a corker. Alexis leaves his wife and family for the love of God, then 
returns unrecognized to his father's palace, where he lives for 17 years 
under a stairway as a religious beggar. Meanwhile, his parents and wife 
desperately search for him. It's not until after his death and 
beatification that his identity is revealed. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The only way to pull this off is with conviction, and Christie's cast 
delivers. The singers (14 soloists, plus a chorus) invest the composer's 
lines with rich expression and insight, as well as bel canto technique. 
Christie conducts with contagious zeal. Margaret Murata provides 
informative notes. Still, for the historically minded only.

Arthur Jarvinen has been a new music trooper in L.A. for years, as 
founding percussionist with the California EAR Unit, and his broad sense 
of music and humor is neatly captured on this album of his compositions, 
featuring members of the Unit and other players. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As Kyle Gann says in the liner notes, Jarvinen can be seen as a West 
Coast member of the Totalist movement, involving youngish composers with 
a taste for rock, jazz, world music and the classical. Here, Jarvinen 
shows a keen interest in rhythmic traffic of the grunge-minimalist type, 
and with exotic instruments--chromatic harmonica on "Clean Your Gun" and 
Brazilian berimbau in extended variations (maybe too extended) on "The 
Paces of Yu." The title track and "Count Your Change"--titillating 
miniatures--as well as "Murphy-Nights" rely on electric and acoustic 
instruments, and recall the swampy accidental counterpoint of Captain 
Beefheart, replete with free jazz outbursts by L.A. woodwind whirlwind 
Vinnie Golia. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Closing with the mad Scarlatti scramble of "The Queen of Spain," 
Jarvinen's Totalist grab bag leaves us enticed and pleasantly confused.

With "The Infamous" back in 1995, Mobb Deep did the 
near-impossible: They matched the mighty Wu-Tang Clan's "Enter the 36 
Chambers" rhyme for rhyme and beat for beat. That dazzling album was a 
soundtrack for a lost generation of wild kids roaming the grimy New York 
streets in search of the next cheap thrill, illegal gain or suicidal 
showdown. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Hell on Earth" is just as alluring, pessimistic and downright scary 
as its predecessor. Sure, there's plenty of ammunition for anti-rap 
crusaders. Why is there a segue before the brooding "G.O.D Pt. III" in 
which a kid shoots a rival from a window as he ambles across a courtyard? 
Isn't there more to their lives than ambushes and murder? 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Maybe not. But with Scorsese-like finesse, Mobb Deep serves up its 
underworld with such verve that even the most brutal characters glow with 
respectful purpose. The hypnotic "Get Dealt With" and the jazzy "Hell on 
Earth (Front Lines)" are only two of 14 funky reasons this album does not 
disappoint.

It was so easy to scoff. When this picture-perfect surfer-teen 
trio's debut album, "Frogstomp," hit America, the then 15-year-old singer 
Daniel Johns looked eerily like Kurt Cobain and sang like Eddie Vedder, 
and each riff (especially the hit song "Tomorrow") felt like something 
that Pearl Jam's Mike McCready and Stone Gossard concocted five years 
ago. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   So when it became a huge hit, Silverchair was widely scolded for being 
young, grunge-derivative and from Australia--a vast body of water removed 
from the Seattle sound's birthplace. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Holing up to make album two in Sydney with PiL and Gang of Four 
producer Nick Launay, the band was apparently fired up by the criticism 
and grounded by its remarkable success. "Freak Show" is a powerful and 
gloriously imperfect work of sludgy, scrappy garage metal. Punkish, 
thrash-heavy, packed with unabashed testosterone and loaded with 
self-flagellating angst, it moves nimbly from the caustic basement-rock 
of "Pop Song for Us" to the venom-as-therapy anthem "Learn to Hate," with 
its echoes of PiL. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   While Bush pushes grunge as mainstream pop music, Silverchair has 
happily burrowed down into more deviant influences such as the Velvet 
Underground and Helmet. In the process, it has found something of its 
own. Coolness factor notwithstanding, "Freak Show" suggests that these 
hard-rocking adolescents will indeed grow up.

Are our worst fears realized? After selling 4 million copies of 
1995's "Smash," the punk pride of Orange County bolts from indie label 
Epitaph for corporate pastures and includes on its follow-up album a 
power ballad that, with glossier production, could pass for Journey! 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Ixnay on that line of thought, hombres y mujeres. Neither that song 
("Gone Away") nor anything else on this richly varied and thoroughly 
smart fourth album is even close to a sellout. Rather, this is a mature, 
sometimes daring and always enticing effort by a band that consistently 
offers far more than meets the ear. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Such fist-pumpers as "The Meaning of Life" and "Cool to Hate" ride 
catchy sounds and themes with an every-one-an-anthem, kids-united posture 
worthy of Twisted Sister. But, as with the "Smash" hits "Come Out and 
Play" and "Self Esteem," within them are subtleties and wit worthy of 
"The Simpsons." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   And it's not just kids' stuff. In "Me & My Old Lady," which sounds 
like a Jane's Addiction tribute with its Perry Farrell-esque yelping and 
Islamic modalities, singer Dexter Holland casts himself in domestic bliss 
(fights included) and is scornful of anyone who views his significant 
other as a "ball and chain." But in "Gone Away," Holland and crew, 
mourning a lost loved one, truly show naked--and tuneful--emotion. Very 
un-punk . . . and thus the most punk move they could make.

Richard James is the enigmatic electronic prodigy who hit the scene 
in 1991 at age 19 only to become the most prolific and revered artist 
connected to ambient dance. His fourth album under the acidic Aphex Twin 
moniker is a lean, introspective ode to a namesake brother who died 
before his own birth in 1972. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Fascinating for students of the electronic process and at times 
endearing, "Richard D. James" is sometimes childish and cantankerous, 
with half-baked drum-and-bass and disposable, simple melodies. It is 
self-indulgent, jagged and, contrary to Brian Eno's own mantra that 
ambient music should be heard and not felt, obtrusive. You can envision 
graphic sound charging around like square pixels on a vintage Atari video 
game. At other times the album seems as if it is stuck in a digital 
holding pattern, waiting for time travel to rescue it from the pause 
button. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Abstract? Yes. But beauty seems to be a fleeting concept to James. 
Long gone are the days of '92's "Didgeridoo"--a teeth-grinding 
dance-floor scorcher and a forefather of the drum-and-bass sound--and the 
ominous machinations of '94's "Selected Ambient Works, Vol. II." With 
"Richard D. James," the life machine is beeping and bleeping, but there 
is no breath, no soul.

Not milk? No, but it's not metal either. While proving himself a 
good sport, Boone never gets his white bucks dirty on this high-concept 
project. And despite some ace big-band arrangements ("Smoke on the Water" 
and "Panama" as sambas, a shuffling "Stairway to Heaven"), he rarely 
transforms the material into swingin' standards that might transcend the 
novelty angle.

Seems like there's nothing but sad chords on the car radio these 
days, but X's 1980 lament "The Unheard Music" still carries weight in its 
revival by Elastica and Pavement's Stephen Malkmus. That track is joined 
by a serene "Odelay" outtake from Beck and other new items from Sonic 
Youth, Superchunk, Boss Hog and the Flaming Lips in an appropriately edgy 
collection for slacker specialist Richard Linklater's latest opus.

Murray is a "sesquipedalian"--someone who is characterized by his 
use of long words. What makes "Enigma" so pleasurable is that this 
rhythmic riddler places breath control--not what kind of car he drives, 
money he makes or drug he smokes--at the center of his art. He's the 
embodiment of electric poetry.

The recent election of the Bee Gees to the Rock and Roll Hall of 
Fame triggered an unusually large amount of snickering, largely from 
those who saw the Brothers Gibb and their "Saturday Night Fever" flurry 
of hits in the '70s as targets of rock's old "death to disco" crusade. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Even before then, however, the Bee Gees largely had been dismissed as 
a somewhat plastic trio that knew how to craft hit singles but had little 
of the soulful vitality of the R&B and rock strains from which the Gibbs 
drew. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Those views are shortsighted. Barry, Maurice and Robin Gibb injected 
an infectious dance floor pulse into their hits of the '70s, but the 
records had a style, individuality and grace that made them far superior 
to the standard disco fare of the period. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Indeed, the Bee Gees' best records from that era--including "Stayin' 
Alive," "Nights on Broadway" and "Tragedy"--shaped and defined the 
titillation and glamour of the mirror-ball era in pop as effectively as 
rock's greatest figures have chronicled other aspects of contemporary 
life and culture. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   And as for the soulfulness issue, this enterprising retrospective 
focuses on versions of Bee Gees songs by R&B artists, from Al Green's 
wonderfully anguished rendition of "How Do You Mend a Broken Heart" to a 
treatment of "Heartbreaker" by Dionne Warwick that is every bit as chic 
and appealing as much of her classic work with Burt Bacharach and Hal 
David. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Among the other selections: Rufus with Chaka Khan on "Jive Talkin'," 
Candi Staton's "Nights on Broadway," Percy Sledge's "I've Gotta Get a 
Message to You" and the Staple Singers' "Give a Hand, Take a Hand." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As good as some of these versions are, they aren't an acceptable 
substitute for the Bee Gees' own recordings--which may be the biggest 
tribute of all to the Gibbs' legacy. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), 
three stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

No one is going to deny that this landmark band deserves a place in 
the Hall of Fame. Few figures ever have infused rock music with such 
dynamics and commentary. From the early "I Can't Explain" to "Tommy" and 
beyond, the Who explored youthful idealism and doubts with an insight and 
power that remain commanding. This two-disc package captures the rawness 
of the group so well that you can feel the electricity in the air. It 
includes most of the still fresh "Tommy" and a nearly eight-minute 
version of "My Generation."

From the falsetto edge of Roland Gift's vocals to the rhythmic 
tension in the group's arrangements, you can hear the Bee Gees' stamp all 
over "She Drives Me Crazy," a No. 1 single in 1989 for this promising but 
short-lived British trio. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   At the time, the Cannibals seemed on the road to a major career, 
bringing together elements of rock and soul in ways that sounded 
agreeable and smart. There are some lingering highlights in this package. 
On the whole, however, the Cannibals' music sounds severely dated--both 
narrow in design and mechanical in execution. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   As such, it serves as a reminder of how much of pop music's impact is 
tied to a place and time. The best artists give us sounds and ideas that 
stick. The others simply entertain us for the moment. The Cannibals fell 
into the latter category.

If the idea of an American Noel Gallagher or perhaps a second Billy 
Corgan is enticing to you, keep an ear out for Ed Ackerson, the leader of 
a band whose wonderfully appealing indie debut in 1995, "Polara," 
exhibited the solid songwriting craft that marked the Minneapolis-based 
singer-songwriter as someone who could step up to those artists' heights. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Polara blended sweet melodies and soulful introspection so well in 
that album (on Clean Records) that powerhouse Interscope Records has 
picked up the group's contract and released this four-song EP to help 
build an audience for the new album, which is due in the spring. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Serving that purpose by breaking into the Top 10 on college and 
alternative-rock radio playlists around the country, the music filters 
'90s sensibilities with all sorts of classic rock elements--from Beatles 
and Stones to R.E.M.--in the manner of Oasis and the Smashing Pumpkins. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   From the melancholy title track (which is offered on the disc in two 
different versions) to the sassy, self-affirming "Light the Fuse and 
Run," Polara serves warning in this EP that it has the vision and command 
to be a major player.

The band's name means "food crazy," and their songs have such 
titles as "Beef Jerky" and "White Pepper Ice Cream," but Cibo Matto is no 
mere concept act. Its 1996 debut album, "Viva! La Woman," was a rangy, 
street-wise delight that seemed to take a big slice of Manhattan and put 
it on wax, like a Lower East Side counterpart to Beck's "Odelay." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   This nine-song EP again presents the idea of food as dreams, repressed 
anger and ultra-revved desire. Singer Miho Hatori and keyboardist-sampler 
Yuka Honda once more set the smorgasbord against a positively infectious 
beat. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The centerpiece is a song from the debut called "Sugar Water." Here, 
the sweet hip-hop elixir of the original is turned into a buzzing 
space-trip by Mike D. of the Beastie Boys and Russell Simins of the Jon 
Spencer Blues Explosion, then mixed into a spare, acoustic Asian blues, 
then spun into a dance-dub whirl by British deejay duo Coldcut. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But it's the new work that makes this collection tasty, if not as 
stunning as "Viva!" "BBQ" is a house-party-perfect gem, with Honda and 
Hatori rapping poetry in their trademark broken English over weird 
scratching and jangling hip-hop clanks. "Crumb" is a delicious collection 
of found sounds. Simins returns for a quirky duet version of Antonio 
Carlos Jobim's "Aguas de Marco." In all, an appealing side dish.

Blame it on his dad, his good looks or Fonovisa's promotion, but 
Enrique Iglesias has achieved mega-stardom with the old formula: corny 
love ballads, conventional arrangements and predictable lyrics. With 
"Vivir" ("To Live"), the follow-up to his hit debut, he has more of the 
same verse-chorus-verse tales of loooooove, under the production of 
cheese-master Rafael Perez-Botija and guests of the caliber of Brazilian 
percussionist Paulinho Da Costa, guitarist Michael Landau and--believe it 
or not--Billy Preston on organ. 
<p>

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The record does, however, show a slight improvement over its 
predecessor. This time, Iglesias wrote most of the songs (strong 
compositions within the poor standards of the genre), added more power 
ballads with edgy guitar solos, and tried some reggae, as in the case of 
"Lluvia cae" ("The Rain Falls"). Fonovisa has shipped 3 million copies of 
"Vivir," so it is now official--this is Enrique Iglesias' hour. Run for 
your life.

With its provocative second album, this big-hearted Silver Lake 
band reveals a penchant for fuzzy country, hummable space-pop and 
experimental noise chatter. A stately version of Bikini Kill's tomboy ode 
"Rebel Girl" is hard to ignore, but it's the demented "Southern Fried" 
and the esoteric yet radio-ready "Tin Man's Cue" that signify this fringe 
band's potential to haul many more dislocated fans into its camp.

The '60s garage-rock version of "Tainted Love" is a kick on KROQ, 
but the originals in the same vein on this Berkeley quartet's second 
album are even more charming--brisk romps (16 songs in 28 minutes) with 
the spirit of the Shadows of Knight filtered through early Buzzcocks. 
We've heard it before, but not so much lately ("That Thing You Do" aside) 
that it doesn't sound fresh.

Sometimes Bone Thugs-N-Harmony member Flesh-N-Bone comes to the 
fore with rhymes that could be characterized as urban psalms. The 
Cleveland rapper melds biblical references to the afterlife, Armageddon 
and morality to the more visual aspects of street life, making for an 
album that's filled with profound themes. Despite a somewhat pedestrian, 
funk-based production, such songs as the melodious "T.H.U.G.S," the 
gentle "World So Cruel" and the grim "Sticks and Stones" keep this album 
from being a waste of time.

The late Tupac Shakur was probably the most mercurial rap artist 
who ever lived. One minute he was rapping about the good life, the next 
about altercation; only occasionally would the true warrior poet in 
Shakur emerge, the street philosopher who explored his links to 
traditions raging from jazz scatting to the wandering ballad of the blues 
traveler. Such a blissful moment occurs toward the end of "Life Is a 
Traffic Jam," a song written specifically as a performance piece for 
Eight Mile Road, the band Tupac's character belongs to in the film. After 
a laughable performance by the horribly pretentious Thandie Newton, 
Shakur injects the track with a sense of revelation. Tupac Shakur, jazz 
poet? One listen to his incredibly agile sashay around the driving 
upright bass line could make a believer out of even hard-core rap foe C. 
Dolores Tucker.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   While none of the other three tracks featuring Shakur prove memorable, 
a few others prevent the remainder of "GRIDLOCK'd" from being completely 
mindless funk fodder. Nate Dogg's haunting "Why," J-Flex's highly 
descriptive "Lady Heroin" and Storm's "Will I Rize" manage to carry the 
film's tragicomic story line while maintaining their own worthwhile sense 
of identity.

You might not know it at the moment--what with the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic's new concert hall an ominously looming question mark and 
the San Francisco Symphony's strike--but we on the West Coast reside in 
an orchestral paradise. L.A. and San Francisco have, between them, the 
two most interesting and relevant music directors in the country, and two 
orchestras that are now playing up to the level of any orchestra 
anywhere, as these two magnificent recordings attest. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   If Tilson Thomas gets the edge, it is in part because Copland's Piano 
Concerto (with Garrick Ohlsson a compelling soloist), Orchestral 
Variations, Short Symphony and Symphonic Ode are gripping pieces from the 
'20s and '30s that have for too long been dwarfed by Copland"s more 
gracious Americana works that followed. Early Copland has long been known 
to be full of jazz and vinegar, if a little stern. But a passionate 
Tilson Thomas reveals a new level of musical expression and warmth in 
performances of unmistakable vitality. This disc is an instant American 
classic. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The L.A. program is not as newsworthy, the Bartok favorites having had 
any number of fine, even great, recordings over the years from the likes 
of Reiner, Boulez and others. Still, Salonen manages to achieve a sense 
of adventure and sheer elan that make the pieces irresistible all over 
again. The L.A. Philharmonic sounds fabulous, the recording made on a 
Hollywood sound stage allows for details in the playing to jump to life 
in a way they never can in the current acoustic of the orchestra's 
downtown digs. And the race-car tempos at the end of the Concerto for 
Orchestra will sweep you off your feet.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
Four years ago, a group of predominantly Native American 
entertainment industry professionals scraped together $50 to put on an 
awards program in a restaurant on Wilshire Boulevard. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "I looked around and saw that blacks and Latinos were honoring their 
own but native people didn't have anything like that and I thought we 
should do something," recalls filmmaker Bob Hicks, chairman of First 
Americans in the Arts, which puts on the awards. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Adds Dawn Jackson, the group's co-founder and vice chairman: "We had 
very humble beginnings. We didn't have a mailing list, we just hoped 
people would show up that day." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   About 130 people did show up, and in succeeding years the event has 
gained the support of Jane Seymour, Sinbad, Larry McMurtry and producer 
Lauren Shuler Donner. Though they lack the big-league stamp of a TV 
contract, this year's ceremonies, the fifth annual, will be held Saturday 
at the Beverly Hilton. The crowd is expected to exceed last year's total 
of 800. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   And while all involved point to the growth of the event, whose winners 
in 13 categories will receive a glass trophy etched with the symbol of an 
eagle feather, organizers complain that there is still a distinct lack of 
parts for Native American actors, particularly females. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "We searched high and low for nominees," says Arigon Starr, First 
Americans in the Arts trustee, "but we didn't find any for leading 
actress or supporting actress in film. The same goes for the [theater] 
category." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   All told, three categories contain only a single nominee, while five 
categories that existed last year had to be dropped because they lacked 
even one nominee. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "It seems that we are where blacks were at 20 years ago," says Sheila 
Tousey, who's been nominated for outstanding performance by an actress in 
a TV movie or special for her starring role in HBO's contemporary drama 
"Grand Avenue." "With First Americans, it's a sign that we are 
organizing--that there are a few of us that live here in the city and 
maybe we have a voice." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The leading nominations-getters were "Grand Avenue" and TNT's "Crazy 
Horse" with seven apiece. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Greg Sarris, who wrote and served as co-executive producer (with 
Robert Redford) of "Grand Avenue," calls the film version of his novel "a 
landmark in American Indian representation in Hollywood." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "It's the first time an Indian from the community has written a major 
Hollywood production," says Sarris, who was the sole nominee for 
outstanding achievement in writing. "If you ask anyone in Hollywood, this 
was an unusual feat for this town." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Jackson says progress is being made, however slowly, to break down 
stereotypes and create positive images of Native Americans in the arts. 
"It's always heartwarming to me, when I go out around the country to 
promote this, that people already know about us," she says. "It's giving 
many native people a lot of pride and role models and we're very happy 
about that."

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
Louisa May Alcott's rediscovered manuscript "The Long Fatal Love 
Chase" is again searching for a home, with no certainty how the chase 
will end. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   After an intense bidding war among various production companies two 
years ago, Citadel Entertainment--an outfit affiliated with pay channel 
HBO--emerged with the property, agreeing to pay a reported $350,000 for 
film and television rights. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Many assumed the story would be turned into a feature after Columbia 
Pictures' box-office success in 1994 with the latest film version of 
Alcott's "Little Women," starring Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon; 
instead, Citadel sold the project to NBC, which began developing it as a 
4-hour miniseries for this season. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   A few months ago, however, NBC quietly walked away from "Love Chase," 
and Citadel, which has produced such HBO movies as the recent Golden 
Globe winner "Rasputin" and "Citizen X," re-optioned the story and is now 
developing it as a two-hour feature film. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Economics played some part in Citadel's decision to take the project 
to television, but the producers say they ultimately determined that a 
four-hour format offered them a better opportunity to more fully adapt 
the source material. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The story, set in England, involves Rosamond, 18, who weds the dashing 
Phillip Tempest, 35, only to discover after their marriage that Phillip 
is married to another woman. Rosamond flees across Europe with Phillip in 
pursuit, seeking to thwart her efforts to find new romance. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   NBC's press materials billed "Love Chase" as a "19th century tale with 
surprisingly contemporary themes." The novel surfaced in 1994, having 
been found in a rare-book store. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Citadel chief executive David Ginsburg maintains that the producers 
had a terrific script, but NBC decided the project wouldn't appeal to 
viewers the network normally attracts with its movies. NBC has for the 
most part shied away from period pieces, instead doing contemporary 
"women in peril" thrillers, including such titles this season as "Her 
Costly Affair," "Her Hidden Truth" and the much-lampooned Tori Spelling 
vehicle "Mother, May I Sleep With Danger?" 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "It's one of those examples of a project where we did everything right 
. . . and their objectives changed," says Ginsburg, who adds that NBC 
"sees [its] market as being different than this property." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   NBC declined to comment but has released the story back to Citadel. 
Meanwhile, Cindy Meyers--whose credits include the miniseries "A Woman of 
Independent Means"--is reworking her television script as a feature. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Numerous studios and independent producers, including 20th Century Fox 
and Fine Line Pictures, pursued the story initially, and Citadel is 
hoping that appetite hasn't diminished. Alcott would be only the latest 
female novelist to experience such a posthumous revival, based on recent 
adaptations of Jane Austen's "Sense and Sensibility" and "Emma," as well 
as a new version of Charlotte Bronte's "Jane Eyre" released last year. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Although the fate of "Love Chase" remains unclear, Alcott fans have 
another "lost" work to tide them over: "Inheritance," a handwritten 
manuscript unearthed last year, has become a TV movie starring Meredith 
Baxter that CBS plans to air in April. In a small touch of irony, Baxter 
also co-starred in a "Little Women" miniseries televised in 1978--on NBC.

Beck is getting elaborate backing for his performance of "Where 
It's At" on the Grammy telecast Feb. 26. The Dust Brothers, who produced 
his "Odelay" album, are collaborating with Alan Elliott (who composes the 
music for the NBC comedy "The Naked Truth" and is in the band Earl Jones, 
recently signed by DreamWorks Records) on orchestral arrangements. But 
don't expect as dramatic a change from the original as Alanis 
Morissette's Grammy version of "You Oughta Know" was last year. . . .

With the "Star Wars" re-release capturing popular fancy, Mark 
Hamill (Luke Skywalker) is making his first-ever appearance in a rock 
video. He just filmed a guest spot, along with "Twin Peaks" co-star 
Miguel Ferrer and veteran actor Joseph Campanella, in a clip for the song 
"Sorry" by Santa Barbara band Nerf Herder--whose name actually comes from 
a throwaway line in "The Empire Strikes Back." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Hamill is close friends with Ferrer, who was brought in by longtime 
acquaintance Lonn Friend, who signed the band to Arista recently. The 
"Star Wars" star was already familiar with the band--which made its mark 
in recent months with the satirical song and video "Van Halen"--because 
his young son is a fan. The shoot, in which Hamill and Ferrer play police 
detectives, with Campanella as their dour chief, turned into an impromptu 
reunion: Hamill played Campanella's son 22 years ago in an episode of the 
TV series "Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law"--which, to bring this full 
circle, was set in Santa Barbara.

Oasis' Noel Gallagher found himself the center of a storm (again) 
in Britain after declaring that taking drugs is "like getting up and 
having a cup of tea in the morning" during a live national radio 
interview. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Predictably, the musician was roundly condemned by politicians and 
commentators--including Labour Party Member of Parliament Gerry 
Bermingham, who proposed a new law to make promoting drug-taking a 
criminal offense. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But within days, and following an elaborating statement from 
Gallagher, much of the criticism actually turned to support--similar to a 
situation that followed his comments last year about having participated 
in various criminal activities as a youth. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Gallagher's initial comments came in response to a question about a 
recent furor over U.K. pop star Brian Harvey, who had been fired from the 
band East 17 after telling an interviewer that he had once taken 12 
Ecstasy tablets in one night. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "If he's being honest, then fair enough," Gallagher said of Harvey. 
"As soon as people realize that the majority of people in this country 
take drugs, the better off we'll be." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Following an outcry, though, Gallagher two days later issued a 
statement explaining, "I've never condoned the use of drugs. I just slam 
as hypocrites those politicians who simply condemn drug abuse as a 
criminal activity and think they're doing something positive! . . . I 
urge all youngsters to educate themselves about the harmful effects of 
drug taking. I've said it before and I'll say it again, the best policy 
is don't start in the first place." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The statement spurred a remarkable turnaround in press and public 
opinion. Highly respected newspapers the London Times and the Guardian 
both voiced support for Gallagher's remarks, and the left-leaning tabloid 
the Daily Mirror--which had followed the Brian Harvey affair with a 
seven-page special feature on the evils of Ecstasy--carried a front-page 
story headlined "Why Noel's Right on Drugs."

releases, sandwiched between Live's "Secret Samhadi" (due Feb. 18) and 
U2's "Pop" (due March 4), just a couple of weeks after the Offspring's 
"Ixnay on the Hombre" and Silverchair's "Freak Show" and three weeks 
before Aerosmith's "Nine Lives." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Retailers and record executives are hoping this rush of star product 
will jump-start the stagnant business. And many won't be surprised if 
Stern is at the front of the pack. His fierce fan base alone could push 
the album to No. 1 in its first week. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Look at the way [Stern's] books sell and his talent for promotion," 
says Bob Bell, new-release buyer for the Wherehouse chain. "His fans are 
very dedicated and they'll be out there on the street date to buy it." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But the presence on the album of such acts as Marilyn Manson, LL Cool 
J (backed by members of the Red Hot Chili Peppers), Rob Zombie (with 
backing vocals by Stern), Ozzy Osbourne, Green Day and Porno for 
Pyros--the last with a track that is being termed a virtual Jane's 
Addiction reunion--could give it some staying power. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Right now, soundtracks are a hot genre, with 'Romeo & Juliet,' 
'Evita,' 'Space Jam' and 'The Preacher's Wife' all Top 10," says Gary 
Arnold, vice president of marketing for the Best Buy stores chain, who is 
also looking forward to soundtrack albums from David Lynch's "Lost 
Highway" (with Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson, Green Day and others), a 
second volume from "Romeo & Juliet" and a collection from the documentary 
"When We Were Kings" (with a new Fugees-A Tribe Called Quest track). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "So you have a hot genre, a hot personality and a hot movie, and it 
does spell success." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Still, can he--or any of these new albums--save the business? 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "I don't think it's realistic to look at any one record or groups of 
records to turn the business around," says Bell. "For that you need a 
[surprise] like Hootie or Alanis Morissette or Jewel that grows and sells 
for two years." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Stan Goman, Tower Records senior vice president of sales, believes 
that one new act could provide a breakthrough: the Spice Girls, the 
English froth-pop sensation that stormed Europe last year and is now 
taking hold in the U.S. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Every little kid between 7 and 10 knows who the Spice Girls are and 
loves them, and that's something that's been missing for a while," he 
says. "The thing that will save the record business is wholesome stuff 
like this that gets kids into buying records young."

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
The first name that must be mentioned in any discussion about 
declaring a "king of soul" should be Ray Charles, whose landmark 
recordings on Atlantic in the '50s and '60s defined the passionate, 
gospel-based singing style that stands as one of the most absorbing in 
all of contemporary pop. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Next should be Sam Cooke, who sang with sweet, angelic grace and added 
a touch of sex appeal and pop accessibility to the soul tradition without 
sacrificing its character. Though his career ambitions sometimes led him 
into anonymous, Top 40 directions, Cooke's early gospel recordings and 
"Live at the Harlem Square Club" album remain soul classics. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Then there's Otis Redding, whose "(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay" 
and "I've Been Loving You Too Long (To Stop Now)" conveyed marvelously 
the tenderness and heartache that rests at the foundation of soul music. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Finally, there's Al Green, who boldly extended the soul sensibilities 
into the '70s and '80s with a series of recordings, from "Tired of Being 
Alone" to "Belle." In those recordings and subsequent gospel works, the 
nine-time Grammy winner redefined soul music in ways that have served as 
a model for subsequent generations of vocalists. You hear echoes of his 
style in everyone from D'Angelo to Tony Toni Tone's Raphael Saadiq. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   If the "king of soul" debate were put to a vote, the critical 
consensus might well favor Charles, Cooke and Redding in that order, 
because they were the forefathers. My vote, however, goes to Green as the 
greatest of them all. Exhibit A is "Anthology," the sparkling new 
four-disc set from Capitol's the Right Stuff label. It is the essential 
Al Green collection, bringing together all the hits, from "Let's Stay 
Together" to "I'm Still in Love With You," that remain jukebox staples 
today. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   But even these 61 live and studio recordings, which showcase his '60s 
and '70s work, don't tell the entire story. Green has continued as a 
vital artist longer than any of his predecessors. Charles' recordings 
since the mid-'60s have not been nearly as innovative or compelling as 
his earlier ones, and his live shows for years have tended to be flaccid. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Cooke and Redding may have been able to maintain or extend their 
visions, but tragedies short-circuited their careers. Cooke was 33 in 
1964 when he was shot to death in a Los Angeles motel. Redding was just 
26 when he died in a 1967 plane crash near Madison, Wis. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Green's recording career began the year of Redding's death when "Back 
Up Train" went to No. 5 on the R&B charts, even though it was released by 
the tiny Hot Line Records. It was years before anyone recognized the 
point, but a torch had been passed. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Thirty years later, Green has not lost a step vocally. He remains as 
challenging and electric as ever on stage, whether in a gospel or pop 
setting. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   At the heart of his art is a singing style that is so constantly 
inventive that he seems like a magician, pulling pieces of vocal 
punctuation out of the air in ways that constantly surprise and amaze. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Like Michael Jordan driving the lane, Green can come at you in so many 
ways. In a single song, he can employ sudden bursts of falsetto or a 
teasing growl. He can move deftly from an almost conversational tone to a 
whisper. He can be teasing, seductive, playful, wry, wholly engaged or 
strangely reserved. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The Green hits on "Anthology" have been recycled endlessly on 
greatest-hits packages. What this box set reveals is the remarkable 
consistency of his larger body of work--from the relatively obscure but 
scorching "Tomorrow's Dream" to a 1971 interpretation of the Doors' 
"Light My Fire" that is so radical and assured that you'd swear he had 
written the song. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Where you can isolate creative peaks and valleys in most box sets, you 
can turn to virtually any track in this anthology and be rewarded with a 
vocal that seemingly represents Green at the top of his form. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Despite the early hit on Hot Line, Green's career didn't flourish 
until record producer Willie Mitchell brought him to Hi Records in 
Memphis two years later and put the Arkansas native together with a 
splendid rhythm section that gave him the same kind of supportive and 
inspiring musical environment that Redding enjoyed at Stax Records with 
Booker T. & the MGs. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "The biggest thing I had to do with Al was soften him up because he 
had so much Sam Cooke in him," Mitchell says in the album's liner notes. 
"He wanted to sound like Otis Redding, he wanted to sound like Sam & 
Dave. I said, 'We don't need that. You can't compare with these guys. You 
need to be smooth and sweet, you don't need to scream.' And finally I got 
him to settle down." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Green, writing most of his own material, and Mitchell would produce a 
memorable body of work, highlighted commercially by "Let's Stay 
Together," which would stay at No. 1 on the R&B charts for nine 
weeks--longer than any other single in the '70s. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   At Hi, Green sold an estimated 30 million records, but he began 
shifting in the late '70s toward gospel music and eventually turned his 
back for years on the pop world. Answering what he has described as a 
call from God, Green became pastor of the Full Gospel Tabernacle Church 
in Memphis. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Without abandoning gospel, Green has returned in recent years to 
recording pop music. He teamed with Annie Lennox in 1988 for the Top 10 
hit "Put a Little Love in Your Heart," and his 1992 duet with Lyle Lovett 
on "Funny How Time Slips Away" won a Grammy for pop collaboration. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   About resolving his conflict between gospel and pop music, Green said 
last year, "I can't put myself in one little teardrop and say this is Al 
Green. I can't cut myself off from my whole river of tears. 'Love and 
Happiness' is truly me and 'Amazing Grace' is truly me. You add them up 
and it's the total person." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   You add them up and you've got the king of soul.

For a decade or more, dance enthusiasts have been predicting a 
techno revolution, when guitar, bass and drums are finally overthrown by 
machine-made music. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   If you subscribe to that theory, then the rise of Prodigy and the 
Chemical Brothers must seem like the seventh sign of the Apocalypse. The 
mostly deejay-driven outfits have infiltrated the high-profile world of 
MTV, getting masses of airplay and paving the way for a slew of 
beat-conscious studio nerds in their wake. And rock veterans such as 
David Bowie and U2 are now co-opting ideas from the electronic dance 
world. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Though electronic music is nothing new, audiences have had problems 
connecting with the more enigmatic dance side of the genre, which often 
lacks charismatic performers. The Chemical Brothers tackled the problem 
by teaming up with Oasis' Noel Gallagher and offering a video with such 
visual overload that the deejays themselves barely need to appear. 
Prodigy smashed techno's facelessness by inducting a frontman who's so 
obnoxious that he's unforgettable. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   This month's Sound & Vision, where we rate current videos on a scale 
of 0-100, also features industrial-based Nine Inch Nails and other 
electronic artists that pull inspiration from rock, the blues, world 
music and hip-hop. Sounds more like evolution than revolution. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The Chemical Brothers, "Setting Sun." The Chemical Brothers' 
high-velocity hit is played so often on MTV that it seems as inescapable 
as Pearl Jam's "Jeremy" was a few years ago. But this video offers such 
sensory overload that no matter how many times you see it, it still looks 
fresh. Directed by the team of Dom & Nick, it simulates an out-of-body, 
hallucinatory trip springing from the head of a passed-out raver. The 
experience whisks her from the danceparty (where stolid policemen 
miraculously break-dance) above winding London streets to her flat, where 
such commonplace motions as gazing into the mirror become fascinating 
undertakings. Even as she watches TV, the seemingly incongruous scenes of 
riots and mayhemjell perfectly with the chaotic format. 93 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Nine Inch Nails, "The Perfect Drug." The song is from the soundtrack 
of David Lynch's upcoming "Lost Highway," and Trent Reznor is the central 
spooky figure in this striking video. Filled with varying shades of blues 
and grays, it offers chilling Victorian imagery, complete with skull and 
raven visuals. The only bright coloring comes when a sinister-looking 
Reznor pours some very yellow absinthe into a glass (mirroring a scene 
from Coppola's "Dracula"). The imagery is so in sync with the song's 
manic break beats and desperate, melancholy moments that it feels as if 
the song was actually created to fit the video's moods. It assures 
Reznor's spot as the master of creep-show cabaret. 90 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   U2, "Discotheque." U2's new video takes place in a chintzy dance-club 
setting, complete with a glittery disco ball, strobe lights and sleazy, 
polyester-clad swingers. You can almost smell the bad cologne. U2's 
contagious and bass-heavy dance tune thumps in the background, while the 
band itself performs in Village People get-ups. Bono looks particularly 
convincing as a hip-thrusting policeman, and the Edge is a mustachioed 
leather daddy. U2 deserves mega-respect for not only taking musical 
risks, but also for making fun of itself along the way: "Discotheque" is 
likely to be a fave on the very dance floors it's parodying. 87 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Prodigy, "Firestarter." This video, another nonstop presence on MTV, 
may not be a stunning example of visual wizardry, but the sheer impact of 
its bombastic, high-energy appeal is hard to escape. Prodigy's 
high-strung centerpiece, Keith Flint, runs maniacally through a scuzzy 
subway tunnel, his eyes bulging and his Mohawk double-finned. He spits 
the repetitive lyric "I'm the firestarter" at the camera, exposing a 
pierced tongue and exuding a generally bad attitude. His John Lydon-esque 
persona puts the finishing touch on a hard-hitting song and video that 
should appeal to both rockers and ravers. 81 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Tricky, "Christiansands." The master of the sublime groove sits across 
from his singing partner, Martina Topley Bird, in what seems to be a 
doctor's barren, stark waiting room. As the two exchange guarded glances, 
the tension between them builds, and Tricky ends up literally climbing 
the walls. It conveys an uncomfortable social moment perfectly, but also 
gets so intense that the video becomes as claustrophobic as the situation 
it's depicting. 65 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   David Bowie, "Little Wonder." Bowie's music is moving ahead 
stylistically, but this video is so overstated in its sci-fi appeal that 
it smothers the song's own booming, gut-level charm. The thin white duke 
plays to the camera, striking arty poses, while a character that looks 
like an animalistic version of Ziggy Stardust skitters around a big city 
like a nervous coyote, finding eyeballs in cups of coffee and alien baby 
heads rolling around on a subway floor. This video is too over-the-top 
even for the dramatic likes of Bowie. 50 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The Orb, "Toxygene." It takes place in an asylum, where lab-coated 
scientists perform experiments on unwilling human guinea pigs. The tests 
involve pummeling the strapped-down subjects with the Orb's bass-laden 
music, causing them to literally lose their marbles. Though humorous and 
wacky, it's ultimately too convoluted to really hit on any visual or 
visceral level. 42

After months of stasis, Long Beach Opera has resurfaced. Last 
spring, the company, which first presented opera in the Southland in 
1979, suffered a financial crisis and canceled the last two of its three 
1996 productions at the Long Beach Convention Center. Then in May, the 
opera's general director, Michael Milenski, and Cal State Long Beach 
announced that the company would become an adjunct of the university. 
Milenski was added to the faculty as a lecturer in opera, with Cal State 
providing performance space for the company. However, no further operas 
were produced in 1996. 
<p>

   For 1997, the company plans to present two operas at two theaters on 
the Cal State campus. The first is the world premiere of Stewart 
Wallace's "Hopper's Wife," scheduled for six performances at the 230-seat 
Martha B. Knoebel Dance Theatre, and two performances of Leos Janacek's 
final opera, "From the House of the Dead," at the 1,162-seat Richard and 
Karen Carpenter Performing Arts Center. Both operas will run from June 
14-22, in what Milenski calls a "festival approach" rather than a 
full-blown season of productions. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Milenski doesn't want to consider Long Beach Opera's return to the 
stage as a comeback. "We didn't [disappear] during the course of last 
season, but we did spot a trend toward indebtedness and we decided to 
take a break," he said. The connection with Cal State, he added, had been 
under discussion "for years." Because the performance space is rent free, 
he admits, the collaboration jelled at a good time. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   According to Milenski, this year's two productions will be put on with 
an estimated budget of $550,000, which is comparable to the cost of his 
previous seasons, when three productions cost "between $650,000 and 
$890,000." Support for the season comes from the same funders as before, 
according to Milenski, primarily the Public Corp. for the Arts of Long 
Beach, the county of Los Angeles, the California Arts Council, the 
National Endowment for the Arts and private donors. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   LBO is also getting a boost from its much larger downtown sibling, the 
L.A. Opera, which has agreed to include information about the 1997 
productions in its subscription mailings, which go out Feb. 18. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Peter [Hemmings, general director of L.A. Opera] has been a supporter 
of Long Beach Opera since he first arrived in L.A.," says Milenski. In 
informal talks last fall, according to L.A. Opera's marketing director 
Joan Cumming, Hemmings offered the idea of a combined mailing as a way to 
help publicize Long Beach Opera's newest incarnation. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "This means including an order form for the two operas our subscribers 
can send directly to Long Beach Opera," Cumming said. "We're happy to do 
it." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Long Beach has long had a reputation for presenting new operas and 
novel productions, and its comeback season is no exception. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The Wallace opera--a co-production with the Tisch Center at the 92nd 
Street Y in New York City, which will present it in New York next 
fall--is based on a fantasy libretto by Michael Korie that makes a couple 
out of artist Edward Hopper and Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper. Wallace 
is the composer of "Harvey Milk," which was recently premiered at Houston 
Grand Opera and presented at San Francisco Opera. "Hopper's Wife" will be 
designed by Paul Steinberg, conducted by Michael Barrett and staged by 
Long Beach Opera veteran Christopher Alden. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Janacek's "From the House of the Dead," based on Dostoevsky's novel, 
will be conducted by Neal Stulberg, who led Long Beach's last offering, 
Henze's "Elegy for Young Lovers," in March, 1996. Making his U.S. debut 
will be stage director Dimitri Gotscheff, who has worked for the Bochum 
and Dusseldorf operas in Germany. Milenski met Gotscheff in the early 
'90s, when he brought two productions to Long Beach. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   A number of ancillary events will fill out the Long Beach Opera 
festival: symposia, conferences and lectures. Milenski says that a full 
schedule of all events should be available in March.

<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
Guy Oseary's rocket ride to the upper strata of the music industry 
puts him in the very select company of executives whose successes in A&R 
(artists and repertoire) work--which involves everything from talent 
scout duties to counseling acts on their artistic choices--earned them 
dramatic career advancement. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Here are five of the most prominent. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Sean "Puffy" Combs: At just 26, Combs is a star as a performer and as 
a producer of top hip-hop and R&B acts TLC and Mary J. Blige. As head of 
the Arista-funded Bad Boy label, the home of Notorious B.I.G., Combs is 
notorious himself for his much-publicized rivalry with Suge Knight's 
Death Row company. Combs started in the early '90s as an intern for MCA's 
Uptown label, where he is credited for breaking both Blige and Jodeci. He 
also manages Blige and rapper LL Cool J, which makes him a multiple 
threat, surpassed in the current R&B market perhaps only by 
writer-artist-producer-executive Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Michael Goldstone: "Goldie," 38, a veteran of marketing and promotion 
at several companies, rose to the A&R elite at Epic Records when he 
signed Pearl Jam, which had formed from the ashes of the Seattle group 
Mother Love Bone, which he had signed while at Mercury in the late '80s. 
At Epic, his signings also included Rage Against the Machine. Late last 
year, Goldstone was snapped up by DreamWorks, which values him enough to 
have made him a partner in the much-watched venture alongside former 
Warner Bros. Records top figures Mo Ostin (one of the most respected 
executives in music business history), Lenny Waronker and Michael Ostin. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Tom Whalley: After successful stints at Warner Bros. Records and 
Capitol Records (where, as head of A&R, he signed Crowded House and 
worked closely with Bonnie Raitt, among others), Whalley was one of the 
first hirings at Interscope when the company started in 1990. He led the 
charge for Nine Inch Nails and made the deals for then-unknown 
rapper-actor Tupac Shakur, Helmet, Primus, 4 Non Blondes and the 
Wallflowers. Last year, company founders Ted Field and Jimmy Iovine named 
him president. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Mark Williams: The Georgia native, 37, was instrumental in signing 
R.E.M. at I.R.S. Records in the early '80s. Later, as an A&R executive at 
Virgin, he signed the Smashing Pumpkins. Last year, he joined forces with 
former Pumpkins manager Andy Gershon and R.E.M. producer Scott Litt to 
head the new Outpost label, funded and distributed by Geffen Records. The 
trio quickly won a bidding war for coveted Canadian singer-songwriter 
Hayden; took over responsibility for the Chicago band Veruca Salt, whose 
second album is due from Outpost next week; and recently set up a deal 
with L.A.-based techno label City of Angels, home of prized act Crystal 
Method. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Tom Zutaut: His signing of Guns N' Roses at Geffen Records set the 
standard for the second half of the '80s and, along with recruiting Enya, 
gave Zutaut, 38, tremendous career momentum. Though his highest-profile 
'90s signing at Geffen--the Stone Roses--never quite translated from 
English sensation to American hit, he remained a respected and looked-to 
figure in A&R circles and last year opened shop with his own label, the 
Enclave, financed by EMI. The company has emerged in recent months with 
promising releases from English female punk band Fluffy and American 
folk-rockers September 67.

For most of their law school careers, the students in professors 
Michael Asimow and Paul Bergman's class have studied subjects like 
constitutional and commercial law. Today, however, they're tackling 
something different--Tom Cruise and Cher. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In "Law and Popular Culture," a weekly, three-unit elective course at 
UCLA, students use film, television and literature to help examine the 
role that the law plays in popular culture and vice versa. Throughout the 
semester, students will take up topics like the criminal justice system 
and legal ethics--using the shows to foster discussion. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   UCLA Law, meet "L.A. Law." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Works to be studied include movies such as "To Kill a Mockingbird," 
"Jagged Edge," "Philadelphia," "Judgment at Nuremberg," "The Paper 
Chase," "Bonfire of the Vanities," "Primal Fear" and "Adam's Rib," TV 
shows including "Perry Mason" and "Matlock," and books such as John 
Grisham's "The Rainmaker" and Scott Turow's "One-L." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "A lot of people's attitudes toward lawyers . . . are shaped by what 
they've read, what they've seen on television, what they see in the 
movies," Bergman says. "It's interesting to look in some systematic way 
at this popular culture." Adds Asimow, "There's always been a premium 
here on innovation and trying to do things that are different." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Asimow and Bergman consider this course an "experiment." Inspired by a 
book the professors co-authored, "Reel Justice: The Courtroom Goes to the 
Movies," the two aren't sure what to expect from the class. They do know, 
though, that despite the seemingly light nature of the topic, this class 
is no joke. Not only do students have to write a 20- to 25-page term 
paper, they also must pair up into teams and teach the two-hour, 
15-person class once during the semester. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "We're taking the subject seriously," Asimow says. "We're not treating 
it as froufrou. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Mostly I've taught subjects in which I'm an expert . . . where 
there's obviously a big gulf between the students and me," Asimow adds. 
"I don't feel like I have a unique expertise here. . . . That's why after 
the first week or two we're going to have the students lead the 
discussion rather than us." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Each professor approaches the course from a different angle. Asimow 
looks at the material in more of a theoretical way: How are law and pop 
culture intertwined? How are lawyers portrayed? Bergman takes a more 
practical perspective. He asks students to put themselves in the role of 
the character. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "In most of the law classes you can kind of put your mind in a narrow 
track and say, 'OK, I'm only going to be talking about contract 
problems,' " Bergman says. "When you look at a movie, it can raise a 
number of different kinds of legal issues. It can raise ethical issues. 
It could raise personal problems for the lawyer. All of these things 
swirling in the same scenario is much more realistic to practice. . . . 
We want students to see how these problems interrelate." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   On this day the class is getting a lesson about legal life. Before 
class, students were supposed to watch "Counsellor at Law," a 1933 film 
that tells the story of, among other things, a workaholic attorney played 
by John Barrymore. In "Counsellor," Barrymore's Jewish character not only 
has troubles dealing with prejudice in the workplace, but also discovers 
that his wife has cheated on him. For more perspective on workaholism, 
the professors show back-to-back clips from "The Firm" and "Suspect." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Having just watched a scene from Cruise's "The Firm," in which the 
actor throws himself into his work, the students are now watching Cher's 
"Suspect." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "I don't have a life," says Cher's character. "I spend all my time 
with murderers and rapists. . . . I don't think I can do it anymore." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Do these characters seem real to you?" Bergman asks. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   A curly-haired woman raises her hand. "Someone did a bad makeup job. . 
. . Cher didn't look tired." Everyone laughs. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   After class, second-year law student Mark Greenstone says that the 
course offers a "nice break" from the case-intensive classes he generally 
takes. "It's much different than any other course in law school," says 
Greenstone, 27. He notes that although the class watches a lot of movies 
and they study from a book showing a bare-midriffed Geena Davis on the 
cover, there is real work involved. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Cathy Sun, 28, concurs. In preparing for co-leading the class on the 
subject of vigilante justice, the second-year law student watched eight 
hours' worth of films and devoted an entire weekend to the presentation. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   On the first day of class, the professors asked students to write down 
why they were taking the course. Never having taught "Law and Popular 
Culture" before, Asimow was especially curious as to how the students 
would respond. He received a variety of replies. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Some of them are interested in the media or hope to practice 
entertainment law," Asimow says. "Or they're interested in how lawyers 
have been shown in the media so that they can better relate to 
nonlawyers. . . . And a lot of them thought it would be fun, which is 
fine. I think people should have fun in all their classes."

Mike Connors acknowledges that it's been "kind of strange" to step 
back into private investigator Joe Mannix's well-worn shoes after 22 
years for Thursday's episode of CBS' "Diagnosis Murder." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "I'm really enjoying it," says the very fit 71-year-old actor. "Once 
they start calling you Mannix and Joe, of course, it becomes a little 
easier." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Connors played the strong and suave shamus on the CBS action series 
"Mannix" from 1967 to 1975, receiving four Emmy nominations. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   This unique episode of "Diagnosis Murder" cleverly teams Mannix with 
his old friend Dr. Mark Sloan (Dick Van Dyke) to solve a murder case that 
the detective was unable to crack on his own series 24 years ago. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Scenes from the 1973 "Mannix" episode "Little Girl Lost" are used in 
flashback sequences. Pernell Roberts, Beverly Garland and Julie Adams, 
who were guest stars on the original episode, also appear. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "It's such a good idea," the jovial Van Dyke says between takes on the 
"Diagnosis Murder" hospital set in Van Nuys. "We weave the old show in so 
well with the flashbacks." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   The program marks the first time these two TV icons have worked 
together. "I have known Mike for a long time," Van Dyke says. "We are 
really having a good time." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "We first met when we had the same tailor, Harry Cherry," adds the 
charming Connors. "He did all the clothes for 'Mannix.' " 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   This morning, Van Dyke, Connors and Barry Van Dyke, who plays Lt. 
Steve Sloan, are filming a scene in which Mannix has been brought into 
the emergency room after he was shot during his investigation of the 
murder case. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Watching the filming with great delight are supervising producers Lee 
Goldberg and William Rabkin, who came up with the idea of weaving the two 
series together over lunch one day. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "We talked about one of our favorite shows, which was 'Mannix,' and we 
couldn't believe no one had brought back the show," says Goldberg. "When 
we were kids we used to pretend we were Mannix. He drove the coolest car. 
He never got his hair mussed. I wanted to be as self-assured and as 
confident as he was." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   After coming up with the idea of combining an old "Mannix" show with 
"Diagnosis Murder," Goldberg and Rabkin, who describe themselves as "TV 
geeks," began their search for the perfect "Mannix" episode. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "I had a book called 'Television Detective Shows of the 1970s,' which 
lists every episode of every single detective show of the 1970s," 
Goldberg says. "So we started looking through eight seasons of 'Mannix' 
and making a list of episodes where the guest stars were alive, 
affordable and the story sounded interesting. We must have pulled 30 of 
them and watched them." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Little Girl Lost," Goldberg says, "had enough emotional resonance 
that it would carry over 20 years. What is great about this episode is 
that Mannix promised this little girl he would find her father's killer. 
In the episode, he actually discovers this whole mob plot, but he never 
actually nails the killer." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Goldberg then had to get up enough nerve to call his idol. "We 
couldn't write the episode until we got him on board. So essentially I 
spent an hour on the phone assuring him this wouldn't be a 'Naked Gun' 
spoof. We wouldn't be making fun of him and this would be a genuine 
continuation and it would be a real meaty part." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Though his hair is still perfect, time has caught up with Mannix after 
too many years of hard living. While in the emergency room, Dr. Sloan 
discovers Mannix has a potentially deadly heart condition. Being the 
ultimate tough guy, the private eye refuses to listen to his old friend's 
warnings. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "We knew we couldn't have him be the man he was 20 years ago," 
Goldberg says. "But we also had to be true to that man and we got a kick 
pairing him up with Dr. Sloan, who is soft-spoken and tries to get 
answers out of people being roundabout and clever, and Mannix is in your 
face." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Beverly Garland, who is reprising her role as a tough cookie named 
Stella, quips that doing this show was like "coming back from the grave!" 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "It was the best," says Garland, who first worked with Connors in the 
low-budget 1955 Roger Corman flick "Swamp Women." "It's going to be fun 
to see all of us the way we were. It's going to be an interesting show. 
It works." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   And the timing is right, too. There's been a major resurgence in the 
popularity of "Mannix" since it joined the Nick at Nite TV Land lineup 
last fall. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "I go into a town and all of a sudden, these young people say, 'We 
love the show!,' " Connors says. "I'm kind of shocked, and I have asked a 
few of them, 'Do you feel it's dated?' And they say, 'No. We love it.' " 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Though "Mannix" was criticized for being excessively violent when it 
originally aired, Connors says the series is tame by today's standards. 
"We did have car chases and fights, but when you compare them to shows 
that are on now, we were very, very low-keyed." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Connors believes the series endured eight seasons because audiences 
identified with Joe Mannix. "I think in those days all private eye and 
detective shows were very cynical and hard-boiled. They never really got 
involved in what they are doing. We made the character vulnerable. We 
made him get involved with the people he was working with. He could be 
suckered in by a soft story or a pretty face. I think people thought he 
was a very normal kind of guy doing a job. That's what I think caught 
people's fancy." These days, acting isn't Connors' top priority, though 
he definitely wouldn't rule out doing a "Mannix" movie or two for TV. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "If I went a month without working I would go crazy," Connors says of 
his younger days. "Now I really am enjoying my freedom. I work when 
something special comes along or if a friend calls me. So I work two or 
three times a year and that's fine." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
\o7    "Diagnosis Murder" airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. on CBS.; repeats of 
"Mannix" air weekdays at 11 a.m. and Mondays-Saturdays at 8 p.m. on TV 
Land cable channel.\f7

In his six decades as a force against evil, a certain high-profile 
crime fighter has survived confrontations with the Red Blot and the Gray 
Fist, the Condor and the Cobra, the Vindicator, the Voodoo Master and the 
Silent Seven. After all that, surviving The Shadow, (KABC Sunday at 9 
p.m.), the 1994 film that carries his name, shouldn't be too difficult. 
Actually, there are times when this action-adventure starring Alec 
Baldwin as the man with the all-knowing laugh seems on its way to not 
only surviving but also prospering. Set largely in a mythical, dreamlike 
New York, it has the benefit of a gorgeous production design and 
eye-catching visual effects. But if ever a film made you wince whenever 
its actors opened their mouths, "The Shadow" is it.

   True Lies (Fox Tuesday at 7:30 p.m.), James Cameron's 1994 
$100-million production, considerably ups the ante for action films with 
snazzy sequences: a horse and motorcycle chase through a hotel, Harrier 
jets hovering near skyscrapers, to name just two. It's partly a romantic 
spoof of action films in general and James Bond spy-thrillers in 
particular, with both Cameron and star Arnold Schwarzenegger pleasantly 
adept at kidding the superhuman image they've worked so hard to build up. 
Despite all this, there is a strain of crudeness and mean-spirited 
humiliation, especially toward women, that runs through the film like a 
nasty virus. Schwarzenegger plays an ace operative for a clandestine 
government agency but is believed to be a plodding computer 
salesman--even by his wife (Jamie Lee Curtis).

   Calgary, 1988: A young figure skater (Moira Kelly), her partner 
twirling her high above his head, abruptly crashes to the ice, just 45 
seconds from winning the Olympic gold. Meanwhile, a star hockey player 
(D.B Sweeney), is blindsided by an opponent, leaving him with a 
career-destroying 18-degree loss in peripheral vision in one eye. This 
speed-of-lightning prologue launches The Cutting Edge (KTLA Tuesday at 8 
p.m. and Saturday at 6 p.m.), a rousing 1992 crowd-pleaser. Two years 
have passed, and now the figure skater is hard at work preparing for 
Albertville on her huge private rink when her path crosses the hockey 
player's.

Like Water for Chocolate (Bravo Friday at 6 p.m. and 11 p.m.; 
Saturday at 2 p.m.) is writer Laura Esquivel's 1992 adaptation of her 
century-spanning period novel. Directed by husband Alfonso Arau, the film 
is a 10-course feast of magic realism: a rapt tale of a cursed 
upper-class Mexican family whose sexual repressions are exorcised in 
sumptuous banquets, while lovers wait a lifetime.

The modern Stone Age family has been dethroned by Fox's Nuclear Age 
fivesome. Tonight, "The Simpsons" will surpass "The Flintstones" as TV's 
longest-running animated prime-time series, and it was no easy task. The 
ABC series' record stood for more than 30 years. Although Matt Groening's 
dysfunctional creation has become part of contemporary pop culture, "The 
Simpsons" began modestly. Groening was an animation novice known for the 
weekly comic strip "Life in Hell" when his irreverent residents of 
Springfield were introduced in vignettes on Fox's "The Tracey Ullman 
Show" in 1987. The Simpsons graduated to their own series on Jan. 14, 
1990, and the misadventures of lazy, balding slob Homer, his high-haired 
wife, Marge, their obnoxious, crafty underachiever son Bart, smart 
daughter Lisa and baby Maggie was one of the network's first hits. "The 
Simpsons" also spawned the current renaissance of TV animation that has 
given us such shows as "Beavis and Butt-head." So we asked the creative 
minds behind a few other cartoons to take pen (or mouse) in hand and mark 
the milestone.

As a video store owner working in New England in the mid-'80s, 
Stuart Skorman spent much of his time trying to connect the right film 
with the right customer. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Rather than simply pointing them in the direction of the new release 
area, Skorman and his co-workers developed a special process that better 
matched up movie and viewer. Skorman's Empire Video Superstores soon 
became the highest-volume video retailer in the country. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Though Skorman, 48, no longer owns the video chain, portions of this 
superstore system still exist--on the World Wide Web. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   On Jan. 8, Skorman launched Reel.com (http://www.reel.com), a Web site 
that attempts to hook up Internet users with films they might enjoy. 
Reel.com is one of the newest in a long line of entertainment Web sites 
vying for attention in the densely populated cyberspace frontier. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In the Reel Genius portion of Reel.com, users rate an extensive list 
of films. In turn, the Genius suggests films it believes best mesh with 
the user's tastes. The more films a user rates, the more films Genius 
proposes. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Besides the movie-matching service, Reel.com offers 30-word film 
reviews and a movie thesaurus. Type in, for example, the 1988 comedy "A 
Fish Called Wanda," and the thesaurus suggests "The Tall Guy," "Blazing 
Saddles," "The Jerk" and "Monty Python and the Holy Grail." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Skorman believes that in order for his fledgling site to be 
successful, it must offer features that repeatedly draw users in and must 
constantly evolve to satisfy users who won't accept stasis. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "That's the thing about the Web," says Skorman, who has invested $1 
million of his own money to fund the 60-person, San Francisco-based 
operation. "It's so dynamic. It's not a book--it's a work in progress." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   At the Bellevue, Wash.-based Mr. Showbiz (http://www.mrshowbiz.com), 
site operators use the oftentimes light nature of the entertainment 
industry to fuel some of the site's most creative aspects. In addition to 
the entertainment news, reviews and interviews offered by the site, 
financially backed by Paul Allen's Starwave Corp., Mr. Showbiz's most 
unusual features lie in its games section. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   In the Plastic Surgery Lab, users can morph together the facial 
features of a handful of movie stars, talk-show hosts, the cast of 
"Seinfeld" or the cast of "Friends." The "Slice and Dice!" button lets 
the user play mad plastic scientist and discover what Goldie Hawn's eyes, 
Keanu Reeves' nose and Ellen Barkin's mouth look like on Danny DeVito's 
head. The game Romantically Linked challenges users to get from one star 
to another only through their romantic involvements. Races start at 3 
p.m. daily. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "Let's face it," says Susan Mulkahi, 40, the site's creator and 
Starwave's vice president of entertainment. "We're talking about 
entertainment, not foreign policy. It's fun." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Twenty-three staffers work for Mr. Showbiz. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Hollywood Online (http://www.hollywood.com) specializes in coverage of 
Hollywood and the motion picture industry. The site, owned by Times 
Mirror Co., offers stories regarding the entertainment world and also 
makes available a number of movie sound clips, previews, scenes and 
production notes for downloading. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   When first launched on America Online in mid-1993, Hollywood Online 
covered the entertainment industry as a whole. As time went by, however, 
its co-founder felt it wiser to concentrate exclusively on one area. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   "In order to prosper in this Wild West of the Internet you have to be 
the best," says Stuart Halperin, 33, who is also executive vice president 
of the 40-staff-member site. "We always felt that we had excelled at the 
movies and we said, 'Let's make it better.' It's a business decision to 
really focus on something and do a knockout job of it." The film industry 
also makes for an excellent subject because "movies spend the most money 
on marketing and movies also offer the most glamour." 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   Like the larger Hollywood Online, many of the smaller entertainment 
Web sites find successby creating their own entertainment niche: Drew's 
Scripts-O-Rama (http://home.cdsnet.net/~nikko11/scripts.htm) links to 
more than 500 movie and television scripts. The Internet Movie Database 
(http://us.imdb.com) offers a comprehensive list of any actor's film 
credits. Girls on Film (http://www.girlsonfilm.com) gives movie reviews 
from the female perspective. The Oracle of Bacon at Virginia 
(http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~bct7m/bacon.html) makes the Six Degrees of 
Kevin Bacon game easy by naming and computing the number of actors 
between any star and Kevin Bacon. 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   At Mr. Cranky Rates the Movies 
(http://internet-plaza.net/zone/mrcranky), bitter film critic Mr. Cranky 
savages new releases as well as old favorites. The character's movie 
rating scale ranges from at best one bomb ("Casablanca" received this 
"almost tolerable" rating) to at worst a clump of dynamite ("Showgirls" 
was lauded for being, "So god-awful that it ruptured the very fabric of 
space and time with the sheer overpowering force of its mediocrity"). 
<p>
<IMG width=15 height=1 SRC="../../art/pix-bl.gif"  ALIGN=BOTTOM>
   According to Hans Bjordahl, 27, who co-created Mr. Cranky along with 
Jason Katzman, 29, a film critic in Boulder, Colo., the site draws a 
dedicated following because of its unorthodox viewpoint and the 
opportunity for users to interact with Mr. Cranky via an on-site message
