<H2><CENTER>GEORGE H. HITCHINGS, JR. </CENTER>
</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="medicine-1988-3.gif" WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=198 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5>My forebears all came from the United Kingdom. On my father's side, they
migrated from London and County Derry in Northern Ireland to Londonderry,
New Hampshire. When the American Revolution came, they, as loyalists, moved
on to Canada. My father, grandfather and great-grandfather were born in
St. Andrews, New Brunswick. In 1865, my grandfather, Andrew Hitchings, moved
his family to Eureka, California. Andrew was a skilled craftsman in the
building of wooden ships, and my father, George Herbert Hitchings, Sr.,
followed in his footsteps, eventually becoming a marine architect and master
builder. <BR>
<BR>
On my mother's side, Scottish and English prevailed. The first American
was one Thomas Littlejohn from near Edinburgh, who came to the New World
about 1735. His descendants, including Shaws, Eldridges and Thomases, moved
about in the Maritime Provinces and New England. My maternal grandfather
and great-grandfather were descendants of the Matthews family that emigrated
twenty-four strong from near Glasgow to Prince Edward Island about 1800.
My grandfather, Peter Matthews, married Sara Elizabeth Eldridge, and my
mother, Lillian Matthews, was born in Maine. In 1875, my grandfather moved
his family across the United States. He, too, was a shipbuilder and settled
in Eureka. <BR>
<BR>
My mother and father met and were married in Eureka, and my two sisters
were born there. About 1897, Peter Matthews established a shipyard in Hoquiam,
Washington, to build lumber carriers for the E.K. Wood Lumber Company. The
company built several schooners a year. When Peter Matthews died, my father
succeeded to the management, which then became Hitchings and Joyce. Later,
my father was master builder and supervisor in Bellingham, Washington, and
Coos Bay, Oregon, and between times he engaged in marine architecture. He
worked in the period between sail and steam and was especially noted for
the design of the transition vessel, the steam schooner, which had a wooden
hull and was steam propelled.
<BR><BR>
I was born in Hoquiam in 1905. Family wanderings put me in grade school
in Berkeley and San Diego, California, as well as in Bellingham and Seattle,
Washington. I enjoyed a warm and loving home environment. A high standard
of ethics prevailed in our family, together with a thirst for knowledge
and an urge to teach. In their schooling, my mother and father were limited
to what was available in Eureka, but they were avid readers, especially
my father. It is clear to me in retrospect that he would have been a scientist
had opportunities been more easily attainable.
<BR>
My father died after a prolonged illness when I was twelve years old. The
deep impression made by this event turned my thoughts toward medicine. This
objective shaped my selection of courses in high school and expressed itself
when I was salutatorian at my class graduation. I chose the life of Pasteur
as the subject for my oration. The blending of Pasteur's basic research
and practical results remained a goal throughout my career. <BR>
<BR>
My experiences at Franklin High School in Seattle were notable for another
reason. We had a most heterogeneous population, one that blended upper class
and minorities including blacks, Filipinos, Japanese, Chinese and first
generation Catanians. As a result I lost any self-consciousness I felt in
dealing with people from different cultures and backgrounds. <BR>
<BR>
I entered the <A HREF="http://www.washington.edu">University of Washington</A> as a
premedical student in 1923.
The enthusiasm of faculty and students in the Chemistry Department was very
infectious, however, and by the end of the first year I had become a chemistry
major. I earned top grades, election to Phi Beta Kappa in my junior year,
and a degree <I>cum laude</I> in 1927. <BR>
<BR>
I stayed on to earn a master's degree in 1928 with a thesis based on work
carried out during the summer of 1927 at the Puget Sound Biological Station
at Friday Harbor, Washington. This institution later became a branch of
the Oceanographic Laboratories of the University of Washington, largely
created and directed by Thomas C. Thompson, who had been my mentor for my
master's thesis. Thompson taught analytical chemistry and was notable for
the keen wit and humorous twists that made his teaching memorable. Perhaps
the most useful lessons I learned from him have to do with the mathematics
of the precision of measurement. <BR>
<BR>
For further graduate work I was offered fellowships at the Mayo Foundation
and at Harvard. I chose <A HREF="http://www.harvard.edu">Harvard</A>, and after one
year as a Teaching Fellow
in the Department of Chemistry at Cambridge, I was accepted as a Teaching
Fellow in the Department of Biological Chemistry at <A
HREF="http://www.med.harvard.edu">Harvard Medical School</A>.
I had intended to work with Otto Folin, but it was his habit to assign first-year
Fellows to Cyrus Fiske for a year. By the end of the year, I was caught
up in the Fiske-Subbarow program, and Folin very generously allowed me to
continue there. After the discovery of phosphocreatine, this group had detected
and isolated adenosine triphosphate. My assignment was to prepare for physiological
studies by developing analytic methods (on a scale then viewed as 'micro'
- 1 mg or less) for the purine bases. These methods constituted my dissertation
and several early publications. <BR>
<BR>
I earned my Ph.D. in 1933, a year memorable for another great event in my
life - my marriage to Beverly Reimer. Her forebears were German, Austrian
(Pennsylvania Dutch), Scottish and English. Her father, Azariah Reimer,
was a Methodist-Episcopal minister who was pastor of a number of parishes
in the Greater Boston area and superintendent of the city missionary society.
Beverly had experience with many races and cultures and grew up having friends
among all. <BR>
<BR>
Beverly was highly artistic and intelligent. She was very accurate in her
intuitive appraisals of people, almost always empathic, almost never disparaging.
As she said, &quot;The same quality is often exhibited in a person's most
liked and most disliked behavior.&quot; Beverly expressed her talents in
painting, jewelry making, writing and teaching. As my research career progressed,
we traveled together and raised two children - Laramie Ruth and Thomas Eldridge.
<BR>
<BR>
Our marriage and my career began in the middle of the Great Depression.
I experienced a nine-year period of impermanence, both financial and intellectual.
I held temporary appointments at the C.P. Huntington Laboratories of Harvard
in cancer research, at The Harvard School of Public Health in nutrition
research, and at Western Reserve University, Department of Medicine, in
electrolyte research. <BR>
<BR>
My career really began in 1942 when I joined the Wellcome Research Laboratories
in Tuckahoe, New York, as head and sole member of the Biochemistry Department.
Support was limited, but I was free to develop my own program of research.
<BR>
<BR>
Elvira Falco was the first permanent member of my staff; <A
HREF="medicine-1988.html">Gertrude Elion</A>
joined in 1944, and Peter Russell in 1947. Additional help was added here
and there, but our numbers were always small. Russell came from <A HREF="chemistry-1957.html">Alex
Todd's</A> laboratory at Cambridge University and brought not only competence
in organic chemistry but a sense of the workings of medicinal chemistry
as well. Elion took part in most of the projects dealing with purines, and
Falco participated in everything from bacteriology and animal feeding to
organic chemistry. For several years our group was housed in one large laboratory.
Under the leadership of Falco, a constant flow of banter developed covering
a wide range of subjects and degrees of seriousness. We never had any obstacles
to interpersonal communication. <BR>
<BR>
In the mid-1940s we began a project that seemed like a digression at times,
but one that had a notable reprise some 40 years later. This was the antiviral
work carried out in collaboration with Randall L. Thompson, then at Western
Reserve. It focused principally on vaccinia virus, and it produced some
active compounds. It also convinced us that effective curative chemotherapy
of viral infections would have to be applied early in the multiplication
cycle. <BR>
<BR>
In 1947, we began to send compounds to the Sloan Kettering Institute to
be screened for activity. Among the first few compounds we submitted was
2,6-diaminopurine, which proved active and later produced several notable
remissions in acute leukemia. <BR>
<BR>
The association with Sloan Kettering was a major impetus for our growth.
The director, C.P. Rhoads, offered us financial support to enable us to
increase our search for antitumor agents. This rather unusual circumstance
resulted from Rhoads' realization that our compounds were of special interest,
both intrinsically and because they were accompanied by a package of biological
information. The external financial help allowed us to expand to about 15
persons. The arrangement continued for a number of years. By that time Burroughs
Wellcome Co. was able to furnish our support completely. The arrangement
with Sloan Kettering was productive and very satisfying for the contacts
it provided, especially with C.P. Rhoads, C.C. Stock, J.H. Burchenal, F.
Philips, D. Hutchison and others. <BR>
<BR>
In 1948, we began to divide responsibilities with respect to developing
purine and pyrimidine analogs. In 1947, Falco had synthesized <I>p</I>-chlorophenoxy-2,4-diaminopyrimidine,
and it was apparent at once that we had a new kind of antifolic acid in
hand. This line was pursued vigorously by Falco and Russell, and within
a short time yielded a very exciting line of investigation - the end of
which is not yet in sight. <BR>
<BR>
The decision to refer the &quot;thiation&quot; of hypoxanthine to Elion
was based on her developing expertise in the field of purine metabolism.
Elion participated in much of the subsequent work with the compound and
the agents that followed, including azathioprine and allopurinol. <BR>
<BR>
It was always stimulating to work with Elion. She is intelligent, hard working
and ambitious. She became my first assistant, and as I was promoted she
succeeded to the position just left. She became head of the Department of
Experimental Therapy, a large segment of the Chemotherapy Division. There
she elucidated the mode of action of acyclovir, a study which is described
as a major part of her Nobel address. <BR>
<BR>
In 1967, I was offered the position of Vice President in Charge of Research
of Burroughs Wellcome Co. It was not a post I had sought, but my experience
had suggested that a scientist was much better able to support the interests
of working scientists than were administrators who got science second hand.
I owe much to D.W. Adamson, Wellcome's Group Research and Development Director,
for his support and encouragement. <BR>
<BR>
By 1968, Burroughs Wellcome Co. had outgrown its facilities at Tuckahoe,
and we were plunged into a new set of administrative problems by the decision
to move the company to a new site. In the end we chose North Carolina and,
acceding to my strong representations, selected a site in the new Research
Triangle Park. The move provided <I>Lebensraum</I>, a good environment and
excellent relationships with the three local universities - Duke, the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and North Carolina State. The move to
North Carolina was a monumental undertaking, but the company soon took root
and today has grown fourfold. <BR>
<BR>
I left my position as Vice President with its heavy administrative duties
to become Scientist Emeritus in 1976. This allowed more time for my own
research and for travel. By 1971, Beverly was handicapped by strange afflictions
classed as &quot;collagen disease&quot; that required close monitoring and
constant medication. She exhibited remarkable courage and continued to be
a joy as a companion. During our last 10 years together we traveled nearly
400,000 miles, much of it on lecture tours. Beverly's disease ended in her
death in December 1985. <BR>
<BR>
For the past 20 years I have pursued my growing interests in philanthropy.
I became Director of The Burroughs Wellcome Fund in 1968 and its President
in 1971. The Fund is a nonprofit foundation dedicated to the support of
biomedical research. The Fund is supported solely by Burroughs Wellcome
Co. and is a relatively small foundation. We have focused The Fund's resources
on underfunded areas of medical research with competitive grants in fields
including clinical pharmacology and innovative methods in drug design. It
has been very rewarding to guide this enterprise and see it grow. <BR>
<BR>
In 1983, I founded what is now the Greater Triangle Community Foundation.
It has been remarkably successful in fulfilling needs in the Triangle area.
I am designated as Founder and Director for Life. <BR>
<BR>
I have been involved also with a number of volunteer civic activities. These
were undertaken partly to provide for activity in the retirement that has
not yet come. They include United Way (Director and Vice President), American
Red Cross (Director and Committee Chairman), Foundation for Better Health
of Durham (Director, President and Chairman), N.C. Board of Science and
Technology, Carolina Consulting Scientists and Engineers (Director); Royal
Society of Medicine Foundation (Director); The Life Sciences Research Foundation.
<BR>
<BR>
Somehow these activities have found a place in my scientific career with
no more cliffficulty than my former administrative duties. Today I devote
one-third of my time to philanthropy and two-thirds to science. <BR>
<BR>
I am vitally interested in current developments in innovative methods in
drug design, and I look back with pride at our contributions to this field.
Our research was untargeted, and the line of inquiry we had begun in the
1940s yielded new drug therapies for malaria (pyrimethamine), leukemia (6-mercaptopurine
and thioguanine), gout (allopurinol), organ transplantation (azathioprine)
and bacterial infections (cotrimoxazole (trimethoprimA). The new knowledge
contributed by our studies pointed the way for investigations that led to
major antiviral drugs for herpes infections (acyclovir) and AIDS (zidovudine).
<BR>
<BR>
My greatest satisfaction has come from knowing that our efforts helped to
save lives and relieve suffering. When I was baptised, my father held me
up and dedicated my life to the service of mankind. I am very proud that,
in some measure, I have been able to fulfill his hopes.

<I>The Permanent Secretary</I><BR><br>
Press Release: The Nobel Prize in Literature 1988 </H3>
October 13, 1988 
<H3>Naguib Mahfouz</H3>
Through the Swedish Academy's decision this year the Nobel Prize in Literature
has for the first time been awarded to an Egyptian. Naguib Mahfouz was born
and lives in Cairo. He is also the first literary Nobel prizewinner with
Arabic as his native tongue.<BR>
<BR>
To date Mahfouz has been writing for about fifty years. At the age of 77
he is still indefatigable.<BR>
<BR>
Mahfouz's great and decisive achievement is as the writer of novels and
short stories. His production has meant a powerful upswing for the novel
as a genre and for the development of the literary language in Arabic-speaking
cultural circles. The range is however greater than that. His work speaks
to us all.<BR>
<BR>
The earliest novels are set in the Pharaonic milieu of ancient Egypt. But
here already there are side-long glances at today's society.<BR>
<BR>
A series of Cairo novels takes place at the present day. To them belongs
<U><I>Midaq Alley</I> </U>(1947). The alley becomes a stage, which holds
together a motley crowd, all drawn with telling psychological realism.<BR>
<BR>
Mahfouz really made his name with the big Trilogy (1956-57). In the centre
is a family and its vicissitudes from the end of the 1910s to the middle
of the 1940s. The series of novels has autobiographical elements. The depiction
of the individuals relates very clearly to intellectual, social and political
conditions. On the whole through his writings Mahfouz has exerted considerable
influence in his country.<BR>
<BR>
The theme of the unusual novel <U><I>Children of Gebelawi</I> </U>(1959)
is man's everlasting search for spiritual values. Adam and Eve, Moses, Jesus,
Mohammed and others, as well as the modern scientist, appear thinly disguised.
It is the scientist who ultimately is responsible for the primeval father
Gebelawi's (God's) death. Different norm systems are confronted with tension
in the description of the conflict between good and evil. On account of
the way in which higher things are treated the book could not be printed
in the author's own country but was published elsewhere.<BR>
<BR>
<I>A Houseboat on the Nile</I>  (1966 - not yet translated into English)
is an example of Mahfouz's impressive novellas. Here metaphysical conversations
are carried on in the borderland between reality and illusion. At the same
time the text forms itself into a comment on the intellectual climate in
the country.<BR>
<BR>
Mahfouz is also an excellent short story writer. In the volume of selected
stories God's World (1973) we get a very good view of what he has achieved
in this field. The artistic treatment of the existential questions is forceful
and the formal solutions often striking.<BR>
<BR>
There has been a tendency to divide Mahfouz's writings into a number of
periods, e.g. a historical, a realistic and a metaphysical-mystical. Naturally
this has not happened without reason. However, the illumination throughout
of human life in general should also be emphasized.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;If the urge to write should ever leave me&quot;, Mahfouz said in an
interview recently, &quot;I want that day to be my last.&quot;<BR>

<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="literature-1988-1.gif" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5>Born in Cairo in 1911, <B>Naguib Mahfouz</B> began writing when he was seventeen.
His first novel was published in 1939 and ten more were written before the
Egyptian Revolution of July 1952, when he stopped writing for several years.
One novel was republished in 1953, however, and the appearance of the Cairo
Triology, <I>Bayn al Qasrayn, Qasr al Shawq, Sukkariya (Between-the-Palaces,
Palace of Longing, Sugarhouse)</I> in 1957 made him famous throughout the Arab
world as a depictor of traditional urban life. With <I>The Children of Gebelawi</I>
(1959), he began writing again, in a new vein that frequently concealed political
judgements under allegory and symbolism. Works of this second period include
the novels, <I>The Thief and the Dogs</I> (1961), <I>Autumn Quail</I> (1962), <I>Small Talk on the Nile</I> (1966), and <I>Miramar</I> (1967), as well as several collections of short stories. <BR><BR>

Until 1972, Mahfouz was employed as a civil servant, first in the Ministry
of Mortmain Endowments, then as Director of Censorship in the Bureau of
Art, as Director of the Foundation for the Support of the Cinema, and, finally,
as consultant on Cultural Affairs to the Ministry of Culture. The years
since his retirement from the Egyptian bureaucracy have seen an outburst
of further creativity, much of it experimental. He is now the author of
no fewer than thirty novels, more than a hundred short stories, and more
than two hundred articles. Half of his novels have been made into films which have circulated throughout the Arabic-speaking world. In Egypt, each
new publication is regarded as a major cultural event and his name is inevitably
among the first mentioned in any literary discussion from Gibraltar to the
Gulf. <BR>

<P>
<h3 align="center">The Nobel Peace Prize for 1988</h3>
<P><br>
<A HREF="http://www.nobel.no/indexen.html">The Norwegian Nobel 
Committee</A> has decided
that the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize is to be awarded to the <B>United Nations
Peace-keeping Forces</B>. <BR>
<BR>
The Peace-keeping Forces of the United Nations have, under extremely difficult
conditions, contributed to reducing tensions where an armistice has been
negotiated but a peace treaty has yet to be established. In situations of
this kind, the UN forces represent the manifest will of the community of
nations to achieve peace through negotiations, and the forces have, by their
presence, made a decisive contribution towards the initiation of actual
peace negotiations. <BR>
<BR>
It is the considered opinion of the Committee that the Peace-keeping Forces
through their efforts have made important contributions towards the realization
of one of the fundamental tenets of the United Nations. Thus, the world organization
has come to play a more central part in world affairs and has been invested
with increasing trust. <BR>
<BR>
The Peace-keeping Forces are recruited from among the young people of many
nations, who, in keeping with their ideals, voluntarily take on a demanding
and hazardous service in the cause of peace. In the opinion of the Committee,
their efforts contribute in a particularly appropriate way towards the realization
of the goals of the United Nations. <BR>

<H2><CENTER>THE UNITED NATIONS PEACE-KEEPING FORCES</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
The <B>United Nations Peace-keeping Forces</B> are employed by the World
Organizaton to maintain or re-establish peace in an area of armed conflict.
The UN may engage in conflicts between states as well as in struggles within
states. The UN acts as an impartial third party in order to prepare the
ground for a settlement of the issues that have provoked armed conflict.
If it proves impossible to achieve a peaceful settlement, the presence of
UN forces may contribute to reducing the level of conflict. <BR>
<BR>
The UN Peace-keeping Forces may only be employed when both parties to a
conflict accept their presence. Accordingly, they may also be used by the
warring parties to avoid having a conflict escalate and, in the event, also
to have a struggle called off. <BR>
<BR>
The Peace-keeping Forces are subordinate to the leadership of the United
Nations. They are normally deployed as a consequence of a Security Council
decision. However, on occasion, the initiative has been taken by the General
Assembly. Operational control belongs to the Secretary-General and his secretariat.
<BR>
<BR>
We distinguish between two kinds of peace-keeping operations - unarmed observer
groups and lightly-armed military forces. The latter are only allowed to
employ their weapons for self-defence. Altogether, 14 UN operations have
been carried out. They are evenly divided between observer groups and military
forces. The observer groups are concerned with gathering information for
the UN about actual conditions prevailing in an area, e.g., as to whether
both parties adhere to an armistice agreement. The military forces are entrusted
with more extended tasks, such as keeping the parties to a conflict apart
and maintaining order in an area. <BR>
<BR>
UN interventions have been in particular demand in the Middle East, both
as regards observer groups and military forces. The UN first took on the
task of sending observers to monitor the armistice between Israel and the
Arab states in 1948. Observer group activity was resumed after the wars
of 1956, 1967, and 1973. After the 1956 war, the first armed UN force was
established to create a buffer between Israeli and Egyptian forces in the
Sinai. Ten nations contributed soldiers. Another force was established after
the war between Egypt and Israel in 1967 to monitor the armistice agreement
between the parties. This took place during a period of extremely high tension
both locally and between the great powers. In 1974, a smaller UN force was
set up on the Golan Heights to maintain the boundary line between Syrian
and Israeli forces. The most extensive UN operation in the Middle East is
represented by the formation of UNIFIL, subsequent upon the Israeli invasion
of Lebanon in 1978. Its tasks included watching over the Israeli withdrawal,
maintaining conditions of peace and security, and helping the Lebanese government
re-establish its authority. Such tasks have taxed the capabilities of UNIFIL
to the utmost, but the UN forces have made an important contribution by
reducing the level of conflict in the area. However, this achievement has
not come without significant cost. UN casualities now amount to more than
200. <BR>
<BR>
The UN played an important role during the struggles that erupted when the
Belgian colony of the Congo achieved independence in 1960. As anarchy and
chaos reigned in the area, a UN force numbering almost 20,000 was set up
to help the Congolese government maintain peace and order. It ended up being,
above all, engaged in bringing a raging civil war to an end and preventing
the province of Katanga from seceding. It was while carrying out the UN
mission in the Congo that Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold was killed
in an air crash. <BR>
<BR>
Among other important tasks may be mentioned monitoring the border between
India and Pakistan, and maintaining the peace-keeping force that was established
on Cyprus on account of the civil war that broke out between the Greek and
Turkish populations of the island. The UN force has succeeded in creating
a buffer zone between the two ethnic groups. <BR>
<BR>
The UN has, in these and other areas, played a significant role in reducing
the level of conflict even though the fundamental causes of the struggles
frequently remain. <BR>

THE ROYAL SWEDISH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES</H3>
18  October 1988 <BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.kva.se/">The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences </A>has
decided to award the 1988 Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences
to <B>Professor Maurice Allais</B>, Ecole Nationale Superieure des Mines
de Paris, for his pioneering contributions to the theory of markets and
efficient utilization of resources. <BR>
<BR>
One of the principal tasks of basic research in economics is to formulate
a rigorous model of equilibrium in markets and examine the efficiency of
this equilibrium. The problem dates back to Adam Smith and his theory of
the &quot;invisible hand&quot; which coordinates a - to all appearances
- chaotic structure comprised of a multitude of independent and individual
decisions based on self-interest. Paradoxically, this chaos gives rise to
coordinated equilibria based on market prices. Firms' production decisions
will correspond to consumers' planned consumption. <BR>
<BR>
Adam Smith formulated his theory in the verbal and somewhat expository manner
that was common in the social sciences during the latter part of the 18th
century. About a hundred years later, other scholars tried to reformulate
Smith's basic problems in mathematical terms. As a result, modern price
theory as it emerged in the late 19th century, differed radically from previous
conceptions of &quot;just&quot; prices or prices based exclusively on production
costs for labor. <BR>
<BR>
The missing link in the development of a more rigorous theory was provided
in the 1870s by the French economist L&eacute;on Walras. He formulated his
model ot the economic system as a large system of equations which described
individuals' demand for goods and services and their supply of labor and
other productive input along with firms' supply of goods and their demand
for various factors of production. A set of prices which gave rise to equilibrium
between supply and demand could, in fact, be regarded as a solution to this
extremely large and complex system of equations. Later on, Walras' model
was developed further by, among others, the Italian economist and sociologist
Vilfredo Pareto. The Swedish economist Gustav Cassel formulated a somewhat
simplified version which had a significant impact internationally. <BR>
<BR>
The foremost contribution of Maurice Allais was made in the 1940s when he
continued to develop Walras' and Pareto's work by providing increasingly
rigorous mathematical formulations of market equilibrium and the efficiency
properties of markets. On the basis of mathematical models of households'
and firms' planning and choice, he introduced a very general formulation
of the conditions for market equilibrium. Allais' two pioneering works are
<I>A la Recherche d'une Discipline Economique, </I> published during the
war in 1943, and <I>Economie et Interet</I>, 1947. A second edition of the
first book appeared in 1952 as <I>Traite d'Economie Pure</I>. Each of these
studies was extensive; the first comprised about 900 pages and the second
approximately 800. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Traite d'Economie Pure</I> contains a general and rigorous formulation
of the two basic propositions of welfare theory. An economic situation with
equilibrium prices is socially efficient in the sense that no one can become
better off without someone else becoming worse off. In addition, under certain
reasonable conditions, each such socially efficient situation can be achieved
through redistribution of initial resources and a system of equilibrium
prices. These propositions are important not only as results of basic research,
but also as guidelines for planning in e.g. the public sector by means of
prices (instead of direct regulation). Allais also formulated a generalization
which covers the case where various kinds of returns to scale may give rise
to natural monopolies. Through his analysis of market equilibrium and social
efficiency, Allais laid the foundations for the school of postwar French
economists who not only analyzed the conditions for efficient use of resources
in large public monopolies (such as Electricit&eacute; de France or SNCF,
the state-owned railroad), but also in many instances applied the theory
to business management. <BR>
<BR>
Allais' two monumental works also contain many results which represent very
early contributions in areas that were not explored until much later on.
He used new mathematical methods to analyze the stability of equilibria,
i.e., the conditions under which an economy - after a disturbance - will
return to equilibrium through price formation. In his 1948 study, Allais
anticipated important results in research which led to the modern theory
of economic growth in the late 1950s and early 1960s. <BR>
<BR>
Allais'<B> </B>distinguished contribution may, to some extent, be regarded
as a parallel to two important works published around the same time in the
Anglo-Saxon research community: <I>Value and Capital </I>(1939) by <A HREF="economy-1972.html">Sir
John Hicks</A> and Foundations of Economic Analvsis (1947) by <A HREF="economy-1970.html">Paul
A. Samuelson.</A> Hicks was awarded the Nobel memorial prize in economic
sciences in 1972 and Samuelson in 1970. The similarity lies primarily in
the objective of providing a comprehensive and rigorous interpretation of
economic theory. The main difference is perhaps that Allais' formulation
is more general and includes an analysis of e.g. households' and firms'
long-run (or intertemporal) planning. The work of Allais served as a basis
for the analysis of market equilibrium and social efficiency using more
advanced mathematical methods carried out by his pupil, <A HREF="economy-1983.html">Gerard
Debreu</A> ( laureate in 1983), concurrently and sometimes in collaboration
with <A HREF="economy-1972.html">Kenneth Arrow</A><A HREF="economics-1972-2.html">
</A>(laureate in 1972). <BR>
<BR>
Allais' outstanding achievements may be characterized as basic research
in economics. By his links to an older French tradition in economic research,
Maurice Allais is the most prominent figure in modern economic research
in France as regards basic theory and applications to public-sector planning.
Even though his fundamental research has been relatively little known beyond
the French-speaking sphere, Allais has had a far-reaching indirect impact
through younger French economists who have been strongly influenced by his
work. <BR>
<BR>
Maurice Allais has also made distinguished, pioneering and often highly
original contributions in other areas of economic research. At an early
stage, he carried out theoretical and empirical studies on the significance
and determinants of the volume of money. He was thus an initiator of monetary
macrodynamic analyses. Outside of a rather small circle of economists, he
is perhaps best known for his studies of risk theory and the so-called Allais
paradox. He has shown that the theory of maximization of expected utility,
which has been accepted for more than forty years, does not apply to many
empirically realistic decisions under risk and uncertainty. <BR>
<BR>
During the past two decades, Allais has tried to generalize market theory
by emphasizing its dynamic aspects. The impetus for consumers' and producers'
economic behavior consists of efforts to use any surpluses that may arise
in an economy through previously unexploited exchange opportunities. Equilibrium
is reached when these surpluses have been exhausted. Allais summarized many
of his early and more recent research contributions in <I>La Theorie G&eacute;n&eacute;rale
des SurpIus</I> (1981). <BR>
<BR>
The sum ot Allais' productive achievements in economic theory is considerable.
Moreover, he has carried out various applied studies in e.g. operations
research and has participated extensively in debates in the French press.
Alongside his accomplishments as an economist, Allais has published studies
in history and physics, particularly geophysics. <BR>

<IMG SRC="economy-1988-1.gif" ALIGN=left VSPACE="5" HSPACE="10"><B><I>My youth</I></B><BR>
I was born May 31, 1911, in Paris. My parents owned a small cheese shop,
and my maternal grandfather was a carpentry worker. I thus came from what
is commonly known as the working class. <BR>
<BR>
In August 1914, my father was called to war, and then taken prisoner. He
died in captivity in Germany on March 27, 1915. My youth, indeed my entire
life, was deeply marked by this, directly and indirectly. <BR>
<BR>
Albeit in often difficult conditions, I was nevertheless able to pursue
my secondary studies. I received my high school baccalaureate diploma in
Latin and Science in 1928, then my two baccalaureate diplomas in Mathematics
and Philosophy in 1929. Throughout my college career I was generally first
in my year in almost all subjects, including French and Latin as well as
Mathematics. <BR>
<BR>
Fascinated by History, I wanted to apply to the<I> Ecole des Chartes</I>,
but on the insistence of my mathematics teacher I entered the special mathematics
class in order to prepare for the <I>Ecole Polytechnique</I>, which I entered
in 1931. I graduated first in my class in 1933, which is commonly considered
to be a &quot;summum&quot; in France. Indeed the <I>Ecole Polytechnique</I>,
together with the <I>Ecole Normale Superieure</I>, are the top of French
education in the sciences. <BR>
<BR>
My choice of a government administration upon graduation was the &quot;Corps
National des Mines&quot;, not because of any particular vocation, but simply
because each year the top graduates of the Ecole Polytechnique (three in
my class) always chose this government service because of the career possibilities
it opened up in the country's large industrial enterprises. <BR>
<BR>
After a year of military service, first in the Artillery School at Fontainebleau
and then in the Alpine Army, and two years at the Ecole Nationale Superieure
des Mines in Paris, I started as an engineer in the mines public service
in October 1936. <BR>
<BR>
<B><I>My professional career<BR>
</I></B>In 1937, at the age of twenty six, I found myself in charge of the
Nantes mines and quarries service, which included five of the 89 French
&quot;departments&quot;, and also put in charge of a number of controls,
in particular that of the general and local railway system. <BR>
<BR>
In 1939, I was called back to the Alpine Army on the Italian front, and
was given command of a heavy artillery battery in the area of Briancon.
But the real war only lasted two weeks, from June 10, 1940, when Italy declared
war on France, until June 25, 1940, the date of the armistice. <BR>
<BR>
Released from service, I took up my old position in Nantes in duly 1940
in the German occupation zone. From October 1943 to April 1948 I was director
of le Bureau of Mines Documentation and Statistics in Paris. <BR>
<BR>
From January 1941 to April 1948 I simultaneously carried out my administrative
functions and published my first works: two fundamental works, &quot;<I>A
la Reserche d'une Discipline Economique</I>&quot; (In Quest of an Economic
Discipline, and &quot;<I>Economic et Interet</I>&quot; (Economy and Interest)
(1947); and three minor works, &quot;<I>Economic Pure et Rendement Social</I>&quot;
(Pure Economics and Social Efficiency) (1945), &quot;<I>Prol&eacute;gomenes
a la Reconstruction &eacute;conomique du Monde</I>&quot; Prolegomena for
the World Economic Reconstruction) (1945), and &quot;<I>Abondance ou Mis&egrave;re</I>&quot;
(Abundance or Misery) (1946), as well as various news articles. Throuughout
this period I worked very hard, at least eighty hours per week.<BR>
<BR>
From April 1948 on, I was relieved of all administrative duties and was
able to devote all my time to teaching, research, and writing for publication.
I was professor of Economic Analysis at the &quot;<I>Ecole Nationale Superieure
des Mines</I> &quot; from 1944 on, and Director of a research unit at the
&quot;<I>Centre de la Recherche Scientifique </I>&quot; (C.N.R.S.) from
1946 on. At various times I held teaching positions at other institutions,
such as the Institute of statistics at the University of Paris (1947 - 1968),
the <I>Thomas Jefferson Center </I>of the University of Virginia as a Distinguished
Visiting Scholar 1958 - 1959), the <I>Graduate Institute of International
Studies in Geneva</I> (1967- l970), and the <I>University of Paris-X</I>
(1970 - 1985). <BR>
<BR>
I retired from the civil service on May 31, 1980, but, thanks to the <I>Ecole
Nationale Sup&eacute;rieure des Mines</I> and the<I>Centre National de la
Recherche Scientific</I> , I have been able to keep some means for working
and to continue to in teaching, research, and writing. <BR>
<BR>
I have received many awards for my works (fourteen scientific prizes from
1933 till 1987). The most important was the<I> Gold Medal of the National
Center for Scientific Research </I>(C.N.R.S.), the most distinguished honour
in French Science ( as a rule there is only one Gold Medal every year for
all sciences). It was awarded to me in 1978 for my lifetime work, the first
and so far the only time an economist has ever received this honour. <BR>
<BR>
<B><I>My involvement in applied economics and politics<BR>
</I></B>In addition to the above activities I have undertaken economic studies
for both private and nationalized firms, and for the <I>European Economic
Community</I>.<BR>
<BR>
Throughout the years following World War II and until the formation of the
<I>European Economic Community </I>in 1958, I was very active as a national
or international rapporteur at many of the international conferences aiming
to establish an European Community. I also took part in various international
conferences with the view of the foundation of an Atlantic Community and
I was rapporteur at the &quot;NATO in Quest of Cohesion&quot; international
conference organized in 1964 in Washington by the <I>Center of Strategic
Studies</I> of Georgetown University.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, from 1959 to 1962, I was also founder and general delegate to the
<I>Movement for a Free Society,</I> a liberal (in the European sense of
the term) para-political organization. <BR>
<BR>
<B><I>My contributions to economic science<BR>
</I></B>My contributions to the fundamental Economic Science have essentially
focused on five fields, all concerned with the research of the conditions
for a maximum efficiency of the economy and with the analysis of the corresponding
determining factors of the distribution of income. I have given a broad
outline of these contributions in my Nobel Lecture. <BR>
<BR>
<B><I>My work in applied economics<BR>
</I></B>- On a national level and in close connection with my work in economic
analysis, I was led to study more particularly four areas of applied economics:
economic management, the distribution of income and taxation, monetary policy,
and the economy of energy, of transport and of mining research. <BR>
<BR>
From the point of view of the management of the economy, the demonstration
of the equivalence of states of maximum efficiency and states of equilibrium
of an economy of markets (markets in the plural) is naturally of great import.
It shows indeed that any economy whatsoever, whether collectivist or private
property, must be organized on the decentralized basis of an economy of
markets in order to be efficient and to use at best the scarce resources
at its disposal. <BR>
<BR>
What are then the conditions of implementation of an economy of markets?
What are the ethical questions raised by such an implementation? Can the
techniques of an economy of markets and the ethical aspirations of our time
be reconciled? What are the monetary conditions of growth? What are the
conditions of full employment? Such are the questions which I tried to answer.
My major conclusion was that both the economic and ethical objectives of
our time can be reached at the same time only if the institutional framework
within which the economy works is appropriately reformed, and I have tried
to specify the principles for such a reform. <BR>
<BR>
- On the international level, the active part I took in various organisations
such as the European Union of Federalists, the European Movement, the Movement
for an Atlantic Union, and the European Economic Communities, together with
my lecturing for several years at the Institute of International Studies
in Geneva, have led me to study thoroughly, in various works and memoirs,
the international factors of economic development, the liberalisation of
international trade, the monetary conditions of international economic relations,
and economic unions. <BR>
<BR>
In my study of the factors of development, as well as in that of the various
economic systems, I was led to make numerous researches on the compared
real income and productivity of France, the Soviet Union and the United
States, to study in detail the economies of these countries, and to analyse
the possible causes of the productivity differences observed. This analysis
shows that the main explanatory factors are their systems of economic organisation
together with the institutional framework within which they operate. <BR>
<BR>
At the same time, my contacts with administrative and industrial circles
led me to study, in my memoirs on the economy of energy, of transport and
of mining research, three series of questions which I was asked on several
times. What must the energy policy of investments, exploitation and price
be in order to be considered effectively satisfactory? According to what
principles must a rational coordination and tariff policy of transports
be established? What is the optimal strategy to adopt for the mining research
of mineral deposits? All these problems led me to study very diverse and
concrete questions, and to reflect on numerous aspects of economic theory,
econometrics and operational research. The - often new - solutions which
I gave them gave rise to many debates in engineering circles and led many
engineers to study economic theory and to apply it to their respective fields.<BR>
<BR>
For my 1952  memoir on mining research, published in English in 1957, I
was awarded &quot;<I>The Lanchester Prize 1958 of the Johns Hopkins University
and the Operations Research Society of America for the outstanding paper
on Operations Research published in 1957&quot;.</I><BR>
<BR>
- All my works in applied economics are closely linked to my works in economic
analysis. Theoretical analysis naturally led me to applications, and the
study of concrete questions has led me to reflect on the theoretical foundations
from which it was possible to provide satisfactory answers. <BR>
<BR>
I have been constantly driven by the conviction that a man of science cannot
fail to take an interest in the fundamental problems of his time. I have
of course never ceased to think that, whether as an adviser or a teacher,
the economist as such should not take a stand on individual ends which often
are contradictory. The ends to pursue belong to the field of politics and
it is in fact the essential task of political systems to define them through
overall compromises. But precisely, on the economic level, the economist's
role is to examine whether the ends defined through such comprises are actually
compatible with each other and whether the means used to reach them are
really the most appropriate. <BR>
<BR>
On the whole, on the level of the analysis as well as on the level of applied
economics, my work has endeavoured to rethink the role of economic liberty
and of an economy of markets as regards the search for efficiency and the
achievement of the ethical objectives of our time, and to contribute to
a thorough study of the questions raised by the economic organisation of
societies.<BR>
<BR>
There is no doubt that my works in applied economics have been influenced
by a philosophy of liberal inspiration (in the European sense) along the
lines of Alexis de Tocqueville, Leon Walras, Vilfredo Pareto, and John Maynard
Keynes, to name but a few. But, whatever this influence may have been, I
have constantly endeavoured to keep my analyses on as <I>objective and as
scientific a level as possible</I>. In fact, all my works in applied economics
are particularly marked by two characteristics, the first being that they
are always founded on a thorough theoretical analysis, the second that they
are constantly preoccuppied with the quantitative aspects of the questions
studied.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>My two parallel interests</I></B><BR>
During my whole career since 1936, I have had two parallel interests to
which I have never ceased to devote an important part of my activity: History
and Physics. <BR>
<BR>
<I>My research on the history of civilizations.</I> It is in the course
of my secondary studies that I first was passionated for History. That passion
has never left me since. <BR>
<BR>
From 1961 to 1968 I wrote the first version of a general book, &quot;<I>Essor
et d&eacute;clin des civilisations-Facteurs economiques</I>&quot; (Rise
and Fall of Civilizations - Economic Factors), which I have continued to
improve and develop at different times over the past twenty years. This
work, as ambitious as it is daring, tries to draw out permanent regularities,
particularly quantitative, from the history of civilizations, dealing with
economic systems, standards of living, technology, monetary phenomena, demographic
factors, inequality and social classes, the respective influences of heredity
and environment, international relations, exogenous physical influences
on human societies, and political systems. <BR>
<BR>
My research on the economic and social factors of the history of civilizations
has been extremely enlightening for me. Nothing can be more formative than
the study of the history of facts, doctrines and economic thought. Whether
it be economic systems, the evolution of real income, monetary phenomena,
demography, international relations, ideologies, or the interactions of
these factors and their relationships of cause and effect, nothing can be
more significant than their analysis. <BR>
<BR>
My work in theoretical and experimental physics. My involvement in Physics
dates from my reflections on physics, mechanics, and astronomy courses at
the Ecole Polytechnique. Had the National Centre for Scientific Research
existed in 1938, I would have devoted myself to the study of physics and
would not have become an economist. <BR>
<BR>
But there again, over the past fifty years, while pursuing my activities
as an economist, I have never stopped reflecting and working at various
times on the problems involved in the elaboration of a unified theory of
gravitation, electromagnetism, and quanta. <BR>
<BR>
On the experimental level, and as a by-product of this theoretical research,
I conducted, from 1952 to 1960, experiments on the anomalies of the paraconical
pendulum (a short pendulum, about one meter long, suspended by a steel ball),
anomalies the existence of which I proved. For these experiments I received
the 1959 <I>Galabert Prize</I>  of the <I>French Astronautical Society</I>,
 and I was laureate in 1959 of the United States<I>Gravity Research Foundation</I>..
<BR>
<BR>
My main idea at the start was that a link could be established between magnetism
and gravitation by observing the movements of a pendulum consisting of a
glass ball oscillating in a magnetic field. Of all the observations made
in 1952 and 1953 I was not able to draw any definitive conclusion. Through
certain experimental devices, I obtained<I> positive</I> effects, but with
other devices I obtained no effect whatsoever. A much stronger magnetic
field would have been necessary, but it was unrealizable in my laboratory
with the available means.<BR>
<BR>
But in the absence of any magnetic field other than that of the earth, I
observed, in the course of continuous observations, pursued over periods
of about one month from 1954 to 1960, <I>very remarkable anomalies </I>in
the movement of the paraconical pendulum, to wit essentially the existence
of a significant periodicity of the order of 24 hrs 50 min. Identical results
were found in June-July 1958 in two laboratories, some 6 km away from each
other, one in a basement, the other in an underground quarry.<BR>
<BR>
At the same time, I observed in the second half of July 1958 a <I>correspondence
</I>between the anomalies in the movement of the paraconical pendulum and
the anomalies observed in the optical sightings on a fixed sighting mark
through a fixed telescope.<BR>
<BR>
Finally during the total eclipses of the sun on June 30, 1954, and October
22, 1959, quite analogous deviations of the plane of oscillation of the
paraconical pendulum were observed.<BR>
<BR>
In fact, all these phenomena are <I>quite inexplicable within the framework
of the currently accepted theories.</I><BR>
<BR>
With regard to all these results as well as to their analysis I can make
a prediction: if, <I>without interruption, for at least one month, in the
same place and at the same time</I>, observations of the movement of the
paraconical pendulum are made, together with optical sightings such as those
I made, as well as a repitition of the Michelson-Morley (1887) and Miller
(1925) experiments, the purpose of which was to display the movement of
the earth relatively to the &quot;ether&quot;, it will be found that the
effects observed by Miller in 1925 correspond to the anomalies in the movement
of the paraconical pendulum and the anomalies of the optical sightings which
I observed.<BR>
<BR>
<I>All my researches in theoretical and applied physics which, at first
sight, appear to be remote from my main activity as an economist, have in
reality enriched me with valuable experience.<BR>
</I><BR>
These researches, which constantly presented all kinds of very great difficulties,
have led me to reflect on the nature of our knowledge, the nature of experience
and theory, the diffficulties of experimentation and the interpretation
of results, and the scientific method in general.<BR>
<BR>
I have been particularly struck by the identity of problems relating to
the construction of models and the meaning of empirical data in economics
and physics. <I>Nothing has been more instructive for me than this confrontation</I>
between two apparently so dissimilar sciences.<BR>

<BR>
Summary<BR>
<BR>
This year's Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to <B>Dr Georg Bednorz</B>
and <B>Professor Dr K. Alex M&uuml;ller</B>, both researchers at the IBM
Zurich Research Laboratory, for their discovery of new superconducting materials.<BR>
<BR>
Superconductivity, one of the most spectacular phenomena of physics, has
been known since 1911. Superconductivity arises when a superconducting material
is cooled to a fairly low critical temperature. Suddenly, an electric current
can then flow with no resistance whatso ever. Simultaneously, there occurs
what is termed the Meissner effect. This means that a magnetic field cannot,
or can only partly, penetrate the material. Hitherto, all superconducting
materials have needed cooling to such low temperatures that only helium,
with a boiling point of -269&#176;C, has been practicable as a coolant.
It has been the dream of many researchers to find material that remains
superconducting at higher temperatures but, in spite of small advances,
nothing had happened since 1973, when an alloy was produced that became
superconducting at -250&#176;C.<BR>
<BR>
Last year, 1986, Bednorz and M&uuml;ller reported finding superconductivity
in an oxide material at a temperature 12&#176;C higher than previously known.
This was the introduction to an explosive development in which hundreds
of laboratories the world over commenced work on similar material. Better
superconductors have already been produced.<BR>
<BR>
What Bednorz and M&uuml;ller did was to abandon the &quot;conventional&quot;
materials - alloys of different composition. Since 1983 they have concentrated
on oxides which, apart from containing oxygen, include copper and one or
more of the rare earth metals. The new idea was that the copper atoms in
a material of this kind could be made to transport electrons, which interact
more strongly with the surrounding crystal than they do in normal electrical
conductors. To obtain a chemically stable material the two researchers added
barium to crystals or lanthanum-copper-oxide to produce a ceramic material
that became the first successful &quot;hightemperature&quot; superconductor.<BR>
<BR>
Bednorz and M&uuml;ller stand out clearly as the discoverers of this specific
superconductivity. They have inspired other researchers to synthesise substances
that are superconducting at temperatures more than four times higher (reckoned
from absolute zero at -273&#176;C) than the earlier ones. The development
is being followed with intense interest by workers in electrotechnology
and microelectronics, and by physicists who envisage exciting new applications
in measurement technology.<BR>
<BR>
Background Information<BR>
<BR>
Superconductivity has a long history. It was discovered as far back as 1911
by the Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh-Onnes, who received the Nobel Prize
in 1913. The associated Meissner effect was observed for the first time
in 1933. Despite numerous experiments and theoretical attempts over the
following years to explain how superconductivity arises, it was not until
1957 that the Americans John Bardeen , Leon Cooper and Robert Schrieffer
were able to formulate a consistent theory, the BCS theory, for which a
Nobel Prize was awarded in 1972. This theory is based on the idea that the
electrons form so-called Cooper pairs which subsequently perform a strongly
coordinated motion within the conductor. Energy is required to break up
the Cooper pairs and make the material return to its normal conducting state.
The more strongly the Cooper pairs are linked, the higher the temperature
at which this break-up occurs.<BR>
<BR>
In the 1960's, another development in superconductivity was initiated, by
the Englishman Brian Josephson (who received the Nobel Prize in 1973). This
development concerned currents across points of contact between superconducting
and normally conducting materials, and was to teach physicists a great deal
about quantum mechanical tunnelling (hew particles can move &quot;through&quot;
barriers) and about interference (how matter waves interact). These contact
points have become important tools in high-class precision determination
of magnetic fields and voltage differences.<BR>
<BR>
Superconductivity has also been employed in technology. Coils of superconducting
materials are found in large magnets in accelerator laboratories and other
research institutions. Pilot systems have also been developed for other
applications such as electrical generators and energy storage arrangements.
There are also inventions based on the fact that objects can &quot;float&quot;
on magnetic &quot;cushions&quot;, for example in wheel bearings. Yet other
applications are envisaged in electronics, and concern switches and memory
elements.<BR>
<BR>
However, the technical applications have so far been greatly limited, in
many cases to the drawing-board, since the available superconducting materials
have required cooling co such low temperatures that, in practice, only liquid
helium has been accessible as a coolant. The handling of liquid helium,
with a boiling point of -269&#176;C, is complicated and expensive.<BR>
<BR>
Finding materials which remain superconducting at higher temperatures has
therefore, over the past 75 years, been a dream which many researchers have
tried to fulfill. The critical temperature level has slowly been raised,
but nothing had happened since 1973 when an alloy with a transition temperature
of 23&#176;C above absolute zero was produced.<BR>
<BR>
In April 1986 measurements were reported by Georg Bednorz and Alex M&uuml;ller
on an oxide where the transition to superconductivity set in at a temperature
of 12&#176;C above the highest then known. Later in the same year, the two
researchers purified the material, and the magnetic properties associated
with a genuine superconducting state were also demonstrated.<BR>
<BR>
This was the start of an avalanche. Hundreds of laboratories all over the
world were soon at work with materials similar to those of Bednorz and M&uuml;ller.
Transition temperatures more than 90&#176;C above absolute zero were reached
during the first few months of 1987 in the United States, China, Japan and
Europe, and it seems that this development has not yet come to an end. Devices
based on such &quot;high-temperature superconductors&quot; can be cooled
with liquid nitrogen, which is a considerably cheaper, more efficient and
easily-handled coolant than liquid helium.<BR>
<BR>
Bednorz' and M&uuml;ller's new approach was to abandon the &quot;conventional&quot;
semiconducting alloys, for instance of niobium-germanium or niobium-tin
type, and to direct their search among metal oxides. It was known that some
of these oxides may conduct electricity, but their conductivity is normally
very limited.<BR>
<BR>
At first sight, therefore, it seems astonishing that such materials can
ever pass to a superconducting state when cooled. Yet it was with various
oxide materials (which in addition to oxygen contain copper or nickel and
some of the rare earth elements) that Bednorz and M&uuml;ller had worked
since 1983.<BR>
<BR>
When they at last broke through all existing limits for superconducting
materials, it was as a result of systematic work, deep insight and experience
of structural problems in the physics and chemistry of the solid state (plus,
one may assume, the intuition characteristic of the true scientist). Besides
this, they had had the audacity to concentrate on new paths in their research.
Their reasoning was that the copper or nickel atoms in the materials they
used could be made to transfer electrons, which interact more strongly with
the surrounding crystal (and consequently also with the oscillations set
up by the atoms in the crystal) than is the case in normal conductors. This
strong interaction is, according to current theory, one of the conditions
for the pairing of electrons and the maintenance of the strongly coordinated
motion which they require in the superconducting state. To obtain a chemically
stable material and at the same time increase the normal conductivity Bednorz
and M&uuml;ller added barium to crystals of lanthanum-copper-oxide to obtain
the approximate composition La<sub>1.85</sub>Ba<sub>0.15</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>,
which turned out to be the first successful high-temperature superconductor.<BR>
<BR>
Bednorz and M&uuml;ller stand out clearly as the discoverers of this specific
superconductivity. They have inspired-a great number of other scientists
to work with related materials. As already mentioned, this has resulted
in the synthesis of substances which are superconducting at temperatures
more than four times higher (above absolute zero) than before. The details
of how superconductivity arises in the new materials are still unknown.
Intensive work is being carried out using the full arsenal of measuring
methods within solid-state physics to uncover the essential mechanisms behind
this phenomenon. One main question is whether the descriptions of superconductivity
employed so far (i.e. the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory) are sufficient,
or whether new concepts will be needed. Perhaps it will be necessary to
reconsider certain aspects of the motion and interaction of electrons in
solid substances.<BR>
<BR>
It is too early to predict how extensive the technical applications will
be, but it is quite evident that the development is being followed with
keen interest by representatives of electrical power technology, by microelectronics
researchers and by physicists who envisage new applications in measurement
technology.<BR>

<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="physics-1987-1.gif" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5>I was born in Neuenkirchen, North-Rhine Westphalia, in the Federal Republic
of Germany on May 16, 1950, as the fourth child of Anton and Elisabeth Bednorz.
My parents, originating from Silesia, had lost sight of each other during
the turbulences of World War II, when my sister and two brothers had to
leave home and were moved westwards. I was a latecomer completing our family
after its joyous reunion in 1949. <BR>
<BR>
During my childhood, my father, a primary school teacher and my mother,
a piano teacher, had a hard time to direct my interest to classical music.
I was more practical-minded and preferred to assist my brothers in fixing
their motorcycles and cars, rather than performing solo piano exercises.
At school it was our teacher of arts who cultivated that practical sense
and helped to develop creativity and team spirit within the class community,
inspiring us to theater and artistic performances even outside school hours.
I even discovered my interest in classical music at the age of 13 and started
playing the violin and later the trumpet in the school orchestra. <BR>
<BR>
My fascination in the natural sciences was roused while learning about chemistry
rather than physics. The latter was taught in a more theoretical way, whereas
in chemistry, the opportunity to conduct experiments on our own, sometimes
even with unexpected results, was addressing my practical sense. <BR>
<BR>
In 1968, I started my studies in chemistry at the University of M&uuml;nster,
but somehow felt lost due to the impersonal atmosphere created by the large
number of students. Thus I soon changed my major to cristallography, that
field of mineralogy which is located between chemistry and physics. <BR>
<BR>
In 1972, Prof. Wolfgang Hoffmann and Dr. Horst B&ouml;hm, my teachers, arranged
for me to join the IBM Z&uuml;rich Research Laboratory for three months as a
summer student. It was a challenge for me to experience how my scientific
education could be applied in reality. The decision to go to Switzerland
set the course for my future. The physics department of which I became a
member was headed by K. Alex M&uuml;ller, whom I met with deep respect. I was
working under the guidance of Hans J&ouml;rg Scheel, learning about different
methods of crystal growth, materials characterization and solid state chemistry.
I soon was impressed by the freedom even I as a student was given to work
on my own, learning from mistakes and thus losing the fear of approaching
new problems in my own way. <BR>
<BR>
After my second visit in 1973, I came to R&uuml;schlikon for six months in 1974
to do the experimental part of my diploma work on crystal growth and characterization
of SrTiO<SUB>3</SUB>, again under the guidance of Hans Jorg Scheel. The perovskites
were Alex M&uuml;ller's field of interest and, having followed my work, he encouraged
me to continue my research on this class of materials. <BR>
<BR>
In 1977, after an additional year in M&uuml;nster, I joined the Laboratory of
Solid State Physics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in
Z&uuml;rich and started my Ph.D. thesis under the supervision of Prof. Heini
Granicher and K. Alex Muller. I gratefully remember the time at the ETH
and the family-like atmosphere in the group, where Hanns Arend provided
a continuous supply of ideas. It was also the period during which I began
to interact more closely with Alex and reamed about his intuitive way of
thinking and his capability of combining ideas to form a new concept. <BR>
<BR>
In 1978, Mechthild Wennemer followed me to Z&uuml;rich to start her Ph.D. at
the ETH, but more importantly to be my partner in life. I had met her in
1974 during our time together at the University of M&uuml;nster. Since then she
has acted as a stabilizing element in my life and is the best adviser for
all decisions I make, sharing the up's and down's in an tinselfish way.
<BR>
<BR>
I completed my work on the crystal growth of perovskite-type solid solutions
and investigating them with respect to structural, dielectric and ferroelectric
properties, and joined IBM in 1982. This was the end of a ten-year approach
which had begun in 1972. <BR>
<BR>
The intense collaboration with Alex started in 1983 with the search for
a high-TC superconducting oxide; in my view, a long and thorny but ultimately
successful path. We both realized the importance of our discovery in 1986,
but were surprised by the dramatic development and changes in both the field
of science and in our personal lives. <BR>

<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="physics-1987-2.gif" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5>I was born in Basle, Switzerland, on 20th April 1927. The first years of
my life were spent with my parents in Salzburg, Austria, where my father
was studying music. Hereafter, my mother and I moved to Dornach near Basle
to the home of my grandparents, and from there to Lugano in the italian-speaking
part of Switzerland. Here, I attended school and thus became fluent in the
Italian language. <BR>
<BR>
My mother died when I was eleven years old, and I attended the Evangelical
College in Schiers, situated in a mountain valley in eastern Switzerland.
I remained there until I obtained my baccalaureate (Mature) seven years
later. This means I arrived in Schiers just before the Second World War
started, and left just after it terminated. This was indeed quite a unique
situation for us youngsters. Here, in a neutral country, we followed the
events of the war worldwide, even in discussion groups in the classes. These
college years in Schiers were of significance for my career. <BR>
<BR>
The school was liberal in the spirit of the nineteenth century, and intellectually
quite demanding. We were also very active in sports, I especially so in
alpine skiing. In my spare time, I became quite involved in building radios
and was so fascinated that I really wanted to become an electrical engineer.
However, in view of my abilities, my chemistry tutor, Dr. Saurer, eventually
convinced me to study physics. <BR>
<BR>
At the age of 19, I did my basic military training in the Swiss army. Upon
its completion, I enrolled in the famous Physics and Mathematics Department
of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Z&uuml;rich. Our freshman
group was more than three times the normal size. We were called the &quot;atombomb
semester&quot;, as just prior to our enrollment nuclear weapons had been
used for the first time, and many students had become interested in nuclear
physics. The basic course was taught by Paul Scherrer and his vivid demonstrations
had a lasting effect on my approach to physics. Other courses were in part
not as illuminating, so that, despite good grades, I once seriously considered
switching to electrical engineering. However, Dr. W. Kanzig, responsible
for the advanced physics practicum, convinced me to continue. In the later
semesters, <A HREF="physics-1945.html">Wolfgang Pauli</A>, whose courses and examinations I took, formed
and impressed me. He was truly a wise man with a deep understanding of nature
and the human being. I did my diploma work under Prof. G. Busch on the Hall
effect of grey tin, now known as a semimetal, and, prompted by his fine
lectures, also became acquainted with modern solid-state physics. <BR>
<BR>
After obtaining my diploma, following my interest in applications, I worked
for one year in the Department of Industrial Research (AFIF) of the ETH
on the Eidophor large-scale display system. Then I returned to Prof. Busch's
group as an assistant and started my thesis on paramagnetic resonance (EPR).
At one point, Dr. H. Granicher suggested I look into the, at that time,
newly synthesized double-oxide SrTiO<SUB>3</SUB>. I found and identified the EPR lines
of impurity present in Fe<SUP>3+</SUP>. <BR>
<BR>
In spring of 1956, just before starting the latter work, Ingeborg Marie
Louise Winkler became my wife. She has always had a substantial influence
in giving me confidence in all my undertakings, and over the past 30 years
has been my mentor and good companion, always showing interest in my work.
Our son Eric, now a dentist, was born in the summer of 1957, six months
before I submitted my thesis. <BR>
<BR>
After my graduation in 1958, I accepted the offer of the Battelle Memorial
Institute in Geneva to join the staff. I soon became the manager of a magnetic
resonance group. Some of the more interesting investigations were conducted
on layered compounds, especially on radiation damage in graphite and alkalimetal
graphites. The general manager in Geneva, Dr. H. Thiemann, had a strong
personality, and his ever-repeated words &quot;one should look for the extraordinary&quot;
made a lasting impression on me. Our stay in Geneva was most enjoyable for
the family, especially for two reasons: the charm of the city and the birth
of our daughter Silvia, now a kindergarten teacher. <BR>
<BR>
While in Geneva, I became a Lecturer (with the title of Professor in 1970)
at the University of Z&uuml;rich on the recommendation of Prof. E. Brun, who
was forming a strong NMR group. Owing to this lectureship, Prof. A. P. Speiser,
on the suggestion of Dr. B. Luthi, offered me a position as a research staff
member at the IBM Z&uuml;rich Research Laboratory, R&uuml;schlikon, in 1963. With
the exception of an almost two-year assignment, which Dr. J. Armstrong invited
me to spend at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights,
N.Y., I have been here ever since. For almost 15 years, research on SrTiO<SUB>3</SUB>
and related perovskite compounds absorbed my interest: this work, performed
with Walter Berlinger, concerned the photochromic properties of various
doped transition-metal ions and their chemical binding, ferroelectric and
soft-mode properties, and later especially critical and multicritical phenomena
of structural phase transitions. In parallel, Dr. Heinrich Rohrer was studying
such effects in the antiferromagnetic system of GdAlO<SUB>3</SUB>. It was an intense
and also, from a personal point of view, happy and satisfying time. While
I was on sabbatical leave at the Research Center, he and <A HREF="physics-1986.html">Dr. Gerd Binnig</A>
started the Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) project. Just before leaving
for the USA, I had been involved in the hiring of Dr. Binnig. Upon my return
to R&uuml;schlikon, I closely followed the great progress of the STM project,
especially as from 1972 onwards, I was in charge of the physics groups.
<BR>
<BR>
The desire to devote more time to my own work prompted me to step down as
manager in 1985. This was possible because in 1982 the company had honored
me with the status of IBM Fellow. The ensuing work is summarized in Georg
Bednorz's part of the Lecture. As he describes there, he joined our Laboratory
to pursue his diploma work, on SrTiO<SUB>3</SUB> of course! Ever since making his acquaintance,
I have deeply respected his fundamental insight into materials, his human
kindness, his working capacity and his tenacity of purpose! <BR>

<BR>
<B>for their development and use of molecules with structure-specific interactions

<H3>Awarded for syntheses of molecules that mimic important biological processes</H3>
<B>Summary</B><BR>
This year's Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded to <B>Donald J. Cram</B>,
USA, <B>Jean-Marie Lehn</B>, France and <B>Charles J. Pedersen</B>, USA
for their development and application of molecules with highly selective
structurespecific interaction, i.e. molecules that can &quot;recognize&quot;
each other and choose with which other molecules they will form complexes.
The laureates have been rewarded for synthesising organic compounds of low
molecular weight and with very special properties. The molecules in these
compounds are designed principally to bind cations (positive ions), but
also anions (negative ions) and neutral-molecules, in a specific and selective
manner. The three researchers have studied chemical and physical properties
of these complexes and have elucidated the factors that determine the ability
of the molecules to recognize each other and fit into one another like a
key fits a lock.<BR>
<BR>
Molecules have been produced that mimic the mode of action of enzymes. The
laureates' research has been of great importance for developments within
coordination chemistry, organic synthesis, analytical chemistry and bioorganic
and bioinorganic chemistry, and has thus laid the foundation for the active
interdisciplinary area of research within chemistry that has now come to
be termed host-guest chemistry or supramolecular chemistry.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Background Information<BR>
</B>At the basis of many biological processes lies the ability of molecules
to recognize each other and to form well-defined complexes. Well-known examples
are substrates bound to enzymes, signal substances bound to receptors, antibodies
bound to antigens and metal ions bound to ionophores. In most cases, one
or more compounds of low molecular weight bind to a specific region in a
high-molecular-weight compound, most often a protein or a nucleic acid.
The binding is very specific and selective and the low molecular-weight
compound must fit the high like a key in a lock.<BR>
<BR>
Inorganic chemists have long dreamed of synthesising relatively uncomplicated
organic compounds that perform the same functions as natural proteins. Great
progress towards this goal has been made over the last 20 years, and it
is the pioneering achievements in this particular area that are now being
recognized.<BR>
<BR>
In 1967, <B>Charles J. Pedersen</B> published two works, which have now
become classics, describing methods of synthesising cyclic polyethers, which
he named crown ethers. Pedersen showed that these compounds have remarkable
and unexpected properties and that they can even bind the alkali metal ions
of lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium and caesium into complexes in which
the lithium ion is the smallest and the caesium ion the largest. He also
found that, depending on the structure of the crown ehter, potassium could
for instance be bound before caesium. Simply expressed, the selectivity
is determined by the fact that different crown ehters include &quot;holes&quot;
of different sizes, into which different spherical metal ions fit.<BR>
<BR>
By building on Pedersen's fundamental discovery, <B>Jean-Marie Lehn</B>
in 1969 developed bycyclic compounds of crown ehter type which he called
cryptands and which show even higher selectivity when forming complexes.<BR>
<BR>
Jean-Marie Lehn and <B>Donald J. Cram</B> have subsequently each developed
increasingly sophisticated organic compounds which when forming complexes
leave fissures and cavities where low-molecular-weight compounds with different
types of geometry can be bound. With this work, Pedersen, Lehn and Cram
laid the foundations of what is today one of the most active and expanding
fields of chemical research, a field for which Cram has coined the term
host-guest chemistry while Lehn calls it supramolecular chemistry.<BR>

<BR>
Cram in particular, using advanced organic-sythetic engineering and molecular
mechanics calculations, has designed completely immobile host molecules
that form particularly strong complexes of extremely high selectivity. Thus,
for example, a host molecule with a 420 000-times-stronger tendency to bind
sodium ions than to bind lithium ions has been synthesised. In addition
to these alkali ions and other metal ions, it has been possible to produce
host molecules that bind organic positive ions (cations such as diazonium
and alkylammonium ions), as well as other host molecules which can bind
small neutral molecules or negative ions (anions such as phosphate ions
and organic carboxylate). Through their detailed investigations of the structures,
physical properties and chemical reactions of the complexes, Lehn and Cram
have increased our understanding of the factors determining the structure-specific
interaction of high selectivity.<BR>
<BR>
These examinations have also contributed to our understanding of ion transport
via biological membranes. Selective cation binding has already found many
applications. Using different types of host molecule it is possible, for
example, to extract radioactive strontium or toxic cadmium and lead ions
without affecting other ions, which is very interesting in terms of protection
of the environment. Such high selectivity has been achieved that it is even
possible to separate isotopes of the same element. Within analytical chemistry,
selective complex formation has led to the development of ion-selective
electrodes and other types of cation sensor. Certain transition metal complexes
also show catalytic activity in photochemical processes, for example the
photochemical decomposition of water to hydrogen, which may be of significance
in energy production.<BR>
<BR>
This formation of complexes is also being applied increasingly in organic
synthesis, not least through Cram's success in producing crown ethers that
help in separating the mirror images of aminoacids.<BR>
<BR>
The goal is to produce synthetic host molecules that recognize biologically
active molecules. Thus Lehn has produced a host molecule for the signal
substance acetylcholine, which is so important in humans and animals.<BR>
<BR>
The explosive development of the art of organic synthesis has enabled Cram
and Lehn to produce hosts that to some extent mimic enzymes such as proteases,
ATP-ases and transacylases (see Fig. 2). Supercomplexes which bind organic
substrates and metal ions have recently been produced by Lehn (see Fig.
3). It will thus be possible to produce supermolecules which do not suffer
from the present limitations on substrate structure and reaction type in,
for example, enzymes. Through their work, Cram, Lehn and Pedersen have shown
the way.<BR>

</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="chemistry-1987-1.gif" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5>The beginning is distant, and was a time when we as a people were without
much of the fruits of science that now refine our lives. But it was also
a good time, when family and town were the domain of our existence. My father
of Scottish, and mother of German extraction, migrated with their three
children from Ontario, Canada, to rural Chester, Vermont, USA, where I was
born in the spring of 1919, as the Cram's fourth and only male child. Two
years later, the family moved to Brattleboro, Vermont. <BR>
<BR>
My mother, Joanna, was high-spirited throughout her 94 years, starting with
a girlhood rebellion against the strict Mennonite faith in which she was
raised. My father, William, was a romantic, a cavalry officer, later working
alternately as a successful lawyer and unsuccessful farmer. He died of pneumonia
at 53, leaving my mother with a set of Victorian upper-class English values,
and the task of providing for and raising my sisters and me, then aged four.
<BR>
<BR>
According to my oldest sister, Elizabeth, I was as a child precocious, curious,
and constantly in, or causing, trouble. This character trait started at
birth; I weighed over ten pounds, and had an unusually large head! Determined
to walk at seven months, I pulled a pan of fresh eggs down from a table
onto that head. At three years, I broke my first window. My father took
me directly to our neighbor, Mr. Mason, to apologize. Reputedly, I said
to him, &quot;Sorry, you nasty Mason&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
By the time I was four and a half, I was reading children's books. My mother,
steeped in English literature, cultivated incentive by reading to me only
the <I>beginnings</I> of tales that involved heroes, heroines, hypocrites,
and villains. When we reached the exciting part, she left me with the story
to finish by myself. My childhood was adventuresome and idyllic in the things
that mattered. <BR>
<BR>
Elementary schooling for me was series of multiclass single-room buildings,
where the young and very young witnessed each other being taught. On report
card days, I faced searching questions and criticism during which &quot;character
grades&quot; were stressed over academic accomplishments. I usually was
marked &quot;A&quot; in attitude and accomplishment, &quot;B&quot; in effort,
and &quot;C&quot; in obedience. <BR>
<BR>
What I call my real <I>education</I> occurred principally outside of the
classroom, in a private world of books and brooks. All of Dickens, Kipling,
Scott, Shaw, and much of Shakespeare were read. I learned how to run up
spring-fed brooks, jumping from one glacier-polished stone to another. I
carried firewood, emptied ashes, and shoveled snow for music lessons. I
picked apples to be paid in apples, strawberries to be paid in strawberries;
and I moved the lawns of a large estate belonging to the dentist who filled
my cavities and pulled my teeth. <BR>
<BR>
The rate of exchange of my time for his was fifty to one. During the Christmas
rush, I sold ties, shirts, shoes, gloves, and jackets in return for the
same. By the time I was fourteen, my mother's barter arrangements were replaced
by a flat fee of 15 cents an hour working for neighbors, raking leaves,
hoeing corn, digging potatoes, pitching hay, and delivering newspapers.
The last job taught me about debts, dogs, and bicycle bags. <BR>
<BR>
At sixteen, I left my home in Brattleboro, Vermont, a handsome old town
on the Connecticut River. By then I had learned how to adapt to eighteen
different employers, and had played high school varsity tennis, football,
and ice hockey. I also had my full growth of 195 pounds, and was 6 feet
tall. <BR>
My family dispersed at that time, and I drove two elderly ladies to Florida
in a Model-A Ford, without benefit of a license, and in return for transportation.
Stopping at Lake Worth, Florida, I worked in an ice-cream shop and weeded
lawns in return for room and board. There, I continued my secondary schooling
while suffering an acute case of homesickness for New England. Nine months
later, I hitchhiked north again to Massachusetts, and passed the summer
as a house painter and roofer. My twelfth grade was spent at Winwood, a
little private school on Long Island, New York, working as a factotum for
my tuition and board. While there, I did three things significant to my
future. I took a course in chemistry, taught myself solid geometry from
a book, and won a $6,000 four-year National Rollins College Honor Scholarship.
<BR>
<BR>
While at Rollins, in the resort town of Winter Park, Florida, I worked at
chemistry and played at philosophy (four courses!). I read Dostoevski, Spengler,
and Tolstoy, and sang in the choir and in a barbershop quartet. In four
halcyon years, I obtained an airplane pilot's license, acted in plays, produced-announced
a minor radio program, and, while my fellow students complained, dined on
the best food I had yet encountered. <BR>
<BR>
During the summers of 1938 to 1941, I worked for the National Biscuit Company
in New York City, at first as a salesman covering an area from 144th Street
to 78th Street on the tough East Side. The largest city in the country was
also its best teacher. This was my first exposure to ghetto slums, youth
gang warfare, drugs, prostitution, and petty thievery. The northern end
of my territory was dominated by Jewish delicatessens, out of which at first
(but not later) I was urged to leave. I got to know everybody, and everybody's
business. In the Irish-run grocery stores, we would conduct &quot;wakes&quot;
for the last fig bar in the bin. Harlem was a place where each street was
a playground, and each store a small fort. The Puerto Rican district was
full of street vendors of all sorts. I started that summer weighing 195
pounds, and ended it at 155. My $ 15 per week provided me with cash, and
a crash course in ethnic groups and big city street-life. The other summers
involved analyzing cheeses for moisture and fat content in the National
Biscuit Laboratories. <BR>
<BR>
From these routine jobs, I extracted pleasure by making them into games.
They taught me self-discipline, and illustrated how I did not want to spend
my life. But this period provided me with a keen interest in the differences
between people, and an overwhelming dislike of repetitive activities. When
the word &quot;research&quot; entered my vocabulary, it had a magic ring,
suggesting the search for new phenomena. Chemical research became my god,
and the conducting of it, my act of prayer, from 1938 to the present. When
told by my first college chemistry professor, Dr. Guy Waddington, that he
thought I would make a good industrial investigator - but probably not a
good academic one - I determined upon an academic research career in chemistry.
<BR>
<BR>
Out of 17 applications for teaching assistantships to go to graduate school,
three offers came. I accepted the University of Nebraska's, where an MS
was granted in 1942. My thesis research there was done under the supervision
of Dr. Norman O. Cromwell. By then, World War II was upon us, so I went
to work for Merck &amp; Co., ultimately on their penicillin project, where
my search for excellence was symbolized by Dr. Max Tishler. Immediately
after the war ended in 1945, Max arranged for me to attend Harvard University,
working for Professor L. F. Fieser. The work for my Ph.D. degree on a National
Research Council Fellowship was in hand in eighteen months. <BR>
<BR>
At Harvard, scientific excellence was personified for me by Professors Paul
D. Bartlett and Robert B. Woodward. After three months at M.I.T., working
for Professor John D. Roberts, I set out for the University of California
at Los Angeles on August 1, 1947, and have taught and researched there ever
since, after 1985 as the S. Winstein Professor of Chemistry. <BR>
<BR>
In retrospect, I judge that my father's death early in my life forced me
to construct a model for my character composed of pieces taken from many
different individuals, some being people I studied, and others lifted from
books. The late Professor Saul Winstein, my colleague, friend, and competitor,
contributed much to this model. It was almost complete by the time I was
35 years of age. Thus, through the early death of my father, I had an opportunity
- indeed the necessity - to animate that father image that was slowly maturing
in my mind's eye. And, at last, I realized who in fact this figure was.
It was I. <BR>
<BR>
The times and environment have been very good to me during my forty-six
years of chemical research. I entered the profession at a period when physical,
organic, and biochemistry were being integrated, when new spectroscopic
windows on chemical structures were being opened, and when UCLA, a fine
new university campus, was growing from a provincial to a world-class institution.
My over 200 co-workers have shared with me the miseries of many failures
and the pleasures of some triumphs. Their careers are my finest monument.
My countrymen have supported our research without mandating its character.
Jean Turner Cram, as my first wife, sacrificed for my career from 1940 to
1968. Dr. Jane Maxwell Cram, my second wife, acted as foil, unsparing but
inspiring critic and research strategist in ways beyond mention. <BR>
<BR>
My fellow scientists have generously honored my research program with three
American Chemical Society awards: for Creative Work in Synthetic Organic
Chemistry; the Arthur C. Cope Award for Distinguished Achievement in Organic
Chemistry; and the Roger Adams Award in Organic Chemistry. Local sections
of the same society awarded me the Willard Gibbs and Tolman Medals. I was
elected to membership in the National Academy of Science (1961), to become
the 1974 California Scientist of the Year, and the 1976 Chemistry Lecturer
and Medalist of the Royal Institute of Chemistry (UK). In 1977, I was given
an Honorary Doctor's degree from Sweden's Uppsala University, and in 1983
a similar one from the University of Southern California. <BR>
<BR>
I have contributed directly to the teaching of organic chemistry-about 12,000
undergraduate students-and, indirectly, by writing three textbooks: Organic
Chemistry (with G. S. Hammond; translated into twelve languages), Elements
of Organic Chemistry (with D. H. Richards and G. S. Hammond; three translations),
and Essence of Organic Chemistry (with J. M. Cram; one translation), plus
the monograph, &quot;Fundamentals of Carbanion Chemistry&quot; (one translation).
I enjoy skiing and surfboarding, playing tennis, and playing the guitar
as an accompaniment to my singing folk songs. The award of a Nobel Prize
at the age of 68 years was ideally timed to enhance rather than divert my
research career. <BR>
<BR>
In the four years that have elapsed since I shared a Nobel Prize in Chemistry
(1987), the effect of receiving this honor on my life has been profound.
Most importantly, the Prize has extended my career by enough years to allow
me to obtain the most exciting results of my 50 years of carrying out research.
The Prize has also broadened the range of my experiences, most of which
have been both interesting and educational. Finally, the research field
of molecular recognition in organic chemistry gained much impetus by being
recognized by the Nobel Prize. I am grateful that our research results were
chosen as a vehicle for honoring those who know the joys of carrying out
organic chemical research. <BR>

<H2><CENTER>JEAN-MARIE LEHN </CENTER>
</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="chemistry-1987-2.gif" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5>I was born on September 30 1939 in Rosheim, a small medieval city of Alsace
in France. My father, Pierre Lehn, then a baker, was very interested in
music, played the piano and the organ and became later, having given up
the bakery, the organist of the city. My mother Marie kept the house and
the shop. I was the eldest of four sons and helped out in the shop with
my first brother. I grew up in Rosheim during the years of the second world
war, went to primary school after the war and, at age eleven, I entered
high school, the Coll&egrave;ge Freppel, located in Obernai, a small city
about five kilometers from Rosheim. During these years I began to play the
piano and the organ, and with time music has become my major interest outside
science. My high school studies from 1950 to 1957 were in classics, with
latin, greek, german, and english languages, french literature and, during
the last year, philosophy, on which I was especially keen. However, I also
became interested in sciences, especially chemistry, so that I obtained
the baccalaureat in Philosophy in duly 1957 and in Experimental Sciences
in September of the same year. <BR>
<BR>
I envisaged to study philosophy at the University of Strasbourg, but being
still undecided, I began with first year courses in physical, chemical and
natural sciences (SPCN). During this year 1957/58, I was impressed by the
coherent and rigorous structure of organic chemistry. I was particularly
receptive to the experimental power of organic chemistry, which was able
to convert at will, it seemed, complicated substances into one another following
well defined rules and routes. I bought myself compounds and glassware and
began performing laboratory practice experiments at my parents home. The
seed was sown, so that when, the next year, I followed the stimulating lectures
of a newly appointed young professor, Guy Ourisson, it became clear to me
that I wanted to do research in organic chemistry. <BR>
<BR>
After having obtained the degree of Licenci&eacute;-&egrave;s-Sciences (Bachelor),
I entered Ourisson's laboratory in October of 1960, as a junior member of
the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in order to work towards
a Ph.D. degree. This was the first decisive stage of my training. My work
was concerned with conformational and physico-chemical properties of triterpenes.
Being in charge of our first NMR spectrometer, I was led to penetrate more
deeply into the arcanes of this very powerful physical method; this was
to be of much importance for later studies. My first scientific paper in
1961 reported an additivity rule for substituent induced shifts of proton
NMR signals in steroid derivatives. <BR>
<BR>
Having obtained my degree of Docteur &egrave;s Sciences (Ph.D.) in June
of 1963, I spent a year in the laboratory of <A HREF="chemistry-1965.html">Robert
Burns Woodward</A> at Harvard University, where I took part in the immense
enterprise of the total synthesis of Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. This was the
second decisive stage of my life as a researcher. I also followed a course
in quantum mechanics and performed my first computations with <A HREF="chemistry-1981.html">Roald
Hoffmann</A>. I had the chance to witness in 1964 the initial stages of
what was to become the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. <BR>
<BR>
After my return to Strasbourg, I began to work in the area of physical organic
chemistry, where I could combine the knowledge acquired in organic chemistry,
in quantum theory and on physical methods. It was clear that, in order to
be able to better analyze physical properties of molecules, a powerful means
was to synthesize compounds that would be especially well suited for revealing
a given property and its relationships to structure. This orientation characterized
the years 1965- 1970 of my activities and of my young laboratory, newly
established after my appointment in 1966 as ma&icirc;tre de conf&eacute;rences
(assistant professor) at the Chemistry Department of the Univerity of Strasbourg.
Our main research topics were concerned with NMR studies of conformational
rate processes, nitrogen inversion, quadrupolar relaxation, molecular motions
and liquid structure, as well as ab initio quantum chemical computations
of inversion barriers, of electronic structures and later on, of stereoelectronic
effects. <BR>
<BR>
While pursuing these projects, my interest for the processes occurring in
the nervous system (stemming diffusely from the first year courses in biology
as well as from my earlier inclination towards philosophy), led me to wonder
how a chemist might contribute to their study. The electrical phenomena
in nerve cells depend on sodium and potassium ion distributions across membranes.
A possible entry into the field was to try to affect the processes which
allow ion transport and gradients to be established. I related this to the
then very recent observations that natural antibiotics were able to make
membranes permeable to cations. It thus appeared possible to devise chemical
substances that would display similar properties. The search for such compounds
led to the design of cation cryptates, on which work was started in October
1967. This area of research expanded rapidly, taking up eventually the major
part of my group and developing into what I later on termed &quot;supramolecular
chemistry&quot;. Organic, inorganic and biological aspects of this field
were explored and investigations are continuing. In 1976 another line of
research was started in the area of artificial photosynthesis and the storage
and chemical conversion of solar energy; it was first concerned with the
photoly is of water and later with the photoreduction of carbon dioxide.
<BR>
<BR>
I was promoted associate professor in early 1970 and full professor in October
of the same year. I spent the two spring semesters of 1972 and 1974 as visiting
professor at Harvard University giving lectures and directing a research
project. This relationship extended on a loose basis to 1980. In 1979, I
was elected to the chair of &quot;Chimie des Interactions Mol&eacute;culaires&quot;
at the Coll&egrave;ge de France in Paris. I took over the chemistry laboratory
of the Coll&egrave;ge de France when Alain Horeau retired in 1980 and thereafter
divided my time between the two laboratories in Strasbourg and in Paris,
a situation continuing up to the present. New lines of research developed,
in particular on combining the recognition, transport and catalytic properties
displayed by supramolecular species with the features of organized phases,
the long range goal being to design and realize &quot;molecular devices&quot;,
molecular components that would eventually be able to perform signal and
information processing at the molecular level. A major research effort is
presently also devoted to supramolecular self-organisation, the design and
properties of &quot;programmed&quot; supramolecular systems. <BR>
<BR>
The scientific work, performed over twenty years with about 150 collaborators
from over twenty countries, has been described in about 400 publications
and review papers. Over the years I was visiting professor at other institutions,
the E.T.H. in Z&uuml;rich, the Universities of Cambridge, Barcelona, Frankfurt.
<BR>
<BR>
In 1965 I married Sylvie Lederer and we have two sons, David (born 1966)
and Mathias (born 1969). <BR>

<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="chemistry-1987-3.gif" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5>I was born in Fusan, Korea, on October 3, 1904. My father Brede Pedersen,
was a Norwegian marine engineer who left home as a young man and shipped
out as an engineer on a steam freighter to the Far East. He eventually arrived
in Korea and joined the fleet of the Korean customs service, which was administered
by the British. Later, he abandoned seafaring and became a mechanical engineer
at the Unsan Mines in what is now the northwestern section of present-day
North Korea. <BR>
<BR>
My mother, Takino Yasui, was born in 1874 in Japan. She had accompanied
her family to Korea when they decided to enter large-scale trade in soybeans
and silkworms. They established headquarters not far from the Unsan Mines,
where she met my father. I had a sister, Astrid, five years my senior, and
an elder brother who died in childhood prior to my birth. <BR>
<BR>
The Unsan Mines were an American gold and lumber concession, 500 square
miles in area. Because the mines were administered by Americans, there was
an effort to make life there as American as possible. English was the spoken
language, and it was the language I learned as a child. Foreign language
schools did not exist in Korea at that time and so at the age of 8 years
I was sent to Japan to attend a convent school in Nagasaki. When I was 10
years old my mother took me to Yokohama, and I began my studies at St. Joseph
College. St. Joseph's was a preparatory school run by a Roman Catholic religious
order of priests and brothers called the Society of Mary, also known as
the Marianists. There I received a general secondary education and took
my first course in chemistry. <BR>
<BR>
When it came time for university, I chose, with my father's encouragement,
to study in America. I selected the University of Dayton because it was
in Ohio were we had family and friends and because it too was run by the
Society of Mary. After taking a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering
at the University of Dayton, I went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
where I obtained a master's degree in organic chemistry. I did not remain
at MIT to take a Ph.D.; I was still being supported by my father, and I
was anxious to begin working. In 1927, I obtained employment at the Du Pont
Company in Wilmington, Delaware, through the good offices of Professor James
F. Norris, a very prominent professor and my research advisor. At Du Pont,
I was fortunate enough to be directed to research at Jackson Laboratory
by William S. Calcott. I remained at Du Pont for my entire 42-year career
as a chemist. <BR>
<BR>
As a new scientist I was initially set to work on a series of typical problems,
which I solved successfully. After a while, I began to search for oil-solvable
precipitants for copper, and I found the first good metal deactivator for
petroleum products. As a result of this work, I developed a great interest
in the affects of various ligands on the catalytic properties of copper
and the transition elements generally and worked in the field for several
years. <BR>
<BR>
I next expanded my interests in the oxidative degradation of the substrates
I was working on, namely petroleum products and rubber. By the mid-1940s
I was in full career, having established myself in the field of antioxidants
and independent in terms of the problems I might choose. In 1947, I was
appointed research associate, then the highest title that a Du Pont Company
researcher could attain. Also at that time, I married Susan Ault and settled
in the town of Salem, New Jersey, where I have lived ever since. <BR>
<BR>
During the late '40s and '50s my scientific interests became more varied.
I became interested in the photochemistry of some new phthalocyanine adducts
and of quinoneimine dioxides. I developed polymerization initiators and
even made some novel polymers. In 1960 I returned to investigations in coordination
chemistry, and decided to study the effects of bi- and multidentate phenolic
ligands on the catalytic properties of the vanadyl group, VO. In the course
of these investigations one of my experiments yielded an unexpected small
quantity of unknown white crystals which I eventually identified as dibenzo18-crown-6,
first crown ether. The last nine years of my career were spent in the further
study of crown ethers. I retired from Du Pont in 1969. During my retirement,
I have pursued interests in fishing, gardening, bird study and poetry. <BR>

Press Release: The 1987 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</H3>
<H4>NOBELF&Ouml;RSAMLINGEN KAROLINSKA INSTITUTET<BR>
THE NOBEL ASSEMBLY AT THE KAROLINSKA INSTITUTE</H4>
12 October 1987<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="/mednobel/assembly.html">The Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska 
Institute</A>
has today decided to award the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for
1987 to <BR>
<BR>
<B>Susumu Tonegawa</B><BR>
<BR>
for his discovery of &quot;the genetic principle for generation of antibody
diversity&quot;. <BR>
<B><BR>
Summary</B><BR>
<BR>
Man is surrounded by viruses, bacteria and other microorganisms which constitute
a threat to life and health. When these contagious agents enter the body
they are recognized and attacked by the immune defence. Important tools
in the recognition of this large variety of intruders are the <I>antibodies</I>.
They are produced by white blood cells called B lymphocytes. The parts of
the microorganisms against which antibodies react are called antigens. The
number of different antigens that the body may encounter is enormous. We
are dealing with hundreds of millions of substances, all of them with their
specific structure. Strangely enough our immune defense have at hand antibodies
which can identify all these molecules and start to counter attack - that
is, hundreds of millions of <I>different</I> antibodies which are ready
in the body already in advance before they have seen the antigen against
which they can react!<BR>
<BR>
This fabulous capacity to vary of antibodies is known since a couple of
decades. The genetic background allowing this variation has, however, been
an unsolved puzzle. The structure of the antibodies is determined by genes
but as the human genome only contains about 100 000 genes it seemed unreasonable
that they could allow the production of maybe a billion different antibodies.
<BR>
<BR>
The man who explained this mystery is the Japanese Scientist <B>Susumu Tonegawa</B>.
In a pioneering study published in 1976 Tonegawa could through a series
of ingenious experiments show how parts of the genome of the cell (DNA)
is redistributed under its differentiation from an embryonic cell to an
antibody producing B lymphocyte. During the following two years Tonegawa
completely dominated this area of research. He could in increasingly greater
detail clarify how those parts of the genome which gives rise to antibody
are moved around in order allow each B lymphocyte to produce its own unique
antibody. <BR>
<BR>
Tonegawas discoveries have increased our knowledge about structure of our
immune defense. They also open up possibilities to increase the immune response
against pathogenic microorganism through vaccination - and also to improve
inhibition of unwanted immune reactions. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The antibody, a molecule with many faces</B><BR>
<BR>
The antibody is a protein where the building stones - amino acids normally
form four chains. Two of these chains (polypeptides) are long and identical.
The other two are short and are likewise identical. Together the four polypeptide
chains form a Y-like symmetric molecule (Figure 1). <BR>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="medicine-1987-press-1.gif" WIDTH="451" HEIGHT="353"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P><B>Figure 1</B>. A picture of an antibody molecule with two long (T)
and two short (L) polypeptide chains which are kept together by sulphur
bridges (-S-S). The variable parts of a long chain (V,D, and J) and a light
chain (Y and J) together form the antigen binding area of the antibody.
<BR>
<BR>
In man there are five different types of long chains which have been given
letters M, D, G, A and E. The naming of the long chains forms the bases
for the names of the five so called <I>immunoglobulin</I> <I>classes</I>:
IgM, IgD, IgG and so on. The short chains are of two types: kappa or lambda.
Each antibody molecule has - regardless of class - either two kappa or two
lambda chains. <BR>
<BR>
Towards the base of the Y there it is a <I>constant part</I> where the sequence
of amino acids is the same in all antibodies belonging to the same class.
In the outer ends of the two arms of the Y, however, there exist a significant
variation in the amino acid sequence when comparing different antibodies.
In this <I>variable part</I> there are three areas where variation is very
large. These areas constitute the walls in a &quot;pocket&quot; where the
foreign substance, the antigen, will fit and can bind. You can make the
analogy of an antibody molecule with a lobster where the claws of the lobster
correspond to the antigen binding parts of the antibody. <BR>
<BR>
Through its Y-form the antibody accordingly is endow two identical antigen
binding areas. These areas have a more or less good fit to a particular
antigen. The better the fit the harder to grip of the antigen and the more
efficient the defense. As we are continuously confronted within an enormous
variety of antigens we also have to have a large number of molecules there
the variable parts do fit to different antigens. <BR>
<BR>
The constant part of the antibody does also contain important biological
functions. After the binding of the antibody to an antigen on the surface
on for example a virus (Figure 2) the antibody molecule is changed in such
a way that its constant part will activate important parts of the immune
defense. Among these is the complement system which can directly make holes
in bacteria and other microorganism and which also attract white blood cells
such as macrophages (&quot;big eaters&quot;) and granulocytes to the battle
ground. <BR>

<P><B>Figure 2</B>. A polio virus particle is attacked by four IgG antibodies.
Through this attack the infectious capacity of the virus is destroyed. It
is mainly through this mechanism that polio vaccine is functioning. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The richness of variety, an equation which didn't add up</B><BR>
<BR>
Antibodies are produced by a special kind of white blood cells which are
called B lymphocytes and which in an adult human being amounts to one million
million cells (10<SUP>12</SUP>). As a single B lymphocyte only can produce
its own unique antibody the number of different antibodies in an individual
can theoretically not exceed that of the number of B lymphocytes. <BR>
<BR>
The information how antibodies should be constructed lies in the genome
of the B lymphocytes. One hypothesis suggested, that in this genome there
exist <I>one</I> gene responsible for each type of polypeptide chain in
the antibody. But here the problem was that the immune defense contains
hundreds of thousands times more different antibody types than there are
total number of genes in the B cells. The equation simply didn't add up
and the hypothesis had to be abandoned. It was replaced by a second one
which explained the almost limitless capacity of variation in antibodies
as a result of some changes in the DNA of the B cell during the development
of the individual. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Susumu Tonegawa</B> was the one who finally answered the question how
the gene material in B cells could suffice to create the structures of a
seemingly endless number of different antibodies. In 1976 he could in a
convincing and elegant manner show how different immunoglobulin genes which
were far apart in the embryonic cell in the B lymphocyte had been moved
in closer contact. Under development from the germ cells (the sperm and
egg cell) to an antibody producing B lymphocyte the genes forming the immunoglobulins
had accordingly been redistributed. In subsequent experiment Tonegawa could
clarify how different pieces of the genome were moved around, recombined
and even could be &quot;lost&quot; to finally give rise to the DNA which
is found in the mature B lymphocyte. <BR>
<BR>
In the human the genes for the long chains are present on chromosome 14,
for the kappa chains on chromosome 2 and for the lambda chains on chromosome
22. Thanks to Tonegawa's pioneering work we now know how many immunoglobulin
genes there are in man, how they are put together and how they can give
rise to this high number of different antibodies. <BR>

<P><B>Figure 3</B>. Redistribution of immunoglobulin genes for the long
chain during the development from an embryonic cell (top) to an antibody
producing B lymphocyte (bottom). Genes from each group V, D and J are brought
together in the final form for functioning gene for the variable part of
the long chain of an antibody molecule. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Economy through waste</B><BR>
<BR>
Today we know that three groups of genes participate in the creation of
the variable part of the long chain, that is the part which together with
the variable part of the short chain is specific for each antibody. These
genes have the names V, D and J (Figure 3). The short chain has V and J
genes. In man the number of different Y genes for the long chains are around
200 to which should be added about 20 D genes and 4 J genes. When the functioning
gene of an antibody is to be created a single V, D and J gene are drawn
at random from the three groups of genes. The process can be compared to
a numbers lottery (Figure 4). 200 x 20 x 4 will give rise to 16 000 different
variable parts. <BR>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="medicine-1987-press-4.gif" WIDTH="352" HEIGHT="121"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P><B>Figure 4</B>. A registration sign for a car with its unique registration
number produced through lottery can illustrate the process which leads to
the creation of a unique antibody molecule. This registration number stands
for Susumu Tonegawa, the 144th Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine.
<BR>
<BR>
V, D and J are put together in an irregular manner which will further enhance
the richness of variation. And as the V and D genes often are different
when inherited from our father and mother this will mean that already here
possibility has been created for something like five million different forms
of the variable part of the long chain. On top of this the light chain contributes
with more than 10 000 variants. The final sum will be many billions possibilities
of variation. <BR>
<BR>
We are accordingly well prepared for an encounter with any possible antigen.
It is likely that normally only a minor part of the antibody variance will
ever be put into usage. The immune system is extremely economic when using
the DNA of the individual. At the same time a large number of lymphocytes
are produced and only a few of these will ever have to participate in the
immune defense of the body. The economy in the usage of DNA is thus combined
with a seeming waste of cells. This is, however, necessary to maintain the
high state of alertness which is required against possible new infections.
<BR>
<BR>
The discoveries of Tonegawa explain the genetic background allowing the
enormous richness of variation amongst antibodies. Beyond deeper knowledge
of the basic structure of the immune system these discoveries will have
importance in improving immunological therapy of different kinds, such as
for instance the enforcement of vaccinations and inhibition of reactions
during transplantation. Another area of importance are those diseases where
the immune defense of the individual now attack the bodies own tissues,
the so called autoimmune diseases. <BR>

<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="medicine-1987-1.gif" WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=198 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5>I was born in Nagoya, Japan on September 6th, 1939, the second of three
sons. I have also a younger sister. My father was an engineer working for
a textile company that had several factories scattered in rural towns in
the southern part of Japan. The company policy made it necessary for my
father to move from one factory to another every few years. I and my brothers
and sister spent most of our childhood in these small provincial towns,
enjoying the space and freedom of the countryside. As my elder brother and
I reached adolescence, however, my parents decided to send us to Tokyo so
that we could receive a better education. <BR>
<BR>
I commuted to the prestigious Hibiya high school from my Uncle's home in
Tokyo. During the high school years I developed an interest in chemistry,
so upon graduation, I chose to take an entrance examination for the Department
of Chemistry of the <A 
HREF="http://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/English">University of 
Kyoto</A>, the old capital of Japan. After
having failed once, I was admitted to this University in 1959. This happened
to be one year before the first ten-year term of the defence treaty between
Japan and the United States expired and the governments of both countries
were preparing for a second ten-year term. <BR>
<BR>
The nation was deeply divided between the pragmatic pro-American conservatives
and the idealistic anti-military leftists. Being the home of the most radical
leftist student groups, classes at Kyoto University were often cancelled
due to frequent political discussions and demonstrations on the streets.
I was only a passive participant, withdrawn from the turmoil, but could
not help having a feeling of defeat shared with many of my classmates when
the treaty was finally extended for the next ten-year term. I believe that
this experience might have been a major factor in making me give up the
original goal of becoming a chemical engineer to pursue the academic life.
<BR>
<BR>
I became fascinated by the then blossoming science of molecular biology
when in my senior year I happened to read the papers by <A HREF="medicine-1965.html">Fran&ccedil;ois
Jacob and Jacques Monod</A> on the operon theory. I decided to pursue graduate
study in molecular biology and was accepted by Professor Itaru Watanabe's
laboratory at the Institute for Virus Research at the University of Kyoto,
one of a few laboratories in Japan where U.S.-trained molecular biologists
were actively engaged in research. However, only two months after I started
my work in his laboratory, Professor Watanabe called me into his office
and suggested that I carry out my graduate study in the United States. He
explained how inadequate the graduate training programs in molecular biology
laboratories were in Japan, including his own, and offered to help in my
application to some major universities in the United States, if I would
seriously consider studying abroad. <BR>
<BR>
At that time, it was a common career development for a Japanese molecular
biologist to go to the United States for a few years of postdoctoral study
after obtaining the Ph.D. in Japan. I already had a vague wish to follow
that pattern. Professor Watanabe's advice to enroll in an American graduate
school therefore came to me as a bit of a surprise, but I was excited by
the idea and accepted his help immediately. I cannot thank Professor Watanabe
enough for this critical suggestion in the early phase of my scientific
career. <BR>
<BR>
With the additional help of Dr. Takashi Yura, then an assistant professor
in Watanabe's laboratory, I was admitted to the graduate school of the Department
of Biology of the <A HREF="http://www.ucsd.edu">University of 
California</A> at San Diego that had recently
been established by Professor David Bonner in La Jolla, the beautiful southern
Californian town near the Mexican border. <BR>
<BR>
At UCDS I studied in the laboratory of Professor Masaki Hayashi, carrying
out a thesis project on the transcriptional control of phage lambda and
received my Ph.D. in molecular biology in 1978. I remained in Professor
Hayashi's laboratory as a postdoctoral fellow working on the morphogenesis
of a phage, &Oslash;X174, until early 1979. Then I moved, also as a postdoctoral
fellow, across the street to the laboratory of Dr. <A HREF="medicine-1975.html">Renato
Dulbecco</A> at the Salk Institute. <BR>
<BR>
Like many others, I believed that the golden age of prokaryotic molecular
biology was coming to an end and that the great excitement would be in higher
organisms. However, the complexity of high organisms was baffling and the
necessary tools seemed hopelessly insufficient. Small tumor viruses like
polyoma and simian virus 40, the biological material primarily dealt with
in Dulbecco's laboratory, seemed to offer a bridge for the gap between prokaryotes
and eukaryotes. Indeed Dulbecco's laboratory was filled with first-class
postdoctoral fellows from around the world, who were trained in prokaryotic
molecular biology and who came there intending to expand their research
into eukaryotic molecular biology. <BR>
<BR>
My project was to define the transcripts of SV40 during lytic infection
and in transformed cells. Since this was the pre-restriction enzyme and
pre-recombinant DNA age, the information I could obtain was very limited.
However, being a member of the best laboratory in the field I glimpsed the
excitement of the cutting edge of scientific research. Furthermore, I very
much enjoyed the free and stimulating atmosphere of the laboratory. Unfortunately,
as an awardee of a Fulbright travel grant, my U.S. visa was to expire by
the end of 1970 and I had to leave the country for at least two years before
I was eligible for another U.S. visa. <BR>
<BR>
I had two or three job possibilities outside of the United States, but none
were particularly interesting. In the autumn of 1970, only a few months
before my visa was to expire I received a letter from Renato Dulbecco who
was travelling in Europe. Renato mentioned the newly established Basel Institute
for Immunology in Basel, Switzerland, and suggested that the time might
be ripe for a molecular biologist to tackle immunological problems. I had
very little knowledge of immunology, but decided to take Dr. Dulbecco's
advice and sent an application letter to the Director of the Institute,
Professor <A HREF="medicine-1984.html">Niels Kaj Jerne</A>, who offered
me a two-year contract. <BR>
<BR>
In the winter of 1971, I thus found myself surrounded by immunologists in
this small town located in the middle of Europe. I must admit that the first
year in the Institute was not easy for me. I had a continuing interest in
work on SV40, but I was also keenly aware that I would not be able to take
much advantage of the circumstances if I isolated myself by pursuing that
subject. I therefore decided to study immunology in the hope of finding
an interesting project.<BR>
<BR>
An immunologist, Dr. Ita Askonas, and a geneticist, Charles Steinberg, were
very helpful to me on my entering the new field. By the end of 1971, I was
introduced to the great debate on the genetic origins of antibody diversity.
I felt from the beginning that I could contribute to resolving this question
by applying the recently invented techniques of molecular biology, namely,
restriction enzymes and recombinant DNA. Initially I worked only with my
skillful technicians, Monica Sh&ouml;ld and Rita Schuller, but was soon
joined by Drs. Nobumichi Hozumi, Minoru Hirama, and Christine Brack. Later,
as my research group expanded, I had the good fortune to work with many
capable postdoctoral fellows and devoted technical assistants. In addition,
Charles Steinberg was a very important collaborator and consultant, particularly
in the initial phase of the research. <BR>
<BR>
Looking back, the research progressed with amazing speed from 1974 to 1981,
the year I left Basel. We all worked hard and had had a great deal of fun.
Our work resolved the long held debate on the genetic origin of antibody
diversity. It turned out that this diversity is generated by somatic recombination
of the inherited gene segments and by somatic mutation. To our very good
fortune, Director Niels Jerne was quick to understand the importance of
our approach and became a staunch supporter of the research in its early
phase. <BR>
<BR>
In the beginning of the 1980's I began to feel that the great mystery of
antibody diversity had been solved, at least in its outlines. I thought
that it might be good to change my environment to launch into a new project.
I also recalled that I had initially come to Switzwerland with the intention
of staying for two years and then returning to the United States. Fortunately,
I received a few offers from the United States and decided in 1981 to take
a professorship at the Center for Cancer Research at <A 
HREF="http://web.mit.edu">M.I.T.</A> Professor <A 
HREF="medicine-1969.html">Salvadore
Luria</A>, Director of the Cancer Center, was extremely helpful, not only
in bringing me to M.I.T., but also in providing me with a beautiful laboratory.
<BR>
<BR>
The research projects on which I had decided concerned two major problems.
One was to investigate the role of somatic rearrangement in the activation
of the rearranged antibody gene, and the second was to extend the research
in Basel to &quot;the other half&quot; of the immune system, namely, to
the antigen receptor of T cells. Fortunately, we could contribute to the
understanding of both problems by discovering a tissue-specific transcriptional
enhancer in the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene and by identifying, cloning,
and sequencing genes coding for the polypeptide subunits of the T cell receptor.
A particularly intriguing development made during the latter study was the
identification of a gene that led to the discovery of a new T cell receptor,
gamma delta. While the function of the T cells bearing this receptor is
currently unknown, data accumulated during the past year in our laboratory
as well as many other laboratories suggest that these T cells may be involved
in an entirely new aspect of immunity. <BR>
<BR>
When I look back on my scientific career to-date, I am amazed at my good
fortune. At every major turn, I met scientists who were not only at the
very top in their own fields, but who also gave me insightful advice and
generous help. I am most grateful to Professors Itaru Watanabe, Renato Dulbecco,
Niels Kaj Jerne, Charles Steinberg, and Salvadore Luria. I also wish to
extend my unending gratitude to many colleagues and technical assistants.
<BR>
<BR>
My parents were firm believers that education is the best asset that parents
can give to their children. I am deeply grateful to them for their outstanding
support of my study and professional career. I am extremely grateful to
my wife, Mayumi, whom I married in September 1985 for her devotion, interest,
encouragement and criticism. I also wish to express my sincere thanks to
my first wife, Kyoko, for her limitless devotion during my days in La Jolla
and Basel. <BR>
<BR>
I have been fortunate enough to receive many professional honors which include:
The Cloetta Prize of Foundation Professor Dr. Max Cloetta, Switzerland (1978),
Warren Triennial Prize of the Massachusetts General Hospital, U.S.A. (1980),
Genetics Grand Prize of Genetics Promotion Foundation, Japan (1981), Avery

Press Release: The Nobel Prize for Literature 1987 </H3>
October 1987
<H3>Joseph Brodsky</H3>
This year's Nobel Prize winner in Literature was born in Leningrad and lives
in New York. Aged<BR>
only 47 he is one of the youngest ever to have been awarded a Nobel Prize
in Literature. A sign of<BR>
the luminous intensity of his writing is that he has already been translated
into more than a dozen<BR>
languages.<BR>
<BR>
Brodsky is chiefly a poet and essayist. He belongs to the classical Russian
tradition with<BR>
predecessors such as Pushkin and the Nobel prizewinner <A HREF="literature-1958.html">Pasternak</A>.
At the same time he is a<BR>
masterly renewer of poetical language and poetical forms of expression,
inspired by Osip<BR>
Mandelstam and Anna Achmatova among others.<BR>
<BR>
Another of Brodsky's sources of inspiration is English poetry from the metaphysicist
John Donne<BR>
to W.H. Auden, he who wanted to be a lesser, atlantic Goethe. That language
is the stuff that<BR>
empires are made of is a vital thought with Brodsky as well.<BR>
<BR>
For Brodsky, poetry is a divine gift. The religious dimension that one meets
in his work is of a<BR>
nature that adheres to no creed. Metaphysical and ethical questions are
paramount.<BR>
<BR>
The east-west background - literary, geographical, linguistic - has greatly
influenced Brodsky's<BR>
writing. It has given it an unusual wealth of themes and manifold perspectives.
Together with the<BR>
writer's profound insight into the literature of earlier epochs it has also
conjured up a grand<BR>
historical vision.<BR>
<BR>
The change of environment and language after Brodsky had left the Soviet
in 1972 naturally<BR>
involved a severe nervous strain for the poet. In the poem 1972 (in the
collection <I>A Part of<BR>
Speech  </I>1980) he depicts how he will gradually lose hair, teeth, consonants,
verbs, and endings.<BR>
Nevertheless he is now engaged on a prolific poetical work in Russian. Parallel
with that he takes<BR>
an active part in the translation of his works into English and sometimes
writes directly in this<BR>
language to great effect <I>History of the Twentieth Century </I>(1986)
is a series of poems in a tone of<BR>
raillery and parody, written with a quite amazing mastery of the English
idiom.<BR>
<BR>
All literature really is about what time does to people, Brodsky has said,
thus indicating a main<BR>
theme in his writing. Parting, becoming deformed, growing old, dying are
the work of time. Poetry<BR>
helps us, gives us basically the only possibility of withstanding the pressure
of existence.<BR>
<BR>
Poetry's role in the world is another central theme. It may apply to totalitarian
societies, in which<BR>
the poet can become the mouthpiece for those who apparently are silent,
or to open societies in<BR>
which his voice threatens to be drowned in the flood of information. In
the brilliant collection of<BR>
essays<I> Less Than One</I>  (1980) Brodsky feels his way in towards the
core of the problem from<BR>
various directions. The poet is a word craftsman, a master of language.
Poetry is the highest form of<BR>
language. Brodsky sees it also as the highest form of life. The poet becomes
an instrument with a<BR>
questioning sound.<BR>
<BR>
The Swedish Academy's citation aims at the great breadth in time and space
which characterizes<BR>
Joseph Brodsky's writing and at both the intellectual and sensitive side
of this rich and intensely<BR>
vital work<BR>

</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="literature-1987-1.gif" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5><B>Joseph Brodsky</B> was born in
1940, in Leningrad, and began writing poetry when he was eighteen. Anna
Akhmatova soon recognized in the young poet the most gifted lyric voice
of his generation. From March 1964 until November 1965, Brodsky lived in
exile in the Arkhangelsk region of northern Russia; he had been sentenced
to five years in exile at hard labor for &quot;social parasitism,&quot;
but did not serve out his term. <BR>
Four of Brodsky's poems were published in Leningrad anthologies in 1966
and 1967, but most of his work has appeared only in the West.     He is
a splendid poetic translator and has translated into Russian, among others,
the English metaphysical poets, and the Polish emigre poet, Czeslaw Milosz.
His own poetry has been translated into at least ten languages. <I>Joseph
Brodsky: Selected Poems</I> was published by Penguin Books in London (1973),
and by Harper &amp; Row in New York (1974), translated by George L. Kline
and with a foreword by W. H. Auden.   A volume of Brodsky's selected poems
translated in French has been published by Gallimard; a German translation,
by Piper Verlag; and an Italian translation, by Mondadori and Adelphi. Farrar,
Straus, and Giroux published Brodsky's acclaimed collection, <I>A Part of
Speech</I>, in 1980. <BR>
On June 4, 1972, Joseph Brodsky became an involuntary exile from his native
country. After brief stays in Vienna and London, he came to the United States.
He has been Poet-in-Residence and Visiting Professor at the University of
Michigan, Queens College, Smith College, Columbia University, and Cambridge
University in England. He currently is Five College Professor of Literature
at Mount Holyoke College. In 1978, Brodsky was awarded an honorary degree
of Doctor of Letters at Yale University, and on May 23, 1979, he was inducted
as a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. In
1981, Brodsky was a recipient of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur
Foundation's award for his works of &quot;genius&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
In 1986, Farrar, Straus, and Giroux published<I> Less Than One</I>, a collection
of Mr. Brodsky's essays on the arts and politics, which won the National
Book Critic's Award for Criticism. <BR><BR>

In the fall/winter of 1988, Farrar, Straus, and Giroux will publish a collection
of his poetry, <I>To Urania.</I> <BR>

<P>
<h3 align="center">The Nobel Peace Prize for 1987</h3>

<A HREF="http://www.nobel.no/indexen.html">The Norwegian Nobel 
Committee</A> has decided
to award the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize to President <B>Oscar Arias Sanchez</B>
of Costa Rica, for his work for peace in Central America, efforts which
led to the accord signed in Guatemala on August 7 this year. <BR>
<BR>
As the main architect of the peace plan, President Arias made an outstanding
contribution to the possible return of stability and peace to a region long
torn by strife and civil war. He thereby carried on the constructive work
begun by the Contadora group. <BR>
<BR>
The Committee attaches importance to the fact that the accord is the result
of responsible cooperation between the five signatory states. As such, it
lays solid foundations for the further development of democracy and for
open cooperation between peoples and states. <BR>
<BR>
A prerequisite for lasting peace is the realization of democratic ideals,
with freedom and equality for all. In the opinion of the Committee, Oscar
Arias is a strong spokesman for those ideals. The importance of his work
for peace will extend beyond Central America. <BR>

</H2>
<IMG SRC="peace-1987-1.gif" ALIGN=left "VSPACE=5" "HSPACE=10"><B>Oscar Arias Sanchez</B> was born in 1941. After studying in the United States, he read law and economics atthe University of Costa Rica in the capital, San Jose. As a student he engaged acti
vely in the work of the National Liberation Party. Having completed
his degree, he went on to take a doctorate in England, with a thesis on
the subject of &quot;<I>Who rules Costa Rica?</I>&quot;. He is the author
of a number of books and articles on political and historical subjects.
<BR>
<BR>
Arias embarked on his political career in earnest in 1970, as assistant
to Jose Figueres, a former President who was again seeking election. When
Figueres was elected in 1972, Arias was given a seat in the government as
Minister of National Planning and Political Economy. In 1975 his party elected
him International Secretary and in 1979, General Secretary. He represented
the party at several Socialist International congresses. <BR>
<BR>
In the1978 elections, when the Christian Social Unity Party won the presidency,
Arias was elected to the Legislative Assembly but withdrew in 1981 to work
for his party's presidential candidate, Luis Alberto Monge, who won in 1982.
Nominated himself in 1985, Arias was elected President in 1986, winning
52.3% of the votes against 45.8% for the Christian Social Unity candidate.
As President, he intervened against the activities of U.S.-backed Contras
on Costa Rican territory. Although critical of the political system in Nicaragua,
Arias has concentrated on engaging Nicaragua and the other Central American
states in a peace-making process. In May 1986, he met the Presidents of
Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua to discuss the proposals
for a peaceful solution that had been worked out by the Contadora group.
They did not reach full agreement, but early in 1987 Arias succeeded in
calling a new meeting at which he submitted his own peace plan, departing
in some respects from the Contadora plan. The accord approved by the five
Presidents in Guatemala on August 7 was based on President Arias's plan.

<H3>KUNGL. VETENSKAPSAKADEMIEN <BR>
THE ROYAL SWEDISH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES</H3></H3>
 21 October 1987<br><br>

<A HREF="http://www.kva.se/">The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences </A>has decided to award the 1987 Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences to Professor <B>Robert M. Solow</B>, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA for his contributions to the theory of economic growth.<br><br> 

The study of the factors which permit production growth and increased welfare has been a central feature in economic research for many years. Robert M. Solow's prize recognizes his exceptional contributions in this area.<br><br> 

It is eminently reasonable to imagine that increased per capita production in a country may be the result of more machines and more factories (a greater stock of real capital). But this increased production may also be due to improved machines and more efficient production methods (which may be termed technical development). In addition, better education and training, and improved methods of organizing production may also give rise to increased productivity. The discovery of fresh natural resources, or improvements in a country's position on the world market, may also lead to higher standards of living. Solow has created a theoretical framework which can be used in discussing the factors which lie behind economic growth in both quantitative and theoretical terms. This framework can also be exploited to measure empirically the contributions made by various production factors in economic growth. 
<br><br>
<B>Solow's Growth Model</B><br>
Solow's growth model was presented in an article entitled "A Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growth" (1956). The article contains a mathematical model (in the form of a differential equation) describing how increased capital stock generates greater per capita production. Solow's starting point is that society saves a given constant proportion of its incomes. The population and the supply of labor, grow at a constant rate and capital intensity (capital per employee) can be regulated. Capital intensity is determined by the prices of production factor. Due to diminishing yields, however, additional capital injections (increasing capital intensity) will make ever smaller contributions to production. This means that, in the long term, the economy will approach a condition of identical growth rates for capital, labor and total production (on condition that there is no technological progress). This involves a situation in which per capita production and real wage no longer increase. An increase in the proportion of incomes which is saved cannot, therefore, lead to a permanent increase in the rate of growth. In contrast, an economy with a higher savings ratio, experiences higher per capita production, and thus higher real income. But, in the absence of technological progress, the rate of growth will be the same, irrespective of the savings quotient, and will be purely dependent on an increased supply of labor.<br><br> 
As a result, technological development will be the motor for economic growth in the long run. In Solow's model, if continuous technological progress can be assumed, growth in real incomes will be exclusively determined by technological progress.<br><br> 

The preceding discussion has assumed that a given proportion of economic income is saved and that savings correspond to an equivalent amount of planned investment. Solow proves, however, that if corporations had perfect foresight and if the labor and capital markets function satisfactorily, corporations will wish to invest to the extent that their total investment plans correspond to the given value of savings. This means that Solow ignores the conditions that may underlie, for example, a Keynesian analysis of unemployment. However, while Keynesians focus on short term instability, Solow is interested in an analysis of long term development.<br><br> 

Solow's theoretical model had an enormous impact on economic analysis. From simply being a tool for the analysis of the growth process, the model has been generalized in several different directions. It has been extended by the introduction of other types of production factors and it has been reformulated to include stochastic features. The design of dynamic links in certain "numerical" models employed in general equilibrium analysis has also been based on Solow's model. But, above all, Solow's growth model constitutes a framework within which modern macroeconomic theory can be structured. 
<br><br>
<b>Empirical Growth Analysis</B><br>
The empirical estimation of the contributions of various production factors to GNP is linked with the work of several other economists. Solow's contributions in two articles "Technical Change and the Aggregate Production Funtion ", published in 1957, and in "Investment and Technical Progress", from 1960, laid the foundations for what was later to develop into "growth accounting". <br><br> 

In his first article, Solow based his model on time series figures for total production, the total input of labor and the cost shares of these factors in total production. Solow thus achieved a measure for continuous change in production technology over time by calculating the difference between the relative development of production and the development of the supply of labor and capital, weighted by factor shares. On the basis of this estimated series, Solow could assess the production function, (ie the mathematical relationship between production, on the one hand, and the input of production factors, on the other).<br><br> 

The change in production technology (the change in production which could not be interpreted as changed inputs of labor and capital) was interpreted as the result of changes in production techniques, that is to say technical progress.<br><br> 

Solow's analysis showed that technical improvements were neutral over time (the distribution of GNP between earnings and capital yield was not affected by technical change). He also demonstrated that only a small proportion of annual growth could be explained by increased inputs of labor and capital.<br><br> 

Solow's study had a dramatic impact - similar analyses were undertaken in a great many other countries. Access to better statistical data in the form of time series for capital and labor has permitted more reliable results to be achieved.<br><br> 

The first attempts at measuring the contributions of production factors to total production were based on given series for the supply of labor and the stock of capital. Both these aggregates are somewhat controversial, however. Robert Solow participated actively in lengthy discussions about the measurement of aggregated capital stock (the "capital controversy" of the 1960 's and 1970 's). In an article published in 1960, "Investment and Technical Progress", Solow presents a new method of studying the role played by capital formation in economic growth. His basic assumption was that technical progress is "built into" machines and other capital goods and that this must be taken into account when making empirical measurements of the role played by capital. This idea then gave birth to the "vintage approach" (a similar idea was discussed by Leif Johansen in Norway at about the same time). The vintage approach assumes that new investments are characterized by the most modern technology and that the capital that is formed as a result does not change in qualitative terms over its remaining life. Thus, the investment decision ties up future technology to some extent, since technological knowledge is rooted in the physical capital object. Solow's formulation of a mathematical model based on these ideas enabled him to develop a theory which permitted empirical calculations to be made. In principle, the model established a new way of aggregating capital from different periods. Solow's empirical results naturally gave the formation of capital a markedly higher status in explaining the increase in production per employee.<br><br> 

The most important aspect of Solow's article was not so much the empirical outcome, but the method of analysing "vintage capital". Nowadays, the vintage capital concept has many other applications and is no longer solely employed in analyses of the factors underlying economic growth. For example, many numerical general equilibrium models utilize Solow's approach in the study of the sensitivity of economies to certain types of disruptive effects. The vintage approach has proved invaluable, both from the theoretical point of view and in applications such as the analysis of the development of industrial structures. 

<br><br><B>Other works</B><br>
Professor Robert Solow has worked actively within many vital areas of economic theory. For example, he has published important contributions in the area of natural resource economics. Conventional economic growth theories assume that the only factors which can affect economic growth are labor, capital and technology. In recent years, the role of natural resources has also attracted considerable attention. Is it possible to imagine continued economic growth when we know that natural resources are finite? Solow studied this question from a theoretical perspective in an article published in 1974 and found that the key to this problem lay in assumptions made about the substitution elasticity for capital and natural resource inputs. Solow has also studied the environmental consequences of growth in other works.<br> <br> 

Over the last decade, Professor Solow has largely devoted his research efforts to macroeconomic questions involving unemployment and economic policy and he has been a member of the US President's Council of Economic Advisers.

<IMG SRC="economy-1987-1.gif" ALIGN=left VSPACE="5" HSPACE="10">I was born in Brooklyn, New York on August 23, 1924, the oldest of three children. My parents were themselves the children of immigrants. They had to earn a living as soon as they finished se
condary school. So my sisters, my cousins and I were the first generation
of our family to attend a university. I was educated, and well educated,
in the neighborhood public schools of New York City. I was good at school
from the very beginning, but not very intellectual until my last year in
high school. Then one of those teachers who make a difference taught me
to read the great 19th century French and Russian novelists, and to take
ideas seriously. I won a scholarship to Harvard College and arrived there
in September 1940. <BR>
<BR>
Lika many children of the Depression, I was curious about what made society
tick. My first studies were in sociology (with Talcott Parsons) and anthropology
(with Clyde Kluckhohn) as well as elementary economics. By the end of 1942,
when I had turned 18, it seemed that there were more urgent and exciting
matters than what I was doing, so I left the university and joined the U.S.
Army. I served briefly in North Africa and Sicily, and then from the beginning
to the end of the war in Italy, until I was discharged in August 1945. <BR>
<BR>
I think that those three years as a soldier formed my character. I found
myself part of a tight-knit group, doing a hard job with skill and mutual
loyalty, led by one of the most remarkable men I have ever known, who never
wavered from the path of humor and decency. Twice again I have had similar
experiences: in Walter Heller's Council of Economic Advisers (along with
<A HREF="economy-1981.html">James Tobin</A>, Kermit Gordon and Arthur Okun)
and, for most of my adult life, in the Economics Department at M.I.T. Day
in and day out, that is the best sort of environment. The only other thing
one could ask for is a warm and happy family life, and that I have certainly
had. <BR>
<BR>
Upon returning to Harvard in 1945, now married to the reader and writer
of all those V-letters, I chose, almost casually, to go on with economics.
By a piece of good luck, Wassily Leontief became my teacher, guide and friend.
I learned from him the spirit as well as the substance of modern economic
theory. He was also responsible for my introduction to empirical work: as
his research assistant I produced the first set of capital-coefficients
for the input-output model. <BR>
<BR>
Somehow - the memory is lost - I became interested in statistics and probabilistic
models. In those days, the teaching of statistics at Harvard was, to put
it kindly, eccentric. I learned a lot from Frederick Mosteller, whose appointment
was in the Department of Social Relations. Eventually he advised me to study
more intensively in a place where that was possible. So, in 1949 - 50, I
spent a fellowship year at Columbia University, in the lectures of Abraham
Wald, Jacob Wolfowitz and T.W. Anderson, along with my fellow student and
friend Jack Kiefer. During that year I was also working on my Ph.D. thesis,
an exploratory attempt to model changes in the size distribution of wage
income using interacting Markoff processes for employment-unemployment and
wage rates. The thesis was awarded the Wells Prize at Harvard, which offered
publication in book form and $500 (in 1951 prices!) upon completion. When
I reread the thesis, however, I thought that I could do it better. But I
never returned to that work and the thesis remains unpublished (and the
check uncashed) . <BR>
<BR>
Just before going off to Columbia I was offered and accepted an Assistant
Professorship in the Economics Department at M.I.T. I have never had or
wanted any other job. M.I.T. hired me primarily to teach courses in statistics
and econometrics. In the beginning I fully intended to make my career along
those lines. It did not turn out that way, probably for a geographical reason.
I was given the office next to <A HREF="economy-1970.html">Paul Samuelson's</A>.
Thus began what is now almost 40 years of almost daily conversations about
economics, politics, our children, cabbages and kings. That has been an
immeasurably important part of my professional life. I suppose it was inevitable
that I should drift back into &quot;straight&quot; economics, where I discovered
an instinctive macroeconomist struggling to get out. <BR>
<BR>
The M.I.T. Economics Department has been a wonderful place to teach and
work. It has provided me - and not only me - with sharp and delightful colleagues,
and with a long line of spectacular students. I estimate that if I had neglected
the students, I could have written 25 percent more scientific papers. The
choice was easy to make and I do not regret it. <BR>

</B>
<H3>Summary</H3>
One half of this year's Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to <B>Ernst
Ruska</B> for &quot;his fundamental work in electron optics and for the
design of the first electron microscope&quot;. The significance of the electron
microscope in different fields of science such as biology and medicine is
now fully established: it is one of the most important inventions of this
century.<BR>
<BR>
Its development began with work carried out by Ruska as a young student
at the Berlin Technical University at the and of the 1920's. He found that
a magnetic coil could act as a lens for electrons, and that such an electron
lens could be used to obtain an image of an object irradiated with electrons.
By coupling two electron lensed he produced a primitive microscope. He very
quickly improved various details and in 1933 was able to build the first
electron microscope with a performance clearly superior to that of the conventional
light microscope. Ruska subsequently contributed actively to the development
of commercial mass-produced electron microscopes that rapidly found applications
within many areas of science.<BR>
<BR>
Electron microscopy has since been developed through technical improvements
and through the advent of entirely new designs, among them the scanning
tunnelling electron microscope. A number of researchers have taken part
in both this and the earlier development, but Ruska's pioneering work is
clearly the outstanding achievement.<BR>
<BR>
The other half of this year's prize has been awarded to <B>Gerd Binnig</B>
and <B>Heinrich Rohrer</B> for &quot;their design of the scanning tunneling
microscope&quot;. This instrument is not a true microscope ( i.e. an instrument
that gives a direct image of an object) since it is based on the principle
that the structure of a surface can be studied using a stylus that scans
the surface at a fixed distance from it. Vertical adjustment of the stylus
is controlled by means of what is termed the tunnel effect - hence the name
of the instrument. An electrical potential between the tip of the stylus
and the surface causes an electric current to flow between them despite
the fact that they are not in contact. The strength of the current is strongly
dependent on the distance, and this makes it possible to maintain the distance
constant at approximately 10<sup>-7</sup> cm (i.e. about two atom diameters).
The stylus is also extremely sharp, the tip being formed of one single atom.
This enables it to follow even the smallest details of the surface it is
scanning. Recording the vertical movement of the stylus makes it possible
to study the structure of the surface atom by atom.<BR>
<BR>
The scanning tunneling microscope is completely new, and we have so far
seen only the beginning of its development. It is, however, clear that entirely
new fields are opening up for the study of the structure of matter. Binnig's
and Rohrer's great achievement is that, starting from earlier work and ideas.
they have succeeded in mastering the enormous experimental difficulties
involved in building an instrument of the precision and stability required.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Background information</B><BR>
The invention of the conventional microscope represented a great step forward
for science, particularly in biology and medicine. As better and better
microscopes were built, it was discovered that there exists a limit that
cannot be exceeded. This is connected with the wave characteristics of light.
Using light waves, it is impossible to distinguish details smaller than
the wavelength of the light. The term &quot;resolution&quot; refers to the
distance between two details of an image that can just be distinguished.
For a conventional microscope using visible light, the resolution is some
4 000 &Aring; (1 &Aring;, &aring;ngstrom = l0<sup>-8</sup>cm).<BR>
<BR>
The great breakthrough in microscopy came when it was found possible to
produce an image of an object using an electron beam. The starting point
was the discovery that a magnetic coil can function like an optical lens.
A divergent bundle of electrons passing through the coil is focused to a
point. A suitable electric field can also act as an electron-optical lens.
Using a lens of this type, an enlarged image can be obtained of an object
irradiated with electrons. the image is recorded on a fluorescent screen
or a photographic plate. It also proved possible to combine two or more
lenses to increase the magnification. The work was carried out at the Technical
University of Berlin at the end of the 1920's.<BR>
<BR>
The scientist who has made the greatest contribution to this development
is Ernst Ruska. As a young student together with his supervisor Max Knoll,
he began studying simple magnetic coils, He found that the use of suitably-designed
iron encapsulation improved their electron-optical properties. Above all,
it now became possible to build a lens of short focal length. This is essential
if high magnification is desired. Using two coils in series, Ruska achieved
a magnification of fifteen times. Even though this was a modest result,
it nevertheless represents the first prototype of an electron micrcscope.
Ruska subsequently worked purposefully to improve the details, and in 1933
he built what can be described as the first electron microscope in the modern
sense - an instrument with considerably better performance than a conventional
light microscope 's. He was then appointed by Siemens and took part in the
development of the first commercially-available, mass-produced electron
microscope, which entered the market in 1939. This event may be considered
the real breakthrough for electron microscopy.<BR>
<BR>
Since then, development of the electron microscope has been very extensive.
Its resolving power could be considered theoretically unlimited, since the
electron is a pointlike particle, However, according to quantum mechanics,
every particle has wave characteristics which introduce an uncertainty into
the determination of its position. This sets a theoretical limit to resolution
for the acceleration potentials normally used of the order of 0.5 - 1 &Aring;.
In practice, resolutions down to about 1 &Aring; have been achieved.<BR>
<BR>
The type of elect on microscope developed by Ruska is called the transmission
microscope. The object to be examined is in the form of a thin section.
The electron beam goes right through this in the same way that light pierces
the object in a light microscope. There are, however, several other types
of electron microscope, the most important apart from the transmission microscope
being perhaps the scanning electron microscope. In this extremely sharply
focused electron beam strikes the object The secondary electrons emitted
are collected by a detector and the current is recorded. Magnetic coils
cause the electron beam to scan the object in the same way as the beam of
a TV tube. The variations in the emission of secendary electrons carn be
used to build up an image. The advantage is the large depth of focus which
gives a three-dimensional image as opposed to the sectional image obtained
with a transmission microscope. However, the resolution is poorer. These
two types of microscope thus complement each other.<BR>
<BR>
Electron microscopy has developed extremely over the last few decades, with
technical improvements and entirely new designs. Its importance can scarcely
be exaggerated and, against this background, the importance of the earliest,
fundamental work becomes increasingly evident. While many researchers were
involved Ruska's contributions clearly predominate. His electron-optical
investigations and the building of the first true electron microscope were
crucial for future development.<BR>
<BR>
The latest contribution to the development of microscopy is what is termed
the scanning tunneling microscope. Its principle differs completely from
that of other microscopes. A mechanical device is used to sense the structure
of a surface. To this extent, the principle is the same as that of braille-reading.
In braille, it is the reader's fingers that detect the impressed characters
but a much more detailed picture of the topography of a surface can be obtained
if the surface is traversed by a fine stylus, the vertical movement of which
is recorded. What determines the amount of detail in the image - the resolution
- is the sharpness of stylus and how well it can follow the structure of
the surface. Obviously if the tip of the stylus is too sharp, it rapidly
becomes destroyed. At the same time, small structural details of the surface
can be damaged by mechanical contact, One solution to this problem would
be to maintain the stylus at a small, constant distance from the surface
The first to succeed in doing this was the American physicist Russel Young
at the National Bureau of Standards in the USA. He used the phenomenon known
as field emission. If a sufficiently high potential is applied between stylus
and surface, a current flows with a strength depending on the stylus-surface
distance. If regulated by a servo mecanism controlled by the current, this
distance can be kept constant without mechanical contact. Young succeeded
in building an instrument that worked on this principle. The distance between
the stylus tip and the surface was approximately 200 &Aring;. Its resolution
was thus considerably poorer than that of an electron microscope<BR>
<BR>
However, Young realised, that it should be possible to achieve better resolution
by using the so-called tunnel effect This is a quantummechanical effect
that allows an electron (and also other particles to cross an area where,
according to classical physics it cannot exist since it lacks sufficiently
high energy. It makes its way so to speak, through a potential mountain
by quantum-mechanical tunneling; hence the name tunneling microscope. This
means here that if the tip of the stylus is near enough to the surface (10
&Aring;, i.e. 1-2 atom diameters) a current flows even at low voltages.
In the same way as field emission, it should be possible to control the
stylus without mechanical contact. However, Young was unable to convert
this idea into practice owing to the exceptionally large experimental difficulties
involved<BR>
<BR>
The first researchers to succeed in building a scanning tunneling microscope
were Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer at the IBM Research Laboratories in
Z&uuml;rich, Switzerland. The reason for their success was the exceptional
precision of the mechanical design One example of this is that disturbing
vibrations from the environment were eliminated by building the microscope
upon a heavy permanent magnet floating freely in a dish of superconducting
lead. Less bulky but equally effective devices for stable, disturbance-free
suspension of the microscope have now been developed. Piezoelectrical elements
are used to control the horizontal movement of the stylus in two perpend
icular directions so that it scans the surface a long parallel lines - hence
the name scanning microscope The vertical movement of the stylus is controlled
and measured using another piozoelement. Using a special technique it has
been possible to produce styluses with tips consisting of a single atom.
Consequently, the precision of the image is particularly great. Horizontal
resolution is approximately 2 &Aring; and vertical resolution. approximately
0.1 &Aring;. This makes it possible to depict individual atoms, that is,
to study in the greatest possible detail the atomic structure of the surface
being examined.<BR>
<BR>
It is evident that this technique is one of exceptional promise, and that
we have so far seen only the beginning or its development. Many research
groups in different areas of science are now in using the scanning tunneling
microscope. The study of surfaces is an important part of physics, with
particular applications in semiconductor physics and microelectronics In
chemistry, also, surface reactions play an important part, for example in
connection with catalysis. It is also possible to fixate organic molecules
on a surface and study their structures. Among other applications, this
technique has been used in the study of DNA molecules. <BR>

<CENTER><H3>ERNST RUSKA</H3></CENTER>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="physics-1986-1.gif" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5>I was born on 25 December 1906 in Heidelberg as the fifth of seven children
of Professor Julius Ruska and his wife Elisbeth (n&eacute;e Merx). After graduating
from grammar school in Heidelberg I studied electronics at the Technical
College in Munich, studies which I began in the autumn of 1925 and continued
two years later in Berlin. I received my practical training from Brown-Boveri
&amp; Co in Mannheim and Siemens &amp; Halske Ltd in Berlin. Whilst still
a student at the Technical College in Berlin I began my involvement with
high voltage and vacuum technology at the Institute of High Voltage, whose
director was Professor Adolf Matthias. Under the direct tutelage of Dr Max
Knoll and together with other doctoral students I worked on the development
of a high performance cathode ray oscilloscope. On the one hand my interest
lay principally in the development of materials for the building of vacuum
instruments according to the principles of construction; on the other it
lay in continuing theoretical lectures and practical experiments in the
optical behaviour of electron rays. <BR>
<BR>
My first completed scientific work (1928-9) was concerned with the mathematical
and experimental proof of Busch's theory of the effect of the magnetic field
of a coil of wire through which an electric current is passed and which
is then used as an electron lens. During the course of this work I recognised
that the focal length of the waves could be shortened by use of an iron
cap. From this discovery the polschuh lens was developed, a lens which has
been used since then in all magnetic high-resolution electron microscopes.
Further work, conducted together with Dr Knoll, led to the first construction
of an electron microscope in 1931. With this instrument two of the most
important processes for image reproduction were introduced-the principles
of emission and radiation. In 1933 I was able to put into use an electron
microscope, built by myself, that for the first time gave better definition
than a light microscope. In my Doctoral thesis of 1934 and for my university
teaching thesis (1944), both at the Technical College in Berlin, I investigated
the properties of electron lenses with short focal lengths. <BR>
<BR>
Since the further technical development of electron microscopes could not
be the task of a college institute-whose resources would have been far overstretched - I
went to work in industry in the field of electron optics. From 1933 to 1937
I was with Fernseh Ltd in Berlin-Zehlendorf and was responsible for the
development of television receivers and transmitters, as well as photoelectric
cells with secondary amplification. Convinced of the great practical importance
of electron microscopy for pure and applied research I attempted during
this time to continue the development of high-resolution electron microscopes
with larger materials, this time working with Dr Bodo von Borries. This
work was made possible in 1936-7 by Siemens &amp; Halske. In Berlin-Spandau
in 1937 we set up the Laboratory for Electron Optics and developed there
until 1939 the first customised electron microscopes (the 'Siemens Super
Microscope'). Parallel to the development of this instrument my brother,
Dr Med. Helmut Ruska, and his colleagues worked on its application, particularly
in the medical and biological fields. In order to promote its usage in different
scientific areas as quickly as possible we suggested to Siemens that they
set up a visiting institute for research work to be carried out using electron
microscopy. This institute was founded in 1940. From this institute, in
which we worked together with both German and foreign scientists, around
200 scientific papers were published before the end of 1944. My task consisted
in the development and production of the electron microscope, such that
by the beginning of 1945 around 35 institutions were equipped with one.
<BR>
<BR>
In the years following 1945 I, together with a majority of new colleagues,
reconstituted the Institute of Electron Optics in Berlin-Siemensstadt, which
had been disbanded due to bombing, so that by 1949 electron microscopes
were again being built. This new period of development led in 1954 to 'Elmiskop
1', which since then has been used in over 1200 institutions the world over.
At the same time I sought the further physical development of the electron
microscope by working at other scientific institutions. Thus from August
1947 to December 1948 I worked at the German Academy of Sciences in Berlin-Buch
in the Faculty of Medicine and Biology, then from January 1949 as Head of
Department at what is today the Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck
Society in Berlin-Dahlem. Here on 27 June 1957 I was made Director of the
Institute for Electron Microscopy, after I had given up my position with
Siemens in 1955. I retired on 31 December 1974. <BR>
<BR>
From 1949 until 1971 I held lectures on the basic principles of electron
optics and electron microscopy at both the Free University and the Technical
University of Berlin. My publications in the area of electron optics and
electron microscopy include several contributions to books and over 100
original scientific papers. <BR>
<BR>
<I>(added by the editor):</I> Ernst Ruska died on May 25, 1988.

<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="physics-1986-2.gif" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5>I was born in Frankfurt, W. Germany, on 7.20., '47 as the first of two sons.
My childhood was very much influenced by the Second World War, which had
only just ended. We children had great fun playing among the ruins of the
demolished buildings, but naturally were too young to realize that much
more than just buildings had been destroyed. <BR>
<BR>
Until the age of 31, I lived partly in Frankfurt and partly in Offenbach,
a nearby city. I attended school in both cities, and it was in Frankfurt
that I started to study physics. Already as a child about 10 years of age,
I had decided to become a physicist without actually knowing what it involved.
While studying physics, I started to wonder whether I had really made the
right choice. Especially theoretical physics seemed so technical, so relatively
unphilosophical and unimaginative. In those years, I concentrated more on
playing music with friends in a beat-band rather than on physics. My mother
had introduced me to classical music very early in life, and I believe this
played an important role in my subsequent development. Unfortunately, I
started playing the violin rather late, at the age of 15 only, but thoroughly
enjoyed being a member of our school orchestra. My brother was responsible
for my transition from classics to beat by his perpetually immersing me
with the sounds of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, until I finally really
liked that kind of music, and even started composing songs and playing in
various beat-bands. In this way, I first learned how difficult teamwork
can be, how much fun it is to be creative, and how unpredictable the reaction
of an audience can be.<BR>
<BR>
My education in physics gained some significance when I began my diploma
work in Prof. Dr. W. Martienssen's group, under Dr. E. Hoenig's guidance.
I realized that actually doing physics is much more enjoyable than just
learning it. Maybe 'doing it' is the right way of learning, at least as
far as I am concerned. <BR>
<BR>
I have always been a great admirer of Prof. Martienssen, especially of his
ability to grasp and state the essence of the scientific context of a problem.
Dr. Hoenig introduced me to experimenting, and exhibited great patience
when I asked him very stupid questions in trying to catch up on what I had
missed over 11 the previous years. <BR>
<BR>
In 1969, Lore Wagler became my wife. We had both been studying for quite
a long time - Lore is now a psychologist - so only recently did we decide to
have children: a daughter born in Switzerland in 1984, and a son born in
California in 1986. This was the absolute highlight and most wonderful experience
of my whole life. However, fatherhood is not without its sacrifice. For
the time being, nearly all my hobbies, like music (singing, playing the
guitar and the violin), and sports (soccer, tennis, skiing, sailing and
playing golf) have had to take a back seat. <BR>
<BR>
It was in 1978 that Lore - my private psychotherapist - convinced me to accept
an offer from the IBM Z&uuml;rich Research Laboratory to join a physics group.
This turned out to be an extremely important decision, as it was here I
met Heinrich Rohrer. His way of viewing physics, combined with his humanity
and sense of humor, fully restored my somewhat lost curiosity in physics.
My years at Ruschlikon, and in IBM Research in general, have been very exciting,
not only because of the development of the STM, but also because of the
stimulating and pleasant atmosphere created by the people working there,
and by those responsible. Working together in a team with Heinrich Rohrer,
Christoph Gerber and Edmund Weibel was an extraordinarily delightful experience,
and one for which I shall be eternally grateful. It is also extremely gratifying
that our work was recognized far afield. We were first awarded the German
Physics Prize, the Otto Klung Prize, the Hewlett Packard Prize, the King
Faisal Prize, and now the ultimate crown, the Nobel Prize for Physics. Life
certainly does not become easier for a scientist once his work has exceeded
a certain significance. But while prizes do add some complications, I must
admit they also have their compensations! <BR>
<BR>
<I>(added in 1991):</I><BR>
<BR>
 In 1990 I joined the Supervisory Board of the Daimler Benz
Holding and presently I am involved in a few political activities.

<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="physics-1986-3.gif" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5>I was born in Buchs, St. Gallen, Switzerland on 6.6., '33 as the third child, half an hour after my twin sister. We were fortunate to enjoy a carefree
childhood with a sound mixture of freedom, school and farm work. In 1949,
the family moved to Z&uuml;rich and our way of life changed from country to town.
My finding to physics was rather accidental. My natural bent was towards
classical languages and natural sciences, and only when I had to register
at the ETH (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology) in autumn 1951, did I
decide in favor of physics. In the next four years, Professors G. Busch,
<A HREF="physics-1945.html">W. Pauli</A>, and P. Scherrer taught me the rudiments. In autumn 1955, I started
work on my Ph.D. Thesis and it was fortuitous that J&ouml;rgen Lykke Olsen trusted
me to measure the length changes of superconductors at the magnetic-field-induced
superconducting transition. He had already pioneered the field with measurements
on the discontinuity of Young's modulus. Following in his footsteps, I lost
all respect for angstroms. The mechanical transducers were very vibration
sensitive, and I learned to work after midnight, when the town was asleep.
My four graduate years were a most memorable time, in a group of distinguished
graduate students always receptive for fun, and including the interruptions
by my basic training courses in the Swiss mountain infantry. <BR>
<BR>
In summer 1961, Rose-Marie Egger became my wife, and her stabilizing influence
has kept me on an even keel ever since. Our honeymoon trip led us to the
United States where I spent two post-doe years working on thermal conductivity
of type-II superconductors and metals in the group of Professor Bernie Serin
at Rutgers University in New Jersey. Then in the summer of 1963, Professor
Ambros Speiser, Director of the newly founded IBM Research Laboratory in
R&uuml;schlikon, Switzerland, made me an offer to join the physics effort there.
Encouraged by Bruno L&uuml;thi, who later became a Professor at the University
of Frankfurt, and, at the time, strongly recommended the hiring of Gerd
Binnig, I accepted to start in December 1963, after having responded to
the call of the wild in the form of a four-month camping trip through the
USA. <BR>
<BR>
My first couple of years in R&uuml;schlikon were spent studying mainly Kondo
systems with magnetoresistance in pulsed magnetic fields. End of the sixties,
Keith Blazey interested me to work on GdAlO<SUB>3</SUB>, an antiferromagnet on which
he had done optic experiments. This started a fruitful cooperation on magnetic
phase diagrams, which eventually brought me into the field of critical phenomena.
Encouraged by <A HREF="physics-1987.html">K. Alex M&uuml;ller</A>, who had pioneered the critical-phenomena effort
in our Laboratory, I focused on the bicritical and tetracritical behavior
and finally on the random-field problem. These were most enjoyable years,
during which so many patient colleagues taught me physics. I left them with
some regret, when I ventured with Gerd to discover new shores. We found
them. Thank you, Gerd. <BR>
<BR>
In 1974/75, I spent a sabbatical year with Professor Vince Jaccarino and
Dr. Alan King at the University of California in Santa Barbara, to get a
taste of nuclear magnetic resonance. We solved a specific problem on the
bicritical point of MnF<SUB>2</SUB>, their home-base material. We traded experience,
NMR and critical phenomena. Rose-Marie and I also took the opportunity at
the beginning and end of my sabbatical to show the USA to our two daughters,
Doris and Ellen, on two extended camping trips from coast to coast. <BR>
<BR>
In all the years with IBM Research, I have especially appreciated the freedom
to pursue the activities I found interesting, and greatly enjoyed the stimulus,
collegial cooperation, frankness, and intellectual generosity of two scientific
communities, namely, in superconductivity and critical phenomena. I should
also like to take this opportunity to thank the many, many friends, teachers,
and seniors who have contributed towards my scientific career in any way
whatsoever, and most particularly my mother for her unstinting aid and assistance,
especially when times were difficult.

THE ROYAL SWEDISH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES </H3>
15 October 1986<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.kva.se/">The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences </A>has
decided to award the 1986 Nobel Prize in chemistry jointly to <BR>
<BR>
Professor <B>Dudley R. Herschbach</B>, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA,

<H3>The dynamics of chemical reactions - a fascinating new field of research</H3>
<B>Summary</B><BR>
This year's Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded to <B>Dudley R. Herschbach</B>,
<B>Yuan T. Lee </B>and <B>John C. Polanyi </B>for their contributions concerning
the dynamics of chemical elementary processes. Their research has been of
great importance for the development of a new field of research in chemistry
- reaction dynamics - and has provided a much more detailed understanding
of how chemical reactions take place.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Dudley R. Herschbach</B> has developed the method of crossed molecular
beams, directed and well-defined fluxes of molecules, to and beyond the
point where detailed studies of chemical reactions have been possible. He
has also elucidated the dynamics of the basic types of reaction. <B>Yuan
T. Lee</B>, who initially worked in cooperation with Herschbach, has developed
the method of crossed molecular beams further towards its use for general
reactions. Most notably, he has used this method for the study of important
reactions for relatively large molecules. <B>John C. Polanyi</B> has developed
the method of infrared chemiluminescence, in which the extremely weak infrared
emission from a newly formed molecule is measured and analysed. He has used
this method to elucidate the detailed energy disposal during chemical reactions.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Background</B><BR>
The molecules and atoms in all substances are in perpetual motion, and collisions
between the molecules in a gas or a liquid thus occur continuously. When
molecules come in close enough contact with each other, redistribution of
the atoms can take place between or within them. New molecules form so-called
product molecules, which means that a chemical reaction takes place. To
effect a reaction, the colliding molecules are often required to have some
special property such as high velocity or large internal energy.<BR>
<BR>
The classical description of how chemical reactions occur, and how rates
of chemical reaction are measured, belongs to the field of chemical reaction
kinetics. This field has developed rapidly during the last few decades,
especially regarding experimental methods. The 1967 Nobel Prize in Chemistry
was awarded to <A HREF="chemistry-1967.html">M. Eigen</A>, Federal Republic
of Germany , <A HREF="chemistry-1967.html">R.G.W. Norrish and G. Porter</A>,
Great Britain, for their studies of extremely fast chemical reactions. In
many respects however, fundamental understanding of what molecular features
influence the rate of chemical reactions has been slow in developing.<BR>
<BR>
The directions and velocities of the molecular motion in a gas or a liquid
are mainly random. Consequently, the collisions between the molecules are
ill-defined as regards, for example, the kinetic energy in the collision.
The details of the reaction thus become blurred and cannot be observed precisely
enough. This problem had not been solved satisfactorily before the development
described here.<BR>
<BR>
It was finally possible to solve the problem by using molecular beams formed
of directed and spatially well-defined molecular fluxes of low density,
often also with well-defined velocities. When two molecular beams are caused
to cross each other, the details of the reactions between molecules can
be studied. The crossed molecular beam technique is thus one of the most
important advances within the field of reaction dynamics.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Dudley R. Herschbach</B> took part in the development of this method
almost from the start. His extremely important achievements concerned for
example studies of short-lived direct reactions, especially of the two main
types, the &quot;rebound&quot; and the &quot;stripping&quot; reaction. He
supplemented the commonly-used procedure of detecting the product molecules
by deflecting them in magnetic and electric fields, thus circumventing one
of the largely-overlooked problems inherent in the early experiments. The
discovery of the first long-lived reaction complexes in crossed beams was
soon followed by a theoretical description of their formation and decay.
The great importance of angular momentum was observed for the first time
in these reactions. Subsequent, more extensive studies by Lee, among others,
have clearly shown that this type of long-lived reaction is of great general
importance.<BR>
<BR>
During this first stage of the development of the field of crossed molecular
beams, reactions between alkali atoms and other molecules were almost the
only ones which could be studied, due to the method of detection used at
that time. Several research groups developed crossed-beam machines for more
general reactions. One of the most sophisticated of these was developed
at Herschbach's laboratory, first of all by <B>Yuan T. Lee</B>. This so-called
&quot;supermachine&quot; employed two well-defined crossed molecular beams
and a moveable mass spectrometric detector, incorporating electron impact
ionization and several stages of differential pumping.<BR>
<BR>
Both Lee and Herschbach, as well as other researchers, have used this type
of molecular-beam apparatus for detailed studies of a large number of chemical
reactions. Lee has led the development towards chemically important reaction
systems by investigating reactions between organic molecules and fluorine
or oxygen atoms. Short-lived direct reactions as well as longlived reactions
have been observed for large systems such as these. This confirms the universal
validity of the early results from studies of alkali-containing reaction
systems. Extremely important reactions, of immediate significance for combustion
chemistry and atmospheric chemistry, have been studied by Lee during recent
years.<BR>
<BR>
Another very important method for the detail study of chemical reactions
has been developed by <B>Polanyi</B>, the infrared - (IR) - chemiluminescence
method. This development took place concurrently with the formation of the
crossed molecular beam field. This complementary method resembles the crossed
molecular beam method in many respects, but involves measurement and analysis
of the extremely weak infrared emission from the product molecules in some
chemical reactions. Excess energy from the reaction is deposited as internal
energy in the product molecules, which after some delay emit the energy
in the form of infrared light. Spectroscopic analysis of this light reveals
directly the quantum mechanical states which the product molecules occupied.
This gives indirect but extremely important information on the multi-dimensional
surface describing the potential energy for the system. The potential energy
surface is the fundamental, but in most cases largely unknown factor, which
determines the detailed behaviour of a chemical reaction.<BR>
<BR>
Polanyi has to a large extent combined a description of the potential energy
surface for the reactions studied with the experimental findings. He has
for example described how the existence and location of an energy barrier
on the potential energy surface modifies the dynamics of the reaction. Further,
he has observed that the product molecules in some cases belong to two different,
well separated, classes with respect to the internal energy distribution.
The method which he has developed can be considered as a first step towards
the present more sophisticated, but also more complicated, laser-based methods
for the study of chemical reaction dynamics.<BR>

"BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P><I>In the figure, two directed molecular fluxes are shown, .i.e. idealized
molecular beams. In the crossing region, a reaction can take place and new
molecules can form. In this special case oxygen atoms (open circles) react
with hydrogen atoms (two filled circles), and form a long-lived complex,
which is an energy-rich and thus unstable water molecule. Each complex dissociates
finally to a hydrogen atom and a hydroxyl radical. This reaction has been
studied in crossed molecular beams as well as with infrared chemiluminescence.

<H2><CENTER>DUDLEY R. HERSCHBACH</CENTER>
</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="chemistry-1986-1.gif" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5>I was born in San Jose, California on June 18, 1932, the first of six children
of Robert and Dorothy Herschbach. My father was then a building contractor
and later a rabbit breeder. His family had lived in this part of California
for three generations; although our surname comes from a pair of villages
in the Rhine Valley, most of his immediate ancestors were of English or
Irish origin. My mother's family had moved to San Jose from Illinois when
she was a young girl; most of her known ancestors were of German, Dutch,
or French origin. <BR>
<BR>
In my boyhood we lived in what was then a rural area of fruit orchards,
only a few miles outside San Jose. For years I milked a cow, fed the pigs
and chickens, and during summers picked prunes, apricots, and walnuts. From
an early age I loved to read but was also very involved in outdoor activities,
scouting, and sports. My interest in science was excited at age nine by
an article on astronomy in<I> National Geographic;</I> the author was Donald
Menzel of the Harvard Observatory. For the next few years, I regularly made
star maps and snuck out at night to make observations from a locust tree
in our back yard. <BR>
<BR>
When I attended Campbell High School, I took all the science and mathematics
courses offered. Chemistry I found at first puzzling and then most intriguing,
thanks to John Meischke, a superb teacher. At the time, I was at least as
interested in football and other sports; perhaps that presaged my later
pursuit of molecular collisions. Like most of my classmates, I did not expect
to attend college; none of my known relatives had graduated from a university.
However, my teachers and coaches presumed I would go. Indeed, I received
offers of football scholarships from some universities to which I had not
even applied for admission. <BR>
<BR>
I entered Stanford University in 1950 and found a new world with vastly
broader intellectual horizons than I'd imagined. Although I gladly played
freshman football, I had turned down an athletic scholarship in favor of
an academic one. This permitted me to give up varsity football after spring
practice, in reaction to a dictum by the head coach that we not take any
lab courses during the season. By then the lab and library already were
for me much the more exciting playground. My chief mentor at Stanford was
Harold Johnston, who imbued me with his passion for chemical kinetics. Many
other subjects and professors were also compelling and I took up to ten
courses a term. Mathematics was especially appealing; I so admired the teaching
of Harold Bacon, George Polya, Gabor Szego, and Bob Weinstock that I simply
took all the courses they gave. I received the B.S. in mathematics in 1954
and the M.S. in chemistry in 1955. My Master's thesis, done under the direction
of Harold Johnston, was titled: &quot;Theoretical Pre-exponential Factors
for Bimolecular Reactions.&quot; It employed the transition-state theory
of Henry Eyring and Michael Polanyi and treated the proportionality factor
in the most venerable formula of chemical kinetics, the Arrhenius equation.
<BR>
<BR>
My graduate study continued at Harvard, where again I found an exhilerating
academic environment. I received the A.M. in Physics in 1956 and the Ph.D.
in Chemical Physics in 1958. My Doctoral Thesis, done under E. Bright Wilson,Jr.,
was titled: &quot;Internal Rotation and Microwave Spectroscopy&quot;. This
presented theoretical calculations and experiments dealing with hindered
internal rotation of methyl groups. The height of the hindering barrier
could be accurately determined because the observed spectra were very sensitive
to tunneling between equivalent potential mimima. Much that shaped my later
research I learned from Bright Wilson and other faculty, especially George
Kistiakowsky and Bill Klemperer, or from fellow students, especially Jerry
Swalen, Victor Laurie and Larry Krisher. My thesis work also benefited from
visits of several months to take spectra at the National Research Council
in Ottawa and to compute Mathieu functions at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
During 1957-1959, while a Junior Fellow in the Society of Fellows at Harvard,
I developed plans for molecular beam studies of elementary chemical reactions.
<BR>
<BR>
This work was launched at the University of California at Berkeley, where
I was appointed an Assistant Professor of Chemistry in 1959 and became an
Associate Professor in 1961. The chief experiments dealt with reactions
of alkali atoms with alkyl iodides, systems studied forty years before by
Michael Polanyi. Rather simple apparatus sufficed to attain single-collision
conditions and revealed that the product molecules emerged with a preferred
range of recoil angle and translational energy. The possibility of resolving
such features of reaction dynamics encouraged other workers pursuing kindred
experiments and fostered an outburst of new theory. My early work thus interacted
particularly with that of Richard Bernstein, Sheldon Datz, Ned Greene, John
Polanyi, John Ross, and Peter Toennies. <BR>
<BR>
This new field developed rapidly after I returned to Harvard in 1963 as
Professor of Chemistry. We studied a wide range of alkali reactions and
found several prototype modes of reaction dynamics which could be correlated
with the electronic structure of the target molecule. Processes involving
abrupt, <I>impulsive</I> bond exchange or formation of a <I>persistent</I>
complex comprise the two major categories. In 1967 Yuan Lee joined our group
as a postdoctoral fellow and led the construction of a &quot;supermachine&quot;.
This employed greatly augmented differential pumping, sophisticated mass
spectroscopy using ion counting techniques adapted from nuclear physics,
and supersonic beam sources advocated by enterprising chemical engineers,
especially John Fenn and Jim Anderson. The new machine greatly extended
the scope of crossed-beam experiments, taking us &quot;beyond the alkali
age&quot;. In particular, we were then able to study the same reactions
elucidated by John Polanyi with his complementary method of infrared chemiluminescence.
This much enhanced the interpretation of reaction dynamics in terms of electronic
structure. <BR>
<BR>
The most representative descriptions of the work recognized by the Nobel
Prize probably appeared in: <BR>
<BR>
Adv. Chem. Phys. <B>10</B>, 319 - 393 (1966). <BR>
Disc. Faraday Soc. <B>44</B>, 108 - 122 (1967). <BR>
J. Chem. Phys. <B>56</B>, 769 - 788 (1972). <BR>
Faraday Disc. Chem. Soc. <B>55</B>, 233 - 251 (1973). <BR>
Pure and Applied Chem. <B>47</B>, 61 - 73 (1976). <BR>
Mol. Phys. <B>35</B>, 541 - 573 (1978).<BR>
J. Phys. Chem. <B>87</B>, 2781 - 2786 (1983).<BR>
<BR>
In current research we are developing a method for simultaneous measurement
of three or four vector properties of reactive collisions, such as reactant
or product relative velocities or rotational angular momenta. Theory has
shown that data on correlations among these vectors can undo much of the
averaging over initial molecular orientations and impact parameters and
thereby reveal more incisive information about reaction dynamics. Other
studies deal with processes akin to liquid-phase reactions by solvating
reactant molecules during a supersonic expansion. We are also examining
bulk liquid interactions by means of vibrational frequency shifts induced
by high pressure; this offers a way to determine solute-solvent intermolecular
forces. In addition to theoretical studies related to these experiments,
we are pursuing a new approach to electronic structure calculations which
exploits exact solutions obtainable in the limit of one- and infintie-dimension.
For two-electron systems this has given high accuracy for the electron correlation
energy with far less effort than conventional methods. <BR>
<BR>
Other biographical items pertaining to Harvard include my appointment in
1976 as Frank B. Baird, Jr. Professor of Science; service as Chairman of
the Chemical Physics program (1964 - 1977) and the Chemistry Department
(1977 - 1980), as a member of the Faculty Council (1980 - 1983), and as
Co Master with my wife of Currier House (1981 - 1986). At Currier we were
in effect reincarnated as undergraduates to preside over an extremely lively
community of 400 students and tutors. Typical of many memorable episodes
was the night we were summoned to a student's room to meet a seal in the
bathtub. My teaching includes graduate courses in quantum mechanics, chemical
kinetics, molecular spectroscopy, and collision theory. In recent years
I have given undergraduate courses in physical chemistry and especially
general chemistry for freshmen, my most challenging assignment. <BR>
<BR>
Away from Harvard, I have been a Visiting Professor at G&ouml;ttingen University
in 1963, a Guggenheim Fellow at Freiburg University in 1968, a Visiting
Fellow of the Joins Institute of Laboratory Astrophysics in 1969, and a
Sherman Fairchild Scholar at the California Institute of Technology in 1976.
I also serve as a consultant to Aerodyne Corporation, the Fluorocarbon Research
Panel, and Los Alamos National Laboratory. I was appointed an Exxon Faculty
Fellow in 1981 and visit regularly the Corporate Research Laboratory in
New Jersey to participate in projects there. I have also served since 1980
as an Associate Editor of the Journal of Physical Chemistry. <BR>
<BR>
Other honors include election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences
in 1964 and to the National Academy of Sciences in 1967; the Pure Chemistry
Prize of the American Chemical Society in 1965, the Linus Pauling Medal
in 1978, the Michael Polanyi Medal in 1981, and the Irving Langmuir Prize
in Chemical Physics in 1983. The University of Toronto bestowed in 1977
the D. Sc., <I>honoris causa.</I> <BR>
<BR>
Chemistry also brought my wife Georgene Botyos to Harvard as an organic
graduate student. We were married in 1964 and our daughters Lisa and Brenda
arrived as harbingers before she received her Ph.D. in 1968. Georgene is
now Assistant Dean of Harvard College, a multifaceted position that often
requires delicate personal chemistry. Lisa is now a junior in humanities
at Stanford, this year enjoying the overseas option at Oxford. Brenda is
a junior in chemistry at Harvard, already pursuing research. Our home is
in Lincoln, Massachusetts. <BR>

<H2><CENTER>YUAN T. LEE</CENTER>
</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="chemistry-1986-2.gif" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5><B>Yuan Tseh Lee</B> was born on November 19, 1936 in Hsinchu, Taiwan. His father
is an accomplished artist and his mother a school teacher. <BR>
<BR>
He started his early education while Taiwan was under Japanese occupation
- a result of a war between China and Japan in 1894. His elementary education
was disrupted soon after it started during World War II while the city populace
was relocated to the mountains to avoid the daily bombing by the Allies.
It was not until after the war when Taiwan was returned to China that he
was able to attend school normally as a third year student in grade school.
<BR>
<BR>
His elementary and secondary education in Hsinchu was rather colorful and
full of fun. In elementary school, he was the second baseman on the school's
baseball team as well as a member of the ping-pong team which won the little
league championship in Taiwan. In high school he played on the tennis team
besides playing trombone in the marching band. <BR>
<BR>
Besides his interest in sports during this time, he was also an avid and
serious reader of a wide variety of books covering science, literature,
and social science. The biography of<A HREF="chemistry-1911.html"> Madame
Curie </A>made a strong impact on him at a young age. It was Madame Curie's
beautiful life as a wonderful human being, her dedication toward science,
her selflessness, idealism that made him decide to be a scientist. <BR>
<BR>
In 1955, with his excellent academic performance in high school, Lee was
admitted to the National Taiwan University without having to take the entrance
examination, a practice the Universities took to admit the best students.
By the end of his freshman year he had decided chemistry was to be his chosen
field. Although the facilities in the Taiwan University were less than ideal,
the free and exciting atmosphere, the dedication of some professors, and
the camaraderie among fellow students in a way made up for it. He worked
under Professor Hua-sheng Cheng on his B.S. thesis which was on the separation
of Sr and Ba using the paper electrophoresis method. <BR>
<BR>
After graduation in 1959, he went on to the National Tsinghua University
to do his graduate work. He received his Master's degree on the studies
of the natural radioisotopes contained in Hukutolite, a mineral of hot spring
sediment under Professor H. Hamaguchi's guidance. After receiving his M.S.
he stayed on at Tsinghua University as a research assistant of Professor
C. H. Wong and carried out the x-ray structure determination of tricyclopentadienyl
samarium. <BR>
<BR>
He entered the University of California at Berkeley as a graduate student
in 1962. He worked under the late Professor Bruce Mahan for his thesis research
on chemiionization processes of electronically excited alkali atoms. During
his graduate student years, he developed an interest in ion-molecule reactions
and the dynamics of molecular scattering, especially the crossed molecular
beam studies of reaction dynamics. <BR>
<BR>
Upon receiving his Ph.D. degree in 1965, he stayed on in Mahan's group and
started to work on ion molecule reactive scattering experiments with Ron
Gentry using ion beam techniques measuring energy and angular distributions.
In a period of about a year he learned the art of designing and constructing
a very powerful scattering apparatus and carried out successful experiments
on N<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> + H<SUB>2</SUB> --&gt; N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>
+ H and obtained a complete product distribution contour map, a remarkable
accomplishment at that time. <BR>
<BR>
In February 1967, he joined Professor Dudley Herschbach at Harvard University
as a post-doctoral fellow. He spent half his time working with Robert Gordon
on the reactions of hydrogen atoms and diatomic alkali molecules and the
other half of his time on the construction of a universal crossed molecular
beams apparatus with Doug McDonald and Pierre LeBreton. Time was certainly
ripe to move the crossed molecular beams method beyond the alkali age. With
tremendous effort and valuable assistance from the machine shop foreman,
George Pisiello, the machine was completed in ten months and the first successful
non alkali neutral beam experiment on Cl + Br<SUB>2</SUB> --&gt; BrCl +
Br was carried out in late 1967. <BR>
<BR>
He accepted the position as an assistant professor in the Department of
Chemistry and the James Franck Institute of the University of Chicago in
October 1968. There he started an illustrious academic career. His further
development as a creative scientist and his construction of a new generation
state-of-the-art crossed molecular beams apparatus enabled him to carry
out numerous exciting and pioneering experiments with his students. He was
promoted to associate professor in October 1971 and professor in January
1973. <BR>
<BR>
In 1974, he returned to Berkeley as professor of chemistry and principal
investigator at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory of the University of California.
He became an American citizen the same year. <BR>
<BR>
In the ensuing years, his scientific efforts blossomed and the scope expanded.
His world leading laboratory now contains seven very sophisticated molecular
beams apparati which were specially designed to pursue problems associated
with reaction dynamics, photochemical processes, and molecular spectroscopy.
His laboratory has always attracted bright scientists from all over the
world and they always seem to enjoy working together. He takes great pride
in the fact that more than fifteen of his former associates are serving
as professors in major universities, and many others are making great contributions
at the national laboratories and in the private sector. <BR>
<BR>
Lee and his wife, Bernice Wu, whom he first met in elementary school have
two sons, Ted (born in 1963), Sidney (born in 1966) and a daughter, Charlotte
(born in 1969). <BR>
<BR>

THE NOBEL ASSEMBLY AT THE KAROLINSKA INSTITUTE</H4>
13 October 1986<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="/mednobel/assembly.html">The Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska 
Institute</A>
has today decided to award the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for
1986 jointly to <BR>
<BR>
<B>Stanley Cohen and Rita Levi-Montalcini</B><BR>
<BR>
for their discoveries of &quot;Growth Factors&quot;<BR>
<B><BR>
Summary</B><BR>
<BR>
The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded for discoveries which
are of fundamental importance for our understanding of the mechanisms which
regulate cell and organ growth. The pattern of cellular growth has long
been known, but it is the Italian developmental biologist <B>Rita Levi-Montalcini</B>
and the American biochemist <B>Stanley Cohen</B> with their discovery of
<I>nerve</I> <I>growth factor</I> (NGF) and <I>epidermal growth factor</I>
(EGF), respectively, who could show how the growth and differentiation of
a cell is regulated. NGF and EGF were the first of many growth-regulating
signal substances to be discovered and characterized. <BR>
<BR>
The discovery of NGF and EGF has opened new fields of widespread importance
to basic science. As a direct consequence we may increase our understanding
of many disease states such as developmental malformations, degenerative
changes in senile dementia, delayed wound healing and tumour diseases. The
characterization of these growth factors is therefore expected, in the near
future, to result in the development of new therapeutic agents and improved
treatment in various clinical diseases. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The Regulation of Growth</B><BR>
<BR>
Adult man consists of billions of cells. However, he begins from a single
cell which contains the genetic material coding for the complete individual.
The first cell divides, and in the beginning, the daughter cells are identical.
Soon, however, the cells begin to exhibit slightly different characteristics.
This unique specialization of cells is termed differentiation. The pattern
for growth and differentiation has long been established but the regulation
of this development has remained unknown. It was only during the past 2-3
decades with the discovery of growth factors that our understanding of the
regulation of cell's growth and differentiation has begun to be clarified.
<BR>
<BR>
Today, we know that cells communicate with each other via signal substances,
hormones. Initially it was believed that hormones were only produced in
specialized glands such as the pituitary, from which hormones such as growth
hormone, were released into the blood stream. It has now become clear that
many cell types synthesize signal substances or hormones which have their
effects both on their cell of origin as well as on neighbouring cells. By
this mechanism, cells can influence the development of their neighbours.
<BR>
<BR>
The scientists in the 1940's and 1950's already knew that the addition of
blood or organ extracts to cells in culture resulted in their successful
growth. They did not know, however, the identity of the active substances,
just as cancer researchers understood little of the unregulated growth of
tumour cells. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The Discovery of NGF</B><BR>
<BR>
The discovery of <I>nerve growth factor</I> (NGF) in the beginning of the
1950's is a fascinating example of how a skilled observer can create a concept
out of apparent chaos. Until this time, experimental neurobiologists did
not understand how the development of the nervous system was regulated to
result in the final complete innervation of the body. The investigation
of NGF's role in the development of the nervous system, as well as later,
in adult neural function, has been a lifelong dedication for Rita Levi-Montalcini.
Developmental biologist <B>Rita Levi-Montalcini</B>, who in the beginning
of 1950's moved from her homeland Italy, to Viktor Hamburger's laboratory
in St. Louis, USA, showed in 1952 that when tumours from mice were transplanted
to chick embryos they induced potent growth of the chick embryo nervous
system, specifically sensory and sympathetic nerves. Since this outgrowth
did not require direct contact between the tumour and the chick embryo,
Rita Levi-Montalcini concluded that the tumour released a nerve growth-promoting
factor which had a selective action on certain types of nerves. Following
this discovery, Rita Levi-Montalcini turned to a more sensitive cell culture
system in order to measure NGF activity in various extracts. NGF proved
to be an extremely potent biological substance. A sensory or sympathetic
nerve cell reacted within 30 seconds to the addition of minute quantities
of NGF. One billionth part of a gram of NGF per ml of culture medium exerted
a potent growth-promoting effect. A few minutes after the addition of NGF,
nerve fibres began to grow out from the ganglion which after a day's exposure
to NGF resembled a sun surrounded by rays (Figure 1). This biological assay
to detect NGF paved the way for the next step in this pathway of discovery
- identification of the active nerve growth-promoting substance. <BR>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="medicine-1986-press-1.gif" WIDTH="464" HEIGHT="265"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P><B>Figure 1</B>. The classical biological assay for the measurement of
NGF which was developed by Rita Levi-Montalcini. Sensory ganglion dissected
from chick embryo is cultured in the presence of extract to be measured.
Nerve fibre outgrowth from the chick ganglion is determined after 24 hours.
The lowest concentration of the extract which causes a halo of nerve fibre
outgrowth (right hand side figure) contains 1 biological unit of NGF. This
is equivalent to a concentration of approximately 10 nanograms NGF/ml culture
medium (10 ng=1/100,000 of 1 milligram). The left hand side ganglion has
been incubated without NGF being present in the medium and is in the process
of dying. <BR>
The figure has been published in Scientific American 1979, <B>240</B>, p.
48. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The Characterization of NGF</B><BR>
<BR>
In 1953, biochemist <B>Stanley Cohen</B>, joined the research group in St.
Louis. Three years later they had purified a nerve growth-promoting extract
from mouse tumour which contained both protein and nucleic acids. To determine
which of these components was active, Stanley Cohen added snake venom containing
a high concentration of a nucleic acid-degrading enzyme. To his surprise,
the snake venom contained more nerve growth-promoting activity than the
tumour itself. When added alone to the incubation medium, the snake venom
induced an enormous outgrowth of sympathetic nerve fibres. The group followed
up this unexpected finding by systematically searching for the presence
of NGF in various tissues. In 1958, they discovered another rich source
of NGF - a salivary gland in the male mouse. <BR>
<BR>
With the help of snake venom and salivary gland extract, Stanley Cohen was
now able to purify NGF and produce antibodies against NGF. Just as NGF induced
nerve growth, so did the addition of the NGF antibodies to the incubation
medium inhibit it. The chemical structure of NGF is now known to consist
of 118 amino acids. Two such chains join together to build a biologically
active molecule. <BR>
<BR>
The advances were a milestone in developmental neurobiology. For the first
time, chemically defined signal substances could be used in the search for
mechanisms which regulated neural development. <BR>
<BR>
<B>NGF is Necessary for the Survival of Nerve Cells</B><BR>
<BR>
NGF is found in mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fishes. Many cell
types in these species synthesize and release NGF during development. The
growth of nerve fibres is stimulated via this mechanism. Nerve fibres grow
towards the source of NGF which is taken up in the fibre ends and transported
back to the nerve cell body. One can imagine that tissues lure nerve fibres
to them by sending out NGF. An excess of sensory and sympathetic nerve cells
is produced during development. Only those which establish contact with
a target organ producing NGF survive. With modern gene technology it has
now been possible to characterize the NGF gene in man and animals. Hybridization
techniques identifying the messenger RNA for NGF have mapped the tissues
that synthesize NGF. Gene technology also makes possible recombinant NGF,
which opens the way for its future application in clinical medicine. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The Discovery of EGF</B><BR>
<BR>
During the course of his studies of NGF <B>Stanley Cohen</B> observed an
unexpected acceleration of development when he injected salivary gland extract
to newborn mice. The mice displayed precocious eyelid opening and tooth
eruption. The explanation was that the salivary gland extract contained
another growth factor apart from NGF. Cohen termed this substance <I>epidermal
growth factor</I> (EGF) because it could stimulate the proliferation of
epithelial cells in skin and cornea. He raised antibodies against EGF as
he previously had against NGF. <BR>
<BR>
In the following years Cohen purified and determined the amino acid sequence
of EGF (Figure 2). For the first time scientists had a factor available
which stimulated epithelial cell growth and allowed studies of the growth
process. Cohen and his coworkers found that EGF enhanced a cascade of events
including stimulation of glucose and amino acid transport, activation of
protein synthesis and initiation of DNA synthesis and cell replication.
In later studies both Cohen and others have shown that EGF stimulates the
growth of a large variety of cells including fibroblasts, liver cells, and
vascular cells as well as endocrine cells the thyroid, ovaries and pituitary
glands. <BR>

<P><B>Figure 2</B>. The amino acid sequence of EGF with placement of disulfide
bonds. <BR>
The figure has been published in J. Biol. Chem. 1973, <B>248</B>, p. 7670.
<BR>
<BR>
The presence of specific binding sites, termed receptors, on the surface
of target cells was a prerequisite for the action of EGF. These receptors
catch EGF and the EGF-receptor complex is taken into the cell. One important
step in the events leading to the biological action of EGF is the phosphorylation
of a specific amino acid tyrosine on the EGF receptor. <BR>
<BR>
The finding of tyrosine-specific autophosphorylation of the receptor was
a breakthrough in our understanding of how a signal from the outside reaches
the inside of the cell. It has later been shown that this event is a general
pathway through which many growth factors mediate their effects. <BR>
<BR>
The knowledge of the regulation of normal cell growth has provided new insights
into cell transformation and tumour growth. Studies on certain virus-induced
tumours have led to the discoveries of special genes, called oncogenes,
which play a role in the transformation of cells. Amongst these oncogenes
there is one, which codes for the synthesis of a protein with homology to
the EGF-receptor. Another oncogene product shows similarity with a later
discovered growth factor derived from the blood platelets (PDGF). As often
occurs, increased knowledge of normal events has led to an improved understanding
of disease. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Search for Other Growth Factors</B><BR>
<BR>
During the last decade, several growth factors have been isolated and characterized
by different research groups. For example, <I>somatomedin</I> or insulin-like
growth factor, which mediates the growth-promoting effect of growth hormone,
was isolated from human plasma. <I>Platelet derived growth factor</I> (PDGF)
was isolated and shown to stimulate growth of mesenchymal cells. <I>Interleukin-2</I>
was isolated and shown to promote growth of the lymphocytes of the immune
system. From tumours, <I>endothelial cell growth factor</I> (ECGF) was isolated
and shown to have similarities to the <I>fibroblast growth factor</I> (FGF).
<BR>
<BR>
All research groups who discovered &quot;new&quot; growth factors have followed
in the tracks of Levi-Montalcini and Cohen. In the research area of growth
factors and their biological action, Levi-Montalcini and Cohen have created
a scientific school with an increasing number of followers. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Clinical Application of NGF and EGF</B><BR>
<BR>
Clarification of the mechanisms regulating the growth and survival of cells
as well as their differentiation are of great interest to basic science.
However, this knowledge can be expected to improve our understanding of
the pathogenesis of several clinical disorders such as malformation and
errors of development, degenerative changes such as occur in senile dementia,
delayed wound healing, muscle dystrophy as well as tumour diseases. <BR>
<BR>
An important future field of NGF therapy is the possibility of enhancing
the reparative process after damage to nerves in the periphery as well as
in the central nervous system. The recent finding of NGF in the brain has
raised great expectation. An important pathway in the brain with acetylcholine
as a transmittor substance seems to be sensitive to NGF. <BR>
<BR>
In studies performed on animals, EGF has been shown to enhance the healing
of wounds in both skin and cornea. Limited amounts of human EGF have restricted
its use in humans. Only now that it is possible to produce recombinant EGF
have clinical trials been started. A future application of EGF to enhance
the repair of wounds in skin and cornea by, for example, local application
after damage or surgery can be anticipated. Autotransplantation of skin
would be improved if epithelial cells could be quickly cultivated outside
the body with the help of EGF. It would also be possible that antagonists
to EGF or antibodies to the EGF-receptors on the cell surface could be useful
in the treatment of tumours in which derangement of EGF or the EGF-receptor
is involved in their transformation. <BR>

<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="medicine-1986-1.gif" WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=198 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5>I was born in Brooklyn in 1922. Both my mother and father were Russian Jewish
emigrants who came to America in the early 1900's. My father was a tailor
and my mother, a housewife. Though of limited education themselves, they
instilled in me the values of intellectual achievement and the use of whatever
talents I possessed. <BR>
<BR>
I was educated in the public school system of New York City and was bright
enough to be accepted at Brooklyn College. Fortunately for me, my college
education was most thorough (I majored in both Biology and Chemistry). Perhaps
equally important was the fact that Brooklyn College was a city school and
had a policy of no tuition; the cost of an education would have been prohibitive
for my parents. <BR>
<BR>
My scientific interests throughout my undergraduate days were directed to
cell biology and especially the mysteries of embryonic development. I think
my one insight into these problems was the recognition that much could be
learned by the application of chemistry to biology. <BR>
<BR>
After working for a short period as a bacteriologist in a milk processing
plant to save enough money to go to graduate school, fellowships enabled
me to continue my education, first at Oberlin College, where I received
an M.A. in Zoology in 1945, and then in the Biochemistry Department at the 
University of Michigan where I received a Ph.D. in 1948. My Ph.D. thesis
concerned the metabolic mechanism by which the end product of nitrogen metabolism
in the earthworm is switched from ammonia to urea during starvation. I remember
spending my nights collecting over 5,000 worms from the University campus
green. <BR>
<BR>
I believe it was my ability to stomach-tube earthworms that convinced Dr.
Harry Gordon to offer me my first job in the Pediatrics and Biochemistry
Departments of the <A HREF="http://www.colorado.edu">University of Colorado</A>,
where I was involved in metabolic
studies of premature infants. <BR>
<BR>
Feeling the need to gain experience with the then emerging application of
radioisotope methodology to biological research, I left Colorado and went
to <A HREF="http://www.wustl.edu">Washington University</A> in 1952 to
work with Martin Kamen in the Department
of Radiology at Washington University as a postdoctoral fellow of the American
Cancer Society. I learned isotope methodology while studying carbon dioxide
fixation in frog eggs and embryos, and also derived a priceless education
participating in the journal club administered by Dr. <A HREF="medicine-1959.html">Arthur
Kornberg</A> who had just arrived at Washington University. <BR>
<BR>
In 1953 I became associated with the Department of Zoology under the leadership
of Viktor Hamburger at Washington University with a two-fold purpose in
mind. I joined with <A HREF="medicine-1986.html">Rita Levi-Montalcini</A>
to isolate a Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) that Dr. Levi-Montalcini had discovered
in certain mouse tumors and to become educated in the field of experimental
embryology. I leave it to Dr. Levi-Montalcini, with whom I am honored to
share this Nobel Award, to recount the results of our early collaboration.
<BR>
<BR>
I came to <A HREF="http://www.vanderbilt.edu">Vanderbilt University</A> 
in 1959 as an Assistant Professor in the
Biochemistry Department where I have been ever since, exploring the chemistry
and biology of epidermal growth factor (EGF) that is the subject of this
lecture. <BR>
<BR>
In 1976 I was appointed an American Cancer Society Research Professor and
in 1986 Distinguished Professor. The works recognized by this Nobel Prize
are clearly a group effort of achievement as may be seen from the names
associated with our publications on EGF. They share in this honor. I have
received much recognition during my research career and I am most grateful.<BR>

<H2><CENTER>RITA LEVI-MONTALCINI</CENTER>
</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="medicine-1986-2.gif" WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=198 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5>My twin sister Paola and I were born in Turin on April 22, 1909, the youngest
of four children. Our parents were Adamo Levi, an electrical engineer and
gifted mathematician, and Adele Montalcini, a talented painter and an exquisite
human being. Our older brother Gino, who died twelve years ago of a heart
attack, was one of the most well known Italian architects and a professor
at the University of Turin. Our sister Anna, five years older than Paola
and myself, lives in Turin with her children and grandchildren. Ever since
adolescence, she has been an enthusiastic admirer of the great Swedish writer,
the Nobel Laureate <A HREF="literature-1909.html">Selma Lagerl&ouml;f</A>,
and she infected me so much with her enthusiasm that I decided to become
a writer and describe Italian saga &quot;&agrave; la Lagerl&ouml;f&quot;.
But things were to take a different turn. <BR>
<BR>
The four of us enjoyed a most wonderful family atmosphere, filled with love
and reciprocal devotion. Both parents were highly cultured and instilled
in us their high appreciation of intellectual pursuit. It was, however,
a typical Victorian style of life, all decisions being taken by the head
of the family, the husband and father. He loved us dearly and had a great
respect for women, but he believed that a professional career would interfere
with the duties of a wife and mother. He therefore decided that the three
of us - Anna, Paola and I - would not engage in studies which open the way
to a professional career and that we would not enroll in the University.
<BR>
<BR>
Ever since childhood, Paola had shown an extraordinary artistic talent and
father's decision did not prevent her full-time dedication to painting.
She became one of the most outstanding women painters in Italy and is at
present still in full activity. I had a more difficult time. At twenty,
I realized that I could not possibly adjust to a feminine role as conceived
by my father, and asked him permission to engage in a professional career.
In eight months I filled my gaps in Latin, Greek and mathematics, graduated
from high school, and entered medical school in Turin. Two of my university
colleagues and close friends, <A HREF="medicine-1969.html">Salvador Luria</A>
and <A HREF="medicine-1975.html">Renato Dulbecco</A>, were to receive the
Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, respectively, seventeen and eleven
years before I would receive the same most prestigious award. All three
of us were students of the famous Italian histologist, Giuseppe Levi. We
are indebted to him for a superb training in biological science, and for
having learned to approach scientific problems in a most rigorous way at
a time when such an approach was still unusual. <BR>
<BR>
In 1936 I graduated from medical school with a summa cum laude degree in
Medicine and Surgery, and enrolled in the three year specialization in neurology
and psychiatry, still uncertain whether I should devote myself fully to
the medical profession or pursue at the same time basic research in neurology.
My perplexity was not to last too long. <BR>
<BR>
In 1936 Mussolini issued the &quot;Manifesto per la Difesa della Razza&quot;,
signed by ten Italian 'scientists'. The manifesto was soon followed by the
promulgation of laws barring academic and professional careers to non-Aryan
Italian citizens. After a short period spent in Brussels as a guest of a
neurological institute, I returned to Turin on the verge of the invasion
of Belgium by the German army, Spring 1940, to join my family. The two alternatives
left then to us were either to emigrate to the United States, or to pursue
some activity that needed neither support nor connection with the outside
Aryan world where we lived. My family chose this second alternative. I then
decided to build a small research unit at home and installed it in my bedroom.
My inspiration was a 1934 article by Viktor Hamburger reporting on the effects
of limb extirpation in chick embryos. My project had barely started when
Giuseppe Levi, who had escaped from Belgium invaded by Nazis, returned to
Turin and joined me, thus becoming, to my great pride, my first and only
assistant. <BR>
<BR>
The heavy bombing of Turin by Anglo-American air forces in 1941 made it
imperative to abandon Turin and move to a country cottage where I rebuilt
my mini-laboratory and resumed my experiments. In the Fall of 1943, the
invasion of Italy by the German army forced us to abandon our now dangerous
refuge in Piemonte and flee to Florence, where we lived underground until
the end of the war. <BR>
<BR>
In Florence I was in daily contact with many close, dear friends and courageous
partisans of the &quot;Partito di Azione&quot;. In August of 1944, the advancing
Anglo-American armies forced the German invaders to leave Florence. At the
Anglo-American Headquarters, I was hired as a medical doctor and assigned
to a camp of war refugees who were brought to Florence by the hundreds from
the North where the war was still raging. Epidemics of infectious diseases
and of abdominal typhus spread death among the refugees, where I was in
charge as nurse and medical doctor, sharing with them their suffering and
the daily danger of death. <BR>
<BR>
The war in Italy ended in May 1945. I returned with my family to Turin where
I resumed my academic positions at the University. In the Fall of 1947,
an invitation from Professor Viktor Hamburger to join him and repeat the
experiments which we had performed many years earlier in the chick embryo,
was to change the course of my life. <BR>
<BR>
Although I had planned to remain in St. Louis for only ten to twelve months,
the excellent results of our research made it imperative for me to postpone
my return to Italy. In 1956 I was offered the position of Associate Professor
and in 1958 that of Full Professor, a position which I held until retirement
in 1977. In 1962 I established a research unit in Rome, dividing my time
between this city and St. Louis. From 1969 to 1978 I also held the position
of Director of the Institute of Cell Biology of the Italian National Council
of Research, in Rome. Upon retirement in 1979, I became Guest Professor
of this same institute.

Press Release: The Nobel Prize for Literature 1986 </H3>
October 1986<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Wole Soyinka </H3>
This year's Nobel prize in literature goes to an African writer, Wole Soyinka
from Nigeria. Now in his early fifties, he has a large and richly varied
literary production behind him and is in his prime as an author. <BR>
<BR>
His background, upbringing and education have given him unusual conditions
for a literary career. He has his roots in the Yoruba people's myths, rites
and cultural patterns, which in their turn have historical links to the
Mediterranean region. Through his education in his native land and in Europe
he has also acquired deep familiarity with western culture. His collection
of essays<I> Myth, Literature and the African World  </I>make for clarifying
and enriching reading. <BR>
<BR>
The learning that the professor of literary science bears with him is in
no way an encumbrance to his literary works. They are vivid, often harrowing,
but are also marked by en evocative, poetically intensified diction. Soyinka
has been characterized as one of he finest poetical playwrights that have
written in English. <BR>
<BR>
Among his plays special mention can be made of <I>A Dance of the Forests</I>
 and<I> Death and the Kinq's Horseman.</I> The former is a kind of African
<I>Midsummer Night's Dream</I>  with spirits, ghosts and gods. There is
a distinct link here to the indigenous ritual drama and to the Elizabethan
drama. A key figure in Soyinka, the god Ogun, also appears in the play.
He is both creator and destroyer and as Soyinka sees him has traits that
lead one's thoughts to the Dionysian, the Apollonian and the Promethean
in European tradition.  <BR>
<I><BR>
Death and the King's Horseman</I>  is in the nature of an antique tragedy
with the cultic sacrificial death as theme. The relationship between the
unborn, the living and the dead, to which Soyinka reverts several times
in his works, is fashioned here with very strong effect. Soyinka confirms
his position as a centre of force in drama. <BR>
<BR>
In a play such as <I>A Play of Giants</I>  we find another side to Soyinka.
It is a dark farce, an aggressive writer's thrust in the service of common
sense. The introductory piece of prose is a caustic summing up of Africa's
agony. <BR>
<BR>
It has already been mentioned that Soyinka's plays have strong poetical
elements. In several collections of poems he has also appeared as a poet
of great distinction. One of the highlights is <I>Idanre, and Other Poems</I>,
 in which a central theme is the very thing that Ogun represents: the conflict,
perhaps the union, between destruction and creation. <BR>
<BR>
The collection of poems <I>A Shuttle in the Crypt  </I>shows real moral
stature. The poems were written during the writer's two years in prison,
to which he was sent because of his attitude in his country's civil war.
They are poems about mental survival, human contact, anger and forgiveness.
The same experiences lie behind his prose work <I>The Man Died: Prison Notes</I>,
 which in itself is a literary work of the first rank. <BR>
<BR>
Linguistically too Soyinka stands out as excellent. He possesses a prolific
store of words and expressions which he exploits to the full in witty dialogue,
in satire and grotesquery, in quiet poetry and essays of sparkling vitality.
<BR>
<BR>
Wole Soyinka's writing is full of life and urgency. For all its complexity
it is at the same time energetically coherent. <BR>

<CENTER><H2>Wole Soyinka</H2></CENTER>

<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="literature-1986-1.gif" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5><B>Wole Soyinka</B> was born on 13
July 1934 at Abeokuta, near Ibadan in western Nigeria. After preparatory
university studies in 1954 at Government College in Ibadan, he continued
at the University of Leeds, where, later, in 1973, he took his doctorate.
During the six  years spent in England, he was a dramaturgist at the Royal
Court Theatre in London 1958-1959. In 1960, he was awarded a Rockefeller
bursary and returned to Nigeria to study African drama. At the same time,
he taught drama and literature at various universities in Ibadan, Lagos,
and Ife, where, since 1975, he has been professor of comparative literature.
In 1960, he founded the theatre group, &quot;The 1960 Masks&quot; and in 1964,
the &quot;Orisun Theatre Company&quot;, in which he has produced his own plays
and taken part as actor. He has periodically been visiting professor at
the universities of Cambridge, Sheffield, and Yale. <BR>
<BR>
During the civil war in Nigeria, Soyinka appealed in an article for cease-fire.
For this he was arrested in 1967, accused of conspiring with the Biafra
rebels, and was held as a political prisoner for 22 months untill 1969.
<BR>
Soyinka has published about 20 works: drama, novels and poetry. He writes
in English and his literary language is marked by great scope and richness
of words. <BR>
<BR>
As dramatist, Soyinka has been influenced by, among others, the Irish writer,
J. M. Synge, but links up with the traditional popular African theatre with
its combination of dance, music, and action. He bases his writing on the
mythology of his own tribe-the Yoruba-with Ogun, the god of iron and war,
at the centre. He wrote his first plays during his time in London, <I>The
Swamp Dwellers</I> and <I>The Lion and the Jewel</I> (a light comedy), which
were performed at Ibadan in 1958 and 1959 and were published in 1963.  Later,
satirical comedies are <I>The Trial of Brother Jero</I> (performed in 1960,
publ. 1963) with its sequel, <I>Jero's Metamorphosis </I>(performed 1974,
publ. 1973), <I>A Dance of the Forests</I> (performed 1960, publ.1963),
<I>Kongi's Harvest</I> (performed 1965, publ. 1967) and <I>Madmen and Specialists</I>
(performed 1970, publ. 1971). Among Soyinka's serious philosophic plays
are (apart from &quot;<I>The Swamp Dwellers</I>&quot;) <I>The Strong Breed</I>
(performed 1966, publ. 1963), <I>The Road</I> ( 1965) and <I>Death and the
King's Horseman</I> (performed 1976, publ. 1975). In <I>The Bacchae of Euripides</I>
(1973),  he has rewritten the Bacchae for the African stage and in <I>Opera
Wonyosi</I> (performed 1977, publ. 1981),  bases himself on John Gay's <I>Beggar's
Opera</I> and Brecht's <I>The Threepenny Opera</I>.   Soyinka's latest dramatic
works are <I>A Play of Giants</I> (1984) and<I> Requiem for a Futurologist</I>
(1985). <BR><BR>

Soyinka has written two novels, <I>The Interpreters</I> (1965), narratively, 
a complicated work which has been compared to Joyce's and Faulkner's, in
which six Nigerian intellectuals discuss and interpret their African experiences,
and <I>Season of Anomy</I> (1973) which is based on the writer's thoughts
during his imprisonment and confronts the Orpheus and Euridice myth with
the mythology of the Yoruba. Purely autobiographical are <I>The Man Died:
Prison Notes</I> (1972) and the account of his childhood, <I>Ak&eacute;</I>
( 1981), in which the parents' warmth and interest in their son are prominent.
Literary essays are collected in, among others, <I>Myth, Literature and
the African World</I> (1975). <BR><BR>
Soyinka's poems, which show a close connection to his plays, are collected
in <I>Idanre, and Other Poems</I> (1967), <I>Poems from Prison</I> (1969),
<I>A Shuttle in the Crypt</I> (1972) and in the long poem, <I>Ogun Abibiman</I>
(1976). <BR>

<H2><br><br>THE NORWEGIAN NOBEL COMMITTEE</H2>
<br><br><br>
<P>
<h3 align="center">The Nobel Peace Prize for 1986</h3>
<P><br>
October 14, 1986
<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.nobel.no/indexen.html">The Norwegian Nobel 
Committee</A> has resolved
that the Nobel Peace Prize for 1986 should be awarded to the author, <B>Elie
Wiesel</B>. It is the Committee's opinion that Elie Wiesel has emerged as
one of the most important spiritual leaders and guides in an age when violence,
repression and racism continue to characterise the world. <BR>
<BR>
Wiesel is a messenger to mankind; his message is one of peace, atonement
and human dignity. His belief that the forces fighting evil in the world
can be victorious is a hard-won belief. His message is based on his own
personal experience of total humiliation and of the utter contempt for humanity
shown in Hitler's death camps. The message is in the form of a testimony,
repeated and deepened through the works of a great author. <BR>
<BR>
Wiesel's commitment, which originated in the sufferings of the Jewish people,
has been widened to embrace all repressed peoples and races. <BR>
<BR>
The Norwegian Nobel Committee believes that Elie Wiesel, with his message
and through his practical work in the cause of peace, is a convincing spokesman
for the view of mankind and for the unlimited humanitarianism which are
at all times necessary for a lasting and just peace. <BR>

<img src="peace-1986-1.gif" align=left vspace="5" hspace="10"><B>Elie Wiesel</B>
was born in 1928 in the town of Sighet, now part of Romania. During World
War II, he, with his family and other Jews from the area, were deported
to the German concentration and extermination camps, where his parents and
little sister perished. Wiesel and his two older sisters survived. Liberated
from Buchenwald in 1945 by advancing Allied troops, he was taken to Paris
where he studied at the Sorbonne and worked as a journalist. <BR>
<BR>
In 1958, he published his first book, <I>La Nuit</I>, a memoir of his experiences
in the concentration camps. He has since authored nearly thirty books some
of which use these events as their basic material. In his many lectures,
Wiesel has concerned himself with the situation of the Jews and other groups
who have suffered persecution and death because of their religion, race
or national origin. He has been outspoken on the plight of Soviet Jewry,
on Ethiopian Jewry and on behalf of the State of Israel today. <BR>
<BR>
Wiesel has made his home in New York City, and is now a United States citizen.
He has been a visiting scholar at Yale University, a Distinguished Professor

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences </A>has decided to award the1986 Alfred
Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences to Professor <b>James McGill Buchanan</B>,
George Mason University, Virginia, USA, for his development of the contractual
and constitutional bases for the theory of economic and political decision-making.
<BR>
<BR>
THIS YEAR'S ECONOMICS PRIZE AWARDED FOR A SYNTHESIS OF THE THEORIES OF POLITICAL
AND ECONOMIC DECISION-MAKING (PUBLIC CHOICE) <BR>
<BR>
<B>Summary<BR>
</B><BR>
This year's Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences is awarded
to James M. Buchanan for his contributions to the theory of political decision-making
and public economics. Traditional economic theory explains in great detail
how consumers and entrepreneurs make decisions regarding purchase of goods,
choice of work, production, investments, etc. In a series of studies, Buchanan
has developed a corresponding theory of decision-making in the public sector.
This comprehensive theoretical formulation which goes under the name the
New Political Economy or &quot;Public choice&quot;, and lies on the boundary
between economics and political science and has some of its origins in the
work of the Swedish economist Knut Wicksell. Buchanan's contribution is
that he has transferred the concept of gain derived from mutual exchange
between individuals to the realm of political decision-making. The political
process thus becomes a means of cooperation aimed at achieving reciprocal
advantages. But the result of this process depends on &quot;rules of the
game&quot;, i.e., the constitution in a broad sense. This in turn emhasizes
the vital importance of the formulation of constitutional rules and the
possibility of constitutional reforms. According to Buchanan, it is often
futile to advise politicians or influence the outcome of specfic issues.
In a given system of rules, the outcome is to a large extent detemined by
etablished political constellations. A relevant example is that those who
would like to correct individual tariffs should concentrate instead on the
fundamental rules of international trade, such as GATT regulations. <BR>
<BR>
For nearly forty years, James M. Buchanan has devoted himself to development
of the contractual and constitutional bases for the theory of economic and
political decision-making. In so doing, he has become the leading researcher
in the field which has come to be known as &quot;public choice theory&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
For a long time, traditional economics lacked an independent theory of political
decision-making. Modern welfare theory often relied on the premise that
public authorities could apply relatively mechanical methods to correct
different types of so-called market failures. Stabilization policy theory
- regardless of whether it was Keynesian or monetarist appeared to assume
that political authorities endeavored to achieve certain macroeconomic or
socioeconomic goals regarding employment, inflation or growth rates. Buchanan
and others in the public choice school have not accepted this simplified
view of political life. Instead, they have sought explanations for political
behavior that resemble those used to analyze behavior on markets. <BR>
<BR>
Individuals who behave selfishly on markets can hardly behave wholly altruistically
in political life. This results in analyses which indicate that political
parties or authorities that to at least some extent act out of self-interest,
will try to obtain as many votes as possible in order to reach positions
of power or receive large budget allocations. This type of analyses has
become universal in recent years, and is perhaps the most widely known aspect
of public choice theory. <BR>
<B><BR>
Principles of Unanimity</B><BR>
<BR>
Buchanan has extended the parallels between economic and political decision-making
even further. Market behavior is based primarily on voluntary agreements
and the exchange of goods and services which give rise to mutual advantages
for the agents in market transactions. A prerequisite of the market system,
however, is the establishment of a legal system that protects ownership
rights and the realization of contractual agrements.The political system
may also be regarded as a sytem based on voluntary agreements. <BR>
<BR>
Beginning with Knut Wicksell's early analysis of the relation between public
expenditures and taxes, Buchanan has formulated a theory of the public sector
and political decision-making based on the principle of unanimity. As a
result, decisions concerning the dimensioning and financing of collective
efforts may be regarded as the outcome of voluntary agreements among citizens.
Every citizen would thus in theory receive a welfare gain if the value,
to him, of collective measures exceeds what he must forego in the form of
taxes. <BR>
<BR>
In this perspective the political process becomes primarily a way of cooperating
to achieve mutual advantages - and not a means for redistributing resources
among individuals. Owing to the high costs of arriving at decisions, however,
the unanimity principle is difficult to apply in practice. The costs of
making decisions based on a high degree of mutual agreement have to be weighed
against the costs an individual faces when a majority decision goes against
him. It thus becomes imperative to distinguish between fundamental decisions
concerning the rules which govern future decisions on all kinds of issues
and the decisions themselves. <BR>
<BR>
Once constitutional rules are adopted, the outcome on concrete issues is
often given by the internal dynamics of the political system. Thus the design
of constitutional rules and the possibility of constitutional reforms take
on great importance. Attempts to advise paliticians or affect the outcome
of specific issues are often futile; for any given rule system, the outcome
is determined largely by prevailing political constellations. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The Importance or Fixed Rules<BR>
</B><BR>
Buchanan's foremost achievement is that he has consistently and tenaciously
emphasized the significance of fundamental rules and applied the concept
of the political system as an exchange process for the achievement of mutual
advantages. He has used his method with great success in the analysis of
many scecific problems and issues. Long before large budget deficits arose,
for exampel, he showed how debt financing dissolves the relation between
expenditures and taxes in the decision-making process. <BR>
<BR>
Developments over the last few decades have confirmed Buchanan's realistic
view of the scope of economic policy and the importance of continuously
reconsidering fundamental rules of the game, while retaining stable rules.
Economists now working in the area of stabilisation policy are much more
interested in fixed rules than they were a few decades ago when &quot;fine
tuning&quot; was in fashion. Earmarked taxes and qualified majority as methods
of achieving better correspondence between public expenditures and taxes
are now considerably more topical questions than they were twenty years
ago when attempts were made to restrict the political administrative decision-making
process as little as possible. <BR>
<B><BR>
Important Publications<BR>
</B><BR>
Buchanan's best-known work is probably <I>Calculus of Consent</I> (1962;
written in collaboration with his colleague Gordon Tullock). Different applications
are given in e.g. <I>Public Finance in a Democratic Process </I>(1966) and
<I>The Demand and Supply of Public Goods</I> (1968). <BR>
<BR>
Buchanan's visionary approach is presented in <I>The Limits of Liberty</I>
(1975) and <I>Freedom in Constitutional Contract. Perspectives of a Political
Economist</I> (1977). In more recent works, Buchanan has continued his analysis
of the tax state and systems of rules in <I>The Power to Tax </I>(1980;
with G. Brennan) and <I>The Reason of Rules</I> (1985; with G. Brennan).
<BR>
<BR>
In addition to these monographs, Buchanan has published numerous articles
in scientific Journals; collections have appeared in <I>What Should Economists
Do? </I>(1979) and <I>Liberty, Market and State</I> (1986).<BR>

Press Release: The 1985 Nobel Prize in Physics<BR>
<BR>
KUNGL. VETENSKAPSAKADEMIEN <BR>
THE ROYAL SWEDISH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES</H3>
16 October 1985<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.kva.se/">The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</A> has
decided to award the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1985 to Professor <B>Klaus
von Klitzing</B>, Max-Planck-Institute for Solid State Research, Stuttgart,
Federal Republic of Germany, for the discovery of the quantized Hall effect.<BR>
<BR>
KLAUS VON KLITZING HAS BEEN AWARDED THIS YEAR'S NOBEL PRIZE IN PHYSICS FOR
THE DISCOVERY OF THE QUANTISED HALL EFFECT 
<H3>Summary</H3>
When an electric current passes through a metal strip there is normally
no difference in potential across the strip if measured perpendicularly
to the current. If however a magnetic field is applied perpendicularly to
the plane of the strip, the electrons are deflected towards one edge and
a potential difference is created across the strip. This phenomenon, termed
the Hall effect, was discovered more than a hundred years ago by the American
physicist E.H. Hall. In common metals and semiconductors, the effect has
now been thoroughly studied and is well understood.<BR>
<BR>
Entirely new phenomena appear when the Hall effect is studied in <I>twodimensional
electron systems</I>, in which the electrons are forced to move in an extremely
thin surface layer between for example a metal and a semiconductor. Two-dimensional
systems do not occur naturally, but, using advanced technology and production
techniques developed within semiconductor electronics, it has become possible
to produce them.<BR>
<BR>
For the last ten years there has been reason to suspect that, in two-dimensional
systems, what is called Hall conductivity does not vary evenly, but changes
&quot;step-wise&quot; when the applied magnetic field is changed. The steps
should appear at conductivity values representing an integral number multiplied
by a natural constant of fundamental physical importance. The conductivity
is then said to be <I>quantised</I>. <BR>
<BR>
It was not expected, however, that the quantisation rule would apply with
a high accuracy. It therefore came as a great surprise when in the spring
of 1980 von Klitzing showed experimentally that the Hall conductivity exhibits
step-like plateaux which follow this rule with exceptionally high accuracy,
deviating from an integral number by less than 0.000 000 1.<BR>
<BR>
Von Klitzing has through his experiment shown that the quantised Hall effect
has fundamental implications for physics. His discovery has opened up a
new research field of great importance and relevance.<BR>
<BR>
Because of the extremely high precision in the quantised Hall effect, it
may be used as a standard of electrical resistance. Secondly, it affords
a new possibility of measuring the earlier-mentioned constant, which is
of great importance in, for example, the fields of atomic and particle physics.
These two possibilities in measurement technique are of the greatest importance,
and have been studied in many laboratories all over the world during the
five years since von Klitzing's experiment. Of equally great interest is
that we are dealing here with a new phenomenon in quantum physics, and one
whose characteristics are still only partially understood.<BR>

<BR>
<B>BACKGROUND INFORMATION<BR>
<BR>
The Movement of Electrons in Magnetic Fields</B><BR>
<BR>
Under the influence of a magnetic field an electron in a vacuum follows
a spiral trajectory with the axis of the spiral in the direction of the
magnetic field. In the plane perpendicular to the field, the electron moves
in a circle. In a metal or a semiconductor, the electron tends to move along
a more complicated closed trajectory, but with fairly strong magnetic fields
and at normal temperatures this ordered movement is fragmented by collisions.
At extremely low temperatures (a few degrees above absolute zero) and with
extremely strong magnetic fields, the effect of collisions is suppressed
and the electrons are again forced into ordered movement. Under these extreme
conditions the classical theory does not apply: the movement becomes <I>quantised</I>,
which means that the energy can only assume certain definite values, termed
Landau levels after the Russian physicist L. Landau (<A HREF="physics-1962.html">Nobel
prizewinner in 1962</A>) who developed the theory of the effect as early
as 1930.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Two-dimensional Electron Systems</B><BR>
<BR>
Two-dimensional material systems do not occur naturally. Under special circumstances,
however, certain systems can behave as if they were two-dimensional - but
only within very limited energy intervals and temperature ranges. The first
to demonstrate this possibility theoretically was J.R. Schrieffer (<A HREF="physics-1972.html">Nobel
prizewinner in 1972</A>). In work appearing in 1957 he showed that in a
surface layer between metal and semiconductor electrons can be made to move
along the surface but not perpendicular to it. Eleven years later a research
team at IBM showed that this idea could be realised experimentally. The
study of two-dimensional systems developed rapidly during the years that
have followed.<BR>
<BR>
These experiments used samples employing a specially designed transistor,
a so called MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor).
Other types of artificial samples - heterostructures - have subsequently
been used, in which the samples have been developed using molecular beams.<BR>
<BR>
It should also be mentioned that advances in technology and production methods
within semiconductor electronics have played a crucial role in the study
of two-dimensional electron systems, and were a precondition for the discovery
of the quantised Hall effect.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Quantised Hall Effect</B><BR>
<BR>
An important step in the direction of the experimental discovery was taken
in a theoretical study by the Japanese physicist T. Ando. Together with
his co-workers he calculated that conductivity could at special points assume
values that are integer multiples of e<sup>2</sup> /h, where e is the electron
charge and h is Planck's constant. It could scarcely be expected, however,
that the theory would apply with great accuracy.<BR>
<BR>
During the years 1975 to 1981 many Japanese researchers published experimental
papers dealing with Hall conductivity. They obtained results corresponding
to Ando's at special points, but they made no attempt to determine the accuracy.
Nor was their method specially suitable for achieving great accuracy.<BR>
<BR>
A considerably better method was developed in 1978 by Th. Englert and K.
von Klitzing. Their experimental curve exhibits well defined plateaux, but
the authors did not comment upon these results. The quantised Hall effect
could in fact have been discovered then.<BR>
<BR>
The crucial experiment was carried out by Klaus von Klitzing in the spring
of 1980 at the Hochfelt-Magnet-Labor in Grenoble, and published as a joint
paper with G. Dorda and M. Pepper. Dorda and Pepper had developed methods
of producing the samples used in the experiment. These samples had extremely
high electron mobility, which was a prerequisite for the discovery.<BR>
<BR>
The experiment clearly demonstrated the existence of plateaux with values
that are quantised with extraordinarily great precision. One also calculated
a value for the constant e<sup>2</sup> /h which corresponds well with the
value accepted earlier. This is the work that represents the discovery of
the quantised Hall effect.<BR>
<BR>
Following the original discovery, a large number of studies have been carried
out that have elucidated different aspects of the quantised Hall effect.
The national metrological (measurement) laboratories in Germany, the USA,
Canada, Australia, France, Japan and other countries have carried out very
detailed investigations of the precision of the quantisation, in order to
be able to use the effect as a standard.<BR>
<BR>
A new and entirely unexpected discovery was made at the beginning of the
1980's when a research team at the Bell Laboratories found plateaux corresponding
to the fractional numbers 1/3, 2/3, 4/3, 5/3, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 2/7..... multiplied
by the constant e<sup>2</sup> / h. This was the discovery of the <I>fractional
quantum Hall effect</I>. This concerns an entirely new type of quantum phenomenon,
in which the movements of the different electrons are very strongly linked
to each other. This effect is at present the subject of extensive experimental
and theoretical studies.<BR>

The prize is being awarded for a methodology because of the great importance
of this methodology for chemical research. Through Hauptman's and Karle's
fundamental achievements, the methods have been developed into practical
instruments for determining the structure of molecules within both inorganic
and organic chemistry - not least within the chemistry of natural products.<BR>
<BR>
The determination of structure involves generating a three-dimensional picture
of the positions of the atoms. The picture maps the electron density within
the crystal the density is greatest at the centre of the atoms. It can never
be less than zero anywhere, and this is the fact upon which the Hauptman-Karle
method is based.<BR>
<BR>
Structure determination employs radiation of so short a wavelength that
it becomes possible to &quot;see&quot; the atoms - X-rays are normally used
for this. This means that the wavelength must be shorter than the distance
between each atom. X-rays striking a crystal are deflected and concentrated
in different directions, and the intensity of the deflected rays is measured.
In order to determine the positions of the atom in a crystal, however, is
it not enough to know the direction and intensity of the rays, it is also
necessary to know the &quot;phase&quot; of each deflected ray, that is,
how much the waves in the different rays are displaced in relation to each
other.<BR>
<BR>
The fact that electron density is positive (electrons either exist or they
do not) limits the possibilities for phase displacement. Hauptman and Karle
have constructed systems of equations that are based on the values of the
intensities measured and that describe the limitations. The two scientists
have also developed a procedure for solving the equations: the solutions
give direct connections between the phases sought.<BR>
<BR>
Since the validity of each equation is only statistically probable, it is
necessary to make a large number of measurements and to obtain many times
more equations than the number of unknowns to be determined. While this
makes the determinations of phase more reliable, it entails comprehensive
calculations of the kind that are now feasible using modern computer techniques.<BR>
<BR>
The method is termed &quot;direct&quot; because of the fact that, in contrast
with other methods, it gives the structure directly from the data collected.<BR>
<BR>
In order to understand the nature of chemical bonds, the function of molecules
in biological contexts and the mechanism and dynamics of reactions, knowledge
of the exact molecular structure is absolutely necessary<BR>
<BR>
<B>Background Information</B><BR>
This year's Nobel prizewinners in Chemistry, Herbert A. Hauptman and Jerome
Karle, have developed what are termed &quot;direct methods&quot; for the
determination of crystal structure. This development of a method merits
a Nobel Prize since the method now plays an increasingly important role
in chemical research. It is therefore of importance to consider the method
first.<BR>
<BR>
As early as the turn of the century, chemists possessed a good understanding
of the geometrical arrangement of the atoms in carbon compounds. But it
is only through structure determination using X-ray crystallography that
we have been able to obtain a detailed picture of the distances between
the atoms and of the angles between the various bonds. Spectroscopy and
electron diffraction have played a complementary role, especially in the
case of simpler molecules.<BR>
<BR>
Until the 1960's it was determination of the arrangement of the atoms that
gave the most important new results. The whole of inorganic chemistry was
revolutionized, hitherto completely unknown principles of structure being
elucidated. Important progress was also made in natural product chemistry.
A series of Nobel prizes describes this development: <A HREF="physics-1914.html">von
Laue</A> in 1914,<A HREF="physics-1915.html"> the
Braggs</A>, father and son 1915, <A HREF="chemistry-1954.html">Pauling</A>
1954, <A HREF="chemistry-1962.html">Perutz and Kendrew</A> 1962, <A HREF="medicine-1962.html">Crick,
Watson and Wilkens</A> 1962, <A HREF="chemistry-1964.html">Hodgkin</A> 1964,
<A HREF="chemistry-1969.html">Barton and Hassel</A> 1969, <A HREF="chemistry-1976.html">Lipscomb</A>
1976 and <A HREF="chemistry-1982.html">Klug</A> 1982.<BR>
<BR>
Lipscomb combined structure determination with far-reaching studies of the
nature of chemical bonds, and it is precisely this theory of chemical bonding
that requires knowledge of the exact structure of molecules - in other words,
accurate bond distances and accurate bond angles.<BR>
<BR>
The need for exact knowledge of structure is great within two areas of chemistry.
One of these areas concerns structural problems, especially those associated
with the function of molecules in biological contexts. Here, a large number
of processes are considered in similar ways under the heading &quot;signal
- receptor processes&quot;. Examples of these processes are enzyme activity,
antigen - antibody and scent substance - scent receptor. For understanding
these signal-receptor processes it is necessary to gain as detailed a knowledge
as possible of both signal molecules and receptor molecules (active site).
The signal molecules are relatively small and their structure can be determined.
The structure of the receptor molecule can also be perceived by analogy
with low-molecular compounds. Where giant molecules are involved, structure
determination of the type for which Perutz and Kendrew received a Nobel
Prize is required. For determining the low-molecular signal molecules the
Hauptman-Karle direct method must be used.<BR>
<BR>
In the other important area, the mechanism and chemical dynamics of reactions
are studied. Questions being asked also by chemists working with organic
synthesis are, for instance: How, at molecular level, does a chemical reaction
take place? How does a molecule move, and how is the structure changed in
chemical reactions? The most important answers are coming from researchers
within theoretical chemistry, but these must in turn have accurate knowledge
of the structures of reacting molecules.<BR>
<BR>
To summarize: the last fifteen years have seen a large increase in structure
determinations accomplished within both inorganic and organic chemistry,
including natural product chemistry. These determinations have been carried
out predominantly using &quot;direct methods&quot;. Looking into the future
we can predict a further increased need for structure determinations of
this kind.<BR>
<BR>
While it is easy to explain the importance for chemistry of the two prizewinners'
development of the methods, it is considerably more difficult without recourse
to mathematical formulae to describe the achievement itself in a way that
is easy to understand.<BR>
<BR>
When X-rays strike a crystal, they will be deflected only in certain definite
directions, where the intensity of irradiation may be measured. To determine
the arrangement of atoms in a crystal, however, it is not enough to know
the direction and intensity. The &quot;phase&quot; of each ray so deflected
must also be known. In special cases, it has been possible to solve this
&quot;phase problem&quot; by making use of the fact that &quot;heavy&quot;
atoms containing many electrons spread the X-rays more strongly than &quot;light&quot;
atoms do. This property of heavy atoms is used both in &quot;Patterson methodology&quot;,
which has been very important in structural inorganic chemistry, and in
&quot;isomorph substition&quot;. The latter is used when determining the
structure of giant molecules such as proteins. In this case the heavy atoms
can be bound to the protein without its structure being appreciably altered.
This however is not possible for the large number of compounds.<BR>
<BR>
Two facts have created the conditions for the development of the &quot;direct&quot;
methods. The first is that electron density, which diffuses the X-rays,
can never be negative. The other is that the number of measurements is much
greater than the number of equations to be solved, which permits the use
of statistical methods. In work done between 1950 and 1956, Hauptman and
Karle laid the foundations for a rational exploitation of these possibilities,
specially the use of inequalities.<BR>
<BR>
The immense importance of this work for subsequent development may easily
be followed in the literature. This is not to say that Hauptman and Karle
alone are responsible for the development, and other names must be mentioned
in particular. Before Hauptman and Karle published their work, D. Harker
and J.S. Kasper proposed the use of one inequality, which represents a special
case in the Hauptman-Karle system, and determined a complicated structure
using it. Important conceptual contributions were also made by D. Sayre,
who anticipated the practical approach which has later come to be used.
Isabel Karle&#180;s and M. Woolfson's contributions to the practical utilization
of direct methods have been crucial, and in this connection the development
of fast computers has been a prerequisite for the full realization of the
value of the method.<BR>

<P><I>X-rays strike a crystal. The crystal contains a molecule, which is
repeated throughout the whole crystal in all directions. The crystal deflects
the x-rays in certain definite directions so that the radiation can be seen
as spots of different intensity such as in a photographic film. To determine
the structure the &quot;phase&quot; of each ray that is deflected must also
be known. This determination can be carried out by using the &quot;direct
methods&quot;.<BR>

</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="chemistry-1985-1.gif" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5>I was born in New York City on February 14, 1917, the oldest child of Israel
Hauptman and Leah Rosenfeld. I have two brothers, Manuel and Robert. <BR>
<BR>
I married Edith Citrynell on November 10, 1940. We have two daughters, Barbara
(1947) and Carol (1950). <BR>
<BR>
My interest in most areas of science and mathematics began at an early age,
as soon as I had learned to read, and continues to this day. I obtained
the B.S. degree in mathematics from the City College of New York (1937)
and the M.A. degree in mathematics from Columbia University (1939). <BR>
<BR>
After the war I made the decision to obtain an advanced degree and pursue
a career in basic scientific research. In furtherance of these goals I commenced
a collaboration with Jerome Karle at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington,
D.C. (1947) and at the same time enrolled in the Ph.D. program at the University
of Maryland. The collaboration with Dr. Karle proved to be fruitful because
his background in physical chemistry and mine in mathematics complemented
each other nicely. Not only did this combination enable us to tackle head-on
the phase problem of X-ray crystallography, but this work suggested also
the topic of my doctoral dissertation, &quot;An N-Dimensional Euclidean
Algorithm&quot;. By 1954 I had received my Ph.D. degree and Dr. Karle and
I had laid the foundations of the direct methods in X-ray crystallography.
Our 1953 monograph, &quot;Solution of the Phase Problem I. The Centrosymmetric
Crystal&quot;, contains the main ideas, the most important of which was
the introduction of probabilistic methods, in particular the joint probability
distributions of several structure factors, as the essential tool for phase
determination. In this monograph we introduced also the concepts of the
structure invariants and seminvariants, special linear combinations of the
phases, and used them to devise recipes for origin specification in all
the centrosymmetric space groups. The extension to the non-centrosymmetric
space groups was made some years later. The notion of the structure invariants
and seminvariants proved to be of particular importance because they also
serve to link the observed diffraction intensities with the needed phases
of the structure factors. <BR>
<BR>
In 1970 I joined the crystallographic group of the Medical Foundation of
Buffalo of which I was Research Director in 1972, replacing Dr. Dorita Norton.
My work on the phase problem continues to this day. During the early years
of this period I formulated the neighborhood principle and extension concept,
the latter independently proposed by Giacovazzo under the term &quot;representation
theory&quot;. These ideas laid the groundwork for the probabilistic theories
of the higher order structure invariants and seminvariants which were further
developed during the late seventies by myself and others. During the eighties
I initiated work on the problem of combining the traditional techniques
of direct methods with isomorphous replacement and anomalous dispersion
in the attempt to facilitate the solution of macromolecular crystal structures.
This work continues to the present time. More recently I have formulated
the phase problem of X-ray crystallography as a minimal principle in the
attempt to strengthen the existing direct methods techniques. Together with
colleagues Charles Weeks, George DeTitta and others, we have made the initial
applications with encouraging results. <BR>

<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="chemistry-1985-2.gif" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5>I was born in New York City in 1918 into a family that had a number of artistic
people among its members. My father's brother and a sister's husband were
probably the best known. The latter, Ivan Olinsky, taught for many years
at the Art Students' League in New York City. I have been told that my paternal
grandfather professionally made artistic decorations in peoples' homes.
The propensity for artistic endeavors extended to my generation and beyond.
<BR>
<BR>
My mother was an excellent pianist and organist and it was one of her hopes
that I would become a professional pianist. As a youth I was entered into
&quot;Music Week&quot; competitions in New York City. I had some modest
success, but found at an early age that I had no taste for public performance.
On the other hand, I was strongly attracted to science as a lifelong career
at an early age. <BR>
<BR>
I had the privilege of attending schools in the New York City public school
system. Their standards of education, character building and discipline
were very high and I, most certainly, benefited from them. They separated
out the more advanced students and permitted them to progress at their own
pace. In my case, this occasionally led to some curious circumstances. In
my senior year in high school (Abraham Lincoln), the girls would join the
boys to practice dancing. I was 14 years old at the time and the girls were
the usual 17 - 18 years old. The physical discrepancy between this 14 year
old boy and 17-18 year old girls was considerable. Their first reaction
was incredulity but after a while they got used to my presence and even
danced with me. I took the chemistry and physics courses that were available,
both taught by the same man. He recognized my interests and was very encouraging
to me. <BR>
<BR>
I enjoyed a number of sports that I participated in at every opportunity,
swimming in the ocean nearby, a game called single-wall handball, played
with a little hard black ball and well-known mainly in some metropolitan
areas, touch football whose rules eliminate the bruises from tackling and
ice-skating that was facilitated by the flooding of a huge parking lot by
the local fire department. <BR>
<BR>
I entered the City College of New York in 1933 and, at first, found it to
be a bit of a struggle. Their academic standards were very high and they
had a concentration of the best students in New York City. In addition,
I spent three hours a day traveling on the subway system to and from home.
This marked the end of piano practicing. City College had no tuition fee.
The only financial requirement was one dollar per year for a library card.
At the College, there were broad course requirements for all students that
ranged through mathematics, the physical sciences, the social sciences and
literature. There were even two years of compulsory public speaking courses.
I studied, in addition to the requirements, some additional mathematics,
some physics, and much chemistry and biology. The year after graduation
from City College was spent at Harvard University in the study of biology,
for which I received a master's degree, M.A., in 1938. <BR>
<BR>
After a brief hiatus, I went to work with the New York State Health Department
in Albany. While there, I had the opportunity to spend some time again at
the piano. At the time I was in Albany, the fluoridation of drinking water
was getting underway. I developed a procedure for determining the amount
of fluorine in water supplies that became a standard method. This was my
first modest contribution to science. <BR>
<BR>
It was my intention to save enough money while at the Health Department
to return to graduate school. This I did, and I entered the Chemistry Department
of the University of Michigan in 1940 where I met my wife, Isabella Lugoski,
whom I married in 1942, at an adjoining laboratory desk the first day that
I went to physical chemistry class. We were both attracted to physical chemistry
and took our degrees with Professor Lawrence O. Brockway whose speciality
was the investigation of gas-phase molecular structure by means of electron
diffraction. Although my Ph.D. degree was awarded in 1944, I had completed
all my work for it during the summer of 1943 and went off to work on the
Manhattan Project at the University of Chicago. Isabella joined me on this
project a few months later. <BR>
<BR>
In 1944, we returned to the University of Michigan, I went to work on a
project of the Naval Research Laboratory and Isabella as an instructor in
the Chemistry Department. While at the University of Michigan, I performed
some experiments on the structure of monolayers of long-chain hydrocarbon
films involved in the boundary lubrication of metallic surfaces. I also
derived a theory that explained the electron diffraction patterns obtained
from the oriented monolayers. <BR>
<BR>
In 1946 we both went to work permanently in Washington for the Naval Research
Laboratory. Our interest continued in developing the quantitative aspects
of gas electron diffraction analysis. The solution of a key problem that
arose in such analyses had evident implications for crystal structure analysis
and, in fact, other areas of structure determination. At about the time
that these matters were developing, Herbert Hauptman joined us at the Naval
Research Laboratory and we decided to pursue the implications for crystal
structures. This eventually led to the development of the direct methods
for crystal structure analysis with the major part of the mathematical foundations
and procedural insights established in the early 1950's. <BR>
<BR>
While all this was going on and with hardly missing a step from her research
activities, Isabella mothered three children, Louise in 1946, Jean in 1950,
and Madeleine in 1955. Louise is a theoretical chemist, Jean an organic
chemist and Madeleine is a museum specialist trained in geology. <BR>
<BR>
The initial applications of the procedure for structure determination for
centrosymmetric crystals involving probability measures and formulas derived
from the joint probability distribution were performed in the middle 1950's
in collaboration with colleagues at the U.S. Geological Survey. Then, in
the second half of the 1950's, through the efforts of Isabella Karle, an
experimental X-ray diffraction facility was established in our own laboratory.
<BR>
<BR>
During the 1960's, there was an intensive program in my laboratory to develop
a procedure for crystal structure determination of broad applicability that
would encompass noncentrosymmetric as well as centrosymmetric crystals.
Largely through the efforts of Isabella Karle, such a procedure was developed
and called the symbolic addition procedure. This procedure had its origins
in the theoretical work and the experience in practical application of the
1950's, but it also required some new procedural insights and some additional
theoretical work to make it efficient and broadly applicable and avoid the
pitfalls that easily arise when optimal pathways through a procedure must
be chosen on the basis of probability measures. The first application of
the symbolic addition procedure was published in 1963 and the first essentially
equal atom noncentrosymmetric crystal structure to be solved by direct phase
determination was published in 1964. This was followed by a number of exciting
applications and toward the end of the 1960's many laboratories started
to become interested in the potential of the direct method for structure
determination. <BR>
<BR>
During the 1960's, I collaborated with Isabella in some of her investigations
and derived with her a variance formula that was the basis for applying
probability measures to procedures for analyzing noncentrosymmetric crystals.
In addition, I also carried out a number of theoretical investigations.
Perhaps, the most useful one concerned a procedure for developing a fragment
of a structure into a complete one by use of the so-called tangent formula
for phase determination. <BR>
<BR>
During the 1950's and 1960's, I maintained an interest in gas electron diffraction
and made some experimental and theoretical studies of internal rotation
and coherent diffraction associated with excitation processes. The latter
was especially interesting, but required extensive experimental development
that the resources available to me did not permit. <BR>
<BR>
In the 1970's, I continued theoretical work in crystal structure analysis
that included the derivation of a &quot;tangent formula&quot; for phase
determination that was based on the more restrictive higher and higher order
determinants from the determinantal inequalities. I showed how joint probability
distributions relevant to crystallographic quantities could be put into
an exponential form and thereby decrease considerably problems with asymptotic
convergence. I also derived heuristic joint probability distributions based
on the determinants involved in the determinantal inequalities and obtained
from them formulas for evaluating triplet phase invariants and, later on,
formulas for the expected values of phase invariants and embedded semi-invariants
of any order, triplet, quartet, quintet, etc. The utility of phase invariants
of high order in phase determination has so far been rather limited, except
perhaps collectively in the high order determinants where they have been
useful for refining the values of approximately determined phase values.
<BR>
<BR>
I participated with Wayne Hendrickson of my laboratory in some refinements
of macromolecular structure with the use of the tangent formula and also
had some early participation with John Konnert and Wayne Hendrickson in
the constrained refinement technique for macromolecules. In collaboration
with John Konnert and Peter D'Antonio, procedures were developed for determining
atomic arrangements in amorphous materials based on criteria similar to
those applied to molecular vapors. Collaborations on structural problems
also included Judith Flippen-Anderson, Clifford George, Richard Gilardi
and Alfred Lowrey. <BR>
<BR>
At the end of the 1970's Wayne Hendrickson made some valuable advances in
the application of anomalous dispersion to the determination of macromolecular
structure that rekindled an interest that I formerly had in this subject.
I developed an exact, linear algebraic theory that includes any number and
type of anomalous scatterer and any number of wavelengths. It can also incorporate
information from isomorphous replacement measurements. Exact data give exact
values for the unknown quantities that include phase differences. I have
also been investigating the evaluation of triplet phase invariants to see
what their potential usefulness may be. This activity continues to the present
and is greatly facilitated by Stephen Brenner who has performed my programming
and computing for me since the early 1960's. <BR>
<BR>
In addition to participating in the development of new analytical methods
and their applications, I have taught from time to time, mathematics and
physics in the University College of the University of Maryland, I have
taken an active role in the affairs of crystallography over the years as,
for example, President of the International Union of Crystallography (1981-1984)
and have enjoyed having a laboratory that investigates a broad variety of
subjects ranging over gaseous molecules, amorphous solids, fibers, crystals
and crystalline macromolecules. <BR>
<BR>
During my entire married life I have had the strong support of my wife,
both technical and spiritual. I also deeply appreciate the supportive atmosphere
provided by the Naval Research Laboratory. This was especially helpful during
the early 1950's when a large number of fellow-scientists did not believe
a word we said. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Added m 1992: </I><BR>
<BR>
Since this biography was written in 1985, advances have been made in macromolecular
structure analysis by applications of the linear algebraic theory for the
multiwavelength anomalous dispersion technique that I published in 1980.
A number of such applications have been made by Wayne Hendrickson and colleagues
who, along with the applications, developed suitable techniques for the
use of synchrotron radiation and relatively weak anomalous scatterers. In
recent years, I have been concerned with additional developments in the
anomalous dispersion technique and have become interested in some aspects
of the solution of nonlinear simultaneous equations, the determination of
electron densities in crystals and some new approaches to phase determination
in crystal structure problems. <BR>
<BR>
Receipt of the Nobel Prize has given me the opportunity to have contact
to an unprecedented degree with young people who look forward to careers
in science and other intellectual and artistic pursuits. I have also had
many contacts with organizations whose purpose is to improve the quality
of life on this planet in a variety of contexts. These contacts have not
changed my earlier views, but, in many instances, have perhaps given some
of them a sharper focus. I would like to share a few. <BR>
<BR>
Societies must provide a framework of encouragement in which its children
can develop their skills fully and an educational system open to all in
which this can be achieved. In many societies with which I am familiar,
this would require a major change of priorities. Encouragement within the
family structure is also very important. <BR>
<BR>
This world has enormous social, economic and political problems, not the
least of which concern the environment and natural resources. The degradation
of the environment must be brought under control if there is to be a worthwhile
and sustainable quality of life for most people. This too will require a
reordering of priorities. It is very likely that continued population growth
will defeat any attempts to halt environmental degradation and the unconscionable
destruction of resources. Everyone has a responsibility in this regard.
<BR>
<BR>
Respect for the dignity of all human beings, if widespread, would go very
far toward relieving numerous social stresses that much too often lead to
societal deterioration and violence. <BR>
<BR>
Our world has a long way to go. <BR>
<BR>
Peace. <BR>

<A HREF="/mednobel/assembly.html">The Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska 
Institute</A>
has today decided to award the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for
1985 jointly to <BR>
<BR>
<B>Michael S. Brown and Joseph L. Goldstein</B><BR>
<BR>
for their discoveries concerning &quot;The Regulation of Cholesterol Metabolism&quot;
<BR>
<B><BR>
Summary<BR>
<BR>
Michael S. Brown</B> and <B>Joseph L. Goldstein</B> have through their discoveries
revolutionized our knowledge about the regulation of cholesterol metabolism
and the treatment of diseases caused by abnormally elevated cholesterol
levels in the blood. They found that cells on their surfaces have receptors
which mediate the uptake of the cholesterol-containing particles called
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) that circulate in the blood stream. Brown
and Goldstein have discovered that the underlying mechanism to the severe
hereditary familial hypercholesterolemia is a complete, or partial, lack
of functional LDL-receptors. In normal individuals the uptake of dietary
cholesterol inhibits the cells own synthesis of cholesterol. As a consequence
the number of LDL-receptors on the cell surface is reduced. This leads to
increased levels of cholesterol in the blood which subsequently may accumulate
in the wall of arteries causing atherosclerosis and eventually a heart attack
or a stroke. <BR>
Brown and Goldstein's discoveries have lead to new principles for treatment,
and prevention, of atherosclerosis. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Cholesterol - an important substance</B><BR>
<BR>
The cholesterol debate during the last decade may have given the public
the impression that cholesterol is something you have to avoid to survive.
This is, however, neither possible nor desirable: cholesterol is present
in all our tissues and is produced in the body. Cholesterol is also vitally
important for several of the normal processes in the body. <BR>
<BR>
Cholesterol originates from two main sources - from within through biosynthesis
predominantly in the liver, and from without through fat in the food. In
the liver as well as in the intestine cholesterol is packeted into particles
in such a way that it can be transported in the blood and lymphatic fluid.
These particles are called lipoprotein - a combination of fat and proteins.
There are different kinds of lipoproteins and they are classified on the
basis of their density as determined by ultracentrifugation: Low Density
Lipoproteins (LDL), Very Low Density Lipoproteins (VLDL) and High Density
Lipoproteins (HDL). The particles transporting cholesterol circulating in
the blood are LDL. <BR>
<BR>
LDL, the major cholesterol carrier in the blood, is a spherical particle
(Figure 1). Its core consists of some 1,500 cholesteryl esters, each a cholesterol
molecule attached by an ester linkage to a long fatty acid chain. The oily
core is shielded from the aqueous plasma by a coat composed of unesterified
cholesterol, phospholipid and one large protein molecule, apoprotein B.
The apoprotein B molecule moors the LDL to specific receptors on the cell
surface - the LDL-receptor. <BR>
<BR>
A normal healthy person has approximately 2 g cholesterol per liter plasma.
The highest abnormal values, approximately 10 g per liter, are found in
persons with a severe disease called familial hypercholesterolemia (FH),
which is an inborn error of metabolism. <BR>

<P><B>Figure 1</B>. The LDL is a spherical particle with a radius of one
millionth millimeter. Most of the cholesterol in the blood stream is found
in LDL particles. Its core consists of approximately 1,500 cholesteryl esters,
each a cholesterol molecule attached by an ester linkage to a long fatty
acid chain. The core is surrounded by a surface coat composed of 800 molecules
of phospholipid, 500 molecules of unesterified cholesterol and one large
protein molecule, apoprotein B, which moors the LDL to the receptor on the
cell surface. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Cholesterol is found in cell membranes and is converted to hormones and
bile acids</B><BR>
<BR>
Cholesterol has two main functions in the body. It constitutes a structural
component in cell membranes, and it is converted to certain steroid hormones
and bile salts. More than 90 per cent of the cholesterol in the body is
found in cell membranes. <BR>
<BR>
Each cell is surrounded by a membrane, the cell or plasma membrane. Its
function is not only to be a protective coat. It also serves as a border
control determining which substances are allowed to enter or leave the cell.
This function is sometimes facilitated by the presence of specific receptors
whereby certain molecules are efficiently trapped and taken up by the cell.
<BR>
<BR>
The cells either produce their own cholesterol or take up LDL circulating
in the blood stream. The discovery of the LDL-receptor by Brown and Goldstein
in 1973 was a milestone in cholesterol research. <BR>
<BR>
Several hormones are produced from cholesterol like estrogen and testosteron,
cortison and aldactone. Cholesterol is stored in cells of the adrenals and
gonads and can be utilized as soon as there is a requirement for these hormones.<BR>
<BR>
Cholesterol also takes part in the synthesis of vitamin D which prevents
development of rickets. Vitamin D is produced in the skin when exposed to
the sun's ultraviolet light. <BR>
<BR>
Another vital function of cholesterol is associated with food intake. Cholesterol
is converted into bile acids in the liver and is transported via the bile
to the upper intestine where the bile salts emulsify the dietary fat making
it absorbable. The bile salts then return to the blood stream and are taken
up by the liver and again secreted into the upper intestine. This recycling
of bile acids normally limits the liver's need for cholesterol. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Excess cholesterol accumulates in the walls of arteries</B><BR>
<BR>
As stated above cholesterol is of vital importance for the body. Thus, cholesterol
deficiency, a rare disease, causes severe damage particularly in the nervous
system. However, the most common abnormality in the cholesterol metabolism
is of the opposite kind. Excess cholesterol accumulates in the walls of
arteries forming bulky plaques that inhibit the blood flow until a clot
eventually forms, obstructing the artery and causing a heart attack or stroke.
<BR>
<BR>
The accumulation of cholesterol in the arterial walls is a slow process
lasting over decades. Among factors contributing and accelerating this process
are high blood pressure, a high intake of animal fat in the food, smoking,
stress and genetic factors. <BR>
<BR>
Studies on patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) by Michael S.
Brown and Joseph L. Goldstein constitute founding stones for our present
knowledge concerning the cholesterol metabolism. FH exists in different
forms and is inherited as a monogenic dominant trait. Individuals who carry
the mutant gene in double dose (homozygotes) are severely affected. Their
serum cholesterol levels are five times higher than in healthy persons,
and severe atherosclerosis and coronary infarction is seen already in adolescence,
or even earlier. Individuals who have inherited only one mutant gene (heterozygotes)
develop symptoms later in life - at 35 to 55 years of age. Their cholesterol
levels are approximately 2-3 times higher than in normal people. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Patients with FH lack functional LDL-receptors</B><BR>
<BR>
Brown and Goldstein studied cultured human cells (fibroblasts) from healthy
individuals and individuals with FH. Like all animal cells cultured fibroblasts
need cholesterol in their cell membranes. Cholesterol - in the form of LDL
- was found to be taken up by highly specific receptor molecules on the
cell surface - the LDL-receptor. The revolutionizing discovery was then
made that fibroblasts from patients with the most severe form of FH completely
lacked functional LDL-receptors. Fibroblasts from patients with the milder
form of FH had fewer LDL-receptors than normal - a reduction by half. <BR>
<BR>
Brown and Goldstein also discovered that the synthesis of cholesterol in
normal fibroblasts was inhibited when LDL-containing serum was added to
the cell culture. Fibroblasts from homozygous patients with FH were not
inhibited since they lacked functional LDL-receptors. Consequently their
intracellular synthesis could not be influenced. <BR>
<BR>
In later studies Brown and Goldstein showed that LDL which had bound to
the receptor was taken up by the cells as a LDL-receptor complex. The receptor
is localized on the cell surface in what is called a coated pit. The coated
pit invaginates and pinches off to form a coated vesicle (Figure 2). Fusion
of several vesicles gives rise to an endosome. The entire process is named
receptor-mediated endocytosis. The cholesterol in the LDL particle is released
inside the cell. One effect of the uptake of cholesterol is that it inhibits
the manufacture of new LDL-receptors on the cell surface. A reduced number
of LDL-receptors leads to a diminished LDL uptake. LDL then remains in the
blood stream with the risk of accumulation in the arterial walls. <BR>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="medicine-1985-press-2.gif" WIDTH="460" HEIGHT="361"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P><B>Figure 2</B>. The cells uptake of LDL particles circulating in the
blood (1) starts with their mooring to LDL-receptors in coated pits (2)
on the cell surface. These pits invaginate and pinch off to form coated
vesicles (3). Fusion of vesicles gives rise to an endosome (4) in which
the LDL dissociates from the receptor, which is recycled (5) to the surface.
The LDL is delivered to a lysosome where the cholesteryl ester is cleaved
to yield free cholesterol to be utilized for membrane synthesis or is converted
to steroid hormones and bile acids. Cholesterol taken up by the cell inhibits
the cell's own cholesterol synthesis. <BR>
<BR>
Brown and Goldstein have discovered a new, and unexpected way of regulation
of cholesterol metabolism. Normally cells have a high capacity to synthesize
their own cholesterol. With a low availability of cholesterol (LDL) in the
blood circulation the cells increase the number of LDL-receptors on their
surface. The concentration of LDL in the blood is thereby diminished. The
more LDL there is in the blood circulation the easier it is for the cells
to acquire it. With a high dietary fat intake an excess of LDL circulates
in the blood. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The discoveries have resulted in new approaches for the treatment of
atherosclerosis</B> <BR>
<BR>
The discovery of the LDL-receptor has broadened our understanding of cholesterol
metabolism considerably and explained the mechanism behind familial hypercholesterolemia.
<BR>
<BR>
Brown and Goldstein have used modern molecular biology techniques to show
that the LDL-receptor is a glycoprotein located in the cell membrane. Its
protein part is constructed by 839 amino acids. Of these 767 are localized
on the cell surface, 22 within the membrane and 50 inside the cell in the
cytoplasma (Figure 3). The LDL-receptor defect can be one of several different
kinds: in some cases the receptor is completely lacking, in others LDL binds
poorly, or not at all, to receptor and in still others LDL is bound to the
receptor but the LDL-receptor complex is not internalized. Analysis of the
LDL-receptor in two patients have shown changes in the intracellularly located
protein part of the glycoprotein: in one patient out of the expected number
of 50 amino acids only two were present, in another 6 &quot;correct&quot;
but 8 &quot;wrong&quot; amino acids were present. The part of the receptor
located on the cell surface was unaltered in both patients. <BR>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="medicine-1985-press-3.gif" WIDTH="454" HEIGHT="348"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P><B>Figure 3</B>. LDL-receptors, one healthy and two abnormal. The part
of the receptor localized outside the cell membrane is identical in all
three cases. The difference is found in the portion of the receptor inside
the cell membrane. The healthy receptor is to the left in the figure. When
the LDL via its apoprotein moors to the receptor it is internalized by the
normal healthy receptor. The two abnormal receptors are unable to complete
the internalization. <BR>
<BR>
The severe form of FH (homozygous) is rare, about one in a million people.
The milder form of FH (heterozygous) is much more common, about one in 200-500
people. This means that in a city like Stockholm several thousand inhabitants
have the disease with its associated risks of atherosclerosis and heart
infarction. <BR>
<BR>
Brown and Goldstein have introduced entirely new principles for treatment
of FH based on their discovery of the LDL-receptor. In individuals with
the milder heterozygous form of FH the number of LDL-receptors has been
increased using drugs - cholestyramine and mevinolin. Such treatment has
been found to lower blood cholesterol levels. In the more severe homozygous
form of FH, where functional LDL-receptors are missing, medication is no
therapeutic alternative. There liver transplantation has been tried. A severely
ill 6 year old girl, who already had suffered several heart attacks, was
given a new liver and heart simultaneously. More than six months after the
operation her blood cholesterol levels were in the range of 3 g per liter
compared to 12 g per liter before the liver transplantation. <BR>
<BR>
The discoveries made by Brown and Goldstein have drastically widened our
understanding of the cholesterol metabolism and increased our possibilities
to prevent and treat atherosclerosis and heart attacks. But their discoveries
have even more far-reaching implications. Coronary infarction is a major
cause of death in most industrialized countries. The disease is caused by
hereditary and environmental factors, which together cause a reduction of
the number of LDL-receptors. This increases the blood levels of LDL and
thereby the risk for atherosclerosis. Brown and Goldstein's revolutionary
results have widened our horizon and holds promise for future fascinating
developments. They speculate themselves about therapy with drugs that increase
the number of LDL-receptors simultaneous with a lesser demand for dietary
regimens......&quot;it may one day be possible for many people to have their
steak and live to enjoy it too&quot;.<BR>

<H2><CENTER>MICHAEL S. BROWN</CENTER>
</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="medicine-1985-1.gif" WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=198 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5><B>Michael S. Brown</B> was born on April 13, 1941, in Brooklyn, New York,
the eldest child of Harvey Brown, a textile salesman, and Evelyn Brown,
a housewife. His sister Susan was born three years later. When Brown was
11 years old the family moved to Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, a suburb of
Philadelphia, where Brown attended Cheltenham High School. An amateur radio
operating license obtained at age 13 led to a life-long fascination with
science. A serious interest in journalism also developed early. These two
passions, science and writing, have remained paramount ever since. <BR>
<BR>
Brown graduated in 1962 from the College of Arts and Sciences of the University
of Pennsylvania, with chemistry as his major subject. He spent most of his
time at the headquarters of the student newspaper, the Daily Pennsylvanian,
where he served as features editor and briefly as editor-in-chief. In 1966
Brown received his M.D. degree from the University of Pennsylvania School
of Medicine. In 1964 he married Alice Lapin, a companion from childhood.
The next two years were spent as intern and resident in Internal Medicine
at the <A HREF="http://www.mgh.harvard.edu">Massachusetts General 
Hospital</A> in Boston. Here Brown met <A HREF="medicine-1985.html">Joseph
L. Goldstein</A>, a fellow intern, and the two established the friendship
and mutual respect that led to their long-term scientific collaboration.
<BR>
<BR>
The years 1968-1971 were spent at the <A 
HREF="http://www.nih.gov">National Institutes of Health</A> where
Brown served initially as Clinical Associate in gastroenterology and hereditary
disease. He then joined the Laboratory of Biochemistry, headed by Earl R.
Stadtman, a pioneer in the disclosure of the mechanisms by which enzymes
are regulated. Here Brown learned the techniques of enzymology and the fundamental
principles of metabolic regulation. Brown made an important contribution
to the Stadtman effort when he and a colleague discovered that a regulatory
enzyme in the glutamine synthetic pathway was controlled by covalent attachment
of a nucleotide, uridine. <BR>
<BR>
In 1971 Brown joined the division of Gastroenterology in the Department
of Internal Medicine at the <A
HREF="http://www.swmed.edu/home_pages/publish/sms_catalog/1smscat.html">University
of Texas Southwestern Medical School</A>
in Dallas. His selection of Dallas was strongly motivated by his friendship
with Goldstein, who had graduated from the Southwestern Medical School.
In Dallas, Brown came under the influence of Donald W. Seldin, Chairman
of the Department of Internal Medicine, an inspirational figure whose passion
for medical science shaped the lives of a generation of Texas students.
<BR>
<BR>
Soon after his arrival in Dallas, Brown succeeded in solubilizing and partially
purifying 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, a previously
enigmatic enzyme that catalyzes the rate-controlling enzyme in cholesterol
biosynthesis. He and Goldstein had developed the hypothesis that abnormalities
in the regulation of this enzyme were the cause of familial hypercholesterolemia,
a genetic disease in which excess cholesterol accumulates in blood and tissues.
The formal scientific collaboration with Goldstein began one year later,
in 1972, just after Goldstein returned to Dallas from a postdoctoral fellowship
in Seattle. The two young physicians initially maintained separate laboratories,
but by 1974 the laboratories had been formally joined. <BR>
<BR>
Throughout the decade of the 1970's, when their scientific work was most
intensive, Brown and Goldstein continued to function as academic physicians,
each performing clinical attending rounds on the general medicine wards
of Parkland Memorial Hospital for six to twelve weeks per year. They also
conducted frequent teaching rounds in medical genetics. Their research efforts
were aided by a number of talented senior collaborators and junior associates,
as well as by frequent interchange with interested members of the Department
of Internal Medicine. <BR>
<BR>
In 1974, Brown was promoted to the rank of Associate Professor of Internal
Medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School. He became
a Professor in 1976. In 1977 he was appointed Paul J. Thomas Professor of
Medicine and Genetics, and Director of the Center for Genetic Disease at
the same institution. In 1985, Brown was appointed Regental Professor of
the University of Texas. <BR>
<BR>
Brown was elected to membership in the <A 
HREF="http://www2.nas.edu/nas">National Academy of Sciences</A> of the
United States in 1980. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences, the American Society for Clinical Investigation, the Association
of American Physicians, the American Society of Biological Chemists, and
the American Society for Cell Biology. He is a Diplomate of the American
Board of Internal Medicine and a Fellow of the American College of Physicians.
<BR>
<BR>
Brown received several student awards at the University of Pennsylvania,
including a Proctor and Gamble Scholarship (1958-1962), the David L. Drabkin
Prize in Biochemistry (1962), and the Frederick L. Packard Prize in Internal
Medicine (1966). He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and Alpha Omega Alpha.
From 1974 to 1977 he was an Established Investigator of the American Heart
Association. He has served on several review boards including the Molecular
Cytology Study Section of the National Institutes of Health (1974-77)
and the editorial boards of the <I>Journal of Lipid Research</I>, the <I>Journal
of Cell Biology</I>, <I>Arteriosclerosis</I> and <I>Science</I>. He has
been a member of the Board of Scientific Advisors of the Jane Coffin Childs
Fund since 1980. <BR>
<BR>
Brown received the honorary degree of Doctor of Science from the University
of Chicago (1982) and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (1982). With his
colleague, Goldstein, Brown has shared the following awards: Heinrich Wieland
Prize for Research in Lipid Metabolism (1974); Pfizer Award for Enzyme Chemistry
of the American Chemical Society (1976); Albion O. Bernstein Award of the
New York State Medical Society (1977); Passano Award (1978); Lounsbery Award
of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (1979); Gairdner Foundation International
Award (1981); New York Academy of Sciences Award in Biological and Medical
Sciences (1981); Lita Annenberg Hazen Award (1982); V.D. Mattia Award of
the Roche Institute of Molecular Biology (1984); Distinguished Research
Award of the Association of American Medical Colleges (1984); Research Achievement
Award of the American Heart Association (1984); Louisa Gross Horwitz Award
(1984); 3M Life Sciences Award of the Federation of American Societies for
Experimental Biology (1985); William Allan Award of the American Society
of Human Genetics (1985); and the Albert D. Lasker Award in Basic Medical
Research (1985). <BR>
<BR>
Brown and Goldstein jointly delivered the following lectures: Harvey Lecture
(1977); Christian A. Herter Lectures at Johns Hopkins University (1979);
Harry Steenboch Lectures at the University of Wisconsin at Madison (1980);
Smith, Kline, and French Lectures at the University of California, Berkeley
(1981); Duff Memorial Lecture of the American Heart Association (1981);
Doisy Lectures at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (1983);
the first Pfizer Lecture in Honor of Konrad Bloch at Harvard University
(1985); and the Berzelius Lecture at the Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm
(1985). <BR>
<BR>
Brown and his wife, Alice, have two daughters: Elizabeth (born in 1973)
and Sara (born in 1977).

<H2><CENTER>JOSEPH L. GOLDSTEIN</CENTER>
</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="medicine-1985-2.gif" WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=198 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5><B>Joseph L. Goldstein</B> was born on April 18, 1940, in Sumter, South
Carolina, the only son of Isadore E. and Fannie Alpert Goldstein. The family
owned and operated a clothing store in Kingstree, South Carolina, a town
of 5000 people. After his education in the primary and secondary public
schools of Kingstree, Goldstein attended Washington and Lee University in
Lexington, Virginia, and received the B.S. degree in chemistry, <I>summa
cum laude</I>, in 1962. He then attended <A 
HREF="http://www.swmed.edu/home_pages/publish/sms_catalog/1smscat.html">Southwestern 
Medical School</A> of
the <A HREF="http://www.swmed.edu">University of Texas Health Science Center</A> in
Dallas where he was 
inspired
to pursue a career in academic medicine by Donald W. Seldin, then and now
Chairman of the Department of Internal Medicine. During his last year in
medical school, Seldin offered Goldstein a future faculty position if he
would become trained in genetics and return to Dallas to establish a division
of medical genetics in the Department of Internal Medicine. After receiving
the M.D. degree in 1966, Goldstein moved to Boston where he was an Intern
and Resident in Medicine at the <A HREF="http://www.mgh.harvard.edu">
Massachusetts General Hospital</A> (1966-68).It was at the Massachusetts 
General Hospital that Goldstein first met and
developed a friendship with <A HREF="medicine-1985.html">Michael S. Brown</A>,
his long-term scientific collaborator. <BR>
<BR>
After completion of his medical training, Goldstein spent two years (1968-70) at the <A 
HREF="http://www.nih.gov">National Institutes of Health</A>, where he 
worked in the laboratory
of <A HREF="medicine-1968.html">Marshall W. Nirenberg</A> and also served
as a clinical associate at the National Heart Institute. The opportunity
to work in a first-rate basic science laboratory while at the same time
carrying a limited clinical responsibility proved highly influential in
shaping Goldstein's career. In Nirenberg's laboratory, Goldstein and his
colleague C. Thomas Caskey isolated, purified, and worked out the mechanism
of action of several proteins required for termination of protein synthesis.
Here he acquired scientific skills and taste, experienced the thrill of
discovery and the excitement of science, and appreciated the power of a
molecular biology approach to human disease. As a clinical associate, Goldstein
served as physician to the patients of Donald S. Fredrickson, then Clinical
Director of the National Heart Institute and an expert on disorders of lipid
metabolism. His curiosity about hypercholesterolemia was aroused when he
cared for patients with the striking clinical syndrome of homozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia. These patients were intensively discussed with Brown.
In view of his and Brown's common interest in metabolic disease, Goldstein
convinced his colleague to join him as a faculty member at the University
of Texas Health Science Center at Dallas, where they would work collaboratively
on the genetic regulation of cholesterol metabolism. While at the National
Institutes of Health, Goldstein and Brown became avid duplicate bridge players.
Their successful bridge partnership proved to be a valid testing ground
for their future scientific partnership. <BR>
<BR>
Before returning to Dallas, Goldstein spent two years (1970-72) as a Special
NIH Fellow in Medical Genetics with Arno G. Motulsky at the <A
HREF="http://www.washington.edu">University of Washington</A> in Seattle. Motulsky
was one
of the creators of human genetics
as a medical specialty. In Seattle, Goldstein initiated and completed a
population genetic study to determine the frequency of the various hereditary
lipid disorders in an unselected population of heart attack survivors. He
and his colleagues discovered that 20% of all heart attack survivors have
one of three single-gene determined types of hereditary hyperlipidemia.
One of these disorders was the heterozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia,
which was found to affect 1 out of every 500 persons in the general population
and 1 out of every 25 heart attack victims. During his fellowship in Seattle,
he became conversant with tissue culture techniques, which proved to be
invaluable in the subsequent studies with Brown. <BR>
<BR>
In 1972, Goldstein returned to the University of Texas Health Science Center
at Dallas, where he was appointed Assistant Professor in Seldin's Department
of Internal Medicine and head of the medical school's first Division of
Medical Genetics. He became Associate Professor of Internal Medicine in
1974 and Professor in 1976. In 1977, he was made Chairman of the Department
of Molecular Genetics at the University of Texas Health Science Center at
Dallas and Paul J. Thomas Professor of Medicine and Genetics, a position
that he currently holds. In 1985, he was named Regental Professor of the
University of Texas. <BR>
<BR>
Goldstein was elected to membership in the <A
HREF="http://www2.nas.edu/nas">National Academy of Sciences</A>
in 1980. He is also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,
Association of American Physicians, American Society for Clinical Investigation
(President, 1985-86), American Society of Biological Chemists, American
Society of Human Genetics, American Society for Cell Biology, and the American
Federation for Clinical Research (National Council, 1979-82). He is also
a Fellow of the American College of Physicians and is a Diplomate of the
American Board of Internal Medicine. Goldstein has served on study sections
for the American Heart Association (1975-78) and the National Institutes
of Health (1975-78). He served on the Scientific Review Board of the Howard

<H3>Claude Simon</H3>
Claude Simon began to be noticed in earnest at the end of the 1950s in connection
with the great interest in the so-called &quot;new novel&quot; in France.
The term had been introduced by the critic Roland Barthes and was effectively
launched a few years later by Alain Robbe-Grillet. The idea behind the term
was to collect a group of French prose writers with little else in common
except that they were against the more conventional fiction and broke its
rules that a novel should have a continuous and realistic story and move
along in a lucid and coherent way in time. The new storytellers in France
linked up with other traditions, with patterns from poetry and the visual
arts and with forerunners such as <A HREF="literature-1949.html">Faulkner
</A>and Proust. Their prose works had the appearance of linguistic montages
or collages. They took place in the dimensions of memory and the apparently
arbitrary or free association. Fragments from different times were closely
joined on the basis of their content or emotional correspondences or aesthetic
effects, but not on the basis of how they might have followed each other
in the ordinary course of time. Influences from the visual arts were strongly
in evidence. In a picture everything is contemporaneous. The flow of things
that follow each other is brought about by the beholder's attention and
co-creative feeling moving over what actually exists as a single coherent
now. This abstract description can fairly well cover what seemed to unite
the advocates of &quot;le nouveau roman&quot;. In its general form it still
applies to Claude Simon and his prose. However, the writers who used to
be included under this term were very unlike each other, with very different
aims and commitments in their linguistic work. And they did oppose being
lumped together in a group as happened. <BR>
<BR>
Claude Simon had begun with several partly autobiographical novels from
the middle of the 1940s up to the middle of the 1950s. These works, nowadays
little read, nevertheless heralded his later production, among other things
in the feeling for the tragic and absurd in the human condition. The narrative
method was however almost traditional, but influenced by Faulkner. The change
in Simon's author-character came with the novels <I>Le Vent</I>, 1957, and<I>
L'Herbe</I>, 1958. He himself counts the latter as the turning point in
his writing. Both stories take place in the South of France, where Simon
himself has his roots and lives as a viticulturist. The principal character
in<I> Le Vent </I> is akin to the one in Dostoievsky's &quot;The Idiot&quot;
- a mysteriously complex man, at once confused and discerning, exposed to
the fascination and inquisitive provocations and cruelties of his fellow
men. He returns to the small town in the South of France to take over a
bequest, a farm - and is caught up in absurd conflicts of various kinds,
financial, erotic, and those involving prestige and the struggle for  power.
And over it all howls the hot mistral, the wind that fills the people with
its everlasting, parching, dusty indefatigability - an inhuman element in
which the people live as if, despite their activities and meddling, they
are imprisoned in conditions which are more lasting and more powerful than
themselves. In both these novels the author weaves a close and evocative
web of words, of events and environments, of memories, thoughts, associations,
with glidings and joins of elements according to a logic different from
what the realistic continuity in time and space prescribes. Here we perceive
how Claude Simon's linguistic art and peculiarity take shape, such as we
shall recognize his prose in later works. The language begins to live its
own life. Each word and description leads on to the next. Elucidations,
amplifications, developments of thoughts and memories and pictures, nuances,
corrections with the insertion of alternatives and possibilities, etc. cause
the text to grow as if the language were an independently living organism
which buds, puts out tendrils and sows seeds of its own accord and as if
the author were a tool or a medium for its own creative force. <BR>
<BR>
So too has Claude Simon himself described his way of working, especially
after his experiences when writing the book <I>Histoire</I>, 1967 nothing
short of a rapturous awareness of the sensual life and charm in giving oneself
up to linguistic work and its surprises and seductions. The book is one
of the peaks in Simon's writing, perhaps the work in which his linguistic
peculiarity is most clearly evident. <BR>
<BR>
It was preceded by two other novels, in which we can find some of the basic
themes that constantly recur in Claude Simon's novels, also in <I>Histoire
- La Route des Flandres,</I> 1960, and <I>Le Palace</I>, 1962. The first
of these two novels made Simon's name internationally. It is a broad and
complex description with strongly autobiographical touches and with memories
and traditions from Simon's family. The story is thought to take place during
the night that &quot;the hero&quot;, Georges, spends with his mistress,
Corinne - and this alone is a radical break with all realist narrative methods.
The profusely flowing narration, its fragmentations and piling up of parallel
actions and its discontinuous joining of scenes and of stories within stories
burst the framework for every realistic narrative art in the traditional
sense. The novel takes the shape of a penetrating description of the French
collapse in 1940, when Simon himself took part as a cavalryman - ending
up in due course as a prisoner-of-war. Simon's experiences during this war,
like during the Spanish Civil War in which he took part in 1936, have been
of immense importance to him, constantly recurring in his writings. Cruelty
and absurdity are the dominating things - unforeseeable. What is apparently
well-planned ends in confusion and dissolution, in which each one lives
through his hardships and has to save himself as best he can. Simon's experiences
from the Spanish Civil War were similar, depicted in <I>Le Palace</I> and
his latest and most important novel, <I>Les Georgiques</I>, 1981. For all
the sympathies which he and others might have for those faithful to the
government who fought against the fascists, it soon turned out that these
government champions for their part, could by no means follow any regular
and intelligently planned strategies and operations. On the contrary, the
fighters were split into factions and mutual strife, giving way to meaningless
and absurd foolhardiness, obstructions and hazardous enterprises. In<I>
Les Georgiques  </I>George Orwell appears, thinly disguised. Simon's picture
of the Spanish Civil War and of the intellectual idealists who like Orwell,
and his English sympathizers, wanted to find an ideologically clear reason
in the fight against oppression, shapes itself into a version, at once grotesque
and tragic, compassionate and ironic, of war's reality and of man's inability
to guide his fate and correct his conditions. <I>La Route des Flandres</I>
 and <I>Les Georgiques  </I>are richly decorated compositions which, with
sensuous perspicacity and linguistic invocation, conjure up an extremely
complicated pattern of personal memories and family traditions, of experiences
during modern war and of equivalents from bygone ages, to be exact the Napoleonic
era. In other contexts Simon goes still farther back -  to Caesar's fight
against Pompey in 43 B.C. (in the novel <I>La Bataille de Pharsale</I>,
1969). The parallels are the same the cruelty, the violence and the absurdity
are common to all, likewise the painful compassion and feeling that the
author expresses in paradoxical contrast to the fascination that these phenomena
obviously have for him. A similar feeling is characteristic of Simon's descriptions
of erotic relationships, more rightly the sexual. In these contexts too
there is a fascination or a fixation with violence and violation. The sexual
contacts appear as conquests, the taking in possession, mountings which
resemble what stallions and mares do, or outrages resembling what occurs
in battle. A tragic feeling of life emerges also here - a picture of human
loneliness and of how people are exposed to destructive passions and selfish
impulses, disguised as vain striving for fellowship and intimacy . <BR>
<BR>
Against these grim descriptions are contrasting elements of another kind
- of tenderness and loyalty, of devotion to work and duty, to heritage and
traditions and solidarity with dead and living kinsmen. In particular there
appears as a contrast of a consoling or edifying kind the devotion to such
as grows and sprouts independent of man's lust for power and overweening
enterprise. There is a growth which lives by its own power, despite what
men can do. The best people in Simon's novels are those who subordinate
themselves to this growth and serve it. We meet some old women, loyal to
farm and family and traditions. We even meet in the brutal and at last disillusioned
warrior a loyal love for his dead young wife. We meet a serving and a patient
endurance which, without any self-important airs, is reflected within these
people, which lives with them even if otherwise in their ostentatious deeds
and ways they seem filled with egoism and brutality. <BR>
<BR>
First and foremost we meet this growth, this vitality and this creativeness
and this viability in language and memory, in the shaping, the renewal and
the development of what is and was and what rises again inspired and alive
through the pictures in words and story for which we seem to be more instruments
than masters. Claude Simon's narrative art may appear as a representation
of something that lives within us whether we will or not, whether we understand
it or not, whether we believe it or not - something hopeful, in spite of
all cruelty and absurdity which for that matter seem to characterize our
condition and which is so perceptively, penetratingly and abundantly reproduced
in his novels. <BR>

<H3>THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR PEACE, 1985</H3>
<I>Speech delivered by Egil Aarvik, Chairman of the <A 
HREF="http://www.nobel.no/indexen.html">Norwegian
Nobel Committee</A>, on the occasion of the award of the Nobel Peace Prize
for 1985, Oslo, December 10, 1985. </I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Your Majesty, Your Royal Highnesses, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
<BR>
<BR>
This year's award of the Nobel Peace Prize gives us once again an opportunity
to reconsider a well known detail in the wording of Alfred Nobel's will.
The prize, it is stated, is to be awarded to the individual or group who
has &quot;done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations,
for the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and for the holding and
promotion of peace congresses&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
What is especially important here is the way in which the question of disarmament
is given a direct relationship to the attitudes of peoples and nations to
one another. Brotherhood and disarmament are two aspects of the same issue.
Work aimed at giving international relationships a quality of unity rather
than conflict can therefore be seen as a step on the way to a bilateral
and controlled disarmament. <BR>
<BR>
Through this year's award of the Peace Prize, the Norwegian Nobel Committee
wishes to emphasize this aspect of the struggle for peace-to direct attention
to the way in which the problem of disarmament is a concern, not only of
politicians, but also of the general public in all countries. <BR>
<BR>
No one can avoid being aware of the anxious interest shown in this problem
today, not least among children and young people. The reason for this is
obvious: with the development of atomic weapons, the question of disarmament
has been given a new dimension, we could almost say, an eternal dimension.
The prevention of an outbreak of war is increasingly regarded as a question
of life or death for the human race. <BR>
<BR>
It is in this connection that this year's Peace Prize laureate, the <B>International
Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War</B>, has, in the opinion of
the Nobel Committee, made a commendable contribution. In accordance with
the ancient <I>Hippocratic Oath</I>, which demands a dedication without
compromise to the protection of life and health, this organization has indicated,
using the evidence of medical science, the dangers to life and health which
atomic weapons represent. These physicians have told us what will happen
if these weapons were to be used. We know now about the &quot;atomic winter&quot;
with its destruction of the biosphere and of all conditions necessary for
life. The physicians have also shown the absence of any escape route, and
that there is no feasible protection available against such an atomic catastrophe.
Home defence and medical services would inevitably collapse; it would be
impossible to help the injured and the dying, and survivors would be subjected
to the murderous long term consequences. <BR>
<BR>
Another aspect of this matter is that the resources which are today used
in the development of new weapons could have been used to help the millions
of people who die of hunger and lack of adequate health care. What can be
more true to the spirit of the <I>Hippocratic Oath</I> than this campaign
for new priorities in the use of the available resources, from military
ends to health and other development causes? <BR>
<BR>
Also, in this area, the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear
War has presented an informative and convincing documentation. <BR>
<BR>
The Norwegian Nobel Committee believes that the organization in this way
has made an important contribution to activating the general opposition
to nuclear armaments and contributes therefore to a mobilization of opinion
which is now taking place all over the world. <BR>
<BR>
It is also true that the question of bilateral and controlled reduction
of nuclear arsenal has been offered a considerable amount of attention at
innumerable disarmament conferences. The results have not been particularly
encouraging. Possibly, the former laureate, <A HREF="peace-1982.html">Alva
Myrdal,</A> was correct in believing that all we can hope for now is a stronger
mobilization of public opposition and a corresponding strengthening of pressure
on the political authorities. However that may be, a contribution to an
increased public opposition to the continued atomic arms-race can only be
seen as a contribution to the cause of peace. The International Physicians
for the Prevention of Nuclear War has, in the opinion of the Nobel Committee,
made such a contribution. <BR>
<BR>
It is obvious that, if such a public opposition is to have real value as
a peace inducing force, it has to be built up independently of ideological
systems, political viewpoints or geographical divisions. It has to be universal.
One has to begin with the simple fact that, faced with the threat of a nuclear
war, the whole of the world's population is in the same boat. Or, as Nikita
Kruschev once expressed it: &quot;<I>After the first exchange of atomic
bombs, no one will be able to see the difference between capitalist and
communist ashes</I>&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Face to face with the threat of nuclear war, there is one common interest
which will assert itself over all others: the will to survive. In other
words, there is a common human interest in preventing nuclear war. The feeling
for this common interest is now beginning to be so strong that a watchword
seems to be evolving: People of all lands who wish to survive, unite! <BR>
<BR>
It is precisely in the light of the fact that this public opinion has to
be universal, that the Norwegian Nobel Committee regards as particularly
important the fact that the International Physicians for the Prevention
of Nuclear War is the result of a common initiative from American and Soviet
doctors. Together, they have created a forum for cooperation which transcends
borders which are otherwise all too often sealed. Building on their realistic
evaluation of the situation, these physicians have chosen to stand shoulder
to shoulder and to work together in a cooperation founded on trust and confidence.
The Nobel Committee believes this was a good decision. <BR>
<BR>
This opinion is obviously shared by many. Although the organization has
only existed for five years, it now has active support from physicians in
more than forty countries all over the world. And this support is growing.
One thousand delegates from fifty countries are expected to take part in
next year's annual congress which is to be held in Cologne, West Germany.
The organization has achieved widespread recognition for its work. At the
third annual congress in Amsterdam, declarations of support were received
from, among others, the Secretary-General of the United Nations and from
Pope John Paul II, as well as from a number of heads of government in both
east and west. In 1984, the International Physicians for the Prevention
of Nuclear War was awarded UNESCO's &quot;Peace Education Prize&quot; &quot;<I>for
its remarkable contribution to informing public opinion and mobilizing the
conscience of the human race in the cause of peace</I>&quot;, as the citation
stated. <BR>
<BR>
The International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War receives
active support from the World Health Organization, which acts as distributor
for the organization's reports on the medical consequences of nuclear explosions.
From March of this year, the organization has been recognized as a so-called
&quot;non-governmental organization&quot; officially connected to the World
Health Organization. In a statement from the WHO, the point is made that
the prevention of an atomic war is the most important task in the field
of health politics, a task which all physicians should have a duty to contribute
to. <BR>
<BR>
The award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the International Physicians for the
Prevention of Nuclear War should be seen as yet another recognition of a
transnational contribution to the cause of peace, coming from physicians
who see it as their duty to mobilize the strongest possible public opposition
to atomic annihilation. <BR>
<BR>
It is permissible to wonder whether we don't already know enough about the
terrible consequences of a nuclear war. The answer is, of course, that we
know more than enough. While visiting the Peace Museum which the Japanese
have erected on the spot where the first atomic bomb fell forty years ago,
however, I came across the following epitaph: &quot;<I>We know 100 times
more than we need to know. What we lack is the ability to experience and
to be moved by what we know, what we understand and what we see and believe</I>&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
One can see that this epitaph touches the heart of the matter. A theoretic
knowledge of the megaton-bomb's explosive power is not enough. It isn't
enough to be frightened to sleeplessness by fiction films on the atomic
Ragnarock. The question is: What shall we do about it? Do we have the ability
to begin to act? Is it possible to force a change of direction?  This is
the question which has become our time's &quot;to be or not to be&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="physics-1921.html">Albert Einstein</A> wrote, in connection with
the development of atomic weapons, &quot;<I>We shall require a substantially
new manner of thinking if mankind is to survive</I>&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
The International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War has, in addition
to its information work, attempted to create such a new way of thinking.
Here, again, it is apposite to recall the way in which Nobel's will emphasizes
the connection between the problem of disarmament and the peoples' attitude
to one another. <BR>
<BR>
All the many bloody chapters in the history of mankind tell us of this connection.
It starts when groups of peoples and nations begin to regard each other
as enemies. In time, each side considers the oppositions to be evil incarnate.
The enemy has become a monster capable of unscrupulously attacking and destroying.
History, especially European history, has, unfortunately, far too many examples
of this philosophy's self-fertilizing effect. <BR>
<BR>
What sort of results would this philosophy have today? With the murderous
potential the various groups now have control over, we have to conclude
that the need for a new direction is now categorical, or, as Einstein said,
&quot;<I>it is now a question of life or death for mankind</I>&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Alongside the atomic weapons, a new reality has been created, based on the
fact that an atomic war cannot be won. It is no longer possible to solve
problems through a power-political confrontation. And, if a war were to
be begun, the question of who was to blame would be totally uninteresting
afterwards. The world's conflicts would have found what Hitler called &quot;the
final solution&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Is it possible to find a responsible politician who desires such a solution?
Obviously not. We have to believe all politicians who declare that this
is precisely what we must avoid. Because it is the truth. <BR>
<BR>
The riddle is, of course, to explain why the arms race continues. How is
it possible, in a world ravaged by famine, poverty and sickness, that anyone
has the conscience to use more than 800 million dollars a year on armaments?
<BR>
<BR>
The explanation is simple. The reason is fear, a fear created and kept alive
by the well-known &quot;enemy philosophy&quot; which, more or less, consciously,
sets its mark on both ideas and attitudes. Nobody dares to take the risk
of relying on the other side. Without this bilateral fear, it would be difficult
to find any rational argument for the build-up of armaments. Nobody with
any knowledge of the information and propaganda which support our age's
balance of terror can be in doubt: the driving force behind the arms race
is the two sides' fear and lack of confidence in one another. The extent
to which this lack of confidence is promoted as a political doctrine is
an indicator of the dangerous nature of today's world as a place in which
to live one's life. <BR>
<BR>
Another aspect of the same picture is the fact that, from time to time,
things are both said and done which can easily be interpreted as confirmation
of the doubts the various parties have of one another. As a general rule,
we have a tendency to believe the enemy when he says something which confirms
our suspicions. If he, on the other hand, says something which indicates
that he is interested in peace and friendship, it is argued that we would
be stupid to believe him, as his intention is to give us a false sense of
security in order to be able to destroy us all the more easily. <BR>
<BR>
It is easy to see how such a mode of thinking creates problems for arms
reduction negotiations. The result is all too well known.  For our own security's
sake we have to have more weapons because we cannot trust the opposition,
and they have to have at least as many weapons because they cannot trust
us. And thereby, the evil circle is made whole. <BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, fear and insecurity grow in all countries, and resources which
could have been used in the fight against famine and sickness are used to
further increase an arsenal which was more than big enough before. <BR>
<BR>
It was once fashionable to talk about &quot;the inevitable conflict&quot;.
It is universally accepted today that such an argumentation cannot be maintained.
The unavoidable truth is that our little planet could not survive an atomic
war. Nobody today dares to think of an atomic confrontation as unavoidable.
<BR>
<BR>
This makes the question which is being raised in more and more countries
even more urgent. Why do we develop more and more sophisticated atomic weapons
when we know that each new development makes their use seem even more absurd?
There is, of course, no political or ideological objective which can justify
the use of such weapons, for who would be able to enjoy the fruits of our
wonderful political or ideological systems if the price of their introduction
is a common annihilation? <BR>
<BR>
Among all the complications which abound in our world, there remains one
simple fact: we have the choice between living together or ceasing to live
at all. Irrespective of what we call ourselves or to which political philosophy
we subscribe, it is this reality which has to be the starting point for
our thoughts and actions, that is, if we want to survive. This is becoming
increasingly more recognized. We have to assume that the fear of atomic
war and the will to prevent it is just as strong in all human beings, wherever
in the world they live. The absurdity of the atomic arms race is ever more
apparent and its necessity ever more doubtful. It ought to be simple to
argue that resources ought to be diverted to causes like health care or
used for the benefit of those in need. <BR>
<BR>
The creation of a new way of thinking and acting based on this common opinion
ought not to be too difficult. <BR>
<BR>
It is regrettable that the world is divided in the way we know it is. It
is just as regrettable that atomic weapons were ever invented. This is,
however, the unfortunate reality with which we have to live. The technological
development or weapons cannot be reversed, and it is even questionable that
our divided world can be united through a power-political confrontation.
It is in the light of this reality that we have to define our own involvement,
and it is this reality which now presents humankind with a decisive test.
Nobody can opt out by resorting to the easy excuse that it is the other
side which is responsible, and that it is their philosophy and actions which
make ours an unfortunate necessity. The problem is that those on the other
side reason in precisely the same way. The fear which oppresses mankind
today is the possibility that both sides are right, and that we can begin
to build the future on the basis of a strategy which would be disastrous
precisely at the moment it showed itself to be correct. <BR>
<BR>
It is in the light of this reality that we have to regard the engagement
in the cause of peace which has been shown by the International Physicians
for the Prevention of Nuclear War. <BR>
<BR>
The Norwegian Nobel Committee does not regard the evaluation of this organization's,
or any other's, concrete proposals for disarmament to be part of its duties.
The committee is primarily interested in the way in which International
Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War has directed its efforts towards
the brotherhood which is the key to the problem of disarmament. A forum
has been created where discussions and actions can be raised out of ideological
blind alleys. The organization has recognized the consequences of the fact
that only by uniting in a common cause today is it possible to make even
things that are impossible today, possible tomorrow. <BR>
<BR>
In the opinion of the Nobel Committee, the International Physicians for
the Prevention of Nuclear War has shown that this is a feasible course.
And it is our duty to believe that the cause of peace can only be promoted
through common interests and brotherhood. <BR>
<BR>
The Nobel Peace Prize has, especially in later years, often been awarded
to campaigners for human rights. The Committee has followed, and still follows,
the fate of these prizewinners with interest, but also in the hope that
the concept of human value they represent will be successful and will be
consummated in the universal recognition of the freedom which is every human
being's birthright. <BR>
<BR>
This year's prize is more concerned with the problem of disarmament, but
is also, at a deeper level, concerned with human rights-perhaps even the
most fundamental human right of them all-the right to live. The right to
a life and a future for us all, for our children and for our grandchildren.
Yes, it is concerned with the unborn generations' right to inherit that
earth which we today tend on their behalf. <BR>
<BR>
It is in the light of this fundamental right of man that the organization
International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War has chosen its
course. And, as it now receives the Peace Prize, it is in recognition of
a constructive work in the cause of peace. But the prize also expresses
a hope-a hope for the steady advance of a new way of thinking, so that bridges
can be built over the chasms that represent our fear of the future. <BR>
<BR>
Mankind in all countries is united in that hope. <BR>

<BR>
The <B>International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW)</B>
is a federation of national groups dedicated to mobilizing the influence
of the medical profession against the threat of nuclear weapons. Currently,
there are IPPNW affiliated groups in 40 nations with several groups in the
process of formation, representing a total of more than 145,000 physicians
and health professionals worldwide. <BR>
<BR>
A long-standing professional association between two leading cardiologists,
Dr. Bernard Lown of the Harvard School of Public Health, and Dr. Yevgeny
Chazov of the USSR Cardiological Institute, was the impetus for the formation
of IPPNW. An exchange of letters between the two led to an extraordinary
meeting of six Soviet and American physicians in Geneva in December of 1980.
That meeting provided the four point consensus that has been the basis of
IPPNW activity since then. <BR>
<BR>
1. That IPPNW would restrict its focus to nuclear war; <BR>
<BR>
2. That IPPNW physicians would work to prevent nuclear war as a consequence
of their professional commitments to protect life and preserve health; <BR>
<BR>
3. That IPPNW would involve physicians from both east and west and would
seek to circulate the same factual information about nuclear war throughout
the world; <BR>
<BR>
4. That although IPPNW might advocate certain steps to prevent nuclear war,
the organization would not take a position on specific policies of any government;
<BR>
<BR>
The IPPNW has its central office in Boston, USA, and an European office
in London. Since 1981, it has organized annual World Congresses, the fifth
being held in Budapest this year. In addition, regional conferences have
been arranged ,and on the national level, groups of physicians have studied
and produced reports of the effects of a nuclear war on their own territories.

KUNGL. VETENSKAPSAKADEMIEN <BR>
THE ROYAL SWEDISH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES</H3>
15 October 1985 <BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.kva.se/">The Royal Swedlsh Academy of Sciences</A> has
decided to award the l985 Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences
to Professor <B>Franco Modigliani</B>, Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
USA, for his pioneering analyses of saving and of financial markets. <BR>
<BR>
THIS YEAR'S ECONOMICS PRIZE AWARDED FOR PIONEERING STUDIES OF SAVING AND
OF FINANCIAL MARKETS <BR>
<BR>
Franco Modigliani's research has been primarily directed towards household
saving and the functioning of financial markets. The achievements for which
Professor Modigliani is now to be rewarded concern the construction and
development of the life-cycle hypothesis of household saving, and the formulation
of the Modigliani-Miller theorems of the valuation of firms and of capital
costs. These two closely-related achievements both deal with the management
of household property, one referring to total value, the other to its composition.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>The life-cycle hypothesis</B><BR>

One of the cornerstones of the British economist J.M.Keynes' general theory,
presented in 1936, is the relationship between consumption and national
income. According to Keynes, it is a &quot;psychological law&quot; that
&quot;households increase their consumption as their income increases, but
not as much as their income increases&quot;. One consequence of this &quot;law&quot;
is that the proportion of national income represented by saving increases
during periods of economic growth. <BR>
<BR>
Keynes' theory of saving was generally accepted by his contemporaries. However,
in 1942 <A HREF="economy-1971.html">Simon Kuznets</A> showed that the theory
did not agree with empirical facts: in the U.S., the long-term saving: income
ratio had not increased over time. This supposed paradox became the object
of a number of studies during the years that followed, and several new approaches
to the theory of saving were presented.However, it was not until 1957, when
<A HREF="economy-1976.html">Milton Friedman </A>formulated his &quot;permanent
income&quot; hypothesis, that a rational explanation of the Keynes-Kuznets
contradiction was given within the framework of a general, well-defined
theory of consumer demand over time. The characteristic feature of Friedman's
hypothesis is that a person's income is assumed to consist of two parts,
one permanent and one transitory, and that it is the permanent part that
is the determinant of decisions about consumption and saving. Friedman argued
that Keynes' proposition was incorrect since it was derived from empirical
observations of cross-section data referring to total, not to permanent,
income. Friedman's ideas were well received by most economists, and for
several years the permanent income hypothesis played a dominating role among
existing theories of aggregate saving. <BR>
<BR>
Three years before Friedman published his theory of saving, Franco Modigliani,
together with Richard Brumberg, a student of his who unfortunately died
some years later, had already presented the life-cycle hypothesis. Like
Friedman, Modigliani and Brumberg assumed that households strive to maximize
their utility of future consumption. The decisive difference between the
two theories concerns the length of the planning period. For Friedman, this
period is infinite, meaning that people save not only for themselves but
also for their decendants. In the Modigliani-Brumberg version, the planning
period is finite: people save only for themselves. From the postulate of
utility maximization it follows that consumption is evenly distributed over
time and this, in turn, implies that the individual during his active period,
builds up a stock of wealth which he consumes during his old age. <BR>
<BR>
The life-cycle hypothesis is a purely microeconomic theory. However, Modigliani
has shown in a number of later works - some of which were produced in collaboration
with others - that the hypothesis has a number of macroeconomic applications.
A few of these are identical with those of the permanent income hypothesis,
for instance the idea that the aggregate saving ratio is constant in the
long term and that capital gains affect consumption only slightly. However,
some of the macroeconomic implications differ completely from those of earlier
theories. The most central one is that aggregate savings depends primarily
upon the rate of growth of the economy. Other distinguishing implications
are that aggregate saving is endogenously determined by economic as well
as demographic factors, such as the age structure of the population and
the life expectation; and that an increase in the rate of economic growth
entails a redistribution of income in favour of younger generations. <BR>
<BR>
The life cycle hypothesis has been used as a theoretical basis for many
empirical investigations. In particular, it has proved an ideal tool for
analyses of the effects of different pension systems. Most of these analyses
have indicated that the introduction of a general pension system leads to
a decline in private saving, a conclusion in full agreement with the Modigliani-Brumberg
hypothesis. <BR>
<BR>
The underlying idea of the life-cycle hypothesis - that people save for
their old age - is of course not new; nor is it Modigliani's own. His achievement
lies primarily in the rationalization of the idea into a formal model which
he has developed in different directions and integrated within a well-defined
and established economic theory, and secondly in the drawing of macroeconomic
implications from that model and in performing a number of empirical tests
of these implications. These achievements are important contributions to
economic science. <BR>
<BR>
The life-cycle model has had a great impact on the development of later
theoretical and empirical research. It represents in fact a new paradigm
in studies of consumption and saving, and is today the basis of most dynamic
models used for such studies. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The Modigliani-Miller theorems</B><BR>

While the life-cycle hypothesis concerns household saving decisions, the
Modigliani-Miller theorems concern decisions about aspects of the composition
of the accumulated savings stock. Although closely related, these two subjects
are usually regarded as belonging to two different disciplines: economics
and corporate finance. <BR>
<BR>
Up to the middle of the 1950's, the literature of corporate finance consisted
mainly of descriptions of methods and institutions. Theoretical analysis
was rare. It was not until Franco Modigliani and <A HREF="economy-1990.html">Merton
Miller</A>, in 1958, presented their now-famous theorem, and at about the
same time <A HREF="economy-1981.html">James Tobin </A>(Nobel Prize 1981)
and others started to develop the theory of portfolio selection, that a
scientific theory emerged concerning the connection between financial market
characteristics and the financing of investments, debts, taxes, etc. Once
established, this theory developed very rapidly. <BR>
<BR>
The first Modigliani-Miller theorem concerns the question of how the market
value of a firm is affected by the volume and structure of its debts. The
central proposition of the theorem gives a clear answer to this question:
neither the volume nor the structure of the debts affects the value of the
firm provided that the financial markets work perfectly, that there are
no taxes and that there are no bankruptcy costs. <BR>
<BR>
Modigliani and Miller define the value of a firm as the sum of the market
value of the equity stock and the market value of its debts. Their theorem
states that this value is equal to the discounted value of the flow of its
expected future returns, before interest, provided that the return on investment
in shares of firms in the same risk class is used as the discount factor.
This implies that the value is completely determined by this discount factor
and by the return on existing assets, and is independent of how these assets
have been financed. It further implies that average capital cost is independent
of the volume and structure of the debts and equal to the expected return
on investment in shares of firms in the same risk class. <BR>
<BR>
In a later paper, Modigliani and Miller formulated another theorem stating
that, for a given investment policy, the value of a firm is also independent
of its dividend policy. A dividend increase, for instance, certainly increases
shareholder's incomes, but this is neutralized by a corresponding reduction
in share value. <BR>
<BR>
The two Modigliani-Miller theorems hold good, irrespective of individual
differences between shareholders' valuations of risk, leverage effects,
durability of loans, etc. The logic of the theorems rests in fact upon the
assumption of perfect markets, namely that a shareholder can always, through
his own borrowing or lending, compose his asset portfolio as he sees fit
and that he can, without costs, give it the composition he desires with
respect to risk, leverage, etc. lf for instance the risk level of a firm's
assets is increased, the shareholders can neutralize this by lowering the
risk of other assets in their portfolios. <BR>
<BR>
The Modigliani-Miller theorems have had important implications for the theory
of investment decisions. One is that such decisions can be separated from
the corresponding financial decision. Another implication is that the rational
criterion for investment decisions is a maximization of the market value
of the firm, and a third is that the rational concept of capital cost refer
to total cost, and should be measured as the rate of return on capital invested
in shares of firms in the same risk class. <BR>
<BR>
The Modigliani-Miller theorems represent a decisive break-through for the
theory of corporate finance, and have had a great impact on later research
in this area. Thus the scientific value of the authors' work is by no means
limited to the formulation of the theorems, but refers to a great extent
also to the introduction of a new method of analysis within the discipline
of corporate finance. While the idea of treating financial decisions as
a market allocation problem is perhaps not completely new, it was Modigliani
and Miller who first used it for stringent analysis, thereby laying down
guidelines for further research in this area. <BR>

<IMG SRC="economy-1985-1.gif" ALIGN=left VSPACE="5" HSPACE="10">I was born in Rome, Italy, the son of Enrico Modigliani and Olga Flaschel. My father was a leading pediatrician in the city and my mother was a volunteer social worker. <BR>
<BR>
My school performance in the early years was good though not outstanding.
Then, in 1932, a major trauma occurred. My father died as a consequence
of an operation. I suddenly realized how deeply I loved and admired him
and at 13 my whole world seemed to collapse. After this event my school
performance for the next 3 years became spotty until I moved to Liceo Visconti,
the best high school in Rome, and the challenge proved healthy and I seemed
to blossom. Encouraged, I decided to skip the last year of the Liceo, passed
the required difficult exams and entered the University of Rome at 17 (two
years ahead of the norm). <BR>
<BR>
My family hoped that I would follow in my father's steps, entering a career
in medicine. I was torn for a while, but finally decided against it because
of my low tolerance level for sufferings and blood. Instead I chose law
which in Italy, opens the way to many career possibilities. In my second
year I decided to enter a national competition sponsored by the student
organization (I Littoriali della Coltura) in the area of economics. To my
surprise I won first prize and, although now I would hesitate to recommend
that first essay as a significant contribution to economics, clearly, it
served the purpose of establishing my current interest in economics. Unfortunately,
under fascism, teaching in this field was dismal and only with the advice
of the few good economists I knew personally and especially of Riccardo
Bachi, I began on my own to read the English and Italian classics. <BR>
<BR>
The Littoriali had put me in contact with young antifascists, and my political
opposition to the regime began then. My involvement with my future wife
Serena Calabi and her remarkable father Giulio, who was a long standing
antifascist also contributed. In 1938 the Italian racial laws were promulgated
and at the invitation of my future in laws, I joined them in Paris where
in May 1939 Serena and I were married. I enrolled at the Sorbonne but found
the teaching there uninspiring and a waste of time, so I spent my time studying
on my own and writing my thesis at the Bibliotheque St. Genevieve. In June
1939 I returned briefly to Rome to discuss my thesis and receive my degree
of Doctor Juris from the University of Rome. Shortly after this, fearing
that Europe was going to be soon engulfed in a bloody war, we applied for
an immigration visa for the U.S. and arrived in New York in August 1939,
a few days before the beginning of World War II. <BR>
<BR>
It became apparent that our stay in the U.S. would be a long one and I immediately
began thinking on how best to pursue my interest in economics. I had the
great luck of being awarded a free tuition fellowship by the Graduate Faculty
of Political and Social Science of the New School for Social Research, an
institution freshly created to give haven to the European scholars who were
victims of the three fascist dictatorships. Thus in fall 1939, I started
on a routine that was to last three years, of studying at night from 6 -
10, while working during the day selling European books to support my family
which soon included our first son: Andre. I worked hard but, nonetheless,
remember that period as an exciting one, as I was discovering my passion
for economics, thanks also to excellent teachers, including Adolph Lowe
and above all Jacob Marschak to whom I owe a debt of gratitude beyond words.
He helped me develop solid foundations in economics and econometrics, some
mathematical foundations, introduced me to the great issues of the day and
gave me, together with his unforgettable kindness, constant encouragement.
In particular I owe to him that blend of theory and empirical analysis,
theories that can be tested and empirical work guided by theory - that has
characterized a good deal of my later work. Marschak also provided me with
an experience that contributed to my development, by inviting me to participate
in an informal seminar which met in New York around 1940 - 41, whose members
included, among others, Abraham Wald, <A HREF="economy-1975.html">Tjalling
Koopmans</A> and Oscar Lange. <BR>
<BR>
I consider that my formal training ended in 1941 when Marschak left the
New School to join the University of Chicago, and I obtained my first teaching
job as an Instructor at New Jersey College for Women. My first published
article in English, &quot;Liquidity Preference and the Theory of Interest
and Money&quot; <I>Econometrica</I>, Vol. 12, No. 1, January 1944, which
is also substantially, my doctoral dissertation, and which I regard as one
of my major contributions, appeared some two years later. The result of
discussions in Marschak's seminar and of a running debate with Abba Lerner,
it purports to integrate the Keynesian &quot;revolution&quot;, then generally
regarded as a total break with the past, with the mainstream of classical
economics.<BR>
<BR>
In 1942 I became an Instructor in Economics and Statistics at Bard College,
then a residential college of Columbia University, and came to appreciate
the unique qualities of life in an American college campus, especially the
intimate association with first rate students. In 1944 I returned to the
New School as a Lecturer and a Research Associate at the Institute of World
Affairs where together with Hans Neisser, I was responsible for a project
whose results were eventually published in <I>National Income and International
Trade</I>. During this period I also made my first contribution to the study
of saving, which has since come to be known as the Duesenberry-Modigliani
hypothesis. <BR>
<BR>
In fall 1948 I left New York, having been awarded the prestigious Political
Economy Fellowship of the University of Chicago as well as offered the opportunity
of joining, as a Research Consultant, the Cowles Commission for Research
in Economics, then the leading institution in its field. Shortly after my
arrival I accepted an attractive position at the University of Illinois
as director of a research project on &quot;Expectations and Business Fluctuations&quot;.
However, I remained in Chicago through the academic year 1949 - 50, greatly
benefiting from my association with the Cowles Commission, staffed and visited
by people like Marschak, <A HREF="economy-1975.html">Koopmans</A>, <A HREF="economy-1972.html">Arrow</A>,
<A HREF="economy-1978.html">Simon</A>, at a time when the profession was
absorbing two important revolutions, one centering on the theory of choice
under uncertainty, initiated by von Neuman and Morgenstern, and the other
on statistical inference from non-experimental observations, inspired by
<A HREF="economy-1989.html">Haavelmo</A>. <BR>
<BR>
My association with the University of Illinois lasted only till 1952 because
of internal strife. During that brief time, I befriended a brilliant young
graduate student, Richard Brumberg. With his collaboration we laid the foundations
for what was to become the Life Cycle Hypothesis of Saving. It was elaborated
in 1953 and 1954 in two papers, one dealing with individual behaviour and
the other with aggregate saving. After we had both left the University of
Illinois, Brumberg had gone to complete his Ph.D. at the John Hopkins University
and I joined Carnegie Institute of Technology, now Carnegie-Mellon University.
The &quot;aggregate&quot; paper was only published in 1980 in my <I>Collected
Papers</I> because the shock of Brumberg's untimely death in 1955 sapped
my will to undertake the revisions and condensation that would have been
required for publication in one of the standard professional journals. <BR>
<BR>
My association with Carnegie, which lasted until 1960, was a very productive
one. In addition to completing the two basic papers setting the foundations
for the Life Cycle Hypothesis, I collaborated on a book dealing with the
problem of optimal production smoothing, and wrote the two essays with Miller
on the effect of financial structure and dividend policy on the market value
of a firm. I also published a paper with E. Grunberg on the predictability
of social events when the agent reacts to prediction, which later was to
provide one of the pillars for the &quot;theory of rational expectations&quot;.
All of these contributions represented, to some extent, the coming to fruition
of seeds started during my research on &quot;Expectations and Business Fluctuations&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
In 1960 I was a visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
to which I returned after a year at Northwestern University, and where I
have remained ever since. Supported by this unique institution and its unique
colleagues, I have pursued the interests developed earlier in macroeconomics,
including criticism of the monetarist positions, generalizations of the
monetary mechanism and empirical tests of the Life Cycle Hypothesis. I have
also branched out into new areas and, in particular, international finance
and the international payment system, the effects of and cures for inflation,
stabilization policies in extensively indexed open economies, and into various
fields of finance such as credit rationing, the term structure of interest
rates and the valuation of speculative assets. <BR>
<BR>
In the late sixties I also had a major responsibility for designing a large
scale model of the U.S. economy, the MPS, sponsored by the Federal Reserve
Bank and still utilized by it. Finally, I have participated actively in
the debate over economic policies both in Italy and the U.S., concentrating
lately on the deleterious effects of the huge public deficits. <BR>

<P>With the <EM>Nobel Forum,</EM> an old vision has achieved concrete 
expression
in a new building designed primarily for the <EM>Nobel Assembly</EM> at
the Karolinska Institute. Here the Nobel Committee announces the year's
Laureate in <EM>Physiology or Medicine,</EM> and here the Nobel Secretariat
carries on its daily work. With the Nobel Forum, the Karolinska Institute
has also gained a meeting place for scientists from all over the world.<BR>
<BR>
A feature of this Karolinska building is the apparently free sitting of
the various blocks in the hilly landscape on the &quot;house-in-a-park&quot;
principle. The new Nobel Forum was to be erected in these surroundings.
The design commission was <LEFT> <IMG SRC="../Pics/foyer.gif" WIDTH="200"

to the architect <EM>Johan Celsing,</EM> and in the summer of 1993 the 
building was finished.<BR>
<BR>
The use of brick for the exterior was decided early, though brick is most
often used today as cladding and so it was not taken for granted that it
would also constitute the bearing shell of the building. That it does so
reflects the wish for accord between construction and design.<BR>
<BR>
As a contrast to the darkly massive exterior of the building, the interiors
are plastered in light shades and, since the rooms richly vary in form and
size the interior materials are relatively few and uniform. The idea has
been as far as possible to allow the natural colours of the materials themselves
to set the tone of the colour scheme. This becomes apparent as soon as one
reaches the foyer on the ground floor where, as elsewhere, the window and
door joinery is in oiled cherrywood. Floors, the reception counter and stone
details of the walls and columns are of polished J&auml;mtland limestone.<BR>
<BR>
The character of the Nobel Assembly with its 50 members and its administration
of the Nobel Prize and other activities were instrumental in the design
of the interiors. The accommodation <RIGHT> <IMG SRC="../Pics/terraces.gif"
WIDTH="182" HEIGHT="162" ALIGN=right NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></RIGHT> had to
function rationally in terms of administrative work and symposia, and both
for small and  large representative meetings and receptions.<BR>
<BR>
Immediately on entering, one encounters the long foyer, from which most
parts of the building are reached. The foyer, which rises the full height
of the building, looks out on the terraces and gardens towards Solnav&auml;gen.
At the far end of the foyer on the ground floor is the auditorium (the Wallenberg
Hall), <LEFT> <IMG SRC="../Pics/auditorium.gif" WIDTH="170" HEIGHT="148"
ALIGN=left NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></LEFT> small enough to permit a natural
dialogue between lecturer and audience. Seminar rooms, the administrative
offices and the reception area are also on the ground floor. On the first
floor, the Nobel Floor, one end of the foyer abuts the Assembly Hall and
the Nobel office. At the other end of the foyer together with the dining
rooms is the lounge in quiet grey-green without windows to the outdoors.<BR>
<BR>
The dark contrast of the lounge is intended to enrich the transition from
the light foyer to the ochre dining room. The idea is that here by the open
fire meals can both be started and rounded off.<BR>
<BR>
<LEFT> <IMG SRC="../Pics/assemblyhall.gif" WIDTH="170" HEIGHT="140" ALIGN=

afforded by a fairly large textile by <I>Birgit Broms.</I> The work, which
was commissioned from the artist by the National Arts Council, is entitled
&quot;Autumn&quot; and is in appliqu&eacute; and paint on linen from Kl&auml;ssbol.
<RIGHT> <IMG SRC="../Pics/furniture.gif" WIDTH="170" HEIGHT="137" ALIGN=

for the Nobel Forum, mainly by the architect's office. Armchairs are by
<EM>&Aring;ke Axelsson.</EM> Lighting was designed in cooperation with 
designer <EM>Bengt K&auml;llgren.</EM> <BR>

<H2>I. Overview</H2>
<HR>
<BR>
<H3>Research</H3>
The current aim of the research at the Nobel Institute for Neurophysiology
is to explore how the nervous system generates vertebrate behaviour in
molecular, cellular and neuronal network terms. The roles of <STRONG>ion
channels</STRONG> in different neurones (El Manira, Hill, Wall&eacute;n and
&Aring;rhem) and of <STRONG>synaptic transmission</STRONG> (Brodin,
Christenson and Wall&eacute;n) have been explored.  Behaviour is produced
by <STRONG>networks of nerve cells. Locomotion</STRONG>, including the
vestibular control of body orientation (Grillner, Orlovski, Deliagina, El
Manira and Wall&eacute;n) and <STRONG>respiration</STRONG> (Yamamoto) is
studied. To understand the basic principles of these neural networks, the
<STRONG>patterns of interaction between identified nerve cells</STRONG>
have been mapped and <STRONG>realistic computer simulations</STRONG> are
used to reveal the mode of operation of vertebrate neuronal networks. The
respiratory analysis has focused on the<STRONG> ontogeny of the respiratory
control</STRONG> system (Lagercrantz and Yamamoto). <STRONG>The development
of voluntary and postural motor control </STRONG>in normal infants is also
investigated as well as that of prematurely born or brain damaged children
(Forssberg). The human brain was investigated at the system's level with
<STRONG>positron emission tomography</STRONG>, magnetic resonance
tomography and at the microscopical level (Roland and Guly&aacute;s)<P>

<BR>
<H3>Techniques and Collaboration</H3>
With the broad problems addressed by the different research groups a
variety of techniques  is required.<STRONG> Intra- and extracellular
neurophysiological techniques </STRONG>are used including <STRONG>patch and
voltage clamp</STRONG>, combined with <STRONG>pharmacological</STRONG>
tools for analysis of ion channels, synaptic release mechanisms, single
neurones and systems of neurones, and morphological analysis on the light
and ultrastructural level. Extensive <STRONG>computer simulation</STRONG>
<STRONG>of single neurones and neuronal networks</STRONG> are developed in
collaboration with the <STRONG>laboratory of A. Lansner</STRONG> at the
computer science department at the Royal Institute of Technology.
<STRONG>Positron emission tomography (PET)</STRONG> and <STRONG>nuclear
magnetic resonance tomography (NMR)</STRONG> is also used, also in
collaboration with Southwestern University, Texas.  Tools for 3D
statistical analysis of data sets are developed in collaboration with the
Department of Mathematical Statistics of the Royal Institute of Technology
(Holst, Raab). Advanced mathematical image analysis is developed by the
group of Roland et al. and in collaboration with NADA at the Royal
Institute of Technology.  Longstanding collaboration with other research
groups extend our technical repertoire to
<STRONG>immunihistochemistry</STRONG> (H&ouml;kfelt), <STRONG>molecular
biology</STRONG> (Larhammar), <STRONG>ultrastructure</STRONG> (Cullheim). A
close <STRONG>interaction between basic and clinical research</STRONG> is
taking place. Two senior investigators (doc. Forssberg and prof.
Lagercrantz) hold clinical positions with the Pediatric department
(Karolinska Hospital) and some collaborative projects have a clear clinical
relevance (intensive care unit, Lindahl; pediatrics, Lagercrantz;
neurovirology, Kristensson; geriatrics, Winblad).<P>

<H4>International collaborations</H4>
Collaborations also occur with the departments of Anatomy and Brain
Research, Heinrich Heine University, D&uuml;sseldorf; the department of
Physiology, University of Tokyo, the department of Experimental Psychology,
University of Oxford; the department of Anatomy, University of Lausanne,
Division of Neuroscience, CNRS, Marseille (F. Clarac), Howard Hughes
Institute, USCD, San Diego (R. Tsien); MRC Unit of Neuroscience, University
of Montreal (S. Rossignol, R. Dubuc); Molecular Neurobiology, Rockefeller
University, New York (P. Greengard); University of Toronto (H. Atwood);
Molecular Neurobiology, Univ. Calif., Irvine (R. Miledi); Southwestern
Medical School, The University of Texas (L. Friberg).  <P>

<BR>
<H3>Funding</H3>
The research is funded by grants from the Medical (MFR) and Science (NFR)
Research Councils, the board of the research councils (FRN) and the board
of Technical Development (NUTEK), the Science program of the European
Commission, Human Frontier Program, Human Capital and Mobility, and other
foundations.<P>

<BR>
<H3>Department of Neuroscience</H3>
Since July 1 1993 the Neuroscience department of the Karolinska Institute
comprises of the researchers of the Nobel Institute (professor S. Grillner
and P. Roland) and it also contains professor K. Fuxe, T. H&ouml;kfelt and
L. Olson (previously department of Histology and Neurobiology), professor
L.-G. Elfvin and G. Grant (previously department of Anatomy) and  professor
K. Kristensson (previously section of neuropathology at Huddinge Hospital).
<P>

<BR>
<H3>Premises of the Department</H3>
The space allocated to the Nobel Institute for Neurophysiology is too
small, which prevents us from accepting new visiting scientists, graduate
students and associated neuroscience groups. The new Neuroscience
department is initially housed in three different locations (the previous
Anatomy, Neurophysiology and Berzelius laboratory buildings). It was
planned that Neurophysiology should move into new space in the Berzelius
laboratory before July 1993, but this did not occur. The new plans are now
detailed by architect M. Dunge, and it is planned to occur before July
1995. <P>

<BR>
<H3>Conferences, Seminars and Courses</H3>
The interdisciplinary <STRONG>"Neuroclub"</STRONG> is coordinated from the
department, which in addition organizes weekly lunch seminars.<P>
An integrated course in Neuroscience (10 weeks) is given annually for
undergraduates with a non-medical background (ie. physics, engineering,
biology, etc.). This course is required for students to be accepted into
the graduate student program in Neuroscience.<P>
A course (5p) for graduate students in Neuroscience and computer science
has been given in collaboration with A. Lansner, Computer Science
Department, Royal Institute of Technology.<P>

<BR>
<H2>II. Research Groups of S. Grillner, L. Brodin, T. Deliagina, A. El
Mantra, R. Hill, G. Orlovski, and P. Well&eacute;n, Including Visiting and

Neuron. He is a member of Academia Europeaea, Royal Swedish Academy of
Science, associate of the Neuroscience Institute (New York) and the board
for the European Neuroscience Program, Councils for the International Union
of Physiology, and International Brain Research Organisation. During 1994
he has been deputy chairman of the Nobel committee. He has lectured on
different occasions in Kyoto, San Diego, Nijmegen, Milan, Rennes, Boca
Raton.<P>
<STRONG>Wall&eacute;n</STRONG> has lectured in G&ouml;teborg, Doorwerth,
Holland.<P>
<STRONG>Orlovski</STRONG> has lectured in Marseille, Paris, San Diego,
Hawaii.<P>
<STRONG>Brodin</STRONG> has lectured in New York.<P>
<H3>Research Framework</H3>
The brain consists of interacting neural networks, which generate the
different aspects of our behavioural repertoire. To understand the brain,
these networks must be understood at at cellular level. In vertebrates this
has turned out to be an almost elusive problem due to the complex neural
organisation. An experimentally amenable in vitro preparation of a lower
vertebrate (lamprey) has therefore been developed. It has comparatively few
neurones and the synapses are accessible for analysis. These studies can be
divided into two parts, a <STRONG>cellular and molecular</STRONG>, and a
<STRONG>network part </STRONG>both of which are of fundamental importance.
The lamprey locomotor network is now better understood than that of any
other vertebrate. <P>

<BR>
<H3>A. Synaptic Transmission, Postsynaptic Receptors and Ion Channels</H3>

<H4>1. Analysis of presynaptic mechanisms (Brodin, Shupliakov, Pieribone) </H4>
In collaboration with P. Greengards laboratory presynaptic microinjection
experiments in the lamprey giant reticulo spinal synapse have been
performed, which have demonstrated the existence of biochemically and
functionally distinct pools of synaptic vesicles (submitted to Nature).
Injection of synapsin antibodies was found to cause a marked disruption of
the major portion of synaptic vesicle clusters, while only a small pool of
vesicles remained tethered to the active zones. Immunogold labelling showed
that the distribution of synapsin correlated with the distribution of
vesicles that were disrupted after antibody injections. Paired recording
experiments between injected axons and target cells showed that the
synaptic response during low-frequency stimulation was unaltered, while
during high-frequency stimulation a marked depression of the release
occurred. Thus, a large synapsin-dependent pool of vesicles is required
during sustained release, while a small synapsin-independent pool is
sufficient to support release at low frequency.<P>
Injection of synaptotagmin antibodies had a distinctly different effect
than that of synapsin antibodies. In this case the synapses showed
ultrastructural changes indicating a strong increase of the spontaneous
release. These included an increased number of fusing vesicles ("omega
profiles"), an expansion of plasma membrane and an increased number of
coated (endocytic) structures. A clustered "reserve pool" was still
present. Structural changes similar to these occur in normal axons
subjected to intense action potential stimulation. These data strongly
support the hypothesis that synaptotagmin has an inhibitory regulatory role
in the synapse.<P>
In a collaborative study with J. Storm-Mathisen and O.P. Ottersen,
D-aspartate, which is taken up by plasma membrane transporters but not
vesicular transporters, was used as a marker at the ultrastructural level
to localize and quantifythe excitatory amino acid uptake into different
synaptic compartments. After incubation in D-aspartate-containing solution
glutamatergic axons were found to show only a limited uptake, while a
prominent uptake occurred in adjacent glial processes. Three-dimensional
reconstruction showed that these glial processes formed a "collar" around
the individual synapses. Taken together with our previous data, these data
show that the synaptic cleft in glutamatergic synapses is isolated from the
surrounding extracellular space by a glial "collar" with a high uptake
activity. This appears to be of critical importance for the integrity of
the synaptic transmission, as it prevents synaptically released glutamate
to diffuse out from the cleft to activate receptors in adjacent synapses,
and it also protects the postsynaptic receptors from being activated during
general elevations of the extracellular excitatory amino acid levels (e.g.
during pathological conditions).<P>

<H4>2. Complementary action of DA-5-HT on synaptic transmission in the
spinal cord (Brodin, El Manira, Grillner, Schotland, Shupliakov,
Wikstr&ouml;m, Zhang)</H4>
5-HT cells located in the spinal cord have been found to co-store dopamine
(DA). The different 5-HT systems in the brainstem-spinal cord release 5-HT
in a paracrine fashion without forming point-to-point synapses. 5-HT acts
in a nonconventional way by modifying the frequency regulation of the
target neurones (spinal and reticulospinal neurones) by influencing the
afterhyperpolarization (AHP) mediated by Ca dependent K+ channels. The
5-<BR>
HT system modulates the segmental and intersegmental locomotor circuitry
through these effects on the AHP. DA acts on Ca2+ channels reducing the
Ca2+ entry during the action potential. This effect complements that of
5-HT on Ca2+ dependent K+ channels. 5-HT and DA are co-released and their
action is complementary and additive (Nature in press). The distribution of
the 5-HT-DA system in a rostrocaudal fashion in brainstem-spinal cord has
been analysed and the effects of 5-HT-DA on different parts of the spinal
cord network for locomotion. 5-HT exerts its action on  5-HT1A like
receptors, while DA acts preferentially on D2 receptors. Both 5-HT and DA
also cause a depression of glutamatergic synaptic transmission from certain
types of neurones. <P>

<H4>3. Real-time measurements of calcium influx in lamprey spinal cord
neurones. (Wall&eacute;n, Grillner, in collaboration with R.Y. Tsien, B.J.
Bacskai, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, UCSD, La Jolla)</H4>
The analysis of the calcium dynamics in different types of neurons in the
lamprey CNS, a collaborative project with prof. Roger Y. Tsien"'"s
laboratory in La Jolla, has continued with regard to spinal motoneurons,
and the results have been compiled into a report which has now been
published (Bacskai et al., Neuron, 14:19-28, 1995). In these studies we
have utilized a video-rate laser scanning confocal microscope system,
developed by prof. Tsien, in combination with Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent
probes which can be intracellularly injected into the recorded cell from
the microelectrode. This allows measurement of Ca2+ fluctuations at
adequately high temporal (30 images/s) and spatial resolution, in
conjunction with simultaneous electrophysiological recordings from the same
neuron.<P>

<H4>4. Sensory touch and pressure cells and afferents, and modulation of
their sensory transmission to different types of neurones (El Manira,
Tegn&eacute;r,)</H4>
Sensory dorsal cells are modulated to a varying degree during fictive
locomotion, providing a phasic gating of the sensory input. This
presynaptic inhibition acts by modulating the excitatory synaptic
transmission in phase with the locomotor activity. The amplitude after
monosynaptic EPSPs  is gated phasically. Both activation of GABAB receptors
and 5-HT causes a depression of the synaptic transmission, it appears
however that the locomotor related modulator of sensory afferents is not
through GABA receptors.<P>

<H4>5. Monosynaptic input from skin afferents to fin motoneurones (El Manira, Shupliakov)</H4>
Touch and pressure dorsal cells do not have monosynaptic input to somatic
motoneurones, but to fin motoneurones. Dorsal cells provide monosynaptic
feedback to fin motoneurones, whereas the corresponding feedback system to
somatic motoneurones is provided by intraspinal stretch receptor neurones
sensing the laterally directed locomotor movements. <P>

<H4>6. Dorsal cells and post tetanic hyperpolarisation (Parker)</H4>
After a higher frequency burst, sensory dorsal cells exhibit a long lasting
hyperpolarisation. This hyperpolarisation blocks the transmission of
impulses from the afferent axon to the central terminals, and acts
therefore as a gating mechanism. This hyperpolarisation is due to a
combined action of a novel type (in lamprey) of calcium dependent K+
channel (not apamin sensitive), and an activation of Na-K+ pump. This is a
new control mechanism. The action of 5-HT and peptides (substance P) is
analysed.<P>

<H4>7. The action of somatostatin and neurotensin on neurones and the
locomotor network (Barthe) </H4>
GABA and somatostatin-ir and GABA and neurotensin-ir containing cells
located at the central canal form a dense plexus around the lateral
dendritic ramifications of edge cells. GABA and somatostatin both have
inhibitory effects, the former via Cl-channels activated by GABAA receptors
and the latter via a so far unidentified K+ channels mechanism. GABAB
receptors also exert effects on edge cells including gating of Ca2+
channels. Neurotensin, on the other hand, depolarizes target cells, an
effect not mediated by a conductance increase and not being dependent on
voltage dependent Na+ or Ca2+ channels.  Somatostatin and neurotensin both
act in the locomotor network.<P>

<H4>8.Peptide neurons - analysis by immunohistochemistry, molecular cloning
and in situ hybridization (Brodin, S&ouml;derberg, Dahlstrand, Pieribone,
Rawitch and Larhammar) </H4>
The amino acid sequences of two NPY-related peptides in lamprey have been
determined from cDNA clones. Sequence comparisons have shown that they
correspond to NPY and PYY, respectively. The two types of mRNA have been
localized in distinct neuron systems including a reticulospinal system
(PYY) and dorsal horn interneurons (NPY), using in situ hybridization. The
peptides deduced from the cDNA sequences have been synthesized and will be
used for electrophysiological analysis.<P>

<H4>9. Dissociation of identifiable spinal cord neurones - cell culture -
Ca2+ channels (El Manira, Bussi&egrave;res)</H4>
To be able to study the properties of identified cell types with regard to
single types of ion channels, particularly different types of Ca2+ channels
(single channel, whole cell) techniques for reliable dissociation of
identified cells have been developed. Cultures of transmitter identified
cells (glutamate, glycine, Ach) are being developed - and their formation
of synapses.<P>

<BR>
<H3>B. Network Analyses - Cellular Bases of Locomotion</H3>
One overall goal of the study of the lamprey CNS-model is to elucidate how
individual brainstem and spinal cord interneurones interact in the neural
networks that generate the basic locomotor synergy. The basic principles of
operation have been analyzed by a variety of techniques including
intracellular paired recordings and computer simulation in collaboration
with Anders Lansner's research group at the Royal College of Technology.
Intersegmental and segmental neuronal mechanisms in the locomotor network
have been described to the extent that many basic mechanisms can now be
said to be understood. The neuronal systems underlying the control of body
equilibrium during movements and for steering are now becoming in focus.<P>

<H4>1. The neural mechanisms of intersegmental coordination (Hellgren,
Wadden, Tegn&eacute;r, El Manira, Grillner)</H4>
The work to establish the mechanisms underlying the constant phase lag
between consecutive segments were continued. Very extensive simulations
have shown that the known segmental and intersegmental connectivity can
produce a phase lag. The new model is continuous, without discrete
segmental oscillators, ie. in a strict sense not a coupled oscillator
model. The model in its largest form has 2000 realistic neurones, and
700,000 synapses. <P>

<H4>2. Efference copy information from spinal networks to brainstem
reticulospinal neurones and back - significance (Vinay)</H4>
The spinal locomotor network signals back to the brainstem information
about its activity. Extensive physiological and anatomical studies of the
spinoreticular axonal pathway have been performed. The system projects in
the lateral part of the spinal cord and continues into the medial
lemniscus. The different neurones inform about ongoing motor activity on
both sides as well as about the transition between the different phases of
the motor program. The effect of braking this loop on the brainstem level
has been investigated under conditions when the spinal CPG is active. The
significance of this circuit is being analysed by simulation. <P>

<H4>3. Local spinal interneurone with crossed axons (Fagerstedt,
Wall&eacute;n) </H4>
A new class of interneurones have been identified, which is currently under
investigation with paired intracellular recordings. They are small and have
crossed axons that extend over a limited number of segments. Some of these
neurones are inhibitory and probably glycinergic. During the experiment the
neurones can be identified by previous staining with retrograde tracers.<P>

<H4>4. Mathematical modelling of the lamprey locomotor system (Grillner,
Lansner, Wall&eacute;n, Ekeberg, Wadden, Hellgren, Tegn&eacute;r,
Wikstr&ouml;m)</H4>
The detailed synaptic interaction between the different types of neurones
has been established as well as the properties of the individual neurones
with their blend of different types of ion-<BR>
channels. With this knowledge, often biological, at hand we have continued
to simulate the neurones in the network in a biologically realistic way in
the form of coupled differential equations. New software has been developed
for a work station or a parallell super computer (CH), which allows
simulation of a number of neurones, each of which with its specific
properties. The analyses of populations of neurones have been very
illuminating, combined with different cellular properties of the spinal
cord and brainstem neurones. Ekeberg has developed a new neuromechanical
lamprey model, which actually swims through "simulated" walls. A new
network configuration has been introduced which allows steering control in
3D. This model is based on the resent neuronal network. <P>

<H4>5. Selection of behaviour - basal ganglia (Pombal, El Manira)</H4>
The basal ganglia are fairly large structures in the lamprey CNS and can be
assumed to take part in the overall regulation and selection of behaviour.
We have started by describing the basic circuitry. Striatum in lamprey has
a similar innervation to that of mammals (DA, 5-HT, histamin, NT) and the
DA projections from the brainstem to striatum have been detailed. Moreover
a pathway with monosynaptic connections from "ventral thalamus" to
reticulospinal cells has been identified, which can initiate locomotor
activity, and displays synaptic potentiation. <P>

<BR>
<H3>C. Nervous Mechanisms for Spatial Orientation and Postural Control
(Orlovsky, Deliagina, Ull&eacute;n, Gonzalez, Grillner)</H3>
A comparative study of the systems responsible for spatial orientation and
postural control was carried out on a few, remotely related species of
animals - the lamprey, the rat and a mollusc (<CITE>Clione lomacina</CITE>)
- to reveal common basic principles in the organization and operation of
these systems.<P>

<H4>1. Postural and steering control systems in the lamprey.</H4>
In behavioral experiments, the motor patterns used by an animal for
changing and correcting its body orientation in space, and for selecting
and maintaining a certain swimming direction were studied. Vestibular
sensory input was found to play a crucial role for the control of body
orientation in the vertical plane, while visual input could strongly affect
the direction of swimming. In addition, dermal photoreceptors were shown to
be responsible for activation of the locomotor system during the
light-avoidance reaction.<P>
On the bases of these behavioral studies, as well as of earlier
electrophysiological studies on the isolated brainstem preparation, a
conceptual model of the roll control system, which is responsible for
stabilization of the dorsal side-up orientation, has been formulated. The
model can explain a number of phenomena related to postural control, such
as the dorsal light response and the continuous rolling seen after a lesion
to the vestibular organ. The model also allowed certain predictions that
later could be confirmed experimentally. In particular, lesion experiments,
where the vestibular and visual sensory organs were removed in different
combinations, showed that the lacking vestibular input could be substituted
by contralateral visual input. This finding is a basis for further studies
of plastic changes after lesions in the CNS. 	<BR>
The analysis of the neuronal networks responsible for the light-avoidance
reaction which represents a very simple form of steering control, was
carried out in electrophysiological experiments, with the main attention
given to the analysis of the transformation of an asymmetrical (unilateral)
sensory input into symmetrical (bilateral) one in the motor centres
responsible for rectilinear swimming.<P>

<H4>2. Postural control in the rat.</H4>
This study was carried out in collaboration with G. Grant, L. Popova and B.
Ragnarsson. Removal of the vestibular sensory organ on one side in the rat
results in numerous motor disorders which severely disturb the postural
control. It was found that all these disorders could be considerably
reduced and even completely abolished by electrical stimulation of the
vestibular nerve on the lesioned side. This finding clearly demonstrated
that tonic input from the labyrinth plays a crucial role for the normal
function of the postural control mechanisms. In addition to the immediate
restoration of the postural control, stimulation of the vestibular nerve
also had long-lasting effects, and promoted the compensation of the
vestibular deficit.<P>
Integration of sensory inputs of different modalities is an essential
feature of the postural control system. One site for the integration is the
central cervical nucleus. In electrophysiological experiments it was shown
that neurons of this nucleus respond both to natural vestibular stimuli
(tilting the animal) and to natural proprioceptive stimuli (stretching the
neck muscles). The output of these neurons thus signals about the head
orientation both in space and in relation to the trunk.<P>

<H4>3. Postural control in molluscs.</H4>
The mollusc <CITE>Clione limacina </CITE>has been used as a simple model
system for studying postural control mechanisms at the network and cellular
levels. In collaboration with the Moscow group headed by Y. Arshavsky, the
gravistatic response has been characterized in different identified
neurons, which constitute the system responsible for the maintenance of the
vertical body orientation. These include: (i) sensory cells of the gravity
sensory organ (statocyst), (ii) different type of interneurons in the
cerebro-pedal command system, and (iii) motoneurons controlling a postural
effector organ, the tail. These experimental results allowed the
formulation of a conceptual model of the postural control system, as well
as a characterization of the corresponding neuronal networks. <P>
Vestibular input affects not only the postural control mechanisms. In the
rat, the lamprey and <CITE>Clione</CITE>, it also affects the locomotor
system and some other systems. In another mollusc, <CITE>Planorbis
corneus</CITE>, input from the statocysts is responsible not only for
postural control, but it can also evoke a defensive behavior. This
phenomenon was analyzed at the network level.<P>

<BR>
<H2>III. Research Group of P. &Aring;rhem</H2>
<HR><BR>
&Aring;rhem has lectured at an international workshop on information
science in Madrid (June). He has coedited a workshop volume on the
cognitive activity of mind and a thematic issue of Journal of Theoretical
Biology on the mind-matter problem. <P>
A graduate course (3p) in theoretical  biology and philosophy of science
has been given in  collaboration with H. Liljenstr&ouml;m, Royal Institute
of Technology. <P>
Fredrik Elinder has defended his thesis "Surface charges of voltage-gated
ion channels".<P>

<BR>
<H3>Research Framework</H3>
To understand the brain it is necessary, as pointed out at other places in
this report, to study nerve activity at all levels. The basis for the
electrical activity of the brain is the activity of ion channels in the
nerve membrane.  It is necessary to complement the increased amount of
structural data on ion channels at a molecular level with functional,
biophysical and pharmacological data at a corresponding level. Important
problems to solve, are for instance the role of charges and the kinetics of
the channels. Such problems are studied experimentally with voltage and
patch clamp techniques on different preparations, and theoretically with
channel model computations. <P>
During the year the group has started voltage clamp studies on cloned
channels expressed in oocytes of <CITE>Xenopus laevis</CITE>. This powerful
technique makes it possible to analyze the channel kinetics in molecular
detail.  The experiments were made in collaboration with Dr Madeja at
University of M&uuml;nster. Several types of mammalian K channels were used
to test a hypothesis developed from voltage clamp studies on the effect of
metal ions. The patch clamp studies of hippocampal slices under visual
control with the technique developed by the Sakmann group in Heidelberg and
recently introduced at the laboratory have continued. This technique is
essential for analyzing neurons in relative intact tissue, and have been
used to test hypotheses based on studies of primary cultures of hippocampal
neurons. Further, the patch clamp technique has also been used extensively
to analyze cell lines (rhabdomyoma cells) and primary cultures of
hippocampal neurons in collaboration with other groups at and outside the
Department. The voltage clamp method developed for myelinated nerve fibres
has been used for studies of statistical and pharmacological properties of
voltage gated Na and K channels. It is, as pointed out in earlier reports,
well suited for high-resolution measurements of these channels. The reason
is that the preparation is well characterized, probably quantitively better
than any other membrane preparation, and that the membrane sites of action
are easily accessible for many blocking and gating modifying substances.
During the year it has mainly been used to study current fluctuations in
order to develop a kinetic model of the Na channel, and the metal binding
to Na and K channels in order to understand the functional role of the
charge profile of the channel molecule. It has also been used in
preliminary experiments with certain local anaesthetics, suggested to
selectively block channels responsible for the resting potential. The
origin of the resting potential is still unsatisfactorily known.  <P>

<H4>1. Metal ion binding to Na and K channels and the role of surface
charges (Elinder, &Aring;rhem)</H4>
In previous studies on the trivalent gadolinium ion it was shown that the
effect on the Na and K channels in the nodal membrane could be described by
three separate mechanisms, mediated by separate sites of action. Further,
quantitative models for the gadolinium ion binding, based on the assumed
molecular structure of the channels, were developed. The models include
metal ion binding to a modulatory site and the modification of a surface
potential due to neutralization of fixed surface charges according to the
Gouy-Chapman theory. The models made it possible to estimate the charge
density of the nodal Na and K channels more exactly than previously. The
models also suggest the location of the modulatory sites as well as the
location of charges on the channels. This makes it possible to predict the
effect of other metal ions on other channel types from data on the primary
structure of the channel.<P>
In order to test these predictions it is necessary to use channels whose
molecular identity is known in detail. Unfortunately this is not the case
for the channels in the nodal membrane of <CITE>Xenopus laevis</CITE>.
Furthermore, the populations are not homogenous. To circumvent these
problems the technique to express identified cloned channels in
<CITE>Xenopus</CITE> oocytes was used. In collaboration with Dr Madeja at
the University of M&uuml;nster experiments on the effect of the divalent
strontium ion on five types of mammalian K channels were performed. The
cRNA used for the expression was obtained from Prof. Pongs at Hamburg
University. The choice of strontium for the analysis was based on the fact
that strontium seems to bind less to the channels than other available
metal ions (with the exception of magnesium that was excluded of other
reasons), and thus is assumed to mainly neutralize the charges by
screening. The results showed that the previously presented hypothesis that
certain functional properties of the channel can be predicted from the
primary structure was valid. The effective charge density of the studied K
channels seems to be mainly determined by a segment close to the
poreforming segment. <P>

<H4>2. The kinetics of the Na channel: Fluctuation analysis (Elinder,
Frankenhaeuser, &Aring;rhem)</H4>
The analysis of Na channel kinetics by fluctuation analysis of
non-stationary Na-currents in the myelinated axon under voltage clamp
conditions has led to the development of a detailed kinetic model. A large
number of models suggested in the literature could be excluded. The most
unexpected feature of the developed model is that it includes two open
states, suggesting channel properties that are experimentally testable. In
collaboration with Prof. Richard Keynes at Cambridge University, Elinder
has analyzed other aspects of Na channel models, based on the studies by
Keynes on the Na channel gating current. These aspects will be included in
the presented model. <BR>

<H4>3. Electrophysiology of hippocampal neurons: Graded impulses and
spontaneous activity (&Aring;rhem,  Englund, Nerg&aring;rdh)</H4>
Earlier patch clamp studies of cultured hippocampal neurons have
unexpectedly shown that certain small-sized neurons generate impulses that
vary in amplitude with stimulus strength. This behaviour deviates from the
generally accepted all-or-nothing law. Further, these small-<BR>
sized neurons show spontaneous activity, that can be shown to be triggered
by single channel events. Both these findings may have consequences for the
information processing of the brain. The latter finding suggests that
random gating of ion channel molecules may be used as a mechanism for
stochastic triggering of spontaneous impulses in mammalian central neurons.
<P>
In order to study these phenomena under more "intact" conditions the
recently introduced hippocampal slice preparation was used. Mainly
spontaneously active neurons of a type corresponding to those earlier
investigated, i.e. small round neurons, were analyzed. The results suggest
that the earlier observations also are valid for neurons in hippocampal
tissue.<P>

<H4>4. Theoretical studies (&Aring;rhem, Lindahl)</H4>
&Aring;rhem has with B.I.B. Lindahl at Stockholm University and in
collaboration with Karl Popper continued the analysis of the proposal by
Popper that certain mental states can be described in terms of force fields
of classical physics. Attempts have been made to understand the role of
spontaneous activity in this context.

<BR>
<H2>IV. Research Group of H.Lagercrantz,Y.Yamamoto, and M.Runold</H2>
<HR><BR>
H.Lagercrantz, professor in neonatology at the Karolinska Hospital together
with drs Y.Yamamoto and M.Runold has studied further functional role of
various neuroactive substances during development.<P>
<STRONG>Michael Runold and Shi-zend Yuan</STRONG> have continued the study
of the mechanisms of the autoresuscitation. They have found that bilateral
adrenalectomy reduced the ability to tolerate anoxia in the newborn rats as
indicated by the significantly shorted gasping duration. The
autoresuscitation mechanism was impaired after adrenalectomy, especially in
the 8-day old rat group. The ability of autoresuscitation was abolished
following phentolamine administration. Propranol did not affect the ability
to autoresuscitate after asphyxia. Glucose supplementation was found to
prolong the duration of hypoxic gasping in 8-day old rats, while the
survival after glucose was reduced in both 1-day and 8 day old rats,
particulary in 8-day old rats. The results indicate that hyperglycemia
might jeopardize the autoresuscitation mechanism in newborn rats during
anoxia. Recovery from apnea was reduced when oxygen was given after the
last gasp. However, a conciderable number of rats survived spontaneously.
This suggests that autoresuscitation is still active even after gasping
period.<P>
<STRONG>Yuji Yamamoto and Hiroshi Otsuka</STRONG> have studied further the
central mechanisms for the integration and the modulation of the
ventilatory "drive"-factors and the respiratory rhythmgeneration in in
vitro preparation from newborn rats. We examined the effects of <BR>
NMDA antagonists, APV and non-NMDA antagonists, CNQX on inspiratory neurons
in the medulla oblongata and C4 and C5 ventral root activity in the
<CITE>in vitro</CITE> brainstem-spinal cord preparation of newborn rats.
Application of APV induced increased rate of inspiratory neuron bursts, and
decreased burst duration. The C4 burst activity was almost abolished by
application of CNQX, whereas inspiratory neurons continued to discharge
rhythmically. The results suggest that non-NMDA receptors are not crucially
involved in the medullary respiratory rhythmogenesis. We have also examined
the effects of halothane on the central respiratory activity. Halothane
decreased respiratory burst frequency, inspiratory duration, ventral C4
activity and respiratory minute activity in a concentration-dependent
fashion. Bicuculline counteracted the depressive effect of halothane on
respiratory burst frequency, C4 activity, and respiratory minute activity.
Inspiratory neuronal activity corresponded to these changes. Activities of
Pre-Inspiratory (Pre-I) neurons and expiratory neurons in the RVL were also
inhibited by halothane. The C4 activity failed to correspond to the
discharge of Pre-I neurons. <P>
These results suggest that modification of GABAA receptor-mediated
neurotransmission is in part responsible for respiratory depression by
halothane, especially the effect on respiratory frequency, peak C4
activity, and minute activity. There seems to be a desynchronization
between Pre-I neurons and C4 discharge during halothane anaesthesia. <P>
<STRONG>Yuji Yamamoto and Eric Herlenius</STRONG> have studied the central
adenosine effects on respiratory activity during postnatal period by using
the isolated rat brainstem-spinal cord preparation. <P>
Endogeneneous adenosine caused a depressing effect on respiratory activity
by a direct action on medullary respiration-related neurons. Adenosine
antagonist theophylline abolished this effect, by blocking central
adenosine receptors. Furthermore, the effect of adenosine was age
dependent, younger animals hade more pronounced effect compaired to more
than 2 day-old rats. In neonatal rats (less than 48h) adenosine play a role
in the irregular type of breathing. <P>

Curt von Euler is president of the international dyslexia research
organization "Academia Rodinensis Pro Remediatione". In this capacity he
has taken part in the program committee and gave the opening speech for the
international symposia on "Eye Movements and Reading with Special Reference
to Dyslexia". This symposium, which was a Wenner-Gren Center Symposium held
in January 1994, was organized by professor Gunnar Lennerstrand and docent
Jan Ygge.<P>
Euler has taken part in the planning and led the 23rd international
symposium of the Rodin Renediation Academy. This symposium was held on
Malta, September 20-24. The theme was "Diagnostic Methods, Crusial Markers
and Genetics for Dyslexia". The main part of the scientific program
consisted of 16 plenary lectures given by leading scientists in the fields
of psychology, neuropsychology, cognitive science, linguistics, neurology
and genetics. In addition, there was a rich menu of poster
presentations.<P>
Euler is also chairman of the Sweidsh Dyslexia Foundation and the Swedish
Dyslexia Association, which <CITE>inter alia</CITE> has been in charge of
two different research projects. One of these is aimed at determining the
occurrance of developmental dyslexia among young (18-25 yr. old) unemployed
people. The other project was a study of developmental dyslexia among
criminals in a Swedish prison. These studies are in progress. Preliminary
results have shown a large over-representaion of dyslexia in both of these
populations.<P>
The longitudinal multicenter research project on developmental dyslexia
described in last years"'"s annual report has proceeded as planned. The
results of this project, which now is in its sixth year, are now on the way
to be published in a series of papers as well as in the form of a book.<P>
In an extension of this project Euler together with prof. Lennerstrand of
the Ophtalmology at the Karolinska Institute and Huddinge Hospital, prof.
Ingvar Lundberg, Dept. of Psychology, University of Ume&aring;, and a group
of reserach workers at the Dept. of Practical Pedagogics at the University
of V&auml;xj&ouml;, have undertaken to investigate the genetics of
developmental dyslexia. The object is to find some 100 families in which
dyslexia can be well documented in two or more generations, and to describe
the pedigress of these family members. Blood samples of the family members
are collected and sent to our collaborators at the laboratory of molecular
biology at the Institute of Deafness and other Communication Disorders,
NIH, Bethesda, USA. So far about 40 families have been well documented in
this way and blood samples from them have been received by the laboratory
at NIH.<P>
The study on adult dyslexic individuals with MRI and PET techniques during
different linguistic tasks, mentioned in last year"'"s report, is no being
prepared for publication. The project is running at the department of
Neuroradiology and clinical neurophysiology at the Karolinska Hospital
jointly by prof. T. Greitz, prof. L. Eriksson and assoc. prof. Martin
Ingvar, and assoc. prof. P. af Trampe, Dept of Linguistics, Stockholm

Neuroscience Meeting. Roland and Guly&aacute;s are the members of the

<BR>
<H3>Research Framework</H3>
To understand the functioning of the brain, one must understand how the
brain works at all levels: Membrane level, cellular level, small neuronal
network level as well as the macro-<BR>
network level. One of the more recent level-bridging techniques is positron
emission tomography by which one can study membrane and receptor events as
well as the behaviour of macro-networks. Most often, as in our laboratory,
the regional cerebral blood flow is used as aparameter of regional
synaptic metabolism.<P>
Based on the relationship between changes in synaptic metabolism and
changes in synaptic activity and the relationship between synaptic
metabolism and regional cerebral blood flow, this technique is used
together with magnetic resonance tomographic techniques and neuroanatomical
techniques to understand the principles for brain work in terms of
macro-<BR>
network organisation. The results of such investigations are 3D pictures of
the brain, often representing more than a million measurement points each.
The manipulation and statistical analysis of such data require advanced
software, development of algorithms and statistical procedures, which are
therefore also substantial part of the activities. Specific programs
include:<P>

<H4>1. The functional organization of the motor cortices in man (Kinomura,
Roland and Ledberg)</H4>
Within the three major motor cortical zones: the premotor zone, the
supplementary motor zone and the primary motor zone, we have now found
several independent areas functionally and anatomically in man. These are
the rostral and caudal cingulate motor areas, the area 4a, the area 4p
(formally the primary motor area) the supplementary motor area and the
pre-SMA. The pre-motor areas seem difficult to parcel at the present.
Several representations of the hand and arm exist here.<P>

<H4>2. The somatosensory cortices in man (Ledberg, O'Sullivan and Roland)</H4>
The recent research has concentrated upon finding several somatosensory
areas in the parietal operculum of man. Here at least three independent
areas of which one might be the so-called secondary somatosensory area have
been discovered.<P>

<H4>3. Functional parcellation of the visual cortices in man
(Guly&aacute;s, Larsson, Roland in collaboration with Cowey and Heywood,
University of Oxford)</H4>
In humans, V1 and V4 (MT) are relatively well characterised
cytoarchitectonically and myeloarchitectonically as well as functionally.
From studies by our own group and others, we now know that the visual
cortical areas extent into the parietal lobe rather far rostrally and into
the inferior temporal gyrus. Traditionally, one has the view that the
visual perception follows a dorsal or parietal route for spatial
information and the information about movement in the field of view, and a
temporal route for analysis of objects and the details (Ungerleider and
Mishikin 1982). We have shown that stereoscopical vision activates
occipital and parietal cortical fields (Guly&aacute;s and Roland 1994a):
However, form perception activates both parietal and temporal lobe areas.
Similarly, colour perception also activates parietal and temporal lobe
areas (Guly&aacute;s and Roland 1994b). Furthermore, a single visual
submodality is always activated by multiple cortical fields and not as
proposed by Zeki by only one cortical field. Finally, in the discrimination
of form attributes a parallel  organisation is apparent (Guly&aacute;s et
al. 1994), Thus form provided by colour cues and form provided by disparity
cues activate non-overlapping visual cortical fields. More rostral parts of
the visual association areas, that is posterior part of the inferior
temporal gyrus and the fusiform gyri, the angular gyrus and the superior
parietal lobule as well as precuneus are potential storage sites for
complex visual information (Roland and Guly&aacute;s 1994; Roland and
Guly&aacute;s 1995).<P>

<H4>4. Visual memories (Klingberg, Kinomura, Roland)</H4>
The entorrhinal cortex in man seems to have a special role for establishing
and maintaining intramodal associations. Working memory representations as
well as long-term memory representations of visual patterns which are
stationary are located both in the temporal cortex (fusiform gyrus) and
posterior inferior temporal cortex as well as in the parietal cortex.<P>

<H4>5. Development of advanced tools for analysis of 3D pictures of the
brain (Graufelds, &Aring;kerman, Lindeberg and Roland)</H4>
The new computerized atlas, at present the most accurate in re-formatting
3D images of the brain into a standard format has been further developed.
Tools for unfolding the cerebral cortex of man have been implemented which
permits a preliminary multiple area unfolded map with moderate area
distortion. Finally a new statistical model for the estimate of overlapping
functional field has been developed in collaboration with Mikael Raab and
Lars Holst at the KTH.<P>

<H4>Development of human control.</H4>
During the spring Forssberg was a Fulbright Scholar at the Department of
Neurology, Childrens Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston,
Massachusetts. Forssberg organized, in collaboration with Francois Clarac,
a Jaques Monod Conference on "Locomotion - from neural networks to
cognition" in Aussois, France. He has on invitation lectured in Boston,
Cambridge, Missuola, Philadelphia, New York, Portland, Quebec, Ohlstadt and
Groningen.<P>
The development of postural control and fine motor skill is studied
experimentally in healthy children with perinatal brain injuries. The
postural control is studied together with Hirschfeld, Eriksson and Brogren
by means of a movable platform perturbing a sitting or standing child while
EMG is recorded by surface electrodes and kinematics by an automatized
movement analyzing system (ELIT). A backward perturbation of a sitting
subject elicits an instant backward rotation of the pelvis, which triggers
central pattern generators for postural adjustments. However, before the
muscles are activated, the pattern is modified by a multi-<BR>
sensorial input including information from the vestibular system. The basic
pattern, triggered by the pelvic rotation, seems to mature before a child
is able to sit up without support. The capability to modify the disorder,
spastic diplegia, only activate the basic pattern seen in young children.
The pattern is stereotyped with only minor modifications. The neural
control of the precision grip is studied together with Eliasson, Iwasaki
and Ingvarsson by a special instrument, which monitor the isometric forces
applied to the grip surfaces. During this year the tactile regulation of
the grip force depending on the friction of the grip surface has been
studied in healthy children and in children with cerebral palsy. The
capability to adapt during an ongoing lift develops normally during the
second year but it is not until the third year children can store the
tactile information into an internal representation of the object and scale
the isometric force pulse during the succeeding lift. Small children need
several lifts to form the representation and only exhibit minor influence
on the force development. The anticipatory capacity is improved with
increasing age and is getting adult like at about 6 years. Children with
cerebral palsy have an impaired feed back regulation as well as weak
anticipation.<P>
Clinical follow up studies are performed on preterm infants, infants with
plexus brachialis paresis, and children with spastic diplegia. Preterm
infants and infants subjected to perinatal asphyxia are followed during the
neonatal period and during subsequent motor and cognitive development
(together with Lagercrantz, Katz-Salamon, Gerner). Special efforts are made
to describe the pathogenesis and the location of brain lesions. Children
with defined perinatal brain lesion are later studied regarding their
postural control and fine manipulative skill. Since several years the
recovery of arm function and manipulation are followed in children with
plexus brachialis palsy, operated on with a nerve graft at the damage
location of the plexus, providing possibility for neurones to regenerate to
the nerves of the arm. Finally, a clinical investigation comparing three
different methods to treat children with spastic diplegia has started, i.e.
selective dorsal rhizotomy, orthopedic surgery and intensified physical
therapy.<P>

<IMG SRC="intro-body.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="300">

Our immune system protects us against threats. These include viruses, bacteria and parasites causing infectious diseases, from ordinary flu to full-blown malaria. The white blood cells of the defense system are produced in the marrow of our bones. The cel
ls are carried in the blood to specialized organs, where they develop and communicate to launch immune responses against infections. Immune responses are aggressive and must be controlled. They should be activated only when the body is threatened by disea
se. To learn how to start or stop the immune system we must understand how microorganisms and sick cells are recognized by white blood cells.<P>
Some white blood cells, like macrophages, destroy and eat bacteria and damaged cells. The B cells produce antibodies, which can neutralize viruses, bacteria or toxic proteins in the blood and other body fluids. The T cells can trace microorganisms that le
ave the body fluids to invade cells. Each T killer cell carries receptors for one type of foreign substance, "antigen". T cells can bind to infected cells and kill them. This can prevent spread of the microorganism within the body. But how can the T cells
 specifically identify or "recognize" the infected cells?<P>

but also an MHC molecule of the infected mouse strain. MHC molecules are normal components of healthy cells. They were known to differ among individuals and to cause rejection of organ transplants and they are therefore sometimes called transplantation an
tigens. It came as a surprise that they were also involved in recognition of infected cells.<P> Doherty and Zinkernagel presented two main theoretical models to explain their observations. These models have inspired immunologists and set the stage for res

The "dual recognition" model assumed that two receptors on the T cell recognized virus antigen and the MHC molecule separately (best illustrated by the previous figure of the "correct combination").<P>
The "altered self" model was based on one T-cell receptor recognizing an MHC molecule modified by virus antigen - or "a little bit of transplantation antigen, a little bit of virus," as Doherty and Zinkernagel have phrased it. (This is illustrated in the 
"zoom" above, like the previous model based on figures in the original reports.) Through important discoveries made later by other scientists, we are now getting a clearer picture of the scenario.  The T-cell receptor, not yet identified at the time of th
e discovery, recognizes a small part of a virus protein, attached in a cleft formed by the transplantation antigen.

There are many different variants of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules.  We all carry different combinations.  Such variation is caused by the MHC genes that we have inherited.<P>
Many chronic inflammatory diseases have been shown to occur preferentially in individuals carrying certain variants of MHC genes.<P>
<A NAME="Bechterews"></A>
<IMG SRC="imp-spine.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="279">
The understanding of how T lymphocytes recognize antigens in association with a specific variant of an MHC molecule has led to better understanding of how the immune cells destroy brain tissue or joints in "autoimmune diseases."  This provides a basis to 
specifically change or avoid reactions causing autoimmune disease, while not disturbing immune reactions against microorganisms.<P><BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="imp-joints.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="132" HEIGHT="150">
<STRONG>Ankylosing spondylitis (Bechterew's Disease)</STRONG>, a joint inflammation mainly affecting the spine, occurs only in individuals carrying a certain variant of MHC molecule (HLA-B27).  Much evidence suggests that molecules derived from microorgan
isms interact with the B27 molecule in causing the destructive immune reactions.<P><BR><BR>

<A NAME="MS"></A>
<TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="350" ALIGN=LEFT>
<TD><STRONG>Multiple sclerosis (MS)</STRONG> is an autoimmune disease in which destructive immune reactions occur within the brain, causing loss of the myelin sheath surrounding neurons.  Such loss may cause paresis and affect both vision and psychic func
tions.  Individuals with the DR2 variant of MHC genes are most susceptible to the disease.</TD>

<STRONG>Towards Novel Vaccines.</STRONG> Vaccination is the most important way to make use of the immune system in medicine.  By vaccination we prepare the immune system to respond earlier and more efficiently against the antigen in question.  The discove
ry of Doherty and Zinkernagel has taught us important things to consider in the design of future vaccines.  It has led to the search for the critical components of viruses and bacteria as well as cancer cells that are recognized together with MHC molecule
s.  We also understand that the MHC molecules of the vaccinated individuals can influence the result.<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="imp-tcell.gif" WIDTH="220" HEIGHT="200"></CENTER><P>
Attempts are now being made to vaccinate against recurrence and spread of certain forms of cancer within the body, metastasis.  After surgical removal of a tumor, patients may still have small colonies of residual tumor cells in their bodies.  Critical pa
rts of proteins in the cancer cells are identified and used for vaccination in the hope of stimulating T killer cells that can attack the residual cancer cells.  It is then essential to type for the MHC molecules of the patient.  Only the "correct combina
tions" of antigen and MHC molecule are expected to work, just as in the original discovery of Doherty and Zinkernagel.<P>

<H3>Poeten och v&auml;rlden</H3>

Det s&auml;gs att f&ouml;rsta meningen &auml;r den allra sv&aring;raste n&auml;r man ska h&aring;lla tal. I s&aring; fall har jag det sv&aring;raste bakom mig ... Men jag k&auml;nner p&aring; mig att f&ouml;ljande meningar ocks&aring; kommer att bli sv&aring;ra, den tredje, den sj&auml;tte, den tionde, fram till och med den sista, eftersom det &auml;r poesi jag ska tala om. I det &auml;mnet har jag uttalat mig s&aring; s&auml;llan, n&auml;stan inte alls. Och jag har aldrig tyckt mig vara s&auml;rskilt bra p&aring; det. D&auml;rf&ouml;r blir mitt anf&ouml;rande inte alltf&ouml;r l&aring;ngt. Ofullkomligheter &auml;r alltid l&auml;ttare att sm&auml;lta om de serveras i sm&aring; portioner.<P>


	Poeten av idag &auml;r skeptiskt inst&auml;lld, rentav misst&auml;nksam - inte minst gentemot sig sj&auml;lv. Bara motvilligt kallar han sig offentligt f&ouml;r poet, som om han sk&auml;mdes lite f&ouml;r det. Men i v&aring;rt h&ouml;gr&ouml;stade tidevarv &auml;r det mycket l&auml;ttare att tillst&aring; sina fel och brister, bara de framst&auml;lls p&aring; ett effektfullt s&auml;tt, och desto sv&aring;rare att medge sina f&ouml;rtj&auml;nster, som ligger djupare f&ouml;rdolda och som man sj&auml;lv inte riktigt kan tro p&aring; ... N&auml;r poeten blir tillfr&aring;gad, eller pratar med folk han st&ouml;ter p&aring;, och han &auml;r s&aring; illa tvungen att tala om vad han sysslar med, d&aring; s&auml;ger han lite vagt att han "skriver", eller ocks&aring; n&auml;mner han n&aring;got arbete han g&ouml;r vid sidan av. Och n&auml;r utfr&aring;garna eller medpassagerarna p&aring; bussen f&aring;r veta att de har att g&ouml;ra med en poet reagerar de med en l&auml;ttare k&auml;nsla av misstro och oro. Jag antar att en filosof kan v&aring;lla samma slags f&ouml;rl&auml;genhet. Men filosofens utg&aring;ngsl&auml;ge brukar vara b&auml;ttre, eftersom han f&ouml;r det mesta kan styra ut sin yrkesbeteckning med en vetenskaplig titel. Professor i filosofi l&aring;ter betydligt seri&ouml;sare.<P>


	N&aring;gra professorer i poesi finns det d&auml;remot inte. Det skulle n&auml;mligen betyda att det r&ouml;rde sig om en syssla som kr&auml;vde specialiststudier, regelr&auml;tt avlagda examina, teoretiska arbeten, rikligt f&ouml;rsedda med bibliografier och referenser, och till slut ett diplom att mottaga i h&ouml;gtidliga former. Vilket i sin tur skulle inneb&auml;ra att alla pappren med de aldrig s&aring; utm&auml;rkta dikterna p&aring; inte r&auml;ckte f&ouml;r att bli poet - nej, f&ouml;rst och fr&auml;mst skulle det beh&ouml;vas ett mindre papper med st&auml;mpel p&aring;. Vi minns att det var just p&aring; s&aring;dana grunder som den ryska poesins stolthet, sedermera Nobelpristagaren Joseph Brodsky, d&ouml;mdes till f&ouml;rvisning. Han f&ouml;rklarades som "parasit", eftersom han inte hade vederb&ouml;rligt intyg p&aring; att han var poet ...<P>


	F&ouml;r n&aring;gra &aring;r sedan hade jag gl&auml;djen och &auml;ran att f&aring; l&auml;ra k&auml;nna Joseph Brodsky. Jag m&auml;rkte d&aring; att han, som den ende bland de poeter jag har k&auml;nt, med f&ouml;rk&auml;rlek kallade sig sj&auml;lv "poet", och han uttalade ordet utan inre motst&aring;nd, p&aring; ett n&auml;stan utmanande naturligt s&auml;tt. Jag tror att han gjorde det d&auml;rf&ouml;r att han mindes de brutala f&ouml;r&ouml;dmjukelser han hade varit utsatt f&ouml;r i sin ungdom.<P>


	I lyckligare l&auml;nder, d&auml;r den m&auml;nskliga v&auml;rdigheten inte tr&auml;ds f&ouml;r n&auml;r lika l&auml;tt, vill poeterna givetvis bli publicerade, l&auml;sta och f&ouml;rst&aring;dda, men de g&ouml;r just ingenting numera, eller v&auml;ldigt lite, f&ouml;r att dagligdags skilja sig fr&aring;n andra m&auml;nniskor. &Auml;nd&aring; var det inte l&auml;nge sedan, under de f&ouml;rsta decennierna av v&aring;rt sekel, som poeterna &auml;lskade att chockera med utstuderad kl&auml;dsel och excentriskt uppf&ouml;rande. Men det var alltid en uppvisning, avsedd f&ouml;r publik. Sedan kom det &ouml;gonblick d&aring; poeten st&auml;ngde d&ouml;rren om sig, kastade av sig sl&auml;ngkappan och grannl&aring;ten, den poetiska rekvisitan, och blev ensam med sin tystnad, i v&auml;ntan p&aring; sig sj&auml;lv, med ett oskrivet blad framf&ouml;r sig. F&ouml;r det &auml;r det enda som r&auml;knas egentligen.<P>


	En sak att l&auml;gga m&auml;rke till: h&auml;r produceras rader av filmer som handlar om stora vetenskapsm&auml;n och konstn&auml;rer och deras liv. En n&aring;gorlunda ambiti&ouml;s regiss&ouml;r st&auml;ller sig uppgiften att p&aring; ett trov&auml;rdigt s&auml;tt presentera den kreativa process som leder fram till de epokg&ouml;rande uppt&auml;ckterna och de lysande konstverken. Med viss framg&aring;ng lyckas han visa hur en vetenskapsman arbetar: laboratoriet och alla instrumenten, och mekanismerna som s&auml;tts i r&ouml;relse, f&aring;ngar &aring;sk&aring;darens uppm&auml;rksamhet f&ouml;r en stund. H&auml;r finns dessutom den dramatik som ligger i sj&auml;lva ovissheten huruvida experimentet, som g&ouml;rs om f&ouml;r tusende g&aring;ngen i modifierad form, till slut ska ge det f&ouml;rv&auml;ntade resultatet. Filmer om konstn&auml;rer kan ocks&aring; bli sev&auml;rda - h&auml;r f&aring;r man f&ouml;lja en tavlas tillkomstfaser, fr&aring;n f&ouml;rsta strecket till sista penseldraget. Och i filmer om komposit&ouml;rer finns musiken med hela tiden - fr&aring;n de f&ouml;rsta takterna, som tons&auml;ttaren h&ouml;r inuti sitt huvud, fram till verkets f&auml;rdiga, orkestrerade form. Alltsammans &auml;r fortfarande lika naivt och s&auml;ger lika lite om det underliga sj&auml;lstillst&aring;nd som b&auml;r det g&auml;ngse namnet inspiration, men h&auml;r finns &aring;tminstone n&aring;got att titta p&aring; och lyssna till.<P>


	Desto v&auml;rre &auml;r det med poeterna. Deras arbete g&ouml;r sig inte alls p&aring; bild. En m&auml;nniska sitter vid ett bord eller ligger p&aring; en soffa, stirrar in i v&auml;gen eller upp i taket, skriver d&aring; och d&aring; sju rader ord, stryker en av dem efter en kvart, och s&aring; g&aring;r en timme till utan att n&aring;gonting h&auml;nder ... Vilken publik kan i l&auml;ngden st&aring; ut med n&aring;got s&aring;dant?<P>


	Jag n&auml;mnde nyss inspirationen. P&aring; fr&aring;gan vad den &auml;r, om den finns, brukar v&aring;ra dagars poeter svara undvikande. Inte d&auml;rf&ouml;r att de aldrig har v&auml;lsignats med denna inre gnista. Sk&auml;let &auml;r ett annat - sv&aring;righeten att f&ouml;r andra f&ouml;rklara det man sj&auml;lv inte f&ouml;rst&aring;r.<P>


	Ocks&aring; jag f&aring;r ibland den fr&aring;gan och h&aring;ller mig d&aring; undan den springande punkten. I st&auml;llet brukar jag svara s&aring; h&auml;r: inspiration &auml;r inte ett exklusivt privilegium f&ouml;r poeter eller konstn&auml;rer i st&ouml;rsta allm&auml;nhet. Det finns, har alltid funnits och kommer alltid att finnas en sorts m&auml;nniskor som drabbas av inspiration. Det &auml;r alla de som medvetet v&auml;ljer sitt arbete och utf&ouml;r det med liv och lust, med fantasi. Det finns till exempel s&aring;dana l&auml;kare och pedagoger, det finns s&aring;dana tr&auml;dg&aring;rdsm&auml;stare och hundra yrken till. F&ouml;r dem kan arbetet vara ett oupph&ouml;rligt &auml;ventyr, d&auml;r de hela tiden hittar nya utmaningar. Trots m&ouml;dor och tillkortakommanden falnar aldrig deras nyfikenhet. Ur varje g&aring;ta som de har l&ouml;st fladdrar det upp en hel sv&auml;rm av nya fr&aring;gor. Inspirationen - vad den nu &auml;r f&ouml;r n&aring;gonting - uppst&aring;r ur ett st&auml;ndigt "Jag vet inte".<P>


	S&aring;dana m&auml;nniskor &auml;r inte alltf&ouml;r talrika. De flesta inbyggare p&aring; v&aring;r jord arbetar f&ouml;r sitt uppeh&auml;lle, arbetar d&auml;rf&ouml;r att de m&aring;ste. De har inte valt arbete efter sin egen lidelse, utan deras levnadsomst&auml;ndigheter har valt &aring;t dem. Ett arbete som man tycker illa om, ett arbete som tr&aring;kar ut en, som har sitt enda v&auml;rde i att det trots sin tristess inte &auml;r tillg&auml;ngligt f&ouml;r alla, det &auml;r ett av m&auml;nniskornas gissel. Och inte ser det ut att bli n&aring;gon &auml;ndring d&auml;rvidlag de n&auml;rmaste &aring;rhundradena.<P>


	Jag tar mig allts&aring; friheten att s&auml;ga att visserligen fr&aring;ntar jag poeterna inspirationsmonopolet, men samtidigt r&auml;knar jag dem till den lilla kretsen av lyckligt lottade.<P>


	H&auml;r kanske ett tvivel har b&ouml;rjat spira hos mina &aring;h&ouml;rare. Alla dessa b&ouml;dlar, diktatorer, fanatiker och demagoger som sl&aring;ss om makten med sina f&aring; och gapiga paroller, de &auml;lskar ju ocks&aring; sitt arbete och utf&ouml;r det idogt och uppfinningsrikt. Ja, det g&ouml;r de - men de "vet". De vet, och det de vet &auml;r nog f&ouml;r dem, en g&aring;ng f&ouml;r alla. De &auml;r inte nyfikna p&aring; n&aring;gonting d&auml;rut&ouml;ver, f&ouml;r det skulle kunna ta udden av deras argument. Men en vetskap som inte alstrar nya fr&aring;gor blir livl&ouml;s mycket snart, tappar den temperatur som h&aring;ller vid liv. Och i sina ytterlighetsformer kan den sortens vetande - som vi vet s&aring; v&auml;l fr&aring;n v&aring;r &auml;ldre och nyare historia - vara livsfarligt f&ouml;r samh&auml;llena i v&auml;rlden.<P>


	D&auml;rf&ouml;r h&aring;ller jag dem s&aring; h&ouml;gt, de tre sm&aring; orden: "Jag vet inte". Sm&aring; men starkt bevingade. De vidgar v&aring;ra liv till de vidder som finns inom oss och dem d&auml;r v&aring;r ringa Jord h&auml;nger och gungar. Om inte Isaac Newton hade sagt till sig sj&auml;lv: "Jag vet inte", kunde &auml;pplena ha haglat mitt f&ouml;r &ouml;gonen p&aring; honom d&auml;r i tr&auml;dg&aring;rden, och han hade p&aring; sin h&ouml;jd plockat upp n&aring;gra och tuggat i sig dem med god aptit. Om min landsmaninna Marie Sklodowska-Curie inte hade sagt till sig sj&auml;lv: "Jag vet inte", skulle hon v&auml;l ha blivit kemil&auml;rarinna p&aring; n&aring;got internat f&ouml;r flickor av god familj, och detta - i alla avseenden hederliga - arbete skulle ha upptagit hennes liv. Men hon sade till sig sj&auml;lv om och om igen: "Jag vet inte", och det var de orden som f&ouml;rde henne till Stockholm tv&aring; g&aring;nger om, d&auml;r m&auml;nniskor som har ett rastl&ouml;st och s&ouml;kande sinnelag bel&ouml;nas med Nobelpris.<P>


	Ocks&aring; poeten m&aring;ste, om han &auml;r en riktig poet, st&auml;ndigt s&auml;ga till sig sj&auml;lv: "Jag vet inte". I och med varje dikt f&ouml;rs&ouml;ker han att finna l&ouml;sningen p&aring; g&aring;tan, men s&aring; fort han har satt punkt blir han bet&auml;nksam igen, han kommer underfund med att l&ouml;sningen var av tillf&auml;llig natur, svaret var ingalunda utt&ouml;mmande. Allts&aring; g&ouml;r han nya f&ouml;rs&ouml;k om och om igen, och med tiden samlar litteraturhistorikerna alla dessa bevis p&aring; hans missn&ouml;je med sig sj&auml;lv till en stor bunt och kallar den f&ouml;r hans "f&ouml;rfattarskap" ...<P>


	Det h&auml;nder att jag dr&ouml;mmer om s&aring;dana situationer som aldrig g&aring;r att f&ouml;rverkliga. Jag kan till exempel vara fr&auml;ck nog att t&auml;nka mig att jag f&ouml;r samtal med Predikaren, han som har skrivit den s&aring; gripande klagos&aring;ngen &ouml;ver det f&aring;f&auml;ngliga i m&auml;nskliga g&ouml;randen och l&aring;tanden. Jag skulle buga mig s&aring; djupt jag kunde f&ouml;r honom, han &auml;r ju en av de allra st&ouml;rsta diktarna, i varje fall f&ouml;r mig. Men sedan skulle jag ta hans hand och s&auml;ga: "'Intet nytt sker under solen', skriver Du, Min Predikare. Men Du f&ouml;ddes ju sj&auml;lv ny under solen. Och den stora dikt som Du har skrivit &auml;r ocks&aring; den ny under solen, ty f&ouml;re Dig hade ingen skrivit den. Och nya under solen &auml;r alla Dina l&auml;sare, ty de som levde f&ouml;re Dig kunde ju inte l&auml;sa den. Och cypressen som Du sitter under har inte heller den v&auml;xt h&auml;r sedan v&auml;rldens tillblivelse. Den har blivit till p&aring; grund av en annan cypress, som liknade Din, men inte var alldeles densamma. Och jag vill vidare fr&aring;ga Dig, Min Predikare, vad nytt under solen Du &auml;mnar skriva nu. Blir det en forts&auml;ttning p&aring; Din tankeg&aring;ng, eller k&auml;nner Du Dig frestad att s&auml;ga emot Dig sj&auml;lv p&aring; n&aring;gon punkt, trots allt? I Din f&ouml;rra dikt pekade Du ocks&aring; p&aring; gl&auml;djen - f&ouml;rg&auml;nglig, visst, men &auml;n sedan? Kanske &auml;r det gl&auml;djen den ska handla om, Din nya dikt under solen? Har Du skrivit ned n&aring;gonting, ett f&ouml;rsta utkast? F&ouml;r inte t&auml;nker Du v&auml;l s&auml;ga: 'Jag har skrivit allt, jag har inget att till&auml;gga'. S&aring; f&aring;r ingen enda poet i v&auml;rlden s&auml;ga, allra minst en s&aring; stor poet som Du."
<P>


	V&auml;rlden - vad vi &auml;n kan t&auml;nka oss om den, i v&aring;r f&ouml;rf&auml;ran &ouml;ver dess v&auml;ldighet och v&aring;r egen vanmakt inf&ouml;r den, i v&aring;r f&ouml;rbittring &ouml;ver dess likgiltighet f&ouml;r det enskilda lidandet, m&auml;nniskornas, djurens och kanske ocks&aring; v&auml;xternas, ty vem kan vara s&auml;ker p&aring; att v&auml;xterna inte lider; vad vi &auml;n kan t&auml;nka oss om rymden runt den, genomstungen av str&aring;larna fr&aring;n stj&auml;rnorna, stj&auml;rnor kring vilka man har b&ouml;rjat uppt&auml;cka planeter, redan d&ouml;da? fortfarande d&ouml;da?, det vet vi inte; vad vi &auml;n kan t&auml;nka oss om denna m&aring;ttl&ouml;sa teater, dit vi visserligen har intr&auml;desbiljett, men med en giltighetstid som &auml;r s&aring; l&ouml;jligt kort, fr&aring;n ett ofr&aring;nkomligt datum till ett annat; vad vi &auml;n kan t&auml;nka oss om v&auml;rlden - &auml;r den h&auml;pnadsv&auml;ckande.<P>


	Men i beteckningen "h&auml;pnadsv&auml;ckande" d&ouml;ljer sig en logisk f&auml;lla. V&aring;r h&auml;pnad v&auml;cks ju av det som avviker fr&aring;n en k&auml;nd och vedertagen norm, fr&aring;n n&aring;gonting sj&auml;lvklart, det som vi &auml;r vana vid. Och s&aring; finns det ingen s&aring;dan sj&auml;lvklar v&auml;rld. V&aring;r h&auml;pnad st&aring;r p&aring; egna ben, den bygger inte p&aring; j&auml;mf&ouml;relser med n&aring;gonting.<P>


	Jovisst, i dagligt tal, d&auml;r vi inte funderar &ouml;ver varje ord, s&auml;ger vi s&aring;dana saker som "den vanliga v&auml;rlden", "det vanliga livet", "tingens gilla g&aring;ng" ... Men i poesins spr&aring;k, d&auml;r varje ord v&auml;gs p&aring; v&aring;g, finns ingenting som &auml;r vanligt och normalt. Ingen sten och inget moln d&auml;rovanf&ouml;r. Ingen dag och ingen natt d&auml;rp&aring;. Och i synnerhet ingen, ingens, tillvaro i v&auml;rlden.<P>

	Poeterna - s&aring; ser det ut - kommer alltid att ha mycket att st&aring; i.<P>

<H2>From Egg to Adult Fly</H2>
<HR><P>
The egg of the fruit-fly <EM>Drosophila melanogaster</EM> is long and narrow, with a length of 0.4 mm and a diameter of 0.16 mm. The embryonic development starts immediately after the fertilization and goes on for twenty-four hours, after which the egg ha
tches and a larva with 14 segments appears. The larval stage consists of three phases, continues for five days and passes into the pupal stage. After some days of pupation and growth, metamorphosis takes place and a new fly emerges, two millimetres long, 
a fortnight after fertilization.<P>

During the early embryonic development the body becomes divided into 14 invisible segments, and the newly hatched larva contains all of them. Each segment in the larva results in a specific segment in the adult fly. The adult fly consists of a head, three
 thoracic segments, eight or nine abdominal segments and a tail. The segments differ somewhat but in principle they are organized in the same way. The first thoracic segment develops two legs, the second two legs and pair of wings and the third two legs a
nd a couple of halteres (organs of equilibrium).<P>

Segmentation is not specific to insects. It is a common developmental principle which is also obvious in the early human embryo. Its segment-like <EM>somites</EM> are the origin of our vertebral column, ribs and certain muscles.<P>

Since the beginning of the 20th century <EM>Drosophila melanogaster</EM> has been extensively used in genetic research, starting with the American geneticist <A HREF="/laureates/medicine-1933.html">Thomas Hunt Morgan</A>. In 1933 he was awarded the Nobel 
Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discoveries concerning hereditary functions of chromosomes. The Drosophila has only four pairs of chromosomes which facilitates research. Its generation time is short and it is easy to breed.<P>

In his <EM>co-linearity principle</EM>, <STRONG>Edward B. Lewis</STRONG> also found that the genetic expression domains overlap and that the first gene in the complex becomes active a little earlier than the second and so on. This is indicated in the figu

.<P>
<STRONG>Lewis</STRONG> found that the extra pair of wings was due to a duplication of an entire body segment, the 2nd thoracic segment. Inactivity of the first gene of the <EM>bithorax-complex</EM> in the appropriate larval segment caused other homeotic g
enes to respecify the 3rd thoracic segment into one that forms wings instead of halteres.

<H4>Razor-sharp Boundaries</H4>
The blue color reveals the specific activity of two homeotic genes in mouse embryos. In figure A the HOX-D 2 gene is active earlier and nearer the embryo's head-end than the HOX-D 4 gene shown in figure B. In both cases there is a razor-sharp boundary at 
the upper end of the segment wheras gene activity is more diffuse further down.<P>

<H4>The Primitive Brain</H4>

Segmentation of the back part of the primitive brain is visible in the nine rhombomeres. The HOX-B 2 gene is expressed in rhombomere 4, the HOX-B 3 gene in rhombomeres 5 and 6 and the HOX-B 4 gene in rhombomeres 7 and 8.
<CENTER><IMG SRC="c-stri-emb.gif" WIDTH=195 HEIGHT=169 VSPACE=5></CENTER>
If a HOX gene is lost the result is incorrect development of the rhombomeres concerned and - as a consequence of this - incorrect development of the branchial arches, neck or head structures.

<H4>Congenital Malformations in Mouse and Man</H4>
Most of the genes studied by N&uuml;sslein-Volhard, Wieschaus and Lewis have important functions during the early development of the vertebrate embryo. Mutations in such important genes - or altering their expression patterns - may damage the embryonic de
velopment.<P>
Two of the three mouse embryos (see above) show malformations caused by high doses of vitamin A (retinoic acid), which was given to their mothers on day 8 of pregnancy. Vitamin A has caused the homeotic HOX genes 1-4 to become expressed in groups of cells
 that usually do not express these genes. It is well known that high doses of vitamin A taken by women early during pregnancy can disturb the regulation of HOX genes even in the human embryo and cause severe malformations. <P>

Mutations have been found in human genes related to those described for Drosophila. A defective human HOX gene related to the Drosophila gene paired will cause a condition known as Waardenburg's syndrome. It is a very rare disease, affecting one of 42 000

<H2>Hunting for the Genes Behind Pattern Formation in Drosophila's Early Embryonic Development</H2>
<HR><P>
Working together at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg, Germany, Christiane N&uuml;sslein-Volhard and Eric F. Wieschaus decided to find out how segmentation is controlled by genes in the newly fertilized egg of the Drosophila f
ruit fly. Their experimental strategy was unique and well planned. They treated Drosophila females with chemicals which damaged their genes and caused random mutations. They reasoned that since genes control embryonic development it should be possible to 
see the genetic damages as defects in the offspring and thus identify genes that specify segmentation. Studying genes intentionally damaged by mutation was the only accessible way to obtain knowledge about genes controlling development. By disturbing the 
system and looking for what happens you may be able to learn something about it.<P>

Christiane N&uuml;sslein-Volhard and Eric F. Wieschaus studied about 40 000 mutations and were able to identify 15 different genes that control the early phase of Drosophila's embryonic development (through continued research additional such genes have be
en found and today they are about 25). These genes caused defective segmentation when mutated, resulting e.g. in a reduced number of segments, in embryos consisting only of odd-or even-numbered segments or in segments with their head and tail ends looking
 similar.<P>

Much of the embryonic development is controlled by the egg's own genes. They are divided into three functional groups which act as follows:
<UL>
<LI>The <EM>gap-genes</EM> lay the foundations of a rough body plan along the head-to-tail axis,
<LI>the <EM>pair rule-genes</EM> govern formation of every second body segment,
<LI>the <EM>segment polarity-genes</EM> refine the head-to-tail polarity of each individual segment, meaning that the head-end and the tail-end of a segment look different.
</UL>
The three types of genes reflect a gradual refinement of Drosophila's developmental program. They come in three waves, one after the other - and it is a quick work, everything happens within hours!<P>

N&uuml;sslein-Volhard and Wieschaus published their important results 1980 in Nature. Their publication has had an enormous impact on how genes that control development are studied today. The paper is consequently regarded as a milestone in developmental 
biology.

Edward Lewis was long before his time. In the 1970s he summarized the results of his scientific work from several decades and formulated far-seeing theories on the function of homeotic genes in combination both with each other and with the co-linearity pr
inciple. Together with the discoveries made by N&uuml;sslein-Volhard and Wieschaus, Lewis' pioneering work has had an enormous impact on our understanding of how evertebrate and vertebrate embryos develop. Other scientists have later found that the homeot
ic genes of Drosophila directly correspond to similar gene complexes in animals, all the way up to man. The Drosophila system has been an affluent source of knowledge for developmental biologists.<P>

The homeotic genes (here called "HOM" genes) in Drosophila are clustered close to each other in the DNA, and they set a ground plan for embryonic development in the fly. Vertebrates also contain homeotic (HOX) genes. Here, we find four clusters, or comple
xes, of homeotic genes. These genes are closely related to the insect genes, their order in the DNA is the same, and their action during embryonal development follows the same order in time and space in the fly. Thus, the effects on the embryonic head-to-
tail axis of these HOX genes largely follow the principles which Lewis' set up for the fly.<P>

It is actually possible to transfer a HOX gene from man to the embryo of a fruit fly, where it is can perform some of the functions that the corresponding Drosophila gene normally executes. The location of our shoulders and hips on the vertebral column, f
or example, may be controlled by specific homeotic genes.

Edward B.Lewis at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena was interested in questions concerning certain developmental changes in the Drosophila fly and how the genes causing them cooperate during body segmentation. The answers he got, laid the
 foundation of one of the most surprising discoveries in developmental biology - the same type of genes which controls the early embryonic development of Drosophila also controls the early embryogenesis of a lot of higher organisms, including man. This me
ans that the genetic control mechanisms have been preserved roughly unchanged through 650 million years of evolution!<P>

A starting point for Lewis in his research on the genetic basis for so-called <EM>homeotic</EM> transformations during early embryonic development was his work with the now famous Drosophila-mutant with four wings instead of two. Homeotic genes control sp
ecialization of the segments. In the mutant-case inactivity of the first gene in a complex of homeotic genes (the <EM>bithorax complex</EM>) caused other homeotic genes to duplicate the segment with two wings. Lewis' pioneering work on the bithorax genes 
led to his discovery of the <EM>co-linearity principle</EM>. According to this principle there is a co-linearity in time and space between the order of the genes in the bithorax complex and their effect regions in the segments. This discovery has had a ve
ry large influence on later developmental research.

<TITLE>Congenital Malformations </TITLE>

<BODY>
<H2>Congenital Malformations</H2>
<HR><P>
Most of the genes studied by N&uuml;sslein-Volhard, Wieschaus and Lewis have important functions during the early development of the embryo. They control formation of the body axis which means the polarity of the embryo, the segmentation of the body, e.g.
 the vertebral column, and the specialization of individual segments into different organs like ribs, pelvis and extremities. It is likely that mutations in such important genes are responsible for some of the early, spontaneous abortions that occur in ma
n, and for some of the about 40 % of the congenital malformations that develop due to unknown reasons. We do not know how frequent spontaneous abortions are, since most of them occur before the woman realizes that she is pregnant. Calculations indicate, h
owever, that only 6 of 20 fertilized eggs result in fully developed children, less than one third of all pregnancies begun.<P>

Environmental factors such as very high doses of vitamin A during early pregnancy are also known to disturb the regulation of HOX genes, thus inducing severe congenital malformations as hydrocephalus, lesions in the vertebral column and heart diseases. Vi
tamin A given in high doses during pregnancy alters the expression of genes both in mice and men. Experiments with mouse embryos confirm this, as you can see on the poster. The mothers of two of the embryos were given vitamin A (retinoic acid) in high dos
es for 8 days. The embryo in the middle has lost several vertebrae and the embryo to the right has got no posterior region.<P>

In 1995 a Boston University School of Medicine study of 22 000 mothers stated that overdosage of vitamin A as low as three times the recommended dose during the first trimester of the pregnancy may cause fetal damage. The scientists found, however, that m
ost of the women in the study (98,6 %) had an intake of the vitamin without risk. Since the vitamin A-content of liver is high, pregnant women are recommended not to eat too much of that food. Certain drugs, e.g. for treatment of severe acne, contain vita
min A which calls for caution by fertile women. In Sweden the National Board of Health and Welfare prescribes special routines for such cases, including contraceptive pills.<P>

There are also other substances in our environment, both known and unknown, that disturb embryonic development, and that thus cause spontaneous abortions or congenital malformations.<P>

<H2>Aniridia</H2>
<HR><P>
If the homeotic gene PAX 6 is mutated the result is a child born with complete loss of the iris. This condition is known as aniridia and like Waardenburg's syndrome it is very rare. If there is no iris in the eye it is impossible to control the inlet of l
ight - the iris is an analogue to the aperture of the camera. The pupil stands wide open, no matter how light it is. The only treatment of aniridia is as yet the use of coloured eye lenses in order to reduce the light inlet.<P>
<IMG SRC="c-eyes.gif" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=79 ALIGN=LEFT VSPACE=15 HSPACE=10>
Experimental studies in mice have shown that disturbances in homeotic genes can cause a malformation of the colon called megacolon. This condition implies heavy enlargement of a certain part of the colon. In small children doctors sometimes diagnose cases
 of megacolon with unknown origin. It is to be hoped that researchers in the future may be able to find out if malformations of this kind are due to defective genes. This also applies to certain cases of cleft palate, lips and jaw.

<H3><A NAME="History">HISTORY</A></H3>



<P>AIME was founded in 1871 by 22 mining engineers in Wilkes-Barre,

PA, as the American Institute of Mining Engineers. Along with the 

American Society of Civil Engineers, the 

<A HREF="http://www.me.berkeley.edu/asme/" TARGET="_top">American Society of Mechanical

Engineers</A>, the <A HREF="http://www.ieee.org" TARGET="_top">Institute

of Electrical and Electronic Engineers

</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.che.ufl.edu/~aiche/" TARGET="_top">American Institute of Chemical

Engineers</A>, AIME is known as an engineering Founder Society. Together, the

Founder Societies formed the United Engineering Trustees, which operates the

United Engineering Center, and the <A HREF="http://www.engfnd.org/engfnd/" TARGET="_top">Engineering 

Foundation</A>. The Engineering

Societies Library - one of the largest engineering libraries in the world - was

recently transferred to the <A HREF="http://www.lhl.lib.mo.us" TARGET="_top">Linda Hall Library</A>.



<P>Through the years, AIME has adapted its structure and operation to meet the

new technologies and changing needs of its members. In 1919, the organization

changed its name to the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical

Engineers after absorbing the American Institute of Metals. Technical divisions

were established as the scope of the institute grew, and, in 1957, the name was

changed to its present title after AIME was reorganized.



<P><H3><A NAME="Organization">ORGANIZATION</A> AND ACTIVITIES</H3>



<P>AIME is a diverse organization, comprising five separately incorporated units

with a combined membership of more than 90,000 professionals. Under the current

organizational structure, one of the units - the AIME Institute

Headquarters - serves as the unifying forum for the four 

<B>Member Societies</B>:

(TMS)



<LI><A HREF="index.html">The Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration, Inc.

</A> (SME) began in 1957

as the Society for Mining Engineers. SME advances the worldwide mining and

minerals community through information exchange and professional development.

Through its technical publications and meetings, minerals professionals

collect, disseminate, and exchange information concerning the exploration for

and extraction and processing of metallic, nonmetallic and fuel ores, as well

as other materials produced through mining techniques for the public benefit.

The society currently has more than 17,000 members.

<H2>SME Professional Registration</H2>

<P>The SME Professional Registration Committee prepares problems for the Mining/Mineral Engineering examination for registration as a professional engineer. The committee sends these problems and their solutions to the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES) for formatting and printing. After a final review by the SME Professional Registration Committee, NCEES distributes the exam to the various states.</P>

<P>After administering the exams, the states return them to NCEES. NCEES then distributes the exams for grading to the technical group or society that prepared the exam. After grading, the exams are returned to NCEES, which then returns them to the appropriate state boards. The mining/mineral exam scores are computer-analyzed each year by a committee member.</P>

<P>Examinees may request (for a fee) a rescore from their state boards, which, in turn, send the requests to NCEES. NCEES then sends the individual questions to SME's Professional Registration Committee for the actual rescoring. Part of the fee charged for this procedure is given to SME. </P>

<P>SME's Professional Registration Committee held its annual workshop on March 10, 1996 in Phoenix, AZ prior to the SME annual meeting. Committee members chose problems for the 9710 exam from the problem bank or agreed to write new ones. All the new problems for the 9710 exam are due at NCEES by July 16, 1996.</P>

<P>The 10 essay questions from the 9610 exam will be scored by the committee on Jan. 4, 1997 at SME Headquarters. The 10 multiple-choice questions will be scored by computer at NCEES.</P>

<P>The Study Guide for Professional Registration of Mining/Mineral Engineers has been completely revised. The volume contains information on state boards, NCEES, exam procedures, the mining/mineral syllabus and a complete sample exam. It currently sells for $25 per copy.  </P>

<DT><H3>MII materials aid local GEM section</H3>
<DD>Linda Baltich, Colorado Section GEM chair, reports that the Mineral Information Institute (MII), located in Denver, CO, has been a great partner in many local GEM activities. Linda says, "MII often provides us with materials when we visit schools and do community outreach projects. MII posters and handouts are excellent resources."
<P>In return, SME provide the names and addresses of interested educators to MII. MII is available to help other GEM Committees. Contact Nelson Fugate or Jackie Evanger at 303-297-3226.
</DL>
<H4>Thanks for GEM financial support</H4>
<P>Our expression of appreciation goes out to those members who contributed to GEM along with their 1995 dues. Your generous support has helped us continue our efforts to educate the public about our constant and growing dependency on products made from minerals and to be a major part of creating a positive image of the mining and minerals industry.

<P>Meetings registration and hotel-reservation forms are available on-line for your use in two different formats:

<UL>
<LI>The first is a pkZip-compressed PostScript file that can be uncompressed and downloaded into any PostScript printer; both <A HREF="postscript/REG.ZIP">Annual Meeting Registration</A> and <A HREF="postscript/HOTEL.ZIP">hotel-reservation</A> forms are available in this format.
<LI>The other online option is an Adobe Acrobat (".pdf") file, again for both <A HREF="pdfs/reg.pdf">Meetings Registration</A> and <A HREF="pdfs/hotel.pdf">Hotel-reservation</A> forms.
<DL>
<DD>To use the Acrobat forms, you must first download the <B>FREE</B> Adobe Acrobat Reader software, either from <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/Acrobat/AcrobatWWW.html"><B>Adobe Systems' Web site</B></A> or one of the many mirror-sites they have listed there. This download is a "one-shot" operation: You need only download it once and install it, and from that point on you will be able to access Adobe Acrobat files on the World Wide Web.
</DL>
<LI>Alternately, you can <A HREF="feedback.stml">contact SME's Meetings Dept.</A> and have them mail the desired forms to you.

<H1>Application of Computers and Operations Research in the Mineral Industry

<!-- Body of page goes here! -->



<P>We are in the Information Age!  Computer methods have become an

integral part of mineral exploration, mining, mineral processing

and management.  These methods were essentially unknown to

minerals professionals before 1960.  They have developed as

computer hardware and software have evolved over the last several

decades.  The constantly increasing portfolio of computer

applications includes analyzing and mapping exploration data,

estimating ore reserves, designing mines, planning production,

controlling processes, maintaining equipment, and managing human

resources, supplies inventories and all types of financial

information.</P>



<P>APCOM has been the major forum for discussion of the application of

computer methods in the mineral industry for nearly four decades. 

As information system technology has advanced from mainframes to

minicomputers to PCs to the World Wide Web, the APCOM Symposia

continue to be a highly effective mechanism for communicating

the advancements in minerals computer application

development worldwide.</P>



<P>It all started in 1961 as a series of workshops at University of

Arizona.  During the 1960s, new sponsors joined in at Stanford,

Colorado School of Mines and Penn State.  SME became a sponsor,

celebrating <I>A Decade of Digital Computing</I> at its 1969 fall

meeting.</P>



<P>APCOM went international in the 1970s with symposia sponsored by

the Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, the South

African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, the University of

Clausthal, the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy

and the Technical University of Berlin, as well as by the US

sponsors.  To date, 26 APCOM international symposia have been

held.</P>



<P>In an effort to meet the needs of emerging groups of computer

users, regional APCOM symposia were started in 1995 with the

first one being held in Ljubljana, Slovenia.



<H2>Proceedings Volumes</H2>



<P>The evolution of minerals computer applications is documented in

the <I>APCOM Proceedings</I> produced for the symposia.  These volumes

are useful references for application developers and users. 

Several recent <I>APCOM Proceedings</I> are currently available.  Earlier

volumes may be found in mineral reference libraries around the

world.

<LI>3rd Regional APCOM Symposium, Perth, Australia, December 7-9, 1998.  Sponsored by The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy and the Western Australian School of Mines.</UL>



<H2>APCOM International Council</H2>



<P>The APCOM symposia are organized by the APCOM International Council.  The council is composed of <A HREF="council.html"> representatives of the sponsoring organizations</A>.  It operates on a largely informal basis.  Its success is due to the personal commitment of a number of dedicated individuals, both council members and those working behind the scenes of the symposia.



<H2>Other Computer Resources for SME Members</H2>



<P><STRONG>COGSnet</STRONG>  is the computer bulletin board system sponsored by the Denver, Colorado-based Computer Oriented Geological Society (COGS) and SME.  It contains an extensive library of geology, mining and related software which can be downloaded.  COGSnet can be reached via the World Wide Web at <A HREF="ftp://ftp.csn.net/cogs" TARGET="_top">ftp://ftp.csn.net/COGS/</A>.  You can also connect directly by dialing 303-526-1617.  Set your modem for 1200 bps or greater, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, and no parity.

<P><STRONG>MINSIM'96 - First International Symposium on Mine Simulation via the Internet.</STRONG>  The University of Idaho (USA) and the National Technical University of Athens (Greece) have hosted, completely via the Internet, a symposium on mining system simulation and related topics.  The symposium was held for two weeks beginning December 2, 1996.  The home page for the symposium has been terminated but information on the printed procedings volume is available from <A HREF="http://www.metal.ntua.gr/msslab/" TARGET="_top">http://www.metal.ntua.gr/msslab/</A> .  Additional information on the symposium, including an evaluation report, can be obtained by contacting the conference organizer, John Sturgul,  <A HREF="mailto:sturgul@uidaho.edu">sturgul@uidaho.edu</A>.

<P><STRONG>LINKS TO MINING COMPUTER APPLICATIONS INFORMATION ON THE WEB.</STRONG>  There are many useful Web sites dealing with mineral industry computer applications and the related software.  They are being started and updated almost daily by software and computer services companies, educators, consultants, users, students, and other interested parties.  Because the number of these sites is growing so rapidly, no attempt will be made to list them all here.  However, links to a few representative sites are included below to illustrate the variety of information available on the Web.  These sites contain many links to other mining applications sites.

<CENTER><H1><I>Minerals - Serving the Global Community</I></H1></CENTER>

<P>Minerals are defined as naturally occurring substances obtained for man's use. The SME Annual Meeting Program Committee has dedicated the 1997 technical program to the global practice, science, and technology, applied in the pursuit of finding, obtaining, and processing minerals for the community of man.</P>

<P>The SME Annual Meeting & Exhibit is comprised of 4-5,000 corporate officers, operations and management professionals, operating and staff engineers and consultants engaged in mineral exploration, underground and surface mining, solution mining, rock mechanics, operations research, mineral processing and environment control. These professionals share their experience, skill, and know-how for the benefit of the industry. The following is a glimpse of 1997 highlights:</P>

<H2>Comminution Practices for the Next Century</H2>

<P>It is  a known fact the comminution process is energy intensive. It uses approximately 29 billion kwhr of electrical energy per annum for size reduction and an additional 3.7 billion kwhr per annum is contained energy in consumables such as grinding media and liners. Ever since the oil crisis of the 1970s the profitability of industries has been linked closely to efficient use of energy and the minerals industry is no exception. These facts have provided incentives for universities, government laboratories, and industries to conduct research in this important area of comminution. As a result, novel comminution devices and new process control strategies for control of mineral processing operations are being developed.</P>

<P>Other disciplines examined during the 1997 meeting include:
<UL>
<LI>Coal
<LI>Industrial Minerals
<LI>Mining & Exploration
<LI>Mineral & Metallurgical Processing
<LI>Minerals Resource Management
<LI>Society of Economic Geologists

<P><FONT SIZE=7 COLOR="#008737">T</FONT><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial">he Business perspective of the Minerals Industry is broadening to meet the increasing demands of both the industrialized nations as well as the emerging economies of the Third World. The speakers for the 1997 SME/AIME Keynote Session will address how business strategies of mineral producers are evolving to achieve corporate growth objectives while bringing responsible business and operating practices to a world where markets are expanding, trade barriers are dropping, and laws are changing to encourage foreign investment.

<UL>

<B><FONT COLOR="#008737"><LI>Robert Smith, President of Barrick Gold Corporation</FONT></B> will describe how Barrick's corporate strategy has evolved with the company's success, particularly with respect to its expansion outside of North America. Mr. Smith will address how Barrick has managed business, social, political and environmental risks associated with its international operating successes, while learning to work within new social and business cultures.

<B><FONT COLOR="#008737"><LI>David Whitehead, Executive Director for Business Development at Gencor-Billiton</FONT></B> will look at the way in which South Africa's Gencor became an international mining house with multi-commodity impact by acquiring Billiton Minerals from Royal Dutch-Shell in 1995. Mr. Whitehead will present a non-North American perspective on the international nature of the minerals business, some insights into expectation for the future, and thoughts on the risks and rewards associated with international mineral ventures.

<B><FONT COLOR="#008737"><LI>Simon Strauss, Keynote Session Moderator</FONT></B> will open with a discussion of the awakening of the North American minerals business to foreign opportunities.

<P>
Last year's Education Forum focused on strengthening the exchange between industry and academia concerning the educational needs of entry-level professionals graduating into minerals engineering careers. The new format was informative and successful in attaining industrial perspectives from a cross-section of senior executives. At our next Forum, recent graduates will share their early experiences in industry and relate them to the level of their academic preparation. Substantial time will be planned for discussion between former students and educators. Please join representatives from industry and academia at the reception following the Forum to pursue topics of interest.

<DD>Each year since 1967, SME has recognized the most outstanding student chapter. This award is one of high distinction because it is evidence that a chapter has conducted its business in a professional manner. Since 1979, the award has been based on a review of annual reports of the Student Chapters. 

<P>The winning SME Student Chapter receives an award of $500, a certificate of recognition, and one ticket to the awards banquet at the SME annual meeting. The chapter receives a travel allowance up to $250 to send a representative to the annual meeting. The award is presented at the awards banquet by the SME president. Three runners-up receive certificates of recognition. All winners will be recognized in <I><A HREF=me.stml">Mining Engineering</A></I> magazine.</P>

<DT><H3>The Annual Report</H3>

<DD>To enter the Student Chapter contest or receive rebate assistance, each Student Chapter is required to prepare an annual report. Annual reports must be <I>received</I> by Dec. 1 to be included in the Student Chapter contest, or mailed by Dec. 31 to qualify for the rebate. 

<P>The Annual Report not only provides an historical record of Student Chapter activities, but also encourages professional accountability. There is no established format for the annual report; however, the following material may be included:</P>

<UL>

<LI>Membership (identification of Student Chapter officers, members, Faculty Sponsor and Section Counselor)

<LI>Student Chapter activities (sequential listing of activities including a description of the program in paragraph or outline form, and attendance information)

<LI>Student Member activities (sequential listing of activities including descriptions, names of participants, and, if appropriate, results of participation)

<LI>Treasurer's report

<LI>Secretary's report

<LI>Miscellaneous (photographs, etc. as documentation of special events)

</UL>

<P>To be eligible for the contest, the Annual Report must be <STRONG><I>no more than 50 pages</STRONG></I>, and must be <STRONG><I>received</I> by December 1</STRONG>.  The report should be loose-leaf bound. The Student Chapter should retain one copy of the report for its records; <STRONG>seven</STRONG> copies should be mailed to:</P>

<DL>

<DD>The following ideas were collected from annual reports from SME <B><A HREF="student_chaps.stml">Student Chapters</A></B>, but you don't have to be in a Student Chapter to get involved. If your school doesn't have a Student Chapter, try getting students in your department involved in the local minerals community. If there is enough interest, you can schedule speakers or arrange field trips or student contests to get others involved. 

<DT><H3>Monthly Meetings</H3>

<DD>The monthly or bimonthly meetings are the basis of the chapter activities. Besides the usual source of speakers and industry, other resources include:

<UL>

<LI>Alumni and recent graduates 

<LI>Professors

<LI>Suppliers, i.e., blasting agents, safety equipment, reagents, etc.

<LI>Government agency publications

<LI>Special interest groups: National Mining Association, Sierra Club, etc.

<LI>Slide shows by students regarding their summer jobs

<LI>Process instrumentation firms

<LI>Consultants

<LI>Retired mining professionals

</UL>

<P>Other interesting ideas for monthly activities are:

<UL>

<LI>MSHA safety training and certification, i.e., new miner training

<LI>ISO 9000

<LI><B><A HREF="scindex.stml">Short courses</A></B>

<LI>Joint meeting with other societies or nearby schools

<LI><B><A HREF="career_wkshp.stml">Career workshop</A></B> including talks on career opportunities, rsum preparation, job interviews, etc.

<LI>Participation in SME-sponsored <B><A HREF="mtgcalendar.stml">meetings</A></B>, seminars, short courses

</UL>

<DT><H3>Social Events</H3>

<DD>Social events attract existing and potential members. The following are ideas from the chapters:

<UL>

<LI>Holiday parties

<LI>Icebreakers

<LI>Parties honoring historical mining figures or modern mining professionals: for example, St. Barbara's Day (the patron saint of miners) is Dec. 4; Georgius Agricola's birthday (the author of <I>De Re Metallica</I>) is March 24, 1494.

<LI>Annual awards banquet

<LI>Graduate student party

<LI>Alumni Day (old-timer's) party

<LI>Retirement dinner (usually for professors)

<LI>Pig roasts/picnics

<LI>Floats in local parades

<LI>Miners' band

<LI>Intramural sports

</UL>

<DT><H3>Fund Raisers</H3>

<DD>A perpetual problem for all chapters is fundraising. Here is how some chapters do it:

<UL>

<LI>Sale of Student Chapter patches, T-shirts, belt buckles, pick-and-shovel lapel pins, hard-hat decals, window stickers, coal-miner statues, etc. (Such activities expand awareness of the society and its activities on campus and in industry.)

<LI>Sale of school supplies, senior rings, mineral specimens and kits, mining supplies, i.e., hard hats, lamp belts, safety glasses, etc.

<LI>Raffles

<LI>Bake sales

<LI>Pop machine in student lounge

<LI>Collecting aluminum cans and newspapers

<LI>Tap the local mining industry for funds

</UL>

<DT><H3>Field Trips</H3>

<DD>Field trips are some of the most popular chapter functions. The following are some examples of chapter field trips:

<UL>

<LI>Active mining or sand and gravel operations

<LI>Manufacturers of mining equipment

<LI>Local mining or mineral museums

<LI>Assay labs

<LI>Reclamation projects

<LI>Exploration sites

<LI>Mineral- and fossil-collecting trips

<LI>Gold panning expeditions

<LI>Trips to abandoned mines and ghost towns

<LI>Offshore oil platforms

</UL>

<DT><H3>Membership Drives</H3>
v
<DD>The best method of attracting new members (and/or gaining greater student involvement) is a high visibility, varied, regular program of monthly meetings, field trips, social functions, etc.  Other specific ways of recruiting new members are:

<UL>

<LI>Welcoming picnic for new members

<LI>Visits by officers to introductory and undergraduate mining courses

<LI>Booth at freshman convocation and/or rush week

<LI>Freshman orientation

<LI>Form alumni membership group

</UL>

<DT><H3>Other</H3>

<DD>The best chapters are usually the most innovative.  Here are a few ideas from the chapters:

<UL>

<LI>Hold tryouts for an intercollegiate mining competition team in the commons or other public campus location, with lots of publicity.

<LI>Hold jackleg, hand and steel mucking contests during Homecoming or Freshman Week.

<LI>Participate in campuswide activities such as Engineering Day, Tech Fair, Student Day, Engineering Exposition, Homecoming, etc.  Arrange displays, laboratory tours, and traditional miners' skills contests.

<LI>Participate in high-school career days, high-school visitation day, or by provide tours of your school or school mine for high school classes.

<LI>Community service projects including blood drives.

<LI>Participate in campus government and councils.

<LI>Start a tutoring service.

<LI>Collect and refurbish old mine equipment.

<LI>Participate in Local Section Student Night.

<LI>Write columns and articles for your school newspaper.

</UL>

<DD>The SME Student Chapter brings together students during their college years to build a broad-based understanding of the minerals industry and a sense of unity and identity with their peers.  The Student Chapter is the link between school and business which enables each student to engage in the type of activity necessary for professional development.

<P>Student Chapters play an important role in the professional development of a young minerals engineer.  Ideally, Student Chapters provide a professional forum, sponsor activities and programming, and provide opportunities for members to gather and interact.

<DT><H3>Accreditation in the United States</H3>

<DD>Accreditation plays a role in every college graduate's professional life.  Job and advancement opportunities may be less plentiful for graduates of nonaccredited institutions or programs.  Accreditation offers industry a certain minimum guarantee of the skills they can expect in recent graduates.  Accreditation promotes industrywide excellence.


<DT><H3>International Accreditation</H3>

<DD>The <B><A HREF="http://www.abet.ba.md.us" TARGET="_top">Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), Inc.</A></B> has begun development of reciprocal accreditation recognitions with the signatory countries to the Washington Accord on mutual recognition of evaluation programs (Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and the United States).  Requests are continually received for ABET to conduct consultancy visits to universities in other countries.  

<P>NAFTA requires that professionals be allowed to practice in Canada and Mexico without undue restrictions.  ABET is working toward that goal with a Policies and Procedures Manual for ABET Substantial Equivalency Evaluations.</P>


<DT><H3>SME's Role in Accreditation</H3>

<P>As a participating body of ABET, SME is responsible for appointing representatives to the ABET Board and Commissions.  SME also appoints members to serve on accreditation teams to visit the programs for which SME has curricular responsibility or shares responsibility with another participating society.  Qualified program evaluators are always in demand, particularly those employed in industry, women and minorities.  Click for information on <B><A HREF="program_eval.stml">how to nominate a program evaluator</A></B> or <B><A HREF="support_accreditation.stml">how to support accreditation.</A></B></P>

<DT><H3>Criteria</H3>

<DD>The SME committees concerned with accreditation are responsible for ratifying the general criteria with which engineering programs across the United States are evaluated.  They create and approve criteria specific to the <A HREF="geprog.stml"><B>geological engineering,</B></A> <A HREF="mincrit.stml"><B>mining engineering,</B></A> and mining engineering technology programs.  They also ratify environmental and metallurgical engineering program criteria.

<P>For a copy of the criteria for accrediting programs in engineering or engineering technology in the United States, contact <B><A HREF="http://www.abet.ba.md.us" TARGET="_top">ABET</A></B> at 410-347-7700, fax 410-625-2238.</P>

<CENTER><H1>DRAFT<BR>
ABET Program Criteria for Mining and Similarly Named Engineering Programs</H1></CENTER>
<P>Draft approved 14 March 1996 by the Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration (SME),  Inc.</P>
<H2>Applicability:</H2>
<P>These program criteria apply to engineering programs including "mining" and similar modifiers in their titles.</P>
<H2>Defining Statement:</H2>
<P>Mining Engineering applies extractive technologies to the earth's resources with an integrated planning and design approach.  Graduates of a basic-level program must be prepared to function as professionals in mining or related industries and can anticipate highly varied positions during their career.  Consequently, programmatic objectives will include specific knowledge and skills appropriate to anticipated tasks as well as sufficient breadth and depth of education to allow the graduate engineer to function in all aspects of mining and to acquire new skills as needed.</P>
<H2>Program Outcomes and Assessment (amplifies Criterion 3):</H2>
<P>Students must take the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam.</P>
<H2>Professional Component (amplifies Criterion 4):</H2>
<P>The basic-level curriculum must include appropriate instruction, such that students can demonstrate an understanding and fundamental knowledge of the following:
<OL>
<LI>mathematics through differential equations, calculus-based physics, general chemistry, and probability and statistics through applications;
<LI>in engineering sciences: statics, dynamics, strength of materials, fluid mechanics, thermo-dynamics, and electrical circuits;
<LI>in geology: characterization of mineral deposits and surrounding strata through concepts of physical geology, structural or engineering geology, and mineral and rock identification and properties. </OL></P>
<P>The basic-level curriculum must also include advanced study in engineering topics related to both surface and underground mining, including: mining methods, planning and design, ground control and rock mechanics, health and safety and environmental issues, and ventilation.  Additional engineering topics should include rock fragmentation, materials handling, mineral or coal processing, mine surveying, and valuation and resource/reserve estimation as appropriate to the program objectives.</P>

<P>The laboratory experience must include content on geologic concepts, rock mechanics, and other topics appropriate to the program objectives, such as mine ventilation or materials handling.</P>
<H2>Faculty (amplifies Criterion 5):</H2>
<P>Teaching of the professional components of a program must not be heavily dependent on just one faculty member.  Registration as a professional engineer is encouraged; at least one faculty member must be registered as a Professional Engineer.</P>

<CENTER><H1>DRAFT<BR>
ABET Program Criteria for Geological and Similarly Named Engineering Programs</H1></CENTER>
<P>Draft available for comment for one year, as approved by the Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration, Inc.(SME) Accreditation and Curricular Issues Committee, Council of Education, and the AIME-SME Board of Directors on 14 March 1996.</P>
<H2>Applicability:</H2>
<P>These program criteria apply to engineering programs including "geological" and similar modifiers in their titles.</P>
<H2>Defining Statement:</H2>
<P>The program in geological engineering must provide the integration of science, mathematics, engineering, and communication in comprehensive design courses, problems, and reports concerning geological engineering.  Design activities in geological engineering normally require an understanding and application of the principles of geology, specifically the physical properties of the materials of the earth's crust, the effects of the processes that form the earth's crust, and the impacts of the works of society on these materials and processes in the solution to engineering problems.  Data gathering and analysis do not, by themselves, constitute design, but are important as a source of input to the design activities and are central to the process.  The recognition of constraints and alternative solutions along with optimal use of resources in reaching the best available resolution for the client and the public, while including ethics, environmental, economic, and societal considerations, constitute geological engineering design.</P>
<P>Geological engineering encompasses some or all but is not limited to:
<OL>
<LI>exploration for, development and exploitation of natural resources;
<LI>geomechanics;
<LI>site characterization, regulation cognizance, and planning;
<LI>natural and manmade hazard investigation;
<LI>studies of site and resource utilization; and 
<LI>hydrogeology and ground water studies and engineering.
</OL></P>
<H2>Professional Component (amplifies Criterion 4):</H2>
<P>Students should demonstrate proficiency in the following areas of study:
<OL>
<LI>Mathematics through differential equations, calculus-based physics, general chemistry, and probability and statistics through applications;
<LI>Geological subjects including physical geology, mineral and rock identification and properties, structural geology, principles of sedimentation or stratigraphy, field geology, and elements of geophysics;
<LI>Engineering sciences to include statics, properties/strength of materials, geomechanics, along with appropriate prerequisites.
</OL></P>
<H2>The faculty (amplifies Criterion 5):</H2>
<P>The program requirements must be controlled by a defined group of faculty members the majority of whom have at least one degree in engineering and who teach the majority of the program's required courses containing design experiences including the major design experience course.  Registration as a professional engineer is encouraged.</P>

<DT><H3>How You Can Support the Accreditation Process</H3>

<DD>Get involved!  Industry professionals are best qualified to determine the current and future specialized needs in their field.  Attend the meetings of the Accreditation and Curricular Issues subcommittee and the Council of Education and Accreditation (see below for more information).

<P>SME is continually seeking qualified program evaluators. Women, minority and industrial program evaluators are in particular demand. Click for information on <B><A HREF="program_eval.stml">how to nominate a program evaluator.</A><B/></P>

<P>Encourage your company to support its employees who become involved. The community is best served when a balance of professionals are involved in the accreditation process, visiting accredited programs and deciding on accreditation requirements.</P>

<P>Support colleges and universities with mining-related accredited programs. Educational programs prepare students for professional practice.</P>

<P>Encourage your employees and colleagues to become SME members. Professional societies support the objectives of the profession and its companies.</P>


<DT><H3>Current ABET Issues</H3>

<DD><B><A HREF="http://www.abet.ba.md.us">ABET</A></B> has been challenged to encourage innovation and creativity in individual engineering programs. To meet this challenge, many changes have been made in the last few years. These include a less-rigid requirement for the balance between engineering design and engineering topics, a move to an outcomes assessment approach, and a proposed simplification of the criteria. These revised criteria will need careful study by all parties involved in the accreditation process, and will also require an overhaul of <B><A HREF="geprog.stml"> geological engineering</A><B/> and <A HREF="mincrit.stml">mining engineering</A><B/> program criteria. Get involved in this process by contacting SME with your input, or by getting involved with SME's Accreditation and Curricular Issues subcommittee or Council of Education and Accreditation.


<DT><H3>SME's Accreditation and Curricular Issues Committee</H3>

<DD>The Accreditation and Curricular Issues subcommittee is responsible for creating program criteria for <B><A HREF="geprog.stml"> geological engineering</A><B/>, <A HREF="mincrit.stml">mining engineering</A><B/>, and mining engineering technology programs, and for ratifying ABET's general criteria, which must be met by all accredited engineering programs in the United States. By participating in this committee's open deliberations, you can have a direct effect on the accreditation requirements for schools across the United States. The committee meets at SME's annual meeting, held each year in February or March.


<DT><H3>Council of Education and Accreditation</H3>

<DD>The Council ratifies the actions of the Accreditation and Curricular Issues subcommittee. It directs the education activities of SME as they relate to students and accreditation. Get involved in this important process!

<DT><H3>Program Evaluator Qualifications</H3>

<DD>A program evaluator must have had substantial experience in engineering or engineering technology and must have demonstrated an interest in engineering or engineering technology education. Academic members shall also have had experience in ABET-accredited engineering or engineering technology programs. An advanced degree in the field is not a requirement.

<DT><H3>How to Nominate a Program Evaluator</H3>

<DD>To nominate a program evaluator, send your name, address, and business phone, and the nominee's name, mailing address, business phone, fax, and e-mail address (if available), to SME Education Dept., PO Box 625002, Littleton, CO  80162-5002, or call 303-973-9550 or 800-763-3132, fax 303-973-3845, or e-mail <B><A HREF=mailto:smenet@aol.com>smenet@aol.com</A></B>.  

<P>Specify which curricular area(s) your nomination covers: environmental engineering, environmental engineering technology, geological engineering, geophysical engineering, metallurgical engineering, metallurgical engineering technology, mineral engineering, mineral processing engineering, mining engineering, or mining engineering technology.  Please nominate each individual for all the curricular areas for which he or she is qualified.</P>

<DT><H3>Requirements of Program Evaluators</H3>

<DD>Program evaluators are required to make a substantial commitment of time and energy to the accreditation process.  A general evaluation visit of an institution takes about seven days of concentrated effort, including preparation, the actual visit, and follow-up. Interim or focused visits may require less time.  

<P>Because of the nature of the team selection process, SME must always have many more evaluators available than will actually participate on visiting teams in any particular year.  However, each program evaluator should be available to participate on at least one accreditation visit per year.</P>

<P>Program evaluators must complete initial training and thereafter attend training at least every two years.  SME provides free training each year in conjunction with the annual meeting in February or March. Participation as an observer on a visiting team is also required. Although <B><A HREF="http://www.abet.ba.md.us">ABET<A/><B/> reimburses the travel expenses for evaluators who are part of a visiting team, observers must pay there own way. Limited funds from SME are available to assist with these expenses when necessary.</P>

Application of GIS and Remote Sensing Technologies to the Mining Industry
</H1>
<H2>
February 22-23, 1997
</H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Overview</B></FONT><BR>
This course will introduce basic concepts of Geologic Information Systems and Remote Sensing (GIS/RS) and their use in mining. The Internet and accessing and downloading datasets are also discussed. Additionally, the use of GIS/RS to the best advantage in real projects is demonstrated. Attendees are encouraged to bring questions relating to their projects. The first day will cover GIS/RS basics; the initial creation of a GIS database, types of GIS analysis, verification of data accuracy, and the output of final maps. Remote Sensing includes discussion of imaging systems and different image types, images processing  techniques, integration of information into the GIS database, and output products. The second day covers Internet access, case studies of projects, and costs and benefits of using GIS/RS. Real projects will be analyzed to show specific applications of GIS/RS. The course will conclude with a discussion of how to get started using GIS/RS in your organization.

Belt Conveyor Drives: Advanced Mechanical and Electrical Considerations
</H1>
<H2>
February 22-23, 1997
</H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Overview</B></FONT><BR>
This course is an advanced course in the design and engineering of belt conveyor drives. The heart of a belt conveyor is the drive(s). It is the most important and complex component and offers the greatest number of available options. It is responsible for accelerating the belt, maintaining running speed, and in some cases, decelerating the belt. The application and control of torque from the drive system to the belt affects the performance, life, cost and reliability of the drive components as well as most other conveyor components. However, the selection of drive type and control algorithms are seldom easy. As conveyors become longer, faster and bigger, these decisions become more difficult. The best decisions require knowledge of the various drive characteristics and limitations, as well as knowledge of the overall conveyor system. This course will address conveyor drive requirements based on system parameters such as length, lift, tonnage, and profile. Extensive comparisons will be made between many drive options including complexity, versatility, maintenance, cost and reliability. Both mechanical and electrical engineers will benefit from this comprehensive study. A manufacturers poster session from 4-6PM on February 23 will highlight the newest products and services available in the industry.

Converting Practises
</H1>
<H2>
February 22-23, 1997
</H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Overview</B></FONT><BR>
One of the oldest techniques of the non-ferrous pyrometallurgical industry is the Peirce-Smith side-blown converting operation. Although the technology is approaching 100 years old, the converting stage of the smelting operation is still regarded with suspicion, fear and a lack of confidence. Too often the batch nature of the process, when added to the above-mentioned factors, limits the overall smelter output significantly. This course is for operators wishing to raise the unit productivity of the converter operations from both the people and mechanical aspects.

Brazil is experiencing a dramatic increase in gold exploration activity. The negative aspects of the 1988 constitutional changes were rescinded in August, 1995, reestablishing the ability to have majority ownership by foreign mining investors. This change, combined with new tax laws, has reenergized foreign investment in the mineral industry, again making Brazil one of the most favorable countries in Latin America. Brazilian government geologists and industry explorationists will present: (1) the latest news regarding exploration activity; (2) a synthesis of the geology and metallogeny of Brazil; (3) new studies of gold deposits, style of mineralization, age; (4) exploration and mining costs in various settings (Amazon, etc); (5) environmental regulations and procedures; (6) accessing DNPM's land status and CPRM's geological database Internet programs; (7) suggestions on how to work with garimpeiros and garimpeiro organizations. Participants will receive 1:7,000,000 scale geologic and gold maps, numerous government publications and demonstration diskettes of DNPM and CPRM software for accessing land status and geological databases. This course is for both exploration managers and field geologists.

Stormwater Management and Erosion Control
</H1>
<H2>
February 22-23, 1997
</H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Overview</B></FONT><BR>
Stormwater management and erosion control has become a significant concern for both active mining operations and closure activities. Recent legislation has changed the way that excavation work is performed on construction projects and is now being applied in varying degrees to mining projects. Regardless of the legal requirements, a good stormwater and erosion control plan can minimize site maintenance work, improve public relations, aid permitting and accelerate bond release. This course presents current environmental policy as it relates to erosion/sediment control and mining activities. Development of successful stormwater pollution prevention plans (SWPPs) are detailed. Generally accepted engineering hydrology principles are presented for analysis of the design "event", drainage basin affects and runoff potential. Erosion mechanisms and analysis of both overland and channelized flow conditions are presented. Finally, best management practices (BMPs) suitable for active sites and closures are discussed.

<P>
The Cresson Project consists of an open pit gold mine, crusher, valley leach and carbon adsorptionelectrowinning facility. The Project is a revival of large-scale mining in the Cripple Creek Mining District and located 20 air miles southwest of Colorado Springs on the southwest flank of Pikes Peak, between the towns of Cripple Creek and Victor. The Project is operated by the Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mining Company (a joint venture between Pikes Peak Mining Company and Golden Cycle Gold Corporation). The operation produces 160,000 ounces (troy) of gold per year along with silver, from a volcanic breccia and phonolite ore associated with 32 million year old volcanic diatreme. The average grade of the ore is 0.026 ounces per ton. The operation is the first to have been designed, constructed, and operated under new State mining and reclamation requirements. The 180-acre leach facility, with a capacity of 53 million tons, receives about 8.5 million tons of crushed ore per year, consists of double-and triple-lined sections, integrated with extensive surface and ground water monitoring. The tour includes an overview of past and present mining in the District, discussions of the geology, mining and recovery process, environmental permitting and reclamation activities.
<UL>
<LI>Attendees should wear warm, layered clothing, windbreakers and sturdy boots (steel toes preferred). Protective glasses and hardhats will be available on-site.
<LI>The trip includes transportation and a buffet lunch at the historic Imperial Casino Hotel in Cripple Creek. Additional time will be available at the Imperial Casino Hotel.

<P>The Powder River Basin of Northeastern Wyoming is the largest strippable reserve of compliant coal (0.6 or less pounds of sulfur per million btu) in the United States. The Powder River Basin boasts annual production of 20% of the nation's coal and the six largest and most productive mines in the United States. This trip will visit two of these mines; the North Antelope Mine, Powder River Coal Company, 1996 projected 27.7 M tons and the Black Thunder Mine, Thunder Basin Coal Company, 1996 projected 39 M ton. The equipment used in these mines rivals the size of the Basin itself. Attendees will observe some of the largest moving equipment in operation; from 190 and 240 ton trucks, 15 to 84-cubic yard shovels and draglines of 45 to 160-cubic yard, to other specialized earth moving equipment in action. Attendees will also be able to see near-pit crushing and conveying systems and innovative dust control stilling sheds at both mines. As an added benefit, a film detailing the Powder River Basin's growth from the 1970s to its' current status as one of the most important coal-producing regions in the US is shown during the six-hour trip to the mine site. Attendees should wear warm casual clothing suitable for outdoor activity.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Comminution Control System Design: A Look Ahead to the Next Century:</B><BR>
<I>J. A. Herbst and W. T. Pate, J. A. Herbst & Assoc., LLC</I></FONT><BR>
Advanced communication technology plus faster and cheaper computers promise significant changes in the next generation of comminution control systems. A third factor contributing to change will be the effective integration of on-line neural networks and phenomenological models to create very powerful model-based control systems. Advanced communication technology will streamline control system development by making specialized design and trouble shooting tools as well as expert human resources from locations around the world readily available to control engineers through "web type" communications. Wireless communication technology will make systems "infinitely distributed" putting more power into the hands of operators on the floor. The combination of faster and cheaper computers with powerful software integrating phenomenological models with neural nets promises to provide a new generation of "soft sensors" to yield accurate minute to minute estimates of such key variables as ore hardness, mineral liberation, entire size distributions, and the state of consumables such as liners and media. Estimates of these key variables input into model-based control strategies will improve comminution circuit performance significantly as well as help facilitate the implementation of successful plantwide control systems. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Expert Systems in Comminution-Case Studies:</B><BR>
<I>L. B. Hales and R. A. Ynchausti, EIMCO Process Equipment, Salt Lake City, UT</I></FONT><BR>
Expert supervisory control strategies have been used for many years to improve operating revenues in communication circuits. Typical improvements in capacity range from four to eight percent. Several case studies of results will be presented as well as a general discussion of the technologies used to achieve the improvements. Crushing, SAG milling and ball milling circuits will be discussed.

<I>A. J. Neale, Freeport Cooper & Gold Inc., New Orleans, LA and C. Veloo, P.T. Freeport Indonesia, Inc., New Orleans, LA</I></FONT><BR>
P.T. Freeport Indonesia currently operates a 600,000 t/d mining and 125,000 t/d milling operating in the remote highlands of Irian Jaya, Indonesia. The isolated location and generally difficult working conditions make for challenges not encountered in most North American operations. In spite of this, the mill technical groups have been able to develop and maintain a highly effective level of plant-wide automation. This has been achieved through the appropriate selection of available technologies and the implementation of innovative management practices. This paper provides an overview of the control systems currently installed and focus on those practices which have resulted in the long-term success of process control at Freeport. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Plant Trial of a New On-line Pressure Vessel Rheometer for Slurries:</B><BR>
<I>A. K. Bakshi and S. K. Kawatra, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI</I></FONT><BR>
A plant trial of a new on-line pressure vessel rheometer for slurries, developed at Michigan Technological University, was carried out at a nearby copper concentrator. The rheometer measured the flow curves (shear stress vs. shear rate) of chalcocite slurries. Viscosity of non-Newtonian slurries changes with shear rate and so, for such slurries viscosity measurement at a single shear rate (often seen in the literature for grinding and classification studies) cannot be correlated to process performance. For these slurries, viscosity at various shear rates can be measured from flow curves generated by the pressure vessel rheometer. Other rheological properties, such as flow type and yield stress can be determined by this rheometer to better characterize the slurries. The slurry at the copper concentrator consisted of ground chalcocite ore. The solids content in the slurry varied between 30-60% by weight. Top size of the particles was 125 micron, and 80% passing size was 34 micron. Measurements by the pressure vessel rheometer showed that most of the slurries had pseudoplastic flow at shear rates below approx. 3000 sec21, where the viscosity of the slurry decreased with increase in shear rate. Above approx. 3000 sec21, like a Newtonian fluid, the viscosity of the slurry remained steady. Flow curves and viscosity from the pressure vessel rheometer were verified with a Brookfield viscometer and a vibrating sphere viscometer, and the results were found to be accurate. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Particle Size Segregation on a Belt Conveyor:</B><BR>
<I>Y. K. Yen, C. L. Lin and J. D. Miller, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT</I></FONT><BR>
Particle size segregation is a common phenomenon in many particulate processes and has many undesirable effects. The size segregation which occurs on a belt conveyor causes a serious problem for on-line particle size measurement using image-based techniques. Whether particle size distributions measured from the top layer of the belt are representative of the total particle population is largely dependent on the degree of size segregation. Therefore, it is important to understand the nature of such size segregation in order to make appropriate corrections for on-line particle size analysis. Monte Carlo simulation has been used to provide segregation information on particles with simple geometry and the results have been complemented with results based on experiments with irregularly shaped particles. It is expected that the relationship between the particle size distribution of the top layer and that of the entire particle population on a belt conveyor can be formulated as a model- based function.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Direct Three-dimensional Liberation Analysis by Cone Beam X-Ray Microtomography:</B><BR>
<I>C. L. Lin and J. D. Miller, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT</I></FONT><BR>
Liberation of valuable minerals during size reduction is an important aspect of mineral processing technology. In practice, most quantitative information on liberation is based on the application of stereological theorems in the analysis of image data from two-dimensional polished sections. On this basis an estimate of the volumetric grade distribution is made. Recently, a new method based on cone-beam X-ray microtomography has been used for direct determination of the three-dimensional liberation spectrum of multi-phase particles 100 microns in size or less. Preliminary results for a packed bed of particles indicate that high spatial resolution (approximately 15 microns) and the direct processing of raw volumetric data are two important benefits offered by this new method. Three-dimensional liberation analysis by microtomography provides an excellent opportunity to overcome many of the limitations of currently used polished section techniques. For example, detailed textural information is provided. Of course microtomography provides an independent method to verify current procedures used for analysis and transformation of polished section data into an estimate of the volumetric grade distribution. More important, however, is the possibility that this method could be developed as a routine procedure for liberation analysis in the 21st century.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B><I>Plenary Address:</I> Review of the Technical Literature on High-pressure Grinding Rolls:</B><BR>
<I>R. E. McIvor, Cleveland Cliffs, Inc., Cleveland, OH</I></FONT><BR>
Since their invention about 10 years ago, high-pressure grinding rolls have been widely adopted by the cement industry, and are now making inroads into mineral processing. Energy savings in the range of 25 to 50% compared to ball milling appear achievable. This paper reviews the technical literature on this important emerging technology.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Influence of the Feed Size Distribution on Throughput and Comminution of a High-Pressure Roller Mill:</B><BR>
<I>U. Sander and K. Shnert, Technical University of Clausthal, Clausthal-Zellerfield, Germany</I></FONT><BR>
The throughput of a high-pressure roller mill depends on the speed, the size distribution of the feed and the roller surface structure. The throughput increases proportional to the speed in the low speed range, then bends off the straight line and decreases above a certain limit. By reaching a critical maximum speed the mill beings to vibrate because of the acceleration effect and of the back-flow effect, especially by fine and very fine grinding. The fraction of the fine material in the feed controls strongly the mill performance. The paper deals with these aspects and discusses as well experimental results as theoretical considerations. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Towards the Development of a Work Index for the Roller Press:</B><BR>
<I>R. B. Klymowsky and J. Y. Liu, KHD Humboldt Wedag, AG, Cologne, Germany</I></FONT><BR>
This paper details the development of a functional work index that characterizes the relationship between the energy that is imparted by a roller press into materials, against the resultant size reduction achieved. Such a roller press work index is necessary for this new grinding technology to differentiate it from Bond's grinding work index, and to clear up confusion that arises with such a comparison to Bond. The energy usage in a roller press does not follow Bond's "Third Theory of Comminution" but rather Rittinger's theory of new surface creation. The relationships for such a work index have been developed from the viewpoint of an equipment manufacturer with the hope that they will be of assistance to the minerals industry in the design of grinding circuits incorporating roller press comminution. The work index contains modification factors that reflect the effect of oversize, fines, moisture, closed-circuit operation and roll surface characteristics on the energy versus size reduction relationship. It has evolved from the results obtained of testing a wide range of ore and mineral types that includes bauxite, coal, kimberlite, limestone, iron and chrome ores, base metal and gold ores. The results show that even for such a diverse range of materials, they all demonstrate similarities of behavior when comminuted in a roller press. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Operational Performance of Grinding Rolls at Cyprus Sierrite:</B><BR>
<I>L. G. Thompsen, Cypress Sierrita Corp., Green Valley, AZ</I></FONT><BR>
The first high-pressure grinding roll in a copper mine was commissioned at Cyprus Sierrita in July 1995. This grinding roll is the world's biggest operating unit. It has a roll diameter of 2.4 meters and a face width of 1.4 meters. It is driven by two 3,000 horsepower motors. This paper will discuss the development of the grinding roll at Cyprus Sierrita and what it has done for comminution of Sierrita ore. Maintenance and operational performance will be discussed as well as test work including size reduction, power input, work index, and throughput.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Metallurgical Benefits of High Pressure Roll Grinding for Gold and Copper Recovery: </B><BR>
<I>W. Baum, Pittsburgh Mineral & Environmental Technology Inc., New Brighton, PA and N. Patzelt and J. Knecht, Krupp Polysius AG, Beckum, Germany</I></FONT><BR>
High pressure roll grinding (HPGR) is a mature but still expanding comminution technology. In the metals mining industry, HPGR is slowly gaining acceptance as a cost-efficient, high-throughput alternative for plant optimization. The increasing need to treat ores with progressively lower grades, complex mineralogies, refractory metal occurrence and variable rock types requires an energy-efficient comminution technology that reduces metallurgical problems inherent in conventional crushing and grinding, while stabilizing leach and flotation circuits and increases metals extraction. This paper will summarize the latest HPGR pilot test results for gold and copper projects in the United States and South America and describe the use of the high pressure grinding roll as a metallurgical tool. The application of HPGR for the treatment of heap-leach SX-EW copper ores, semirefractory gold ores, waste rock material and concentrator feeds will be illustrated with case histories.

<I>S. Morrell, W. Lim, F. Shi, and L. Tondo, University of Queensland, Indooroopilly, Qld, Australia</I></FONT><BR>
The high pressure grinding rolls (HPGR) is a relatively new technology which offers the potential benefits in energy savings, circuit simplicity and improved product characteristics in minerals processing applications. Over 300 machines are now operating world-wide, but most of these are used for grinding cement clinker, and relatively few are used in conventional mineral processing. One of the reasons for its current limited use in the minerals processing industry is that design, scale-up and flowsheet assessment procedures are seen to be relatively immature and untested. This has reduced confidence in the potential application of the technology. To help rectify this situation an industry funded research project was undertaken, one of whose aims was to develop and prove a mathematical model of the HPGR and a scale-up procedure.

<I>R. L. Bleifuss, H. E. Goetzman, B. R. Benner, and S. Zhong, University of Minnesota, Duluth, MN</I></FONT><BR>
A commercial high pressure roller press (KHD 90/25) was installed at the Coleraine Minerals Research Laboratory for testing in October, 1994. Pilot plant evaluation of the high pressure roller press has shown that it can be used as an alternative to the rod mill for the comminution of taconite. A series of pilot plant tests were run to compare roller press products to rod mill products in a simulated taconite flowsheet using magnet separation and closed circuit ball milling. Further investigation of a hybrid grinding system, roller press crushing followed by ball mill grinding, indicate that the combination may represent the most energy efficient system for taconite processing.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B><I>Plenary Address:</I> Evolution of AG/SAG Milling Technology-Current Status and Future Directions:</B><BR>
<I>R. D. Morrison and S. Morrel, J. K. Tech, Indooroopilly, QLD, Australia</I></FONT><BR>
Early experiences suggested autogenous mills were difficult to operate and consumed substantially more energy than conventional rod/ball mill circuits. As our understanding has increased and the technology has matured this perception has changed to the point where most new comminution circuits are AG/SAG based. In addition many operators have replaced existing conventional circuits with this technology. The JKMRC had been studying AG/SAG mills for over 20 years. During this time it has amassed what is probably the single largest and detailed database of pilot and full scale mills in the world. This has been used to help develop and refine its current commercially available mathematical model of AG/SAG mills. A decade of its application has greatly helped simplify both design and operation of AG/SAG milling circuits as well as helping to promote the effective use of recycle crushing, secondary crushing and closed-circuit operation. This paper describes the development of AG and SAG milling in terms of our understanding and the evolution of the technology. In addition the application of mathematical modeling and simulation in designing and operating efficient circuits is described with the aid of practical examples. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Ball and Rock Charge Motion in SAG Mills:</B><BR>
<I>R. K. Rajamani, B. K. Mishra and P. Songfack, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT</I></FONT><BR>
Primary grinding in SAG mills is gaining more importance with respect to the conventional crushing, rod and ball milling operations. This is due to the reduced operating costs generated by lower steel consumption. However, SAG milling is inherently susceptible to more severe risks and problems since it attempts to combine several stages of the conventional crushing and grinding operation into a single stage. This paper analyzes the SAG milling operation by predicting the motion of the rocks and steel balls. The well-known discrete element method is used to calculate the trajectories of individual entities, and their collisions with one another. A computer code previously used for studying the motion of grinding media in ball mills is enhanced to handle the interactions between heavy spherical steel balls and light chunks of rock, usually ellipsoidal in shape. A case study of a 32-ft. diameter SAG mill is presented and the effects of lifter bar height and configuration on the overall dynamics of the charge are discussed. This new approach has a large potential because it shows in detail the effect of each design or operating parameter on the performance of SAG mills.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Slurry Rheology in Autogenous Grinding and Classification:</B><BR>
<I>S. K. Kawatra, A. K. Bakshi, K. J. Shoop and T. C. Eisele, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI</I></FONT><BR>
Slurry rheology can have significant impact on the performance of autogeneous grinding circuits. A viscous slurry can act as a cushion and retard impact forces between the media and the ore, which reduces grinding efficiency. On the other hand, a dilute slurry will not be viscous enough to hold slurry in the impact zone of the media, which will lead to inefficient use of impact energy. An unfavorable rheology can also lead to overgrinding or centrifuging of the slurry inside the mill. Slurry rheology can have a similar effect on classification, with higher viscosity increasing the cut size. In this article, the causes of the rheological effects on autogeneous grinding and hydrocyclone classification have been discussed. Both plant and pilot scale data from autogeneous grinding have been provided to show the effects of viscosity on specific energy consumption and other breakage characteristics of the ore. It is shown that: (1) high viscosity, produced by low temperature and high fines content, significantly increases the specific energy consumption and the production of critical size material. (2 In hydrocyclone operation, increasing the viscosity causes the d5 (c) size to become coarser. (3)) Increasing viscosity tends to increase the amount of critical size material produced by an autogeneous mill, due to changes in the charge motion, and in the cushioning effects of the slurry in the grinding charge. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Development of Fully Autogeneous Grinding within Boliden Mineral:</B><BR>
<I>U. Markland and S. Markstrom, Boliden Mineral AB, Boliden, Sweden</I></FONT><BR>
Pioneering work with pilot-scale autogenous grinding started in Boliden in 1956. From 1961 to 1991 eleven fully autogenous grinding circuits have been installed at various concentrators within the Boliden company. A compact two-stage grinding system was designed in the beginning of the 1970's. The system included a pebble extractor which fed the secondary grinding stage with grinding media. The APC grinding system is a further development of the AG concept. A new design of the Boliden pebble extractor together with improved control strategy make the performance of the APC system suitable to almost any ore quality. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>The Influence of Designs, Maintenance Practices, and Operating Conditions on SAG and AG Mill Liner Performance:</B><BR>
<I>J. L Parks, ME Intl., Minneapolis, MN</I></FONT><BR>
This paper describes improvements in SAG and AG mill liner designs and their cumulative effect on wear life and mill availability. Routine procedures used by many SAG and AG mill operators to improve liner life are reviewed. Guidelines are provided for estimating the time required to replace worn liners along with practical methods to reduce downtime for liner replacement. Finally, the effects of mill operating conditions on liner wear life and breakage are considered. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>The Comminution Alternatives to SAG Mills:</B><BR>
<I>K. O'Bryan and E. Wipf, Nordberg, Inc., Milwaukee, WI</I></FONT><BR>
Flow sheets employing SAG mills as the initial stage of grinding are commonly selected for comminution of ores. Several alternative technologies are available. The paper will provide a brief review of the latest alternatives to SAG mills. Included in this review will be a discussion of the comparable benefits of each technology. Commonly accepted disadvantages will also be presented. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Modeling of Cone and Impact Crushers Using Laboratory-determined Energy-breakage Functions:</B><BR>
<I>K. Kojovic, T. J. Napier-Munn and J. S. Andersen, JKMRC, Indooroopilly,  QLD, Australia</I></FONT><BR>
Generic size reduction models of cone and impact crushers, which incorporate a single particle breakage test and the t-family of curves to describe the breakage behavior of the ore, have been developed using Whiten's computational structure for the modeling of crushers. A quantitative model of 7-foot cone crushers has been developed, based on surveys of Svedala (Kobe) and Nordberg machines. Survey data on Canica vertical shaft impact machines has been used to validate the impact crusher model. Given the crusher operating conditions (such as tonnage, feed size, gap and liner condition, or rotor speed and configuration), and breakage information on the ore, the models provide good predictions of product size distribution, and appear to be robust over a wide range of conditions. The paper describes the models and discusses their application to process design and optimization.

<I>Y. Wang and E. Forssberg, Lule University of Technology, Lule, Sweden</I></FONT><BR>
This paper presents recent experimental results in wet ultrafine grinding and classification of industrial minerals (such as carbonates and kaolin clay) using a stirred ball mill and a high performance centrifuge. The studies have been focused on the effect of beads (size, density and load) on the grinding efficiency. The use of chemical additives and the control of slurry rheology is presented. The role of pre-crushing with a high-pressure roller mill on subsequent ultra-fine grinding is discussed for energy saving and size reduction. In addition, a disc-stack nozzle centrifuge for ultrafine classification duties at high solids contents is concerned. </P>

<I>H. Hoberg, RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany and G. Schubert, Tu Bergakademie Freiberg, Freiberg, Germany</I></FONT><BR>
A large and diverse array of size reduction equipment is now available for the comminution of waste materials. Selection is determined by the nature of the waste and by its behavior under external mechanical stressing. Accordingly, wastes can be divided into those with elastic/brittle and those with plastic or viscous behavior. Only in a few unique cases have the fundamentals of the comminution of plastic or viscous materials been presented. The paper centers on a systematic characterization of the types of stress fundamental to comminution. An analysis is presented of available technologies, centering on those machines designed for materials with plastic or viscous behavior. </P>

<I>U. Schneider and H. Hoberg, RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany</I></FONT><BR>
Ultrafine dusts have achieved major technological significance, especially in the production of nanostructured materials. For a diverse range of substances the grinding behavior and the product characteristics change drastically in the transition from the micron to the colloid range. Apart from the material-specific peculiarities the type and intensity of stressing and the reactions between material and media in the grinding chamber are of utmost importance. On different high-melting oxides it was demonstrated that colloidally-disperse dusts with characteristic structures can be generated using special grinding techniques, often complemented by the use of grinding activities. </P>

<I>M. S. Duffy, Mount Isa Mines, Mount Isa, QLD, Australia and S. Morrell, J. K. Mineral Research Center, Indooroopilly, QLD, Australia</I></FONT><BR>
To exploit the mineral resources of fine-grained ore bodies the mineral processing industry is turning to fine-grinding technology, of which tower milling has become an established part. However, compared to other mills relatively little is known about the operating mechanisms in tower mills. In all milling processes one of the keys to understanding how they work is in knowing how their grinding media move. To investigate the ball motion in tower mills a glass mill was therefore constructed and measurements taken of the movement of the grinding media. This paper describes the results from this study. </P>

<I>J. Zheng, C. C. Harris and P. Somasundaran, Columbia University, New York, NY</I></FONT><BR>
Powder surface and polymer structural changes have been studied as a function of grinding time, stirring speed and polymer and mineral types. It was found that specific surface area can be increased over 100% by using polymer additives; particle surface and polymer structure were also found to change during grinding. Powder surface and polymer properties have been determined using FTIR, ESR, Fluorescence, TOC, ICP, and HPLC/GPC analysis, and surface and polymer properties are correlated with operating variables and the mechanisms involved are explored. </P>

<I>J. L. Vanderbeek, Chino Mines Co., Hurley, NM</I></FONT><BR>
The Chino Concentrator commenced operation in 1982 as a SAG-ball mill circuit which could process 37,500 stpd of ore. Since 1982 a series of process improvements such as the addition of two stages of SAG recycle crushing allowed throughputs to increase to more than 48,000 stpd, at the expense of significantly coarser flotation feed sizing and reduced recovery. To compensate, a third (tertiary) stage of grinding consisting of four 1250 hp Vertimills was installed which has allowed the flotation feed size and recovery to return to historical levels. The design and operational characteristics of the Tertiary Grinding Circuit are described. </P>

<I>K. R. Weller, M. Gao and B. J. I. Adlair, CSIRO, Pinjarra Hills, QLD, Australia and G. D. Richmond, 2 Aberfoyl Ltd., Burnie, Tas, Australia</I></FONT><BR>
After ultrafine grinding in a 4-litre continuous horizontal stirred mill to a P80 of 2.3 um, gold recovery by cyanide leaching from the concentrator tailing (containing 3 g/t gold and 144 g/t silver) increased to 23.3%; far short of a mill manufacturer's claim that ultrafine grinding would lead to extractions greater than 90%. Grinding and leaching conditions are discussed. An extensive QEM*SEM Trace Mineral Search on the unground tailing failed to identify any gold-bearing particles but did identify silver-bearing particles which displayed a variety of textural associations and liberation characteristics. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B><I>Plenary Address:</I>Worldwide Grinding Circuits Practice: </B><BR>
<I>D. Malhotra, Mineral Resource Development, Inc., Wheat Ridge, CO</I></FONT><BR>
Comminution circuits in general account for fifty percent of capital and operation costs for a processing plant. Significant advances have been made in optimization of these circuits. One would expect a few circuits would be the favored designs for plants. Review of worldwide grinding circuits indicate a variety of circuits designs are utilized for non-technical reasons. A brief review of circuits and reasons for their selection are discussed in this paper.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Comminution in a Mining Context: </B><BR>
<I>D. J. McKee, G. Chitombo and T. J. Kojovoc, JKMRC, Indooroopilly, Brisbane, QLD, Australia</I></FONT><BR>
The product sizing and tonnage from a grinding circuit are the end result of a series of linked size reduction stages which always involve: fragmentation in mining; degradation in transport of ore; crushing and finally grinding. A case study is presented which illustrates the substantial effect on autogenous mill throughput of different mining practice. It is shown that it is possible to model each of the size reduction steps of fragmentation, degradation, crushing and grinding. The way in which this predictive capability is used is dependent on the operating constraints of each mine-mill combination.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>The Effect of Media Sizing on Ball Milling Efficiency: </B><BR>
<I>R. E. McIvor, Cleveland-Cliffs, Inc., Cleveland, OH</I></FONT><BR>
This paper reviews the historical literature and the author's experience with regard to the effect of that the selection of grinding ball size or sizes has on ball mill grinding efficiency. The conclusions presented provide guidelines for single and multi-size charging practices in commercial milling operations. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Extrusion Effects in the High Pressure Grinding Rolls: </B><BR>
<I>W. I. L. Lim and J. J. Campbell, CSIRO, Pinjarra Hills, Brisbane, QLD, Australia and L. Tondo, JKMRS, Brisbane, QLD, Australia</I></FONT><BR>
Due to the abrasive nature of typical ores, significant wear rate has typically occurred in using high pressure grinding rolls (HPGR) to grind ores. A probable wear mechanism is the abrasion of the rolls surface due to extrusion of the compacted material as it leaves the rolls. This study involves laboratory, pilot and full-scale HPGR's. The results indicate that extrusion increase with increasing grinding pressure and rolls diameter, while the use of studded or profiled rolls significantly reduces the extrusion effect compared to smooth rolls. Rolls speed and feed moisture can also have significant effect on extrusion.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Recent Developments in the Design of Large Size Grinding Mills:</B><BR>
<I>N. Patzelt and J. Knecht, Krupp Polysius AG Beckum, Beckum, Germany</I></FONT><BR>
There are several concepts on the market for the design of large size grinding mills. One difference is the way how to support grinding mills - either on trunnions with conical endwalls or on the mill shell itself applying slipper pad bearings. Also for the drive systems several possibilities exist - conventional open gear drives, gearless drives and a more recent development the COMBIFLEX drive. The design features of the world's biggest shell support SAG mill will be discussed. The 34 ft. SAG mill is equipped with an 11,000 KW (14,750 HP) double COMBIFLEX drive arrangement.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Design and Economic Considerations of Comminution Circuits: </B><BR>
<I>W. H. Cooksey, Kilborn International Inc., Englewood, CO</I></FONT><BR>
Two comminution scenarios are investigated to optimize the rate of return on a new plant investment. A combination of crushing (primary, secondary, and tertiary) and grinding (SAG mill, rod mill, and ball mill) circuits is required to achieve the desired product size with the best economic performance levels. The selected circuits are dependent on costs associated with numerous project, equipment, and ore specific criteria. Project specific items include location of ore deposit, tonnage, and production schedule. Equipment criteria entail capital costs for the equipment, installation and start-up time and operating costs associated with power efficiency, steel consumption, and maintenance. Ore specific items consist of required product size, recovery, ore hardness, ore abrasion, ore impact index, and chemical composition. Factors influencing the selection of the crushing and grinding plant require systematic evaluation to optimize plant performance and economic return. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Proper Mill Application for Today's Industry: </B><BR>
<I>C. M. Sams, Fuller Mineral Process, Bethlehem</I></FONT><BR>
Todays' large milling applications vary greatly from traditional duty. New approaches in mill process applications test the old tried and proven methods, compromising mill energy efficiency, for improvements in availability and production increases. This paper reviews the traditional application standards and evaluates the changes in operating philosophy of large mills since the mid 1980's. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Establishing the Energy Efficiency of a Ball Mill: </B><BR>
<I>R. P. King, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT</I></FONT><BR>
It is generally accepted that the energy efficiency of a ball mill is low, but it has never been possible to establish a suitable base line for the calculation of the theoretical energy that is required. Calculations that are based on the production of new surface area are not appropriate. The problem is complicated because the energy is applied discretely to individual particles that absorb energy and may or may not break and, if they do, the size distribution of progeny particles from each breakage event is determined strongly by the amount of energy that is absorbed. Properly designed single-particle breakage tests in the laboratory have made it possible to measure the fracture energy of a wide variety of particulate materials under conditions equivalent to those found in industrial ball mills. The fracture energy is the energy that is actually required to break a particle under impact loading. The fracture energy also determines the relationship between the size spectrum of the progeny and the applied energy. These measurements make it possible to calculate the minimum energy required to reduce a particular material from a given feed size distribution to any required product size distribution. This gives a realistic base line for the calculation of energy efficiency.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Status of a Reclaimed Mine Site in Colorado After 10 Growing Seasons:</B><BR>
<I>J. J. Gusek and J. T. Gormley, Knight Piesold LLC, Denver, CO</I></FONT><BR>
Several final pits in the Seneca No. 1 Surface Coal Mine were abandoned in the 1960's without being reclaimed. In addition, a progressive landslide aggravated by the abandoned mine land conditions was threatening a county road and private property. An AML-funded project to stabilize the landslide and reclaim the final pits was completed in 1986 for the Colorado Division of Mines and Geology (formerly Colorado Mine Land Reclamation Division). The site was visited after ten growing seasons. The land is stable and the vegetation re-establishment is strong. Volunteer native plant species are now invading the reclaimed sites. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>An Update on ISO 14000 EMS: Application, If Any, to the Mining Industry:</B><BR>
<I>A. B. Szwilski and R. D. Begley, Marshall University, Huntington, WV</I></FONT><BR>
ISO 14000 are voluntary international standards that address environmental management system standards, environmental auditing, environmental labeling, environmental performance evaluation, and life-cycle assessment. An environmental management system (EMS) is a facet of an organization's structure that addresses the immediate and long-term impact of a company's products, services, and processes on the environment. An EMS includes an appropriate environmental policy and a commitment of sufficient resources to achieve continuous environmental performance improvement. The paper outlines the current status, possible benefits to the  mining industry, and options available to a company wanting to become involved in the ISO 14000 standards.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Environmental Issues for the Reclamation of Abandoned Coal Mines in the Appalachian Coal Fields:</B><BR>
<I>R. D. Begley and A. B. Szwilski, Marshall University, Huntington, WV and D. Sarin, West Virginia Division of Environmental Protection, Nitro, WV</I></FONT><BR>
This paper will present the results of an analysis of several abandoned mine reclamation projects completed in the state of West Virginia. The analysis was performed with the objective of summarizing and/or classification of the environmental consequences with reference to the characteristics of the mining facilities (surface, underground, etc.). The analysis also addressed the itemized cost of remediation with respect to procedures, environmental concerns and time. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Impacts of Consolidation on the Shear Strength of Coal Refuse Impoundments:</B><BR>
<I>R. J. Sweigard, T. C. Hopkins, C. T. Justice, T. Beckam, and E. D. Thompson, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY</I></FONT><BR>
Fine coal refuse is often pumped, as a slurry, into surface impoundments as a means of permanent disposal. As the available volume is filled, the height of the embankments are frequently increased. Many times the additional embankment material is placed upon consolidaed fine coal refuse. There has been some concern about the long-term effect of consolidation of this material at or above the liquid limit upon its shear strength. A laboratory investigation was performed using three different types of fine coal slurry taken from Central Appalachian coal preparation plants. The refuse was consolidated in 10-foot plexiglass columns under incremental amounts of surcharge loading. The incremental loads were designed to simulate the effect of increasing the height of a refuse embankment on top of the consolidating coal slurry. After the refuse in the columns had consolidated for several months, the columns were cut apart and triaxial tests were performed on both the consolidated material and unconsolidated material for comparison of their shear strength pa-rameters. </P>

<I>J. F. Colinet and R. A. Jankowski, US Dept. of Energy, Pittsburgh, PA</I></FONT><BR>
Full-scale laboratory tests were conducted to investigate the dust control effectiveness of using a flooded bed scrubber with exhaust ventilation in deep-cut continuous miner faces up to 12.2 meters in length. The impact on respirable dust levels were measured for changes in face airflow, curtain setback distance, operator positioning, and in operating parameters of the external spray system on the miner. Statistically significant differences in dust levels of 0.5 to 1.2 mg/m3 were observed between specific sampling locations and the other test parameters. Results indicate that the use of a flooded bed scrubber with exhaust face ventilation appears to be a viable system for dust control when extracting deep-cuts.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Construction of Explosion-resistant Seals: </B><BR>
<I>C. R. Stephan and M. J. Schultz, Mine Safety and Health Administration, Pittsburgh, PA</I></FONT><BR>
Federal safety standards for underground coal mine ventilation include regulations detailing the construction of explosion-resistant seals. Many different types of seals have been installed in underground coal mines including: solid concrete block, wood, cemetitious foam, OMEGA block, and limestone/polyurethane mixtures. The strength characteristics, materials, and methods of construction each play an important role in determining whether a particular seal design meets current regulations. This report details the results of large-scale testing and identifies all current seals which meet or exceed the regulations set forth in Title 30 CFR Part 75.335. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Real Time Psychrometric Data Collection (You Can Teach an Old Dog New Tricks): </B><BR>
<I>K. H. McDaniel, Westinghouse Electric Corp., Carlsbad, NM</I></FONT><BR>
Eight Mine Weather Stations (MWS) installed at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) to monitor the underground ventilation system are helping to simulate real-time ventilation scenarios. Seasonal weather extremes can result in variations of Natural Ventilation Pressure (NVP) which can significantly effect the ventilation system. The eight MWS(s) (which previously collected and stored temperature, barometric pressure and relative humidity data for subsequent NVP calculations) were upgraded to provide continuous real-time data to the site wide Central Monitoring System. This data can now be utilized by the ventilation engineer to create real time ventilation simulations and trends which assist in the prediction and mitigation of NVP and pyschrometric related events. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Characteristic Curves Revisited: A More Logical Approach to Determine Operating Points: </B><BR>
<I>L. M. English and Y. J. Wang, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV</I></FONT><BR>
When plotted as head vs. volume, fan curves start high and decrease in head with increasing volume while mine head curves start low and rise with increasing volume. Their intersection is the system operating point. But wait a minute: isn't head loss a negative number, a debit? And isn't fan head an energy addition, a credit? This, as every ventilation instructor knows, is often a stumbling block to student or audience comprehension. It is possible to use the intuitively correct curves-pressure losses as negative values and energy additions as positive values-and still obtain the correct operating point: adding the two curves produces a third curve that intersects the X-axis at the operating point, the point at which the fan energy input exactly matches air circulation energy loss. Using this technique also makes it easier to account for outside influences on the system, such as natural ventilating pressure; with the standard approach it is quite easy to add or subtract such influences to the wrong curve. This approach can be extended to the graphical solution of any series/parallel circuit or ventilation network. The results are the same, and the approach is logically consistent and less confusing.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>National Coal Resource Assessment: Coal for the Twenty-First Century:</B><BR>
<I>H. Gluskoter, US Geological Survey, Reston, VA</I></FONT><BR>
The total coal resources of the US are large and will satisfy the increased demand that is projected for the next several decades. However, once we look beyond the life expectancies of existing mines, it is not easy to predict which regions and which coal beds will be produced. The current National Coal Resource Assessment, conducted by the US Geological Survey with the cooperation of many State agencies, other Federal agencies, and coal companies, is identifying those coals expected to be available to meet the demand during the next several decades and is reporting upon their location, quality, and other significant characteristics.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Changes in the National Coal Availability and Recoverability Studies:</B><BR>
<I>M. D. Carter, US Geological Survey, Reston, VA and T. J. Rohrbacher, US Geological Survey, Denver, CO</I></FONT><BR>
Detailed resource analysis of individual 7.5-minute quandrangle areas by the US Geological Survey (USGS) and State geological agencies have found that, in those areas studied in the Appalachian region and Illinois basin, approximately 50 percent of the original coal resource is available for mining, 25 percent is recoverable, and a mere 8 percent of the total resource can be extracted and marketed profitably. During 1995 and 1996 three developments have added flexibility, versatility, continuity, and useability to the studies: 1) establishment of the USGS's National Coal Resource Assessment program, 2) institutional merging of the US Bureau of Mines' Coal Recoverability Studies into the USGS's Coal Availability Studies, and perhaps most significantly, 3) the ability to study multiple quandrangle areas in single models allowing a more regional approach in a reasonably short time frame. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Quality and Distribution of the Anderson-Wyodak Coal Zone, Powder River Basin, Montana and Wyoming-A First Step in the National Coal Resource Assessment:</B><BR>
<I>G. D. Stricker, M.S. Ellis and R. M. Flores, US Geological Survey, Denver, CO</I></FONT><BR>
Region IV of the National Coal Resource Assessment includes the Tertiary coal producing basins within the northern Rocky Mountains and Great Plains. The principal source of coal in the Powder River Basin is the Anderson-Wyodak coal zone, which splits and merges, is missing in some areas, and is as thick as 140 feet. Over 800 samples of this coal zone were analyzed for moisture, ash, and total sulfur contents; heat-of-combustion; and for environmentally sensitive trace elements. Not all of the Anderson-Wyodak coal zone will be available for mining. Many geologic and economic factors and government mandates control the availability of the resource. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Coal Availability and Recoverability Studies in Kentucky: Implications for National Coal Assessment:</B><BR>
<I>G. A. Weisenfluh, Kentucky Geological Survey, Lexington, KY</I></FONT><BR>
The USGS national coal assessment program is evaluating original coal resources at a 1:250,000 scale, whereas the coal availability and recoverability programs have focused on single quadrangles (1:24,000 scale) and include analysis of factors that affect the mineability of the coal. Studies using single quadrangles tend to be weighted toward local factors affecting availability and recoverability, and do not always reflect regional patterns. To better measure these regional factors, contiguous areas with as many as 15 quadrangles have been analyzed without modifying the scale of data collection. Applying coal availability and recoverability factors to the results of the national coal assessment (1:250,000 scale) may be accomplished with an acceptable reduction in data accuracy.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Availability of Coal in Illinois for Efficient, Low-cost Mining:</B><BR>
<I>C. G. Treworgy and C. Chenoweth, Illinois State Geological Survey, Champaign, IL</I></FONT><BR>
Whether Illinois' huge reserves of bituminous coal play a role in future US coal production depends on their availability and mining cost. Residential and commercial developments restrict access to coal reserves in some parts of Illinois, but geological and technical factors (seam thickness, stripping ratios, roof conditions, partings, faults, and size and geometry of the reserve block) have greater effect on the coal's availability for mining. The collective impacts of these factors significantly reduce coal availability in some parts of Illinois, but large blocks of reserves suitable for efficient, low-cost mining operations appear to remain available elsewhere. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Late Paleozoic Illinois Basin Brine Migration-Consequences for Coal Quality:</B><BR>
<I>M. B. Goldhaber and J. R. Hatch, US Geological Survey, Denver, CO and E. L. Rowan, US Geological Survey, Menlo Park, CA</I>
This study describes geochemical data which confirm a major regional fluid-flow event in the Illinois basin during the early Permian (approximately 272 MY BP) which resulted in the genesis of two large sediment-hosted ore districts located at the north and south ends of the basin. One consequence of this basin-wide fluid flow is enrichments in the Pennsylvanian coals of western Illinois in ore-related elements, primarily Zn, Cd, Pb, As, Co and Mo. Previous fluid-inclusion studies on ZnS in coal from this region document formation from a brine whose temperature and salinity was similar to ore fluids. We hypothesize that the metal-enriched coals occur where rocks of the Mississippian system pinch out, permitting ore-bearing fluids to flow upward into the overlying coals. This mechanism is supported by paleoflow calculations employing a finite difference modeling code.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>The British Coal Industry: An American Perspective:</B><BR>
<I>J. L. Weiss and R. L. Lewis, John T.  Boyd Co., Pittsburgh, PA</I></FONT><BR>
The British coal industry has experienced a significant reduction in the number of mines, production, and employment since 1984. This consolidation was accelerated by market forces, culminating in the privatization of British Coal Corporation (BCC) in 1994. Between 1991 and 1994, John T. Boyd Company (BOYD) performed several comprehensive evaluations of BCC for the British Government. These included assessments of productivity potential, economic viability, technical aspects relative to privatization, and development of independent plans and projections for BCC's underground and surface mines. This paper summarizes BOYD's efforts and includes our perspective of the present and future British coal industry. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>NSW Coal-A Micro View of the Future:</B><BR>
<I>J. Barber, ECS Mining Consultants, Bowral, NSW, Australia</I></FONT><BR>
The Australian states of New South Wales and Queensland, because of their endowment of black coal resources, dominate the production and export statistics for Australian coal. New South Wales produced 86 million tons of saleable coal in 1994, representing a doubling of output since 1980, or a growth of 5% per annum. Asian demand for thermal and coking coal has, of course, driven this growth in NSW. This high Asian demand is forecast to continue and NSW will seek to secure its share. This paper focuses on some of the issues facing NSW in the future, and in particular examines some of the major new and proposed mining projects.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Unconventional Mining-New Generation of Mining Technology of the XXIst Century:</B><BR>
<I>J. F. Vasjuchkov and B. M. Vorobjev, MINERAL Ltd., Moscow, Russia and K. Vasioutchkov, KV Mineral, Inc., Shirley, NY</I></FONT><BR>
A term "unconventional mining" or "non-traditional mining technology" becomes more and more familiar to the mining engineering media. This new technology produces practically no wastes, leaves the land virtually unscarred and avoids other environmental and safety problems associated with conventional mining technology. Unconventional mining technology could make it economic to work deposits that are now too low-grade or too deep or too thin to be economically mined. Humanization of mining labor is finally the most important advantage of the non-traditional technology. The application of unconventional mining would provide the most possible economical and environmentally sound solutions worldwide for a very wide scope of geo-technical and mining conditions.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>The Technological Evolution of Longwall Mining:</B><BR>
<I>C. Haycocks and M. Karmis, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA</I></FONT><BR>
The evolution of longwall mining is traced from its inception. This method recovered 90% of coal with roof closure controlled by packs and walls. Mechanization began with kerf cutting and crude face conveyors and progressed to face shearers. Plows followed accompanied by mechanical chocks then hydraulic supports. US longwalls evolved a retreating system to recover blocks of coal outlined by room and pillar panels. Computer control combined with self-advancing supports and improved face mining have greatly increased productivity. Past trends are used to predict future technological trends. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Evoluation of RFID Technology in Underground Coal Mines:</B><BR>
<I>A. Unal and R. L. Grayson, University of Missouri, Rolla, MO</I></FONT><BR>
Use of radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology to solve informational needs in isolated and restricted underground mining environments will be reviewed, also giving specifications of some past and currently available systems. The advantages and disadvantages of using various frequencies, system configurations, and specific components, including their construction standards and capability, will be discussed. The remaining challenges to more widespread use of RFID systems for personnel and vehicle tracking will be identified, and recommendations concerning operating environment capabilities will be detailed. Finally, the ultimate requirements for maintaining system integrity during and following a coal mine emergency will be discussed. </P>

<I>J. P. Rider, E. T. Thimons and A. E. Prokop, US Dept. of Energy, Pittsburgh, PA</I></FONT><BR>
The Mining Health and Safety Division of the US Department of Energy is studying the effect of covering the underside of longwall shields with acoustical material to reduce reverberating noise along the face. Experiments using acoustical absorptive insulation were conducted at the full scale simulated longwall test facility located at the Pittsburgh Research Center. The undersides of ten 1.5 m (5 ft.) wide shields were covered with acoustical material. Sound levels were recorded every 1.5 m along a 15.2 m (50 ft) section of the simulated face. The analysis of the data indicated that a 2.0-3.0 dBA noise reduction was achieved between the shearer drums and a 4.0-5.5 dBA attenuation was attained upwind of the headgate drum. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>The Effects of Intake Airflow Velocity on Average Face Methane Concentrations: </B><BR>
<I>C. D. Taylor, J. P. Rider and J. A. Zimmer, Pittsburgh Research Center, Pittsburgh, PA</I></FONT><BR>
The purpose of this research was to examine how changes in the velocity of intake air affect face methane concentrations. A range of face operating conditions (scrubber flow: 1.9 and 3.3 m3/s, setback distances: 3, 9 and 15 m) were simulated in a surface test gallery. Methane gas released in the gallery was monitored at several locations to evaluate the effects of air velocity on methane dilution and removal. For each of the conditions tested, methane concentrations were reduced when intake velocity was increased from 1.3 to 2.5 m/s. Effects due to velocity were greatest for shorter setback distances and lower scrubber flow. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Forensic Investigations of Mining Accidents by the Mine Safety and Health Administration: </B><BR>
<I>S. Sawyer, MSHA, Pittsburgh, PA</I></FONT><BR>
The Pittsburgh Safety and Health Technology Center of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) provides engineering and scientific support to the inspectorate personnel of MSHA. One of the Center's myriad roles is to assist in the investigation of mining accidents, especially those involving fatalities. Center personnel utilize forensics to help uncover the causes of accidents and to make technical recommendations on preventing future similar mishaps. To exemplify a typical forensic investigation, this paper documents the methodology used in determining the reasons for a boat sinking, which resulted in a double fatality on a mine company pond. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Targeting and Prioritizing Safety Interventions in West Virginia:</B><BR>
<I> R. L. Grayson, University of Missouri, Rolla, MO and R. C. Althouse, J. M. Dean, G. L. Winn and M. J. Klishis, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV</I></FONT><BR>
Using powerful database management software, nested-field analysis and micro-analysis of narratives have been recently made of West Virginia accident data, resulting in a new approach for targeting and prioritizing safety interventions by county, mine size, specific mine, job title, type injury, etc. and combinations of these parameters. The analyses can (and have) been useful in focusing training or discussion groups on specific work problems, trends, conditions, and situations for the targeted groups of miners. Application of the technique, which will be presented in this paper, also allows comparisons of various performance measures among mines. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Economic Decision-making for Methane Drainage Systems for Underground Coal Mines: </B><BR>
<I>J. M. Mutmansky and A. Wang, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA</I></FONT><BR>
The ventilation system in any underground coal mine requires a base level of ventilating air into every mining section to meet the minimum requirements of mining regulations. If the mine has high methane (or dust) levels, the ventilating air quantity is increased to keep methane and dust levels in check. However, other methods of controlling both dust and methane levels also exist. In the case of methane, control may be affected in part by a methane drainage system. This paper defines the basic economic model for decision-making when considering a methane drainage system for an underground coal mine. The adoption of a drainage system will require a significant capital and operating expense. The model outlines the economic structure of the decision and considers the costs and benefits when the he methane can be marketed and when the methane is vented to the atmosphere. The effects on the dust levels and the safety of the mine will also be considered, both in a general format and as economic variables. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Horizontal Stress and Longwall Headgate Ground Control: </B><BR>
<I>C. Mark and T. P. Mucho, US Dept of Energy, Pittsburgh, PA</I></FONT><BR>
Horizontal stresses are caused by global plate tectonic forces. During 1995 alone, they were largely responsible for closing two US longwall mines. This paper presents eight case histories from Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Alabama. Each mine encountered roof falls or difficult ground conditions in the headgate, caused by horizontal stress concentrations. The problems are detailed, and the control measures adopted are described. The paper also discusses detailed measurements made at two adjacent Pennsylvania longwalls. One headgate was oriented to avoid a horizontal stress concentration, and the other was not. Eliminating the stress concentration dramatically reduced roof support loads and roof deformation. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Evaluating Jet Fan Performance in Conjunction with Machine-mounted Dust Scrubbers: </B><BR>
<I>J. P. Rider, C. E. Taylor, and J. A. Zimmer, Dept of Energy, Pittsburgh, PA</I></FONT><BR>
The number of extended cut mining systems has increased significantly in coal mines over the last decade, and there is a constant push to extend the face ventilation systems to even greater setback distances. The need to maintain airflow at setback distances of 40 ft and beyond requires that methods for delivering intake air to the face be improved, or alternative ventilation techniques be implemented. For this reason, research was conducted at the Pittsburgh Research Center to evaluate the performance of jet fans used in conjunction with machine-mounted scrubbers. A series of tests utilizing a simulated mine entry were conducted with a full-scale continuous miner at jet fan setback distances of 40, 60, and 90 ft. Available air in the last open cross-cut was regulated at 9000 or 14000 cfm. Scrubber flows of 4000, 7000, and 14000 cfm were used in combination with jet fan flows of 4000 and 7000 cfm. In addition, blowing brattice ventilation systems were tested for comparison with the jet fan. </P>

<P>New technology doesn't just happen, it begins with a creative thought and is developed by countless hours of researching, experimenting, testing, failing, and trying again. In our attempts to make our current mining practices more efficient, we are missing the opportunity to develop new technology that could revolutionize our industry? Or are we practical, safety-conscious miners who are responding to the current market, in an industry with a finite life? These questions, and more, will be discussed by a panel of well-known professionals from consulting, manufacturing, operations and research. The representatives from each area will begin our discussion by presenting a summary that outlines their perspective on what the industry's needs will be. From this point forward, through panel discussion and questions from the floor, we will analyze the direction that research is taking, review some of the current work being done, and be able to voice our individual opinions as to the brilliance or folly of our current outlook towards the technology of tomorrow.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Overview of Low-rank Coal Drying:</B><BR>
<I>W. Willson, Coal-Water Fuel Services, Fairbanks, AK, B. Irwin, Int'l. Coal Preparation Consultants Ltd., Calgary, AL, Canada, and D. E. Walsh, University of Alaska, Fairbanks, AK</I></FONT><BR>
Low-rank coal (LRC) drying processes are generally categorized by operating temperature, drying environment and type of feed (either sized or ground coal). Within these broad categories, drying processes differ according to the type of drying equipment and methods of quenching and stabilizing the dried products. This paper focuses on the product quality of various LRC drying processes including conventional low and high temperature evaporative drying and non-evaporative, hydrothermal drying. The former may be preferred if the dried product can be utilized immediately, but moisture re-absorption, spontaneous heating and fines production during handling are problems associated with longer term storage, transportation and utilization. Methods for reducing these problems are discussed. Hydrothermal processing is an advanced technology featuring high pressure, non-evaporative drying, which solves stability problems by producing a liquid fuel. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Considerations for Blending Low-rank and High-rank Coals:</B><BR>
<I>M. W. Downing and O. I. Ogunsola, University of Alaska, Fairbanks, AK</I></FONT><BR>
An environmental regulations become more stringent and clean coal becomes more scarce and expensive, some interrelated factors must be considered to derive maximum benefits of coal blending. These factors may be broadly classified as technical, economical, environmental and geopolitical. While it is easy to determine the economic and geopolitical merits/demerits of a blend, it is difficult to predict the combustion and emission characteristics of a blend of those individual coals. This paper discusses some of these factors based on an ongoing study in our laboratory and on information obtained from the literature. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Low-rank Coal Ash Characterization:</B><BR>
<I>Washability and Utilization Implications: P. D. Rao and D. E. Walsh, University of Alaska, Fairbanks, AK</I></FONT><BR>
Chemical and physical properties of typical low-rank coal (LRC) ash are significantly different than bituminous coal ash. With the exception of extraneous ash, which is incorporated during mining or is due to ash partings within or between coal seams, LRC ash consists primarily of inherent ash that is bonded into the coal's organic matrix or finely disseminated mineral matter. This paper reviews the nature of LRC ash, both inherent and extraneous, and how this impacts the prospects for washing and utilizing LRCs. A literature review, as well as washability data, proximate and ultimate analysis and ash analyses of over 25 Alaskan LRC seams are used as a basis for this discussion. The authors' recent research into the nature and distribution of phosphorus in an Alaskan LRC is also discussed. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Characterization of Hydrothermally Dried Low-rank Coals:</B><BR>
<I>D. E. Walsh, P.D. Rao, O. Noirot, H. C. Owens and J. R. Mokka, University of Alaska, Fairbanks, AK</I></FONT><BR>
This study investigated the effects of temperature, residence time, and particle size on the degree of low-rank coal (LRC) upgrading for a non-evaporative drying process: hot water drying (HWD). Replicated, factorial tests were conducted on three Alaskan LRCs. Within tested particle size range, there was no significant effect due to particle size. Experimental results indicate that LRC upgrading via HWD occurs rapidly within the first 10-20 minutes of residence time; thereafter, the upgrading process slows down. The properties of the hot water dried products were very sensitive to process temperature. Calorific value, carbon and oxygen contents, equilibrium moisture and Hardgrove grindability all appear to change linearly with process temperature within the 275C to 325C range. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Driving Down Haul Road Costs: </B><BR>
<I>L. E. O'Neill, Caterpillar, Inc., Peoria, IL</I></FONT><BR>
During the past decade the trend has been toward larger mining trucks, placing demands for larger, more efficient support equipment. A well-designed and maintained haul road is important in achieving the lowest hauling cost per ton. This paper will cover the design features of a larger and more efficient motor grader to meet the needs of mines operating larger haul trucks. A comparison will be made with current designs, as well as predicted performance advantages. Initial customer experience will be shared regarding this new technology. This new technology will expand the application range of motor graders and should be of interest to the mining industry worldwide. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>A Computer-based Hazard-awareness Assessment Program for Surface Mines: </B><BR>
<I>D. A. Poukhovski and C. J. Bise, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA</I></FONT><BR>
Two integral components of the 30 CFR 48 training requirements mandated for new miners, newly employed experienced miners, and the annual refresher training of all miners are hazard recognition and prevention of accidents. Unlike instruction preparation for fact-based material, hazard-recongnition instruction preparation places a particular challenge before safety-training specialists because they are often limited in their ability to adequetely gauge the trainees' levels of awareness prior to training, in addition to the usual concerns of training relevance and thought-provoking presentation. Computer-based instruction is particularly well suited for assisting trainers in developing hazard-recognition topics because it can be used in pre-training and post-training modes for assessment of training effectiveness, as well as during training as a presentation tool. Therefore, this paper will present a recent approach developed at Penn State to apply this technology for assessment and instruction of accident prevention through hazard recognition, with a discussion of results gathered from field tests in several surface coal mines.

<I>A. W. Dickerson, BHP Research, Clayton, VIC, Australia, F. A. Bartley, Liebherr Mining Truck Inc., Baxter Springs, KS and G. Hollier, BHP Australia Coal, Dysart, QLD, Australia</I></FONT><BR>
Following on from many years of research work aimed at improving the efficiency of truck haulage operations in mines operated by BHP Minerals, BHP Research developed a concept for a much more cost-effective rear dump mining truck. A proof of concept prototype truck is now operating in an Australian coal mine. The key features of the concept are outlined and some results from the initial evaluation of the proof of concept prototype truck are provided.

<I>J. G. Pippenger and R. J. Ziegler, The Coteau Properties Co., Beulah, ND</I></FONT><BR>
The Coteau Properties Company's Freedom Mine is a surface lignite operation located near Beulah, North Dakota. As part of the mining process, Coteau removes and replaces thin layers of suitable plant growth material (SPGM) generally ranging in thickness between one and five feet. Historically, tractor-scrapers have completed this work, however, rising tractor-scraper costs and increasing haulage distances sent Coteau in search of a lower cost method resulting in the acquisition of a backhoe/truck fleet in 1995. This presentation reviews the study justifying the fleet's purchase and the actual performance compared to tractor-scrapers during the first year of operation.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Practical Optimization Strategies for Coal-washing Plants:</B><BR>
<I>R. P. King, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT</I></FONT><BR>
Coal washing plants are commonly designed to process different size fractions of the feed material in parallel sections of the plant. This allows the choice of the optimal equipment type for each size range and significant gains in processing efficiency are consequently realized. However, plants with this structure must be nicely set up in terms of particle sizes at which the feed is split and in terms of the target separation densities that are set up for each of the individual washing operations. The choice of these operational settings is a difficult optimization problem since choices made for one setting affect the performance of all the other operations in the plant. A combination of classical optimization theory and modern plant simulation techniques provides solutions that can be easily implemented in operating plants and which lead to significant increases in yield with no sacrifice of ash or sulfur levels over conventional nonoptimal plant setups. The implementation of the optimal strategy does not increase operating costs. Typical examples of the optimization procedure are given in the paper. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Towards a General Distribution Model for Separator Design:</B><BR>
<I>M. S. Klima and P. T. Luckie, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA</I></FONT><BR>
Proper analysis of washability data can lead to the development of a maximum yield coal preparation plant flowsheet. Simulations, as simple as spreadsheet mass/water balancing, are important in examining yield maximization and middlings liberation. Key to flowsheet simulations is the distribution model, expressing the probability of a species reporting to the product stream. There are many such models in the literature. This paper examines a functional form that fits most of the proposed distribution functions. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>High Capacity Processor-A Novel Design for Coal Pre-combustion Cleaning:</B><BR>
<I>D. G. Chedgy, S. Yu, M. A. Sharpe and J. V. Ghelarducci, CLI Corp., Pittsburgh, PA</I></FONT><BR>
This article presents a novel design for coal pre-combustion cleaning, called the High Capacity Processor (HCP). This design is different  from the conventional designs with the equivalent capacity, and is characterized by four features: 1) the use of highly efficient cleaning devices operating within a wide size and specific gravity range; 2) the use of single units of high capacity equipment for each individual process; 3) much lower capital and operating costs; and 4) a very compact plant construction. This design has been applied for the Dipka Coal Preparation Plant in India. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Recent Developments in Dense Medium Cyclone Circuit Design:</B><BR>
<I>R. Robertson, Massey Coal Services, Inc., Charleston, WV and D. S. Placha, R. L. Terry and L. A. Watters, Sedgman, Bridgeville, PA</I></FONT><BR>
Dense medium cyclones are the preferred means for cleaning 1/2 in. x 14 to 28 Mesh (12.7 mm x 1.0 to 0.6 mm) raw coal and are becoming a common choice for cleaning raw coal from a nominal top size of 2-1/2 in. to 3 in. (63.5 mm to 76.2 mm) down to 14 to 28 Mesh (1.0 mm to 0.6 mm). During the last ten years, dense medium cyclone circuitry design has undergone changes which have combined to improve process efficiency. This paper describes these improvements and compares present day design with the design used prior to the mid 1980's. Improvements in the following areas are described: raw coal desliming, cyclone configuration, drain and rinse applications, dilute medium circuitry, and instrumentation and control. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>An Overview of Russian Coal Preparation Technology and the Integration of US Principles and Practices:</B><BR>
<I>K. Wyzykowski, Scott European Capital Corp., Valencia, PA</I></FONT><BR>
Russian coal beneficiation technology developed essentially to meet both the problems common to the preparation of coals and the unique circumstances of their utilization marketplace, environment, and social/economic conditions. Steam coal preparation plants generally employ dry screening with only the coarse fraction washed. Plants preparing metallurgical coal are uniformly 3 circuit plants with a coarse heavy media circuit for +13 mm, jigs for the 13 mm x 0.5 mm and flotation of the fines. US principles of unit process efficiency, alternative equipment for fines washing and intensive mechanical dewatering have been introduced, well-received and are increasing in application. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Recent Advances in the Development of Coal Spiral Technology:</B><BR>
<I>B. Weldon, Mineral Technologies, Bundall, QLD, Australia</I></FONT><BR>
The use of spiral separators for the washing of coal in the size range 2 x 0.1mm is now a well established practice throughout the world. Notwithstanding this almost universal acceptance of spiral technology for coal fines beneficiation and through use, some short comings in these processing units have been identified. A number of these shortcomings have been addressed in recently-developed hardware. Both laboratory and in-plant test data on new spiral models incorporating features to improve the performance of coal spirals are presented and compared with the performance of previous spiral models. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Coal Resources, Coal Quality, Coal Reserves, and Interregional Competition for Utility Markets-Key Elements of the National Coal Resources Assessment:</B><BR>
<I>R. C. Milici, US Geological Survey, Reston, VA</I></FONT><BR>
US coal reserves are a small part of a great natural resource endowment. At present, depletion and environmental concerns have shifted much of the remaining reserves to the west and have enhanced the competitiveness of western coals in utility markets. Topics under consideration by the USGS are: 1. Rate of production from major coal fields in the US during the next several decades. 2. The effects of coal quality and environmental regulation on coal reserves. 3. Depletion of eastern coal reserves and the future sources of energy needed to supply the nation's ongoing need for electric power generation. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Water Quality Effects of Fly Ash/Coal Refuse Blending:</B><BR>
<I>W. L. Daniels and B. R. Steward, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA</I></FONT><BR>
This paper reports five years of laboratory and field data on water quality effects of fly ash/coal refuse blends. When alkaline fly ash is blended with acidic refuse at rates that maintain a net alkaline balance over time, water quality effects are generally positive. However, when non-alkaline ash is utilized, or when the ash/refuse mix is net acidic, the blends acidify and heavy metals are preferentially stripped from the fly ash matrix, seriously degrading water quality, at least locally within the fill. This acidification process may be time-lagged for years after placement, but can be predicted. Refuse pile design options for ash co-disposal are discussed. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Issues Impacting Coal Ash Utilization:</B><BR>
<I>L. Larrimore, Southern Company Services, Birmingham, AL and D. Dodgen, Southern Company Services, Atlanta, GA</I></FONT><BR>
Electric utilities depend heavily on coal as a major fuel source for power generation, annually producing approximately 75 million tons of ash as a by-product. Utilities and others who burn coal have traditionally disposed of these materials in ponds or landfills. However, in the last 10-15 years there has been a greatly increased emphasis on beneficial utilization of coal ash by the producers themselves as well as by customers who purchase the materials. This document examines the regulatory, cost, and technical performance issues which currently impact the use of coal ash for various applications. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Upgrading Gasifier Slag:</B><BR>
<I>M. S. Klima, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA and V. Choudhry, Praxis Engineers, Inc., Milpitas, CA</I></FONT><BR>
Table concentration was used to process nominal -3.4 mm gasifier slag (~85% ash) to separate high (~100%) ash slag from low (~50%) ash char. The results indicated a nearly ideal separation of the slag from the char for sizes coarser than about 1 mm. An overall slag yield of 71% was obtained. The slag was sufficiently clean to be used as feed material for the production of expanded lightweight aggregate. Size separation could be used to reduce the ash content of the char product to under 35%. The upgraded char could then be combined with raw coal to be used as fuel. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Assessing Roof and Rib Hazard in the Underground Stone Industry:</B><BR>
<I>A. T. Iannacchione and L. J. Prosser, US Dept. of Energy, Pittsburgh, PA</I></FONT><BR>
Currently, 96 underground stone mines are in operation with several more in the proposed or planning stage. The production from underground stone mines has increased 32% from 1991 to 1994, reaching a total of 6 metric tons. Unfortunately, from 1991 through 1995, 44 miners were fatally injured in the stone industry with 11 occurring at underground mines and from a workforce of less than 2,000 miners. Nine of these 11 miners were fatally injured in falls of roof or rib. Clearly, a safer environment for the miners can be achieved by better control of hazardous ground. To help characterize the types of ground control hazards experienced in the stone industry, information related to accidents within the industry since 1978 was collected and analyzed. Also, 24 mines visited in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, Kentucky, and Indiana were used to assess ground conditions in underground stone mines. In general, ground failures could be classified as those occurring near-surface and initiated by solution (water) processes or those occurring under moderate overburden and initiated by geologic structures and stress concentrations. This paper will overview the factors which effect ground control and provide several examples of assessment efforts aimed at improving miner safety. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Use of Tomography in Mining:</B><BR>
<I>D. F. Scott and T. J. Williams, Spokane Research Center, Spokane, WA and M. J. Friedel, Lakeville, MN</I></FONT><BR>
Seismic tomography can be a valuable tool for mine planning and can increase miner safety. It is a time-efficient, relatively inexpensive, and reliable method of determining relative stress in deep underground (<1220m) pillars. If high-stress areas are detected, these areas can be destressed prior to development or avoided. High-stress areas can be monitored with successive seismic surveys to determine if stress decreases to the point where development can be initiated safely. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Cribless Tailgate in the Pittsburgh #8 Coal Seam Employing Cable Trusses: </B><BR>
<I>J. G. Oldsen, J. C. Stankus and S. Guo, Jennmar Corp., Pittsburgh, PA and A. W. Khair, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV</I></FONT><BR>
During the last several years, implementation of trusses, in lieu of wood cribs, has been successful for supplemental tailgate support in the Pittsburgh seam. This paper reviews the truss support system provided by the new high strength 0.6" tensioned cable truss, which is now also being used in cribless tailgates. Cable loading and roof deformation were monitored, as well as panel and pillar stress loading, to evaluate roof and floor performance. The test results indicate that the cable truss system successfully controlled the roof and floor during first and second panel extraction. This paper will describe the advantages of cable trusses and their load transfer mechanism as well as mine evaluation. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>The Ignition of Methane and Coal Dust by Air Compression-The Experimental Proof: </B><BR>
<I>W. Lin and M. J. McPherson, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA</I></FONT><BR>
When a large area of open gob collapses suddenly, a windblast is produced that can cause considerable damage throughout the infrastructure of a mine. In a few cases, the windblast has been accompanied by ignitions of methane and/or coal dust. Earlier in this project, analytical and numerical analyses investigated the transient behavior of the air through the small time period during which the roof is falling. This is sufficiently short to allow adiabatic compression of the air, i.e. negligible heat transfer to rock surfaces. Controlled escape of the air interconnecting entries limits the build-up of air pressure. However, this same phenomen causes the potential energy of the falling strata to be concentrated into a diminishing mass of air. Computer simulations predicted that the temperature of the air would increase rapidly as the roof descends, reaching values that are capable of igniting either methane or coal dust. This paper concentrates on a series of laboratory test involving the compression of mixtures of air, methane and coal dust under a falling weight and while allowing controlled escape of the mixture. The transient responses on pressure and temperature sensors were recorded. In addition to an analysis of those records, the paper highlights those conditions in which ignitions occurred. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Electrical Fault Detection on Downed DC Trolley Lines: </B><BR>
<I>J. S. Peterson, G. P. Cole and M. R. Yenchek, US Dept. of Energy, Pittsburgh, PA</I></FONT><BR>
The US Bureau of Mines (now part of the Department of Energy) has conducted research to improve electrical fault detection on coal mine dc trolley systems. Tests were conducted at cooperating mines to assist in developing a neural network-based detection algorithm for distinguishing between electrical faults and normal operation of the trolley system. Rectifier current measurements were taken during normal loading, during induced faults, and during transitions between them for data to train the neural network. During field tests, when the trained neural network detects an electrical fault it provides an indication signal to the user. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Laboratory Assessment of Rock Fragmentation Process by Continuous Miners: </B><BR>
<I>V. B. Achanti and A. W. Khair, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV</I></FONT><BR>
Laboratory studies were carried out at West Virginia University to investigate the rock fragmentation mechanism by continuous miners using an automated rotary cutting simulator. The primary factors influencing the fragmentation process were found to be: bit spacing, bit geometry, depth of cut, type of rock, and attack angle. This paper presents a quantitative relationship among these parameters to achieve optimum energy consumption and minimize dust generation during rock fragmentation process. Three bits were used simultaneously on Indiana limestone while the bit geometry, namely, bit tip angle and bit tip size were varied. Bit spacing was varied from 2.5 cm (1 in.) to 7.5 cm (3 in.) while the cutting process was assessed for varying cutting depths. Triaxial tests were also conducted to correlate the failure angle of the rock during cutting. Assessment of these parameters has led to a better understanding of the cutting mechanism by continuous miners in terms of energy consumption and dust generation. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Protection of Pipelines Affected by Surface Subsidence: </B><BR>
<I>Y. Luo, S. S. Peng and H. J. Chen, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV</I></FONT><BR>
Surface subsidence often has potential to cause problems to buried pipelines which differ largely in their services, materials, sizes, joints and burying conditions. This paper presents the methods for assessing the subsidence influences on pipelines. The basic steps are: (1) prediction of dynamic and final surface movements and deformations along the pipelines, (2) identification of the weaknesses of the pipeline structures and the major contributors to the problems, (3) assessment of severity of the problems. If necessary, proper mitigation measures will be designed to maintain the safe operation of the pipelines during and after subsidence process. A number of field cases of protecting pipelines are also presented.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Industrial Minerals in the 21st Century: A Perspective of Trends in Markets, Technologies and Applications: </B><BR>
<I>C. C. Harvey, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN and A. F. Alsobrook, Alsobrook & Co., Medford, NJ</I></FONT><BR>
As we move towards the 21st Century, there are several factors which influence the markets and processing technologies for industrial minerals. Traditional markets for industrial minerals in the developed world are frequently stagnant or decreasing because of their maturity or due to environmental factors such as reclamation, recovery of byproducts and recycling. Some industrial minerals are greatly affected by these factors, while others are either immune or have adapted successfully to meet these challenges. In the developing countries of the world, there is rapid market growth and resource exploitation. The future of specific mineral commodities in these environments will be discussed. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>The Outlook for Graphite and Graphite Technology: </B><BR>
<I>G. P. Hand, Superior Graphite Co., Chicago, IL</I></FONT><BR>
The graphite industry as a whole has gone through many changes over the years. Most of the graphite used in major applications since the turn of the century were basic natural or electrode by-product synthetic materials, processed using simple crushing, screening, or grinding techniques. In the mid 1970's new thermal technology was developed which changed the face of the graphite industry, and opened up a panacea of new products and capabilities. Materials produced through this new technology have helped revolutionize new products and processes in industries including automotive, batteries, fuel cells, electronics, iron, lubricants and steel. This paper outlines the continued improvements in those industries as well as the outlook for new technology in this rapidly changing area. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Vermiculite - Outlook 1997: </B><BR>

Review of worldwide vermiculite production and markets with particular emphasis on recent technologic advances.

<I>C. R. Landis, F. J. Reisch, and C. E. Davis, American Colloid Co., Arlington Heights, IL</I></FONT><BR>
In recent years, emerging bentonite technology is exposing this versatile ore into new product markets, as well as, more efficient exploration and development. These opportunities require familiar performance attributes, but within the context of the specific new application. For example, high viscosity, Na-montmorillonite-based bentonite products improve gel stability of ceramic body compositions. In other cases optimization of surface modification convert non-swelling clays into swelling clays capable of broader market use. Organic-based surface modifications offer viscosity enhancements of an order of magnitude with only a factor of two or three increases of solids such as cosmetic, consumer, and environment markets. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Ball Clay Developments in the Americas: </B><BR>
<I>T. Deems, S. Leese, J. Larimore and T. Vincent, United Clays, Inc., Brentwood, TN</I></FONT><BR>
Increases in consumption of ball clay in Central and South America as well as North America initiate a review of major deposit locations, technical properties and access to imported clays. The review will include the nature and quality of deposits and market requirements. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Barite: World Sources and the US Market: </B><BR>
<I>S. D. Bearden, New Riverside Ochre Co., Inc., Cartersville, GA</I></FONT><BR>
The world's reserve base is adequate for at least 100 years at the current consumption rate. China, United States, and India are expected to remain the leading barite producing countries. The United States will continue to be the largest consumer of ore in all end use categories. None of the known substitutes for barium sulfate are expected to impact existing applications. World production for the past decade is near five million tons per year. This is about 50% of the projected capacity. The US consumed 1.6 million tons of barite in 1995, which is approximately 40% of the record year high of 4.3 million tons set in 1981. Consumption is directly proportional to hydrocarbon well installation activity as about 90% of all barite end use is in drilling fluid additives. Imports are expected to continue to supply more than half of the US requirements.

For the past 6000 years lime usage has continued to broaden with today's worldwide consumption estimated at 140 million metric tons. It is fair to say that lime in one form or another was utilized to produce products consumed by virtually every person in attendance at this conference. On a very broad scale, lime utilization from country to country correlates with two major factors: population and Gross National Product. This paper will explore those growth opportunities and discuss the factors which significantly influence lime consumption.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Outlook for Cement Raw Materials:</B><BR>
<I>S. A. Regis, Arizona Portland Cement Co., Rillito, AZ</I></FONT><BR>
Cement raw material demand is affected, not only by cement demand, but also by environmental regulations, technological changes in cement manufacturing, and cement market demands. The utilization of recyclable industrial by products as a substitute for mined materials is a trend that will continue, albeit at the whim of new regulations. Concrete market trends such as the recent awareness of Alkali-Silicate Reactivity or high early strength requirements also cause manufacturers to search for new raw materials. Finally, modern cement plants are more sensitive to raw mix variability and the effects of trace elements than older facilities and the analysis of raw material supplies is much more sophisticated. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>The Outlook for Refractory Raw Materials in North America:</B><BR>
<I>C. J. Kessler and J. L. Cunningham, Harbison-Walker Refractories Co., Pittsburgh, PA</I></FONT><BR>
Specific trends in raw materials critical to the future of the refractories industry begins with a demand base of current materials, product-segmented, and projections of the future "mainstays" and newer, emerging materials required to maintain tomorrow's cost-effective products. Supply sources and impact of future materials, parameters of good supply, and specific trends in the refractories industry driving materials outlook are presented. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Advances in Acid-activated Clays:</B><BR>
<I>T. Dombrowski, Engelhard Corp., Gordon, GA and J. Henderson, Engelhard Corp., Beachwood, OH</I></FONT><BR>
Acid-activated montmorillonite is used worldwide as a catalyst and as a sorbent for the enhancement and purification products as well as vegetable and animal-based facts. The solid-acid character of the activated montmorillonite is imparted by the manufacturing process, giving it unique properties that are exploited in these industries. Several international companies and a multitude of local clay producers are focusing on improving the efficiency of their standard and specialized products. This paper will describe the use of acid-activated montmorillonite in traditional sorbent applications, as a solid acid catalyst, and other new uses. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Magnesia, Moving Beyond Refractories:</B><BR>
<I>M. L. T. Maniocha, Martin Marietta Magnesia Specialties, Baltimore, MD</I></FONT><BR>
Most magnesia, whether of natural or synthetic origin, is utilized in its dead burned or periclase form as refractory linings for the production of steel. Continued research in refractory science combined with good refractory maintenance and improvements in steel making practice have resulted in decreasing use of magnesia. To make up for this loss of business producers of synthetic magnesia have started to manufacture a variety of magnesium based chemicals that are utilized in many diverse industries and applications.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>A Kaolin Company's Journey to ISO 9002 Certification: </B><BR>
<I>L. A. Arrington-Webb and E. Loyd, Thiele Kaolin Co., Sandersville, GA</I></FONT><BR>
The International Standards Organization (ISO) 9000 series of quality standards was published in 1987. First initiated by the British in the mid-1970's to assure the quality of British goods and services, ISO 9000 certification demonstrates the capability of a supplier to meet the requirements of the customer. Thiele Kaolin Company has invested considerable time and money achieving and maintaining ISO 9002 certification. Through a regimen of process control and documentation, routine audits, and a commitment to quality management, this kaolin producer continues to be a competitive pigment supplier in a world-wide market. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Quality Control Practices in the US Bentonite Industry: </B><BR>
<I>R. K. Brown, WYO-BEN, Inc., Billings, MT</I></FONT><BR>
The quality of finished bentonite products is heavily influenced by the physio-chemical characteristics of the base clay itself. Knowledge of these properties is critical if the correct clay is to be chosen for each product type. Laboratory testing of clay samples during exploration, pit development, mining and processing ensures that clay quality remains consistently appropriate for the requirements of each product. Plant processing of the clay is limited to drying, sizing, and in some case incorporation of chemical additives to modify the properties of the clay. Drying and sizing are monitored on a continuous basis using statistical process control (SPC) methods. The affect of additive addition is monitored by laboratory testing of finished product. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Total Quality and the ISO Quality Standard-SMI's Approach: </B><BR>
<I>W. M. Conboy, Specialty Minerals Inc., Gulliver, MI</I></FONT><BR>
The ISO 9000 series quality standards have their roots in the quality control systems which preceded the move to quality assurance through Total Quality Management. Specialty Minerals has moved past the initial resistance to ISO as a "necessary evil" and come to recognize the quality standard as system which strongly supports their Total Quality effort (aka Minerals Total Quality). This presentation will detail the elements of the ISO standard which support and promote Total Quality (as experienced by one mining/mineral processing company). 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Between a Rock and a Hard Place: ISO 14000 and the Mining Industry: </B><BR>
<I>P. Nazaryk and H. Ilenda, Harding Lawson Assoc., Denver, CO</I></FONT><BR>
ISO 14000 is a series of voluntary international environmental standards. These standards describe how a corporation should manage its environmental affairs. Some experts predict that ISO 14000 will have the same impact on corporate environmental management that ISO 9000 has had on corporate quality management programs. This paper will discuss ISO 14000 and the future of ISO 14000 in the mining industry. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Clay: Measuring up to ISO 9000: </B><BR>
<I>M. G. Leidich, Robinson Brick Co., Denver, CO</I></FONT><BR>
As our customers demand quality in all aspects of the brick manufacturing process, the Robinson Brick Company has chosen to become ISO 9001 certified. This process will extend to the performance verification of the clays where we have developed testing programs that address the numerous physical properties of the clays. The reporting of those results wil greatly improve manufacturing's confidence that the end product will meet Robinson's rigid quality standards.

<I>C. A. Alves, DOCEGEO, Belem, Para, Brazil and H. H. Murray, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN</I></FONT><BR>
The kaolin district along the Capim River in Para in northern Brazil contains reserves of more than 500,000,000 metric tons. These deposits are in the Ipixuna Formation of Tertiary age and are exceptionally pure. The major mineral is kaolinite along with quartz and minor quantities of anatase, zircon, and tourmaline. The particle size ranges between 60 and 90 percent greater than 2 microns and the crude ore brightness percentages are between 80 and 87. The processed products for paper coating are 89 ISO to 91 ISO and the Brookfield viscosity is less than 200 centipoise. These Capim River kaolins will be the dominant source of high quality paper coating kaolins in the 21st century. </P>

<I>S. M. Pickering Jr., Industrial Mineral Serlvices Inc., Macon, GA and M. A. Linkous, US Borax Inc., Raleigh, NC</I></FONT><BR>
Commercial quality kaolins occur in fluvial sediments in both central-eastern Georgia and in the eastern Amazon River area. Distinctive coarse and fine particle size kaolin deposits are present in both areas; they have many remarkable similarities for mineral deposits occurring at such wide geographic separation. Industrial, mineralogical, crystalline, and chemical resemblance of the coarse and fine kaolin deposits from the two areas will be described in detail. Knowledge of similarities of the Brazilian clays to those which have dominated world production in Georgia will help to develop superior quality kaolin products for world use in paper, paint, plastic, ceramic, and other applications. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Functional Fillers for Plastics-Outlook Beyond the Year 2000:</B><BR>
<I>C. H. Eckert, Kline & Co., Fairfield, NJ</I></FONT><BR>
Industrial minerals are utilized as additives in dozens of industries including paint, paper, adhesives, and rubber. However, of all of their additive applications, plastics represents the highest in value with current mineral prices averaging twice those for all other filler applications. In 1995, an estimated 1.8 million tons of minerals were consumed in the US plastics industry. The outlook for demand is very encouraging, in some applications, growth in demand will exceed 10% per year. This paper will focus on the performance benefits of specific mineral additives in various polymer systems, key trends impacting demand, and provide insights on emerging applications. </P>

<I>R. C. Freas, Franklin Industrial Minerals, Nashville, TN and J. Barton and L. Canova, Franklin Industrial Minerals, Kings Mountain, NC</I></FONT><BR>
The physical and chemical properties of mica are unique relative to most other industrial minerals. As such, mica is suitable for a variety of functional applications in new and emerging markets. This paper examines some of these applications and particularly the contribution mica makes in end product performance. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Crystalline Silica-Health and Regulatory Aspects: </B><BR>
<I>R. E. Glenn, National Industrial Sand Assoc., Calverton, MD</I></FONT><BR>
The health affects on the lung from the inhalation of crystalline silica will be reviewed. The listing by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of crystalline silica triggered numerous regulatory requirements at the federal and state level. IARC will reconsider the carcinogenicity of crystalline silica in October 1996. The preliminary findings of the reconsideration and possible impact, if any, will be discussed. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>The Geology of Silica and its Significance in Crystalline Silica Regulation: Part 1: </B><BR>
<I>S. G. Ampian, Ampian & Assoc., Mount Airy, MD and M. L. Raymond, Ralston Purina, St Louis, MO</I></FONT><BR>
This paper is the first in a series to help regulators better understand the natural occurrence of silica to avoid over-regulation. Photomicrographs of typical rock thin-sections are used to illustrate the differences between single crystal, cryptocrystalline, glassy, and amorphous silicas continually encountered down-stream. The petrographic differences between the crystalline silicas, largely ignored, are used to both correlate and critically examine the mineralogy of the epidemiological and biological evidence routinely cited justifying regulation. The regulators almost total reliance on X-ray diffractometry for quantifying crystalline silica is questioned because its resulting total crystalline silica analysis is incapable of distinguishing between the crystalline silica varieties commonly encountered in many bulk and monitor samples. Examples of quartz and cristobalite over-regulation are discussed. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>The Quantitative Measurement of Crystalline Silica: </B><BR>
<I>W. J. Miles, Bentonite Corp., Denver, CO</I></FONT><BR>
Current worker right to know regulations have created the need to analyze many industrial products for crystalline silica polymorphs at a threshold of 0.1% and determine the concentration of each for identification of health risks and compliance with government regulations. X-ray diffraction is the preferred analytical method for identification of the polymorphs, quartz, cristobalite and tridymite, and for quantification of these mineral species. However, quantification at the 0.1% threshold is extremely difficult or impossible with complex mineral and chemical systems typically found in industrial products. Concentration techniques for the crystalline silica polymorphs are required to enhance sensitivity of X-ray diffraction for both identification and quantification of initial concentration.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>The Measure and Mismeasure of Opal: </B><BR>
<I>W. F. Moll, Oil-Dri Corp., Vernon Hills, IL</I></FONT><BR>
Misidentification of opal as cristobalite can have regulatory consequences. Opal is a non-crystalline form of hydrated silica whereas cristobalite is a crystalline and regulated. The X-ray diffraction effects for opal bear some similarity to the diffraction pattern of cristobalite, and is the source of the confusion. These effects are not Bragg reflections arising from long-range order but arise from different sources. Methods of differentiating between opal and cristobalite include careful examination of the diffraction effects, acid dissolution, and effects of heating. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Good Science and Regulation-An Indispensable Pair: </B><BR>
<I>C. S. Thompson, Norwalk, CT</I></FONT><BR>
A simple incorrect mineralogical definition caused untold hardship to a company and could have destroyed a major segment of the mining industry. Usually such an affected industry reluctantly accepts such a decision, regardless of its scientific validity. In a major case, the particular industry challenged the decision, and promoted good and correct science by enlisting the help of scientists in academia, government and industry. Eventually, the regulatory groups altered their position, and ensured not only the viability of the industry but also public health and safety. Professional organizations have a duty to address regulatory actions and through cooperative efforts with all concerned, ensure that good science prevails.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>ISK Wollastonite-Strategic Development of a High Grade Deposit: </B><BR>
<I>B. A. Slim, MineStart Management Inc., N. Vancouver, BC, Canada</I></FONT><BR>
Investigations, by Super Twins Resources Ltd, of high-grade wollastonite in the Coast Mountains of north-west British Columbia show raw grades of 80% purity yielding 95% concentrates with aspect ratios of 20:1. The mountain location, at 1500 m elevation in the undeveloped Iskut region with low cloud and short summer season will impose constraints on bulk shipping and operations. A 100 mm, HDPE pipeline is being investigated to transport a raw wollastonite slurry either to the Strikine River for barging or for trucking on the proposed road extension joining the nearby Snip Gold mine to Eskay Creek. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Breakthrough Technology May Revolutionize the Soda Ash Industry: </B><BR>
<I>J. S. Wold, Wold Trona Co., Inc., Casper, WY</I></FONT><BR>
Wold Trona Co., Inc. (WTCI) of Casper, WY is building the sixth mine and soda ash plant in the Green River Basin of Wyoming. Patented technology developed for Wold by Hazen Research, Denver, permits the production of Benetron (dry beneficiated trona 98% Na2 Co3) and Benetron Plus (99.5+% Na1 CO3) at 1/3 the capital investment and 1/2 the operating cost of the five monohydrate plants in Green River which produce 1/3 of the world's soda ash. WTCI's trona resources are the largest in the basin giving an unparalleled opportunity to become an international leader in the soda ash industry. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>U.S. Zeolites, An Emerging Company: </B><BR>
<I>T. R. van Fleet, US Zeolite, Inc., Golden, CO</I></FONT><BR>
Nearly 10 years ago, four retired mining executives formed a company to develop and commercialize a natural zeolite resource, Clinoptilolite, on the Union Pacific land grant in Sweetwater County, Wyoming. The struggle to develop markets and raise investment capital over the years has been an interesting and frustrating story. Like most Industrial Minerals projects, the success of failure lies in your ability to develop markets and locate funding. This paper will discuss our many adventures, failures, and hopefully success in developing a zeolite business. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Development of Calcium Borate Production: </B><BR>
<I>G. J. Hartman, Fort Cady Minerals Corp., Newberry Springs, CA</I></FONT><BR>
Fort Cady Minerals began borate production by in situ leaching techniques in 1981 and is now marketing Cadycal 100, a calcium borate product. Mine production in by in situ leaching of a deep seated colemanite deposit using dilute acid. After the rich boric acid solution is pumped to the surface, the solution is purified then calcium borate product is precipitated. The resulting product is then dried and sold to ceramic and fiberglass manufacturers. This paper discusses the recent activity and future plans.

<I>J. C. Heter, Industrial Mineral Fillers, LLC, Canyon Country, CA</I></FONT><BR>
Industrial Mineral Fillers, LLC is in the initial stages of mining and processing Anorthosite (CASPAR) at its Caspar mine located in Soledad Canyon, Los Angeles County, California. The CASPAR it being mined from the Precambrian San Gabriel Anorthosite Complex of the western San Gabriel Mountains. Preliminary results suggest that CASPAR is a desirable alternative to silica sand used in construction applications, such as stucco, grout, abrasives and other uses including filtration and golf course recreation sands. With the use of standard ore dressing techniques, CASPAR is suitable for use as a filler in paint, plastics and rubber. Environmentally, CASPAR has advantages over silica sand, in that, there is no detectable Free Silica.

<I>E. R. Berlanga and M. Garza, Vitro Quimica y Empaghes, Monterrey, Neon Leon, Mexico</I></FONT><BR>
This paper examines Mexico's feldspar industry and it's related consumer sectors, glass and ceramics. The feldspar industry has changed during the last 10 years into a more concentrated one. Moreover, glass has taken a second place as compared to ceramics, a fast growing sector. Mexico's economic situation is now turning to positive growth after the crisis brought about the by the peso devaluation in December 1994. It is expected that a significant growth in the demand for feldspar by the year 2,000 will occur, triggered by ceramics and construction sectors. Companies in these sectors are highly competitive in the U.S. market and have been expanding their capacity in spite of the economic crisis. Container producers are the main consumers in the glass market due to the slow down in consumption of aluminum and plastics containers in which prices went shoulder to shoulder with the US dollar exchange rate, glass consumption is expected to have a moderate growth through the year 2,000.

<I>F. Heivilin, Oil-Dri Corp. of America, Ochlocknee, GA</I></FONT><BR>
An option for or the lease, mineral deed, or warranty are no longer the sole key to gain or maintain access to mineral reserves on fee lands. You need a plan which has a reasonable chance of success to handle all present or future local, state, or federal laws. Your neighbors, the perception of the community, a complete mine plan, and potential liability are all part of the plan. Examples from New Jersey, Florida, Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Update on the 1872 Mining Law: </B><BR>
<I>S. Dempsey, Royal Gold, Inc., Denver, CO</I></FONT><BR>
Perhaps more than ever before, pressure to reform the 1872 Mining Law has created an environment of uncertainty for miners. Contrary to popular reports, the mining industry supports reform, and has played a significant role in Congressional reform efforts. Since its passage in 1872, the Mining Law has been modified on numerous occasions to meet the changing needs of America's society and economy. Despite evolution, the Mining Law continues to be criticized as outdated. Although all sides of the issue have shown support for reasonable reform legislation, these interests have been unable to reach agreement on specific provisions of proposed reform legislation. The debate has focused on such issues as the size and type of royalties to be paid to the government, payment of fair market value for lands, claim maintenance fees, and abandoned mine cleanup programs. Although in last year's Budget Reconciliation Bill, Congress passed comprehensive reform legislation for the first time ever, the Bill was vetoed by President Clinton. In the absence of effective reform measures, some innovative approaches have been used to prevent mining operations on the public lands. These include everything from the use of environmental laws to delay or prevent operations, to inflammatory rhetoric by the Secretary of the Interior directed at mining companies complying with the law, to presidential withdrawals of mineral lands. This paper will address in more detail the current state of the Mining Law, and likely proposals for change.

<I>J. R. Evans, Bureau of Land Management, Sacramento, CA</I></FONT><BR>
In order to patent an industrial mineral placer mining claim, it must incorporate an economic deposit. Each ten acre parcel is evaluated for its mineral-in- character nature. Nonmineral-in-character parcels cannot be patented. Economic concerns include: claim location, dummy locators, common variety nature, "excess reserves," and environmental constraints. Also, geologic and mineralogic studies, sampling and testing procedures are vital. Mining, milling, processing costs, and taxes must be evaluated. Product marketability analysis is necessary before starting any cash flow or discounted cash flow study. Valid data is essential to evaluate an economic industrial mineral deposit.

<I>D. H. Sherwood, Parcel, Mauro, Hultin & Spaanstra, PC, Denver, CO</I></FONT><BR>
Government agencies managing public lands are limiting mineral exploration. Land is being closed to mining, and even where exploration can still be done, there is no longer much certainty that one can mine what might be found. The government in some cases argues that what has been found cannot be mined economically, and in others that too much has been found. Courts, which once zealously protected private claims to the public domain, now favor the land managers and those who on general principle oppose mining. Furthermore, recent events in Congress suggest that the end is near, especially for industrial minerals.

<I>J. Hayden, National Stone Association, Washington, DC</I></FONT><BR>
It is becoming increasingly difficult to secure local aggregate resources that meet quality standards and local restrictions without conflicts with other land uses and environmental regulations. The successful integration of natural-resource information into land-use decisions is increasingly difficult as the needs for land and resources become more numerous, complex, and urgent. Well-reasoned decisions about land-use are critical to the National interest if Infrastructure resouces are to remain economically available. Provisions for uninterrupted future supplies of aggregate should be made using proper long-range planning that incorporate a multiple land-use program. That program would inlcude identification and protection of natural resources, strategies that will permit development of resources in relation to future market needs and environmental considerations, and a beneficial use of mined-out areas.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Fluid Inclusion Evidence for a Magmatic Source for Metals in Hydrothermal Systems: </B><BR>
<I>R. J. Bodnar, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA</I></FONT><BR>
Fluid inclusions provide one of the most direct means of determining the source(s) of components in hydrothermal ore deposits. Results of synchrotron XRF analyses of individual fluid inclusions from various paragenetic stages in porphyry copper deposits show clearly that many metals of interest (Cu, Fe, Pb, Zn) are sourced in the magma and are introduced into the hydrothermal system when aqueous fluids exsolve from the crystallizing magma. The results also indicate that volatile elements such as As, Hg, T1 as well as Au, Ag and some Cu are partitioned into the vapor phase and transported into the near-surface where precipitation and mineralization occurs. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Are Mafic Alkaline Rocks Needed to Make a Good Porphyry System?: </B><BR>
<I>J. D. Keith, D. T. Maughan, K. A. Waite and D. H. Tomlinson, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT</I></FONT><BR>
Large porphyry molybdenum and porphyry copper systems often contain small amounts of mafic alkaline rocks that occur as late mineralized dikes. Petrogenesis of latitic rocks from the Bingham Canyon porphyry copper system indicates that ore-related magma contained more than ten percent intermixed mafic alkaline magma. Mafic alkaline magma is often oxidized and much more sulfur-, metal- and water-rich than the intermediate or silicic magma that crystallizes adjacent to the ore. Should we assume that the silicic magma is more critical to ore formation than the underplated mafic magma because it is more proximal?</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Magmatic Contributions to a Mineralized Geothermal System, Valles Caldera, New Mexico: </B><BR>
<I>F. E. Goff and J. N. Gardner, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM</I></FONT><BR>
The 1.2 Myr Valles caldera is the "type" resurgent caldera and post-caldera eruptions are as young as 60 kyr. Within the caldera, a 200-300C hydrothermal system circulates mostly in intracaldera tuff and tuffaceous sedimentary rocks. Isotope results show the fluids are dominated by meteoric water. Epithermal mineralization (propylitic and phyllic alteration) characterizes the reservoir rocks and sub-ore grade molybdenite is the major ore mineral found to date. The only component of obvious magmatic/mantle origin is anomalous 3He although it is possible that magma still contributes some C, S, Cl, and water to the system.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Why Small Porphyry Intrusions Can Host Big Ore Deposits: </B><BR>
<I>J. B. Lowenstern, US Geological Survey, Menlo Park, CA</I></FONT><BR>
Recent work suggests that Climax-type Mo deposits form from relatively normal granitic magmas, rather than from extraordinarily trace-element enriched melts. This requires that the large tonnages of ore are not derived solely from the small associated intrusions. Instead, cupolas serve partly as conduits for degassing of large, subjacent magma reservoirs. One important mode for degassing may be convective magmatic flow, whereby magma rises, degasses at the top of the cupola, and then descends back down through the center of the conduit. Advection through bubble-rich magmatic foam may be a critical aspect of degassing at the magma/wallrock interface. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Recent Gold Degassing and Deposition, Galeras Volcano, Colombia: </B><BR>
<I>F. E. Goff, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM and J. A. Stimac, Union Geothermal Co., Santa Rosa, CA</I></FONT><BR>
Galeras is a composite, andesitic stratovolcano that has formed during the last 0.7 Myr and has erupted frequently in the last few years. Magmatic fluids (360C in early 1993) contained significant Co2, So2, H2S, and HCl, plus ~0.04 ppm Au. Altered andesite breccia on the cone contains alunite, anhydrite, quartz, pyrite and ~2 ppm Au. Older veins within the edifice contain ores with visible electrum and sulfosalts. The hydrothermal environment surrounding the magma conduit is "high sulfidation". Assuming constant SO2 flux of 500 t/d, Galeras can emit ~0.5 kg/d Au during short-lived eruptive events. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Descriptive Exploration Model for Porphyry Gold Deposits: </B><BR>
<I>An Update from the Maricunga Belt, Northern Chile: J. L. Muntean, Stanford University, Stanford, CA</I></FONT><BR>
Maricunga porphyry gold deposits (~25-300 MT), occur in Miocene subvolcanic andesitic to dacitic intrusive centers. Pervasive propylitic alteration and banded, epithermal-like quartz veinlets that occupy radial and concentric fractures predominate at the Verde deposit at Refugio. Along a 300m vertical exposure at the Pancho deposit at Refugio, porphyry Cu-type veinlets and pervasive potassic alteration predominate at the lowest levels and are cut by banded veinlets that predominate at higher levels. The banded veinlets are cut by quartz-alunite ledges at the highest levels. At the Cavancha deposit at La Pepa, quartz veinlets and pervasive potassic alteration are cut by pyrite veins with sericitic envelopes which may be feeders to quartz-alunite-enargite-barite ledges (locally >100g/t Au) that are within 100m of Cavancha. At all of the deposits, both the porphyry Cu-type and banded quartz veinlets cut and are cut by the intrusions suggesting a genetic relationship between mineralization and intrusive activity. Zones of abundant banded veinlets generally contain 0.5-2g/t Au and <0.1% Cu (hypogene), whereas zones of abundant porphyry Cu-type veinlets contain mostly <1g/t Au and 0.1-0.4% Cu (hypogene).</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Carlin-type Gold Deposits-Products of Magmatism?: </B><BR>
<I>J. S. Cline, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, NV and A. H. Hofstra, R. O. Rye, and G. P. Landis, US Geological Survey, Denver, CO</I></FONT><BR>
Although gold production from Carlin-type deposits has made Nevada one of the world's leading gold producers, the geologic processes that generated these systems are poorly understood. To address questions concerning the source and evolution of ore fluids, the chemical and isotopic composition of fluid inclusions from the Getchell gold deposit have been examined. Microthermometric measurements and quadrupole mass spectrometer gas analyses show that ore stage fluids are H2O-dominant and contain significant CO2 and H2S. High dDH2O (250 to 297%) and d18OH2O (112 to 0%) values of ore stage fluids provide clear evidence for a deep-sourced ore fluid at Getchell that is either magmatic or metamorphic, or both.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Knowledge-based Ore Systems for Associated Manganese of South Africa: </B><BR>
<I>R. Cook and R. Cowley, Anglovaal Ltd., Johannesburg, South Africa</I></FONT><BR>
Knowledge-based applications are becoming important to Associated Manganese for efficiently dispatching ores of appropriate grades to customers on time. The G2 expert system shell has been used to develop blending and scheduling applications using a combination of object-oriented rule-based procedural and heuristic approaches. The blending application, for example, uses a heuristic approach for creating blends from over 4000 stacks of ore of various grades and sizes, to meet customer specifications while fully exploiting the available inventory. Data capture and data warehousing have become important issues, and the Internet shows strong potential for distribution of the processed information.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Multi-mineral Cutoff Grade Optimization with Option to Stockpile: </B><BR>
<I>K. Dagdelen and W. A. A. Mohammed, Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO</I></FONT><BR>
Cuttoff grade optimization is very critical to the open pit production scheduling. In case of single mineral deposits, algorithms have been developed for determining cutoff grade policy that maximizes the net present value of yearly cash flows. For determining cutoff grade policy for projects with two minerals including stockpiles the problem becomes much more complex. The purpose of this paper is to present an algorithm for the optimization of cutoff grades for two minerals that will maximize NPV subject to mining, milling, and marketing constraints with option to stockpile. Benefits of the methodology developed are demonstrated on a number of case studies coming from copper-gold deposits. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>A Comparison of Belt Loading Models and Simulated Belt Capacity: </B><BR>
<I>S. D. Thompson and X. Wang, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV</I></FONT><BR>
For underground coal mining, several discrete-event simulation models have been developed to design conveying system capacities. Most of these models require the use of a step-function approach to mimic the loading process at each conveyor loading point. Over the years, practitioners have generally employed one of three versions of the step-function approach. An important issue is how these three versions compare in terms of simulated capacity requirements. This paper addresses this issue by statistically and quantitavely comparing their simulation results. The consequences and problems associated with using each version are also discussed and summarized.

<I>J. R. Sturgul, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID; T. L. Tecsa, Technical University of Petrosani, Petrosani, Romania and W. L. Jacobsen, Kennecott Corp., Salt Lake City, UT</I></FONT><BR>
The Green's Creek Pb-Zn mine is an underground mine near Juneau, Alaska. It is proposed to drive a 3000 m incline both for existing operations and development. There will be traffic both going into the mine and coming out of this incline. It can accommodate only one way traffic. A simulation and animation model was constructed using the GPSS/H simulation language and PROOF for the animation to determine the effect of adding a long loop for empty trucks returning to the mine to avoid congestion. The whole haulage system from underground to the surface is shown in the animation. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>An Algorithm for Exact Solution to a Mesh Equation in the Hardy Cross Method for Ventilation Network Analysis: </B><BR>
<I>Y. J. Wang, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV</I></FONT><BR>
The Hardy Cross iterative method is the most popular technique for solving the ventilation network problem with natural air splitting. This method traditionally solves each mesh equation by an approximation during each iteration. It is thus interesting from both theoretical and computational viewpoints to be able to solve for an exact solution to the mesh equation. Presented in this paper is an algorithm for computing the exact solution to the mesh equation. The algorithm uses signum functions for air quantities to generate an alternative mesh equation in the form of a quadratic equation, which has two solutions defined by the well-known quadratic formula. The condition that the derivatives of the alternative and the original equations must be the same provides a basis for a proper choice of the solution.

<I>C. T. Williamson and D. S. Ramey, BHP Copper, Tucson, AZ</I></FONT><BR>
The oxide copper resource at San Manuel, Arizona has undergone in situ leaching since 1986 by BHP Copper (formerly Magma Copper). Approximately 900 injection and extraction wells are located on the benches of the successfully completed open pit mine. The current water table is over a thousand feet below the pit bottom which is at 2100 ft m.s.l. The active leach zone, therefore is a bulb of saturation suspended over the water table separated by an apparent unsaturated zone. Preferential flow conduits existing in the unsaturated zone lead to an underground collection reservoir in abandoned mine workings. A steep local fluid gradient has been induced because of leaching over the past ten years which mirrors the topography of the open pit and plays a major role in fluid flow. A firm understanding of the hydrological aspects of the system is necessary before any optimization of flow or chemistry can take place for in situ leaching. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>In Situ Leach Solution Chemistry at the San Manuel Porphyry Copper Deposit, Arizona:</B><BR>
<I>R. E. Beane and R. K. Preece, BHP Copper, Tucson, AZ</I></FONT><BR>
BHP Copper has over 10 years experience leaching copper in situ from chrysocolla at San Manuel, Arizona. Acid leach solutions contain high concentrations of magnesium aluminum and sulfate, in addition to lesser copper and iron. This brine composition demonstrates that copper is not the only element mobilized by leaching. When acid concentrations increase above a characteristic threshold, overwhelming acid consumption is by non-copper-bearing minerals. The solution composition results in stability of a suite of product minerals (chiefly sulfates), precipitation of which can inhibit copper leaching. Copper leaching is optimized when the minimum acid concentration of chrysocolla dissolution is used. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>The Minnesota Manganese Environmental Mining Project:</B><BR>
<I>S. C. Carlton, Gold & Manganese Resources Co., Emily, MN</I></FONT><BR>
One of the largest known higher grade manganese deposits in North America is located in Emily, Minnesota. Gold & Manganese Resources Company is utilizing environmental technologies to enhance and develop this well-defined deposit, and to develop, produce, and market manganese-based sorbents for desulfurization of fuel and flue gases in coal-fueled electrical generation systems, sour gas desulfurization in refinery applications, and effluent cleanup in paper mill waste. Current reserve estimates indicate that more than a billion pounds of contained manganese may be extracted utilizing in-situ techniques. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Development of In Situ Leaching of Boron:</B><BR>
<I>G. J. Hartman, Fort Cady Minerals Corp., Newberry Springs, CA</I></FONT><BR>
Fort Caddy Minerals Corp continues to develop in situ techniques for the recovery of boron. Testing was initiated in 1981 and work continues to optimize the recovery of boron from a deep seated ore body of colemanite. A small scale production facility has been constructed in southern California and has operated for approximately two years. This paper will be primarily concerned with development of the equipment and procedures used in the operation of the well field.

<I>D. A. King, C. F. Luckay and W. M. Schafer, Schafer & Assoc., Bozeman, MT</I></FONT><BR>
Monitoring devices have been installed at several mine sites to assess the potential for the development of acid rock drainage (ARD). These devices monitor temperature, oxygen, and water movement in he waste rock pile. This information can be used to evaluate the current ARD risk, the effectiveness of caps and covers, and provide information to aid in the design of other reclamation strategies that limit ARD development. The instrumentation includes nested thermisters and oxygen sensing ports, neutron access tubes, heat dissipation units (HDUs), and lysimeters. Many of the monitoring devices can be linked to a datalogger and cellular telephone connection to allow monitoring data to be download from the office. </P>

<I>A. D. Davis and C. J. Webb, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Rapid City, SD</I></FONT><BR>
The Bear Butte Creek watershed, in the northern Black Hills of South Dakota, shows the effects of past mining activities in the form of dissolved metals and arsenic in stream water. Bear Butte Creek, during normal flow periods, loses all of its discharge to sinkholes that recharge the Madison Limestone aquifer. This work focused on the geochemical fate an transport of arsenic and on understanding ground-water flow conditions in the Madison aquifer through development and a three-dimensional ground-water flow model that was coupled to a geographical information system (GIS). Stream sampling and discharge measurements helped determine sinkhole losses and loading rates. Column laboratory tests provided data on arsenic adsorption and the mixing of stream water and with aquifer water, which also was simulated with the geochemical models, pHREEQE and NETPATH. The models and GIG can be updated with new information and will be useful in managing the water quality of the Madison aquifer. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Small Scale Characterization for In Situ Leaching at the San Manuel Copper Mine: </B><BR>
<I>S. Orr and D. S. Ramey, BHP Copper, Tucson, AZ</I></FONT><BR>
As an ongoing operation, in situ leaching of copper in the San Manuel mine has moved to a phase in which changes to original well pattern are necessary to maintain high/economic copper grade in pregnant leach solution (PLS). Such changes require an investigation of preferential pathways, short circuiting, and well efficiencies. Various bore hole logging techniques are being used in San Manuel in order to understand the mechanisms that reduce leach efficiency. Previously, most attention was devoted to functional 2D sweeping of the ore. Currently, the third dimension (vertical) is equally treated, providing small scale characterization to increase sweeping. In this paper, we describe such characterization and the problems associated with it and with sweeping efficiency. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Management of Environmental Quality Data Using GIS Techniques in a General Mine Planning Framework: </B><BR>
<I>P. Croney, CGSS, Denver, CO and J. C. Herweijer, Water Management Consultants, Inc., Denver, CO</I></FONT><BR>
Environmental monitoring requires major effort and expense but management of data receives less attention. A modern database system can manage hydrochemistry, water levels, meteorology, geology and downhole geophysics data and is flexible to allow the storage of ad hoc data. Reports can be customized by the user and derived data generated from input values. The production of high quality maps with contours and hydrochemical diagrams is an essential part of the reporting process. These maps integrate directly with the current site survey information. These facilities are best provided by storing the data in an industry standard database such as Oracle or Access to which customized AutoCAD and Microsoft Office routines make direct SQL calls. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Practical Geostatistics at Newmont Gold Company: A Story of Adaptation: </B><BR>
<I>J. M. Rendu, Newmont Gold Co., Denver, CO</I></FONT><BR>
Methods used by Newmont Gold Company to model mineral deposits are presented. These methods vary depending on the geologic properties of the deposit, the economic feasibility of the project, and the availability of historical information. It is shown that understanding of the geology, knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of the various modeling techniques, and flexibility in choosing the appropriate method are critical to successful modeling. Each major deposit is discussed separately. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Some Methods of Producing Interval Estimates for Global and Local Resources: </B><BR>
<I>B. M. Davis, Littleton, CO</I></FONT><BR>
The problem of assessing uncertainty in grade estimates has been a topic of research and debate since kriging was first introduced. Use of the kriging variance was originally touted as all that was necessary in order to produce confidence limits for grade estimates. Since then the prudence of using kriging variance for local confidence interval estimation has been questioned, and techniques such as the jackknife and conditional simulation have been proposed to develop better interval estimates. This paper compares interval estimates produced by the three methods and draws conclusions about the performance of these methods. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>How to Use Conditional Simulation for Determining Volume Variance Relationship in Recoverable Reserve Estimation:</B><BR>
<I>K. Dagdelen, Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO and G. Verly, Placer Dome Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada</I></FONT><BR>
Accurate prediction of recoverable reserves in open pit mining relies heavily on determining how the distribution of grades change as we go from point support to the selective mining unit (SMU) support. The affine correction and direct log-normal correction are two traditional techniques that allow us to do change of support on the local grade distributions. These two techniques are also very sensitive to determining the appropriate variance reductions that will take place as the SMU size increases. The geostatistical conditional simulation has become an important tool in estimating recoverable reserves that are a function of SMU size. This paper will demonstrate how conditional simulation can be used directly for estimating recoverable reserves as well as how it can be used to determine variance reduction factors in various parts of the deposit. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Conditional Bias and Smoothing Effect in Kriging: </B><BR>
<I>G. Pan, Independence Mining Co., Englewood, CO</I></FONT><BR>
Conditional bias tends to overestimate high grades and underestimate low grades, which distorts the tonnage - grade curves. Smoothing effects, however, are referred to as the opposite effect, i.e., kriging tends to underestimate high grades and overestimate low grades, which also causes incorrect tonnage - grade relations. Both effects lead to biased estimates of recoverable reserves. Based on a "ground true" blast hole data set, conditional simulation is used to generate reference estimates from which conditional bias and smoothing effect are related. Solutions are finally highlighted. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Multi-mineral Recoverable Reserve Estimation and Whittle Pit Optimization: </B><BR>
<I>S. Zhang, Echo Bay Minerals, Battle Mountain, NV</I></FONT><BR>
Recoverable reserves are defined as the estimated tons and grade that can be recovered by a mining operation at a given economic cutoff. The accuracy of grade estimation is important to minimize the over and under estimation of contained metal. The tonnage distribution at different economic cutoffs is also equally important for a mining company, since mine design and ore processing capacity, such as mill throughput or leach pad capacity, depend on the grade-tonnage distribution. Open pit optimization and mine planning should be based on the recoverable reserves which will reflect what should be recovered and processed in both grade and tons.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>From Surface to Underground: Carlin East: </B><BR>
<I>J. M. Driscoll, Newmont Gold Co., Carlin, NV</I></FONT><BR>
After 30 years of success, Newmont Gold Co has temporarily ceased production from its Carlin Pit. In late 1993, the Carlin East Decline was driven and an extensive underground exploration program was started. Today, Newmont Gold produces refractory ore from the Carlin East underground at the rate of 700 t/d (770 stpd) for an annual ounce production of over 100,000 ounces. Over 70 underground miners enjoy the 6-8 year mine life at Carlin East. About 70% of the ore mined at Carlin East is accomplished by mechanized longhole stoping with cemented backfill. The remaining ore is mined by underhand drift and cemented fill methods. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Mining at the Getchell Property: </B><BR>
<I>R. D. Russel, T. R. Harter, and R. M. Barker Getchell Gold, Golconda, NV</I></FONT><BR>
The historic Getchell property is currently being mined from the Getchell Main Underground workings (1.3 million oz.), a footwall extension of the Getchell open pit deposits along the Getchell fault. Drift-and-fill techniques are used to extract the ore via ramp access. The adjacent Turquoise Ridge deposit (1.4 million oz.) is currently under development via two vertical shafts. Together, the two mines will continues to provide feed to the Getchell's 3,200 t/d autoclave mill, taking Getchell Gold from its current production rate of 200,000 oz. per annum, to over 400,000 oz. per annum by 1999.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Jerritt Canyon's Transition to Underground Mining: </B><BR>
<I>W. W. Bristol, Independence Mining Co., Elko, NV</I></FONT><BR>
Since its discovery, the Jerritt Canyon Mine, located 50 miles north of Elko, Nevada, a joint venture between Independence Mining Company Inc. (70%) and FMC Gold Company (30%), refractory gold ore has predominantly been mined by conventional open pit methods. Since the early 1990's, the discovery of deeper ores has required the joint venture to develop and mine a significant portion of the 325,000 troy ounce annual production utilizing underground mining methods. The recently developed Murray and West Generator underground mines now produce 120,000-140,000 ounces annually. Two additional underground projects are also being concurrently developed by IMCI. This paper documents the major transition/redevelopment of the Jerritt Canyon mining methods. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Design and Development of the Meikle Mine: </B><BR>
<I>R. D. Pye and J. W. Breen, Barrick Goldstrick Mines Inc., Elko, NV</I></FONT><BR>
The Meikle Mine, the first shaft accessed underground mine on the Carlin Trend and destined to become the largest underground gold producer in the United States, presented a number of interesting challenges in its design and development. The design of the mine and its associated infrastructure is described together with a review of the mine development program leading to full production status.

<I>B. Schimm, Wirtgen GmbH, Windhagen, Germany</I></FONT><BR>
Improve the mine's productivity by simplifying the mining process, for these tasks the Wirtgen Surface Miner offers an attractive alternative. Surface Miners cut, crush and load material in one operation with only one machine. The cutting depth is controlled exactly. This allows: Selective mining of different material qualities, mining without blasting, production of small particle sizes, preparation of level and stable surfaces, walls and haulroads. The result: Less investment, less production costs, low noise and dust, no vibrations, high systems availability, simple mine and operation planning and coordination, less labor for operation and maintenance and less spare parts.

<I>R. R. Allum, BHP Copper, San Manuel, AZ</I></FONT><BR>
The application of high speed tunneling in a deep underground copper mine was essential for the Lower Kalamazoo expansion project at BHP Copper's San Manuel Mine. At stake was the future of over 1,300 employees at one of the largest producing block caving copper mines in the world. This paper examines the details required to assemble, deploy and operate a 4.62 meter open main beam tunnel boring machine (TBM) in a 1048 meter deep operating mine accessible only by shaft. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Selection, Design Optimization and Performance Prediction of Tunnel Boring Machines: </B><BR>
<I>L. Ozdemir and J. Rostami, Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO</I></FONT><BR>
Tunnel Boring Machines (TBM's) are finding increasing use in underground mine development due to the potential benefits they offer in terms of higher production rates, reduced ground support and ventilation requirements and lower excavation costs. As with any mechanical tunneling project, the successful application of TBM technology to mining lies in the selection of the most suitable equipment and cutting tool for the rock and ground conditions to be encountered. Once a decision is made on the type of machine, the next step is to optimize its design to achieve the highest advance rates feasible. This paper will present and discuss the process of conducting site investigations, laboratory testing, machine selection, design optimization and performance/cost estimation for TBM use in mine development.

<I>S. M. Hodgson, Wester Ag-Minerals, Carlsbad, NM</I></FONT><BR>
A comprehensive feasibility study began by asking: Why wouldn't a mechanical mining machine cut potash. Six years later a continuous miner has doubled the tons per man-shift at the Nash Draw Mine. The program: Considered all continuous miners, roadheaders, and borers. Visited mines experienced in mechanical mining. Evaluated machine cutterhead layout, power, and RPM. Contacted manufacturers for specifications and innovative risk sharing. Determined torque and power requirements using large rock block cutting tests. The program indicated a potash miner with high torque, and weighing at least 50 tons. The new 90 ton machine mines an 8 by 32 foot 11-entry production panel for 132 feet before roof bolting. The financial package shares both ownership (price in cost per ton) and maintenance.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>A Study-BHP Robinson and BHP Tintaya: </B><BR>
<I>K. L. Browne II, BHP Nevada Mining, Co., Ruth, NV</I></FONT><BR>
After a decade of high copper prices, major mining companies are renewing their interest in purchasing operating properties and/or development of ore bodies. An existing operation carries with it a history that can present unique opportunities, while a greenfield operation allows for the establishment of a defined culture. Capital investments are distinctly different. A comparison of BHP Copper Robinson Operation, a greenfield property, and BHP Copper Tintaya Operation, a government-owned Peruvian property, will provide insights into mining, concentrating and cultural differences between North and South American operations.

<I>A. H. Summers, Minera Hecla, S. A. de C. V., Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico</I></FONT><BR>
La Choya is located 55 km south of Sonoyta in northwestern Sonora. Hecla Mining Co. purchased the concessions in May 1992 and designed and constructed the mine which started production in January 1994. Mineralization is controlled by a low angle thrust fault-which created a permeable host for the metal bearing hydrothermal solutions. Open pit-heap leaching methods are used to recover gold and silver from low grade ore. Approximately 9 tons of gold will be recovered over the four year productive life of the mine which was the second largest gold producer in Mexico during 1995 and 1996. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>The Candelaria Copper-gold Mine, Chile: </B><BR>
<I>P. J. Ryan and J. L. Madson, Phelps Dodge Corp., Phoenix, AZ</I></FONT><BR>
The Candelaria copper-gold mine is located 20 kilometers to the south of the town of Capiop in Northern Chile, Phelps Dodge owns 80 percent of the mine and the remaining 20 percent is owned by the Sumitomo group of companies. The deposit was discovered by Phelps Dodge in 1987 and minable reserves extractable by open-pit methods have been estimated at 366 million tons averaging 1.09 percent copper and 0.26 grams of gold per ton. A detailed feasibility study, dated March 1991 demonstrated the economic viability of the project and construction and development commenced on October 1, 1992. By September 1994, the first concentrate was produced about four months ahead of schedule and within the approved budget of $570 million. During 1995, the first full year of production, Candelaria produced 521,478 tonnes of concentrate containing 150,340 tons of salable copper and 97,796 ounces of gold. The unit cash cost of production for 1995 was less than $0.50 per pound of copper making Candelaria one of the low cost copper producers in the world. Taking into account the large ore reserves, Phelps Dodge is currently doubling the milling rate to 20 million tons per year. The Candelaria copper-gold mine is the largest and most successful project ever undertaken by Phelps-Dodge outside the United States. Details of the geology, ore reserve estimates, mine planning and operating procedures, metallurgical process development and operations and the port facilities are discussed. In addition, the development of power, water, roads and housing are covered. Permitting and environmental requirements for the project and the financing arrangements are also discussed. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Minera Candelaria: A Retrospective View: </B><BR>
<I>W. F. Baker, Phelps Dodge Mining Co., Tierra Amarilla, Chile</I></FONT><BR>
Minera Candelaria represents the first greenfield venture by Phelps Dodge Mining Company in South America. Although a resounding success, the project in retrospect presents an opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of our U.S. based philosophy as it has been applied in this new geographic arena. This paper will review the brief history of the project with emphasis placed on lessons learned during the development, construction and initial operation of the facility as well as a current look at Candeleria. In conclusion, a quick glimpse into the future of Phelps Dodge's newest world-class mining operation will be presented. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Kubaka, The Arctic Mining Challenge in Far East Russia: </B><BR>
<I>T. L. Owen, Cyprus Amax, Englewood, CO</I></FONT><BR>
Not since 1917 has a foreign company developed a stand-alone, grass roots gold mine in Russia. With Russia's political change, in the late 1980's development of mineral prospects once again beckons foreign investors. In 1991 Cyprus Amax began aggressively searching for such an opportunity. Early in 1997, production will commence at the Kubaka gold project located in Far Eastern Russia, near the Arctic Circle. The Kubaka proj-ect is a 1,750 ton-per-day open pit operation that will produce over 300,000 ounces of gold per year. This paper will focus on the challenges of locating such a prospect, doing business in Russia, developing supply lines, identifying workforce capabilities, gaining government approvals, secure financing, arrange for gold sales and ultimately building the facility in this arctic region.

<I>R. Quesnel, L. Chenad, and D. Janoien, La Mine Doyon, Quebec, PQ, Canada, and P. Stgeonges, ICI Explosives, Quebec, PQ, Canada</I></FONT><BR>
In order to increase shareholders value, Barrick Gold Corporation has embarked, beginning January 1996, on a 3-year 10% cost reduction program. At La Mine Doyon, we believe that this can be achieved mainly through our Dilution Control Program. Multiple task team, comprising of geologists, engineers, key underground personnel and explosives consultants are auditing and reviewing all phases of mining. Innovative techniques and structures are being implemented and management is committed in supporting and supplying the required tools. This paper outlines what has been accomplished and where La Mine Doyon is headed.

<I>P. Moser, Montan University, Leoben, Austria</I></FONT><BR>
As a contribution to an improved primary development design procedure beyond the already existing studies a study for the identification and quantification of the influence of parameters on primary development based on operational data from working mining operations has been completed. For that purpose a worldwide analysis of the design of the primary access of about 200 underground hardrock mining operations in industrialized countries was completed. Based upon the mine data collected a sequenced decision model has been developed, that enables us to develop an initial concept for the design of the accesses from the surface based upon a few critical parameters. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>The Effects and Control of Overbreak in Underground Mining:</B><BR>
<I>G. F. Revey, GEOTEK & Assoc., Inc., Highlands Ranch, CO</I></FONT><BR>
All underground operations have limiting factors that influence their overall profitability. Hoisting, hauling, available headings, labor, milling capacity and other factors limit how much material can be removed from an underground mine. Consequently, when limited labor is used to handle additional rock from overbreak and perform extra ground support tasks, productive activity is replaced by non-productive work. This paper reviews the effects of overbreak on mining costs, and presents a quality improvement approach that has been successfully used to significantly reduce overbreak at several large underground metal mines.

<I>A. D. Davis, C. J. Webb and C. J. Paterson, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Rapid City, SD</I></FONT><BR>
This work focused on identifying, examining, and ranking the physical and environmental hazards at inactive and abandoned mine sites in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Earlier inventory projects in the Black Hills concentrated on federal lands, while more recent efforts have examined abandoned mines on state and private lands after passage of legislation by the State of South Dakota requiring a comprehensive inventory. The inventory information provides criteria for identifying those sites that require further investigation through characterization of the physical safety or environmental hazards. For most AML sites in the Black Hills, locational information is all that is typically needed because the majority of sites pose little environmental or physical hazard. This comprehensive inventory of abandoned mines in the Black Hills included the identification and ranking of hazards, and provided information on the extent of potential water contamination as well as remediation strategies. The inventory also resulted in the linking of previous information sources such as the US Bureau of Mines, US Geological Survey, and US Forest Service databases.</P>

<I>C. J Webb, A. D Davis, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Rapid City, SD and T. V. Durkin, SD Dept. of Environment and Natural Resources</I></FONT><BR>
This project took a watershed approach in the evaluation of water-quality impacts from past mining activities and current restoration projects in the Bear Butte Creek basin, a small and well defined drainage in a heavily mineralized area of the northern Black Hills. The basin contains numerous inactive and abandoned mines as well as a currently active heap-leach surface gold mine. Bear Butte Creek normally loses all of its discharge to sinkholes in the Madison Limestone aquifer and thus can affect the water quality of this regionally important water resource. Water-quality data were analyzed, stream surveys were conducted, and two abandoned mine restoration projects were monitored to evaluate the effectiveness of the watershed approach and to identify practical remediation techniques that could be applied to other watersheds. A geographic information system (GIS) was developed to organize information on stream quality, abandoned mine locations, and other geologic and hydrologic data. The watershed approach toward assessing and reclaiming abandoned mines appears to be effective when compared to a point-source approach that might  improve water quality at specific sites but not result in significant overall improvement to the watershed because of adjacent sources. </P>

<I>M. E. Orman and K. R. Criley, Vector Engineering, Inc., Grass Valley, CA</I></FONT><BR>
Many factors must be considered when designing a heap leach pad. Geotechnical properties of the ore can and will affect how well an ore leaches, the solution recovery, stability of the heap, and ore settlement. As a heap is stacked, some of these properties will change due to the increased load. In order to properly design a heap, these properties should be determined beforehand, so that the heap performs as intended. As a heap is stacked, stresses in the lower portion of the heap increase and cause a reduction in ore porosity and permeability. This paper presents a test method which has been successfully used to estimate ore permeability and deformation under simulated heap loading conditions. Once these factors are determined, the heap drainage system can be properly designed and the appropriate rates can be selected. </P>

<I>M. E. Smith, Vector Engineering, Inc., Grass Valley, CA and K. Crompton, Vector Chile Ltd., Santiago, Chile</I></FONT><BR>
Leach pad liner system selection practice ranges from "we've used it before" to exhaustive considerations of all possible combinations of foundation soils, geosynthetics, and cover materials. On one end of the spectrum engineering judgement is the only tool used and on the other the analytical tools often out-gun the quantifiable factors. The authors present a rational design method, applicable to any liner project but specifically developed for heap leaching, which balances the needs for a simplified approach with the engineering appropriate for the investment represented. Illustrative case histories are also presented. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Designing Leach Pad Liners for Differential Settlement:</B><BR>
<I>T. V. Ramey, M. E. Orman and M. E. Smith, Vector Engineering, Inc., Grass Valley, CA</I></FONT><BR>
Heap leaching brings unique design problems in the form of possible large differential settlements of the foundation soils due to the dissolution of salts. Soils often contain very high concentrations of soluble salts (nitrates, potassium, magnesium, and common sodium). Leaking solution can dissolve these salts and trigger settlement. If the differential settlement is great enough, the geomembrane tears, the leakage increases, triggering more settlement. The authors present a simplified technique to quantify the differential settlement resulting from dissolution of salts and present a method to select a geomembrane which provides suitable flexibility to tolerate the predicted settlement. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>On/Off Leach Pads: Special Liner Design Requirements:</B><BR>
<I>M. E. Smith, Vector Engineering, Inc. Grass Valley, CA</I></FONT><BR>
On/off leach pads have traditionally been constructed of asphalt. But geomembranes have become increasingly popular substitutes for a number of reasons, including cost and reliability. Geomembranes for on/off leach pads require special design considerations to withstand the large, repetitive loading. Combinations of bedding, geomembrane selection and protective cover design can be optimized for cost and performance. Design techniques, common trade-offs and examples are presented. </P>

<I>D. A. R. Taylor, Bat Conservation International, Inc., Austin, TX</I></FONT><BR>
Inactive underground mines provide essential habitat for a majority of North America's largest remaining bat populations. These bats are primary predators of insects that cost American farmers and foresters billions of dollars annually. Mine closures without checking for bats could endanger even currently abundant species. Fortunately, cost-effective closure methods exist that can protect both bats and humans, and new habitat can be created during mining, preventing future endangered listings. BCI and the BLM founded the Bats and Mines Project to provide coordination and leadership among public and private agencies and the mining industry to minimize the loss of bats living in mines. </P>

<I>K. Whiting and R. L. Olsen, Camp Dresser & McKee, Inc., Denver, CO</I></FONT><BR>
Elevated concentrations of copper, cobalt, and arsenic within the Panther Creek Basin sediments in north central Idaho prompted an evaluation of the sources of the metals. Potential tailings and wasterock source samples collected at the head of Blackbird Creek were compared to sediment samples in the Panther Creek Basin using electron microprobe techniques. The mineral types, degree of alteration, and the morphology of the metal-bearing sediment grains within Blackbird and Panther Creeks were found to closely resemble the tailings material, suggesting the copper, cobalt and arsenic concentrations in the basin were derived principally from the tailings impoundment. </P>

<I>W. G. Pariseau and S. C. Schmelter, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT</I></FONT><BR>
The well-known destabilizing effect of water pressure on rock mass stability is examined quantitavely by the finite element method. A coupled code that accounts for the simultaneous effects of rock mass deformation and fluid flow is used for this purpose. Equivalent elastic moduli, strengths and hydraulic conductivities are composited from laboratory test data and joint set map data using a non-representative volume element (NRVE) procedure. Of concern is the Mandel-Cryer effect of transitory but elevated water pressure following a cut, a phenomenon not taken into account by simple before and after equilibrium analysis. </P>

<I>K. Fuenkajorn, Rock Engineering Int'l., Tucson, AZ and J. C. Stormont, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM</I></FONT><BR>
This paper presents an overview of sealing methods for mine openings, with an emphasis on geomechanics and goehydrological performance of the emplaced seals. Discussions include design considerations and criteria, material selection, placement methods, and current regulations and practices. The site conditions that may impact the seal performance are addressed, including geological and hydrological considerations, borehole conditions, fluid pressures, geochemistry, in situ stresses, temperature, and impact from nearby activities. General design criteria are provided. The recommendations are based on the results of laboratory and in situ experiments conducted as part of research effort on nuclear waste repositories. </P>

<I>L. A. Panek, Denver, CO</I></FONT><BR>
This mathematical model of pillar compressive strength was developed by interpreting numerous published tests performed under laboratory conditions, to eliminate poorly controlled end effects as a source of data variability. Log strength was show to be a bilinear function of c (itself and function of size and aspect ratio), with small slope for small width/thickness and much greater slope for large W/D, thus providing a straightforward basis for accurately computing the strength of typical, wide mine pillars. The present paper extends the model to include end effects, which depend on sliding friction, internal friction, prism/platen deformability and bond, and lateral earth pressure.</P>

<I>D-W Park and D. Deb, The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL</I></FONT><BR>
Longwall mining is considered as the most effective underground coal mining technique in terms of coal extraction ration, productivity, and safety. But roof falls, excessive face convergence, shield damage, and other maintenance problems cause interruptions of coal production and safety hazards. The University of Alabama has been developing software called Longwall Strata Control and Maintenance System (LoSCoMS), which integrates real-time shield monitoring, data presentation, analysis, forecasting, and warning modules. The main objectives of this system is to provide information on excessive load, inadequate setting load, leg leakage, etc., and to synthesize mining and geological parameters to determine past and present ground behavior and forecast loading patterns for the mining cycles, next periodic weighting, etc. Using this unique system, mine personnel can learn past and present roof loading patterns, and predict future loading trends at a longwall face, thus proper safety measures can be taken ahead of time. </P>

<I>M. G. Karfakis and S. W. Kan, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA and R. Wilson and J. Zelanko, Sandvik Rock Tools, Bristol, VA</I></FONT><BR>
Chemical grouting is often used as a remedial measure when the implemented ground control program is unable to completely prevent structural failures or when there is a need for preventing a structural member from unraveling. The polyurethane grout, which is currently being used, has a limited range of mechanical properties that restrict its utilization. Polyurethane grout cannot be used for applications where reinforcement and strengthening, together with deformability, is desired. The strength and deformability of chemical grout must be compatible with the intended purpose of grouting and the expected deformation of the rock that is to be grouted. To overcome these limitations, research has been conducted on a newly developed polyester based grout. The newly developed polyester grout, depending on its formulation, is flexible enough to have a wide range of mechanical properties. The assessment of mechanical properties of polyester grout is the focus of this work. Field experiences and laboratory research have defined the properties of an effective grouting material. Experimental results indicate that the polyester grout meets or exceeds these recommended properties and has the potential to expand the applicability of chemical grouting in ground control. By adjusting its formulations, mechanical properties of polyester grout can be engineered to solve specific ground control problems. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Design and Evaluation of Entry System Stability by Using Reliability Theory: </B><BR>
<I>V. Z. Sun and S. S. Peng, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV</I></FONT><BR>
One of the major concerns of ground control in a coal mine is safety against failure in the mine entry system (i.e. roof-pillar-floor). In order to better design and evaluate stability of the entry system with a certain confidence, a reliability approach is introduced rather than using the conventional factor of safety (CFS) only. Since the reliability approach can take variability of both rock properties and stress distribution into consideration, it is anticipated that, by using this approach, the current state-of-the-art-based ground control design in coal mines will convey a better sense of confidence. The results of this study show a significant influence on the current design concept and evaluation of entry system stability. </P>

<I>J. T. Crawford, Behre Dolbear & Co., Inc. Gainesville, FL</I></FONT><BR>
A comprehensive strategic planning model has been developed for the phosphate strip mining and chemical operations at White Springs, Florida. The computerized model covers ore body modeling, production simulation and financial analysis. Several innovative features in the model include using NPV techniques in ore body block economics, adapting the floating cone method to a floating template for generating dragline mining units automatically, using interactive graphics for designing mining units, and a dragline move economics algorithm for automatic scheduling of mining unit assignments and moves. Simulation of chemical plant production uses linear programming and concentrate inventory levels control mine operating schedules.

<I>D. Greene, Caterpillar, Concord, CA</I></FONT><BR>
The paper will summarize Caterpillar's products and experience using Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) monitoring and information systems for mining machines. The paper will include overviews on the background, development, and field application of systems which allow digital mine design plans to be used directly on-board various mining machines in real-time via moving map displays. These systems help eliminate many time consuming error-prone survey operations and paper maps. In addition, the systems help eliminate many excavation errors, ranging from incorrect haul ramp slopes to bench over/under-excavation and mis-excavation of ore vs. waste. The paper will close with a look at the significant management advantages gained from use of a real-time database of as-mined and as-built information, which is automatically created as the machines are operated.

<I>A. J. Basu and S. Belohlawek, Western Australia School of Mines, Kalgoorlie, WA, Australia and B. McFadzean, Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines, Kalgoorlie, WA, Australia</I></FONT><BR>
Computer-assisted mine planning and design applications are routinely used by many Australian mining companies. However, the design process requires human expertise to recognize and evaluate the potential pitfalls. This paper introduces the application of a commercial optimization software (WHITTLE 4D) for strategic planning of an open pit mine in Western Australia. The authors present their experience in intelligent application of the optimization program while incorporating many technical and nontechnical obstacles. It is expected that this paper will provide some guidelines on how to apply the optimization software without losing sight of practicalities. Moreover, this paper also shows how to build project evaluation guidelines for nonexperts.

<I>S. A. Jeric, Phelps Dodge, Morenci, AZ and M. J. Hrebar, Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO</I></FONT><BR>
In-pit crushing and conveying of ore and waste has been utilized in the mining industry for many years. In recent years, innovations in crushing, conveying, and particularly heap leach and waste stacking technology, have sparked a renewed interest in continuous haulage systems for large scale open pit applications. This paper examines current operations that are using large scale continuous haulage systems. A review of the advantages/disadvantages and operating techniques of crushers, feeders, conveyors, and stacking systems currently available is made. Finally, a case study is presented that evaluates the application of a continuous waste haulage system in a large open pit mine in the Western United States. The case study includes an economic comparison with the existing truck haulage system.

<I>J. Luo, C. Haycocks and M. Karmis, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA</I></FONT><BR>
A major design problem for upper seam longwall gateroads is to predict the effect of stress transferred from lower seam mines on operating stability. Case study data were analyzed to develop empirical stress transfer relationships between seams for both longwall and room-and-pillar mines. Analysis showed vertical movement in the upper seam and roof CMRR to be controlling factors in damage prediction and therefore gateroad planning and design. Results from selected case studies were correlated with upper seam stress predictions calculated by LAMODEL for additional planning opportunities. </P>

<I>K. Biswas and S. S. Peng, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV</I></FONT><BR>
Pillar stability long after mining can be attributed to the weathering action in presence of mine moisture. From the field observations, it has been found that this phenomenon becomes more critical in case the coal seam contains a parting or binder in it. The weathering action degrades both the coal and parting in terms of their load-bearing capacity as the mine moisture penetrates into the pillar and it has been found that the deterioration is more severe in parting as it converts to clay-like material when exposed to moisture for a long period of time. The expansion of weathering zone in either coal or parting is a time dependent phenomenon as the moisture gradually penetrates into the pillar. This paper investigates the effect of weathering action on coal and parting in laboratory and in field. Also an attempt has been done to establish formulae for time dependent strength of coal and parting. </P>

<I>D-W Park and D. Deb, The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL</I></FONT><BR>
Longwall Strata Control and Maintenance System (LoSCoMS) is a computer software developed to monitor, analyze, and forecast longwall ground control problems in real-time. Recently, this system has been installed in Shoal Creek Mine, Alabama. This system is designed for monitoring pressure data from all the shields at regular intervals and storing them in the hard disk of the surface computer in real-time. Using LoSCoMS, hourly reports of maintenance problems such as high load, inadequate settings, leakage of hydraulic systems, etc., can be generated along with shields locations. Presentation of past and present data, analysis of mining cycles and subsequent forecasting of next mining cycles and periodic weighting location are generated to facilitate everyday operation. Moreover, the surface computer is connected with Drummond's internal networking system, thus, any terminal equipped with LoSCoMS software can access the remote data files and perform the analysis in near real-time. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Numerical Simulation of Rock Strength Testing: </B><BR>
<I>A. J. Basu and M. Kuruppu, Western Australian School of Mines, Kalgoorlie, WA, Australia</I></FONT><BR>
Rock mass properties testing for determining strength parameters is an integral part of geomechanics. These tests are performed either in a laboratory environment or in a field (in situ). The authors share their experience in using numerical modelling in simulating the laboratory test procedures. This approach helps studying the rock breakage and failure mechanism more efficiently and provides a high degree of visualization. Moreover, imperfections and discontinuities can be easily incorporated in these models. This capability of providing arbitrary fractures and discontinuities facilitates in building a large knowledgebase of rock strength and failure mechanisms. This knowledgebase may then be used to generate heuristics for determining rock strengths for rock mass with fractures and discontinuities. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Back-analysis of Stresses Associated with Longwall Face Bursts at the Deer Creek Mine, Energy West Mining Company, Utah: </B><BR>
<I>J. F. T. Agapito, R. R. Goodrich and M. Moon, Agapito Assoc., Inc., Grand Junction, CO</I></FONT><BR>
Experience at Energy West Mines in the Wasatch Plateau Coal Field, Utah has shown that longwall face bursts occur mostly near the tailgate when extracting the third adjacent longwall in a panel section where depths exceed 2000 ft. It is believed that this is due to a combination of cover depth and side abutment stresses created by the widening of a pressure arch formed by interlocking and bridging of large blocks of very competent strata. The 200-ft-thick Castle-gate Sandstone probably plays a key role in pressure arching. This paper presents a back-analysis of the location and magnitude of the stresses associated with face bursts that occurred when mining the 7th Right Longwall at the Deer Creek Mine. Improvement of these conditions may be achieved by widening the longwalls to achieve critical subsidence width sooner while mining the second longwall, and to reduce the stresses at the face. Wider longwall faces, however, increase the change of sandstone channel interception often associated with bursts. Satisfactory mitigation of face bursts beyond cover depths of 2000 ft to 2200 ft may be difficult without using destressing techniques. Development and testing of hydraulic fracturing/liquid infusion technique is recommended. </P>

Some unresolved questions from previous investigations into the physical and numerical modeling of the block caving mining method (McNearny and Abel, 1993), are investigated and reported in this paper. The previous work investigated both the physical and numerical modeling of the effects of drawpoint spacing, undercut thickness, and the rate of draw. Specifically, the questions raised by the prior investigation include (1) unequal draw rates and its effect on dilution, (2) planes of weakness within and along the boundary of the model, and (3) the progression of deformations into the undisturbed rock mass prior to cave development. </P>

<I>G. Chen, BHP Copper, Florence, AZ and S. Orr and D. S. Ramey, BHP Copper, Tucson, AZ</I></FONT><BR>
A feasibility study of in situ leach mining at Florence, Arizona is being conducted by BHP Copper. The hydrogeologic characterization covers large (regional) scale pumping tests, intermediate scale pumping tests, and small scale tests along boreholes. The initial findings indicate that the site is sufficiently permeable for in situ leaching and behaves like a porous medium at these scales. The vertical distribution of hydraulic conductivity, fracture distribution and mineralization are investigated. Parameters determined in this characterization are being used in numerical simulations of leaching processes and optimization of the mine design.

<I>C. K. Hoag and J. M. Sguin, BHP Copper, Florence, AZ</I></FONT><BR>
BHP Copper has developed a method to study fracture intensity, mineralogy, and orientations to optimize structure-mineralogy data gathered on buried, in situ copper oxide leach targets. This new method utilizes an acoustic borehole televiewer logging tool to determine structure orientations for fracture and fault planes, in conjunction with detailed fracture and mineralogy data collected from drill core. The downhole distribution, as well as the preferred orientations, of common ore and gangue minerals are determined. Overall structure-mineralogy trends are identified, which contribute to the geologic and hydrologic model, as well as influence wellfield design and extraction methods.

<I>T. L. Carstensen and M. P. Neira, BHP Copper, Tucson, AZ</I></FONT><BR>
The Miami in situ mine of BHP Copper is located in Globe-Miami, Arizona. The mine leaches mineralized leach capping over a supergene enriched sulfide deposit, and has produced over 500 million lbs. of copper during the last 50 years. The Miami unit has identified several opportunities to enhance and expand in situ production. A computer block model consisting of strict geologic controls, mineralogy, and metallurgical data, was developed to assist in the determination of the leachable copper resource. An understanding of the accessibility and solubility of the resource to leaching solutions, and the integration of hydrogeologic and hydrometallurgical information was necessary for completion of this project. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Numerical Simulation of In Situ Leaching and Metal Attenuation:</B><BR>
<I>A. Getahun, Brown and Caldwell, Phoenix, AZ</I></FONT><BR>
Numerical modeling has been used to simulate a near-surface in situ leaching of oxide-copper minerals using acid sulfate solution. Several types of reactions expected to occur during leaching are evaluated by a series of calculations at 25C: 1) reaction of acid-sulfate  solution with ore-bearing silicate rock, 2) reaction of metal-rich acid-sulfate solution with carbonate rock, minerals, and carbonate cemented alluvial material, 3) reaction of metal-rich acid-sulfate solution with lime, and 4) mixing of metal-bearing acid-sulfate solution with groundwater. The results demonstrate the importance of 1) host rock composition, 2) type of copper-bearing minerals, 3) pH of the solution during reaction, and 4) the water/rock ratio. Such simulation results provide a systematic evaluation of the chemical and hydrologic conditions that are tied to in situ leaching and help to focus toward appropriate production and environmental questions. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Numerical Simulation of Hydraulic Control for In Situ Mining:</B><BR>
<I>J. M. Oliver and F. Sirjani, Brown and Caldwell, Phoenix, AZ and The BHP Copper Group, Tucson, AZ</I></FONT><BR>
An analysis was conducted of multidimensional groundwater flow and solute transport for a proposed in situ copper mine in Florence, Arizona. The two key features evaluated in the mathematical simulations were: (1) hydraulic control of mine solutions within an active mine block; and (2) potential effects of the mining operations on the regional aquifer system. A representative mine block was modeled with injection and recovery wells simultaneously pumping in a repeating 5-spot well pattern. Results of the modeling illustrated that hydraulic control of the mine solutions within the simulated mine block could be achieved over a wide range of hydrogeologic scenarios.

Geology I-Geologic Factors that Influence the Economic Viability of Mineral Deposits

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Turning Discoveries into Mines-What's Required from the Geologist?:</B><BR>
<I>P. G. Monzon, Eldorado, Tucson, AZ</I></FONT><BR>
A producing mine has to meet technical as well as economic constraints in order to operate profitably. Among some of the technical parameters are the geological features that each deposit has. The shape and the depth of the orebody as well as the grade and type of mineralization will determine the mining method to be used. Information on the structural geology, lithology, alteration and type of mineralization will help to determine the metallurgical process and the slope design. The information provided by the geologist is of utmost importance in turning discoveries into mines. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Utilization of Geologic Information in Computer Block Models:</B><BR>
<I>J. A. Waegli, Phelps Dodge Exploration Corp., Lakewood, CO</I></FONT><BR>
Key geologic features of a mineral deposit are modeled to control grade interpolation, and to quantify other parameters which affect the economic viability of a deposit. Although numerous papers discuss grade interpolation aspects of geologic modeling, the impacts of lithology, mineralogy, alteration, and structure on mining and mineral processing are often not considered, and therefore not modeled. Three examples of geologic modeling are presented: modeling recoveries and acid consumption in a copper leach project, modeling milling and leaching characteristics at a combination concentrator SX/EW operation, and modeling RQD for slope optimization. Careful collection of these kinds of information during the exploration and development phases of a project is critical in forming a solid foundation for feasibility-stage models, and will avoid the considerable time and expense involved in relogging drill holes months or even years later. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Process Development for Exploration Projects:</B><BR>
<I>J. T. Hanks, Phelps Dodge Exploration Corp., Phoenix, AZ</I></FONT><BR>
Process development is one of the principal tasks required in the course of turning an exploration discovery into a mine. Exploration geologists should have an understanding of the more important metallurgical processes and the test work required for each process. The paper discusses the important metallurgical processes, the test work and sample requirements for each, and the costs and time requirements to accomplish the testing. The limitations of reverse circulation drill samples for metallurgical testing are discussed. The level of process definition required to support engineering studies: scoping, prefeasibility and feasibility studies is also described. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Practical Geotechnical Drill Core Data Collection Requirements for an Underground Mine:</B><BR>
<I>L. A. Sandbak, BHP Copper, San Manuel, AZ</I></FONT><BR>
The purpose of collecting rock mechanics data from drill core is the eventual use in operations, planning, or characterization work. Information gathered must be quantitative and repeatable. Fracture frequency and rock block sizes are commonly overlooked in most rock classification methods. Data for the Kalamazoo porphyry copper deposit feasibility study included geology, alteration, and rock mass characterization. The primary benefit of adequate data retrieval is prediction. Additional drift mapping is compared to drill hole data for subsequent refinement and correlation, and to determine what data is most useful.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Considerations in Business Negotiations for Exploration Projects:</B><BR>
<I>R. W. Schafer, Kinross Gold Corp., Toronto, ON, Canada and J. Tarazoff, BHP Minerals, San Francisco, CA</I></FONT><BR>
Among the technical aspects of a mining venture that determines whether a mining venture is successful or not, one of the most important, but least acknowledged, is the property agreement with the underlying owner. In the case of public lands, the administrator is defined (BLM or NFS) and the "terms of agreement" are well-regulated. In the case of a private mineral and/or surface ownership, virtually all aspects of an agreement may be open for negotiation. No matter whether a lease, purchase, or joint venture is desired, the most certain way to assure failure is to strike an agreement that results in one side believing he agreed to unfair terms or was misinformed about the implications of  the terms. Both participants to a minerals negotiation need to be informed about the negative impacts of overly generous royalties, rapidly accelerating bonus payments or work commitments, onerous earn-in expenditures, and accelerated dilution clauses. Concern for the time implications of the permitting process and the current uncertainties of evolving environmental compliance codes should allow some flexibility in establishing contractual timeframes for completing certain tasks or attaining production.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Building Confidence in Assays:</B><BR>
<I>L. B. Bloom, Analytical Solutions Ltd., Toronto, ON, Canada and D. Titaro, A. C. A. Howe, Toronto, ON, Canada</I></FONT><BR>
In 1996, lack of confidence in assaying methods and sample handling affected companies as diverse as Bre-X and Timbuktu. Both share prices and the ability to raise financing are impacted when the quality of assay data is suspect. Overseas projects are subject to enhanced scrutiny when local facilities are used that are unfamiliar to brokers, financing agencies and banks. Quality control systems can be used to monitor sampling through assays but there are associated costs. These costs should reflect the risk to the mining company, investors and financiers and the size of the proposed investment. Assay control can be considered a form of insurance to enhance the value of an exploration or mining project. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>The Discovery and Exploration of the Batu Hijau Deposit, Sumbawa, Indonesia:</B><BR>
<I>B. K. Levet, Newmont Mineral Exploration, Perth, WA, Australia</I></FONT><BR>
The Batu Hijau porphyry copper gold deposit on the island of Sumbawa, in the Sunda-Banda island arc of Indonesia, was detected up to 15 kilometers from a mineralized outcrop by the analysis of active stream sediments using the Bulk Leach Extractable Gold technique and the identification of limited float in the stream. Analysis of <80 mesh stream silts proved to be the most effective method for defining the extent of the anomaly within 1 to 2 kilometers of outcropping mineralization. The deposit was defined by the integration of geological, geochemical and geophysical data sets, and was confirmed by diamond drilling. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Discovery and Exploration of the Gosowong Quartz-adularia Vein Deposit, Halmahera, Eastern Indonesia:</B><BR>

Langmead, Newcrest Mining Ltd., East Perth, WA, Australia and W. J. Rafferty, PT Barrick Gold Corp., Jakarta, Indonesia</I></FONT><BR>
The Gosowong quartz-adularia vein, in the Halmahera magmatic arc, represents a new discovery in an area of primary tropical rain forest with no history of gold mining or mineralization. The newly recognized mineralized district is so far known to contain several other epithermal vein systems, three centers of porphyry Cu-Au mineralization, and a number of argillic and advanced argillic alteration zones. Gosowong was discovered and tested through the application of basic exploration techniques including drainage sampling, soil sampling, trenching, magnetics, IP, and diamond drilling. Lapse time from the initial discovery of a stream sediment anomaly to the release of an inferred resource of approximately 1.0m ounces was just over 3 years.</P>

<I>J. A. Haggman, Climax Arimco Mining Corp., Makati City, Philippines</I></FONT><BR>
In a country richly endowed in mineral wealth, Climax Arimco Mining Corporation's (CAMC) Dinkidi porphyry Au-Cu deposit located in Barangay Didipio, Neuva Vizcaya, Philippines, represents the most significant mineral discovery in this country in recent times. The deposit is located within a belt of young intrusive and volcanic rocks in the Sierra Madre mountain chain of north Luzon a region previously unassociated with porphyry-style mineralization. A new mining law was passed in March 1995 and earlier CAMC was the first foreign company to be granted a Foreign Technical Assistance Agreement (FTAA)) by the Philippine government allowing 100% foreign ownership of mining projects. Since 1989, drilling of the Dinkidi deposit has outlined a resource of 124 million tons of 1.0 g/t gold and 0.4% copper with regional exploration throughout CAMC's 37,000-hectare FTAA identifying a further sixteen satellite porphyry-related targets. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>The Siguiri Gold Deposits-Case History of Discovery:</B><BR>
<I>P. R. Davies, Socit Aurifre de Guine, Guinea, West Africa and M. L. Page, Golden Shamrock Mines Inc., Denver, CO</I></FONT><BR>
The Siguiri gold deposits occur in a Lower Proterozoic Birimian meta-sedimentary basin in the northeastern corner of Guinea, West Africa. Lithologies are generally fine grained and volcanics are unknown in the project area. Extensive artisanal gold mining of active high grade alluvials and a defunct mechanized alluvial mining operation highlighted the potential of the Siguiri area. The local affiliate of Golden Shamrock Mines Ltd., Socit Aurifre de Guine, initially trenched and drilled known saprolitic sheeted quartz vein and minor breccia systems and identified 0.5 million ounces by the end of 1994. Orientation laterite lag and follow-up laterite rockchip sampling in December 1994 indicated the potential in the laterite itself. Widely spaced open hole rotary air blast (RAB) drilling quickly outlined the broad dimensions of the mineralization. Aircore and reverse circulation percussion drilling defined the resources, which by April 1995 were estimated at 2.7 million ounces. Step-out drilling of the laterite mineralization has brought current (July 1996) resources to 67.4 mt @ 1.57 g/t Au (3.4 million ounces). Fifty percent of the gold is contained in near surface laterite, and consequently, reserve strip ratios are 1:1. Both in situ and transported, aeriferous laterite profiles are recognized. Several lateritized paleochannel deposits form an annulus around the Kami sheeted vein deposit, the main source of active alluvial gold channels in the area. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>The Segala Gold Discovery, Mali, West Africa:</B><BR>
<I>R. Thivierge, Oliver Gold Corp., Bamako, Mali and L. L. Duffett and J. R.</I></FONT><BR> Allan, Oliver Gold Corp., Vancouver, BC, Canada
In Mali, Oliver Gold Corp is exploring the Segala gold discovery, occurring within Proterozoic Birimian metasedimentary rocks of the "Keneiba Inlier" which straddles the Mali-Senegal border. The deposit is hosted by a lower greenschist facies turbiditic sequence of greywacke, phyllitic siltstone and argillite which is intruded by felsic plutons and small-scale dykes, northeast trending diabase dykes and a number of kimberlite bodies. Gold mineralization is identified in several zones. Mineralized intervals in the Main Zone are characterized by bleached, iron-carbonate and sericite altered metasediments containing disseminated pyrite and arsenopyrite and a complex network of quartz veinlets. Gold occurs as fine intercrystalline patches and fracture fillings in sulphide minerals, and as coarse visible grains within iron carbonate-quartz veinlets. A preliminary resource of over one million ounces has been calculated in the Main Zone. The 1996 work program and prefeasibility study on the Main and Northwest Zones includes 10,000 meters of diamond drilling to delineate the deposit at shallow to moderate depths, and 10,000 meters of RC drilling to test for supergene mineralization in the laterite and saprolite horizons overlying the zones. Preliminary metallurgical results indicate over 95% gold recovery by a combination of gravity and cyanide leach procedures. Concurrently with the drilling programs, detailed soil geochemical and geophysical surveys are underway to evaluate additional mineralized zones on the property.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Zimbabwe Platinum: The Sleeping Giant Awakes:</B><BR>
<I>P. M. Vanderspuy, Delta Gold N.L., North Sydney, Australia</I></FONT><BR>
The Great Dyke in Zimbabwe, second only after South Africa's Bushveld Igneous Complex as a repository of platinum group metals, was first recognized in the 1860's. Its layered mafic-ultramafic character was recorded in the 1890's and its platinum content was first noted in 1914. Recovery of alluvial platinum was attempted around 1930. In the 1960's and 1970's four separate trial underground mines were established and subsequently suspended for technical and financial reasons. In 1986 Delta Gold started re-evaluating the economic and technical viability of platinum mining on the Great Dyke. In 1990 BHP joined Delta in this evaluation, leading to mine construction between 1994 and 1996, with first production scheduled for early 1997. Initial platinum production from the Hartley Platinum mine will account for 3% of world supply possibly growing to between 10% and 15% of world supply by 2010.</P>

<I>T. C. Shrake, Gibraltar Mines Ltd., Reno, NV; D. R. Ernst, Gibraltar Mines Ltd., Santiago, Chile; P. Thurston, Girdwood, AK; and J. Ashleman, Spokane, WA</I></FONT><BR>
Lomas Bayas and Fortuna de Cobre are leachable porphyry deposits located in Region II, Chile. The two deposits are 2 km apart. Dacite porphyries intrude a Late Cretaceous granodiorite batholith along a northeasterly strike-slip fault zone. The higher grade hypogene systems are restricted to veins and breccias that are surrounded by very large low-grade shells. The hypogene system was subjected to a long period of enrichment and oxidation. The majority of the copper was contained in various species of copper sulfate. The combined reserve/geologic resource for the deposits total 8.9 billion pounds of contained copper.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Geology of the El Abra Porphyry Copper Deposit, Chile:</B><BR>
<I>R. E. Graichen, Cyprus Amax Minerals Co., Englewood; CO; D. A. Dean, Cyprus Amax Minerals Co., Sparks, NV; and L. F. Barrett, D. K. Christensen; and W. D. Burton, Cyprus Amax Minerals Co., Englewood, CO</I></FONT><BR>
El Abra is a deeply eroded and oxidized, low-sulfide porphyry copper system. Chrysocolla, pseudomalachite and copper clays are the principal oxide ore minerals. A poorly developed chalcocite zone lies at the base of the oxide zone with disseminated chalcopyrite and bornite lying beneath it to beyond 1,000 meters depth. Ore occurs in a potassically altered system of diorite to quartz monzonite intrusives of late Eocene to early Oligocene age. Commonly these rocks appear fresh in hand sample. The deposit is situated within and probably controlled by a wrench fault system related to the nearby West Fissure as are other copper deposits in Northern Chile. Mining of the 798 million ton oxide reserve of 0.54 percent copper began in July, 1996. The oxide deposit economics are related to its continuity and thickness (65 to 350 meters), low stripping and a central high grade zone at the surface. </P>

<I>B. Gillies, A. Plazzolles, J. Guillen, L. Prieto, and F. Linares, Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde, Arequipa, Peru</I></FONT><BR>
The Cerro Verde and Santa Rosa deposits, situated 30 km southwest of the Peruvian city of Arequipa, are of the porphyry copper molybdenite type, emplaced in the south segment of the Coastal Batholith, Arequipa section. Similar to the Cuajone, Quellaveco, and Toquepala settings, Cerro Verde is thought to lie along a northwestern splay of the West Fissure, a dominant tectonic feature common to some of the largest copper deposits in northern Chile. Surface copper oxide mineralization had been known for centuries and high grade mining operations were run by various small miners from 1868 until 1916. Since then, the property experienced 3 phases of exploration drilling by Newmont and Anaconda until 1970. Minero Peru constructed a modern treatment facility in the mid seventies and commenced leaching operations in 1977. Cyprus Amax Inc. acquired the operation in 1994 and through an aggressive exploration and development program, has expanded SX/EW production to 48,000 tons of cathode copper, annually.</P>

The Cerro Negro oxide copper deposit is located 3 km southeast of the Cyprus Amax Cerro Verde porphyry copper mine. Cerro Negro is hosted in a distinctive quartz-tourmaline breccia with mineralization and alteration related to the intrusion of quartz-tourmaline breccia bodies along the bounding faults of a 1.5 km near circular, volcano tectonic depression. The Cerro Negro deposit is the largest breccia (300 m by 900 m) and has near vertical contacts with adjacent host rocks. Several breccia phases are recognized. They consist of matrix supported quartz-tourmaline breccias with angular to subrounded fragments of Yarabamba granodiorite. Copper mineralization post dates but is associated with tourmaline and specularite in the quartz-tourmaline breccias. Oxidation occurs to 200 m depth. Chrysocolla, tenorite, malachite, cuprite, and anterlite occur in veinlets, fracture and vug fillings, and as replacement of breccia matrix and fragments. Primary sulfides (pyrite and chalcopyrite) occur in veinlets, fractures, and vug fillings.</P>

<I>P. L. Zweng, BHP Copper, Tucson, AZ</I></FONT><BR>
The Cu-(Au, Ag) skarn deposits of Tintaya are located in the Yauri district, southern Peru. Calcic skarn forms principally within roof pendants of lower Cretaceous Ferrobamba limestone engulfed in Tertiary monzonite, or along contacts separating limestone from monzonite or diorite. Skarn is spatially associated with K-silicate altered monzonite, and is characterized by diopside skarn replaced by andradite skarn and magnetite replacement bodies. Over 80% of the copper occurs with andradite and magnetite in low-sulfur assemblages, magnetite-bornite, bornite-chalcopyrite, and chalcopyrite. Minor chlorite, epidote, and clay-bearing assemblages containing pyrite-chalcopyrite overprint skam. Unusual features of Tintaya relative to other copper skarans include: (1) poorly developed mineral zonation in skarn; (2) minor hydrolytic alteration, and (3) the abundance of skarn in roof pendants. These features together suggest skarn formed by highly focused fluid flow in a deep environment.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Discovery of the Pierina, Peru, Gold Deposit by Arequipa Resources:</B><BR>
<I>J. D. Lowell, Lowell Mineral Exploration, Rio Rico, AZ</I></FONT><BR>
Staged regional exploration in 1995 identified a 400 3 600 meter anomaly averaging 1.6 ppm Au. A grid of 3m deep pits averaged over 6 ppm Au. The deposit was explored by two adits and a 100 3 100m grid of RC and diamond drill holes. A continuous block of ore grade mineralization 1100 3 200-400 by 10-200m deep had been delineated by August, 1996, when Arequipa Resources was acquired by American Barrick. The mineralization occurs in a strongly silicified lithic tuff which overlies feldspar porphyry with strong argillic and sericite alteration. The ore grade varies from one to several grams of Au and 10-200g of Ag. Most of the strong mineralization occurs in vuggy silica. It contains alunite, native sulfur, barite and iron oxide minerals with occasional sparse disseminated pyrite, enargite and covellite. Oxidation may be of hypogene origin. Gold is late stage and very fine grained, and cyanide leach tests indicate it is readily soluble. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Remote Sensing into the Twenty-First Century:</B><BR>
<I>D. W. Coulter, Newmont Exploration Ltd., Denver, CO</I></FONT><BR>
Over the past decade, the Landsat based Thematic Mapper has become the remote sensing instrument of choice for mineral exploration applications. As the decade and century draw to a close we are experiencing renewed Interest and growth of satellite remote sensing with more than twenty instruments scheduled for launch by the year 2004. While most of these systems are designed to meet the needs of the civil engineering, agricultural, news gathering, and environmental industries, explorationists will greatly benefit from their capabilities. High resolution radar imagery may already be obtained from Radarsat and we will soon have access to near aerial photographic quality stereo images. Mineral mapping from space will also soon be a reality with one hyperspectral system scheduled for launch and others in the process of being designed. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>The LASI High-resolution Electromagnetic Sounding System:</B><BR>
<I>B. K. Sternberg and M. M. Poulton, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ</I></FONT><BR>
We have developed a series of new electromagnetic (EM) sounding systems at the Laboratory for Advanced Subsurface Imaging (LASI) during the last 6 years. These include low frequency (LF, 30 Hz to 30 kHz), medium frequency (MF, 1 kHz to 1 MHz), and high frequency (HF, 30 kHz to 300 MHz) systems. Applications have included: mapping of plumes of contaminated groundwater, tracing leachate for an in situ leaching operation, locating buried hazardous waste, identifying subsidence-prone zones, and detecting buried voids. These systems are also applicable to exploration for ore bodies. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>GIS-An Exploration Tool: </B><BR>
<I>G. L. Raines, US Geological Survey, Reno, NV and B. R. Johnson, US Geological Survey, Spokane, WA</I></FONT><BR>
A geographical information system (GIS) is a system of computer hardware, software, geographic data, and personnel designed to efficiently capture, store, update, manipulate, analyze and display all forms of geographically referenced data. Two limitations to the geologic application of GIS are availability of digital data and analytical methods. A critical issue of data availability is the lack of digital geologic maps, especially at larger scales. Another issue is the lack of data standards. Significant progress is being made in GIS analytical methods. Recently a new massive sulfide discovery in Canada was predicted using the weights-of-evidence, fuzzy-logic, and other GIS data integration techniques. A weights-of-evidence model for hot springs gold deposits in the Great Basin has provided a mineral assessment comparable to that of an expert team. Estimates of numbers of undiscovered deposits from this model are identical to the estimates of traditional expert teams. Research suggests that which data and how they are used is more important than which analytical method is used to integrate the data. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Geophysics Research, Development and Applications to Mineral Exploration: </B><BR>
<I>K. L. Zonge, Zonge Engineering & Research, Tucson, AZ and C. S. Lide, Zonge Engineering & Research, Sparks, NV</I></FONT><BR>
Research and development in both airborne and ground geophysics has emphasized increased resolution, greater depth of exploration, multi-component measurements, higher productivity and better interpretational tools. These efforts have resulted in microprocessor-based instruments which have more channels, better noise rejection, lower power consumption, and are smaller and lighter than instruments available 5 years ago. The decrease in size and weight of the instrumentation is important to geoophysical exploration in remote areas. Algorithms for automated construction of depth sections have become relatively standard for many techniques and provide a complement to standard psuedosection presentation of data. Development is continuing on 2D and 3D modeling and inversion algorithms. Increased effectiveness in mineral exploration provided by these recent advancements is demonstrated by case studies. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Recruiting and Training for Exploration: Changing Times, Changing Needs: </B><BR>
<I>N. C. White, BHP Minerals Int'l. Exploration, Sparks, NV</I></FONT><BR>
The world is opening up to explorers. We have more technology, and better understanding of mineralization than ever before. Global explorers need a command of both advanced and simple methods. They need to understand their targets, alternative exploration techniques, and logistical, legal, economic, environmental and social factors. An interdisciplinary approach is increasingly essential. Lack of jobs discourages students from training for the industry, so there are fewer schools producing graduates. The quality and number of graduates is declining and this is made worse by adverse social attitudes. Industry expectations of new graduates vary widely. Companies with strong commitment to training want graduates with basic academic skills to train on the job. Others want graduates already trained in operations. So the remaining schools have the problem of who to try to satisfy. In some third world countries there are well-trained graduates. However, their training commonly lacks practical experience and industry awareness. Quality recruits are available, but they need training and supervision. Present trends will continue unless the industry changes them. We allowed some of the problems to develop; only we can fix them. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Laterite Development and Gold Mineralization at Siguiri, NE Guinea-Genetic and Exploration Models: </B><BR>
<I>P. R. Davies, Socit Aurifre de Guine, Guinea, West  Africa</I></FONT><BR>
Lateritic weathering over perhaps the past 70 million years has dominated the Siguiri region in northeastern Guinea. Erosion has produced a complex regolith of partially preserved residual and transported material, and commonly inverted relief. In situ laterite gold mineralization occurs in the ferruginous part of the weathering profile above saprolite and fresh rock mineralization. Gold content is often higher near surface due to volume reduction caused by silica and carbonate loss during weathering. Grades are smoothed by hydromorphic dispersion in the lower part of the ferruginous zone. Profiles can be recognized by the presence of fragmental duricrust at surface, and underlying vermiform duricrust grading down to mottled clays and ferruginous saprolite. Transported laterite mineralization occurs as aprons of clay-rich colluvial or palaeochannel gravel derived from a now eroded in situ laterite profile previously developed over bedrock mineralization. Profiles contain downward fining lateritic pebbles, cutens on lateritic pisoliths, underlying transported clays, and basal quartz and lateritic boulder beds. The palaeochannels may be subsequently lateritized, with the clay matrix duricrusted up to 10 meters deep above a mottled zone, producing a profile similar to the in situ type. Gold grades are enhanced and further smoothed in this event, but drop with decreasing iron content and increasing depth in the profile. Higher grades may occur at the base of the duricrust and in the quartz boulder beds. </P>

<I>J. G. Groppo and T. L. Robl, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY and C. H. J. McCormick, Advanced Pozzolan Technologies, Inc., Atlanta, GA</I></FONT><BR>
Froth flotation has been demonstrated to be an effective method for selective separation of unburned carbon from high LOI fly ash, particularly ponded ashes. Although fly ash is quite fine (-325 mesh) it demonstrates unique filtration characteristics. The results of laboratory batch and continuous vacuum filtration studies will be presented. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Predicting the Moisture Content of Coals Dewatered by Screens:</B><BR>
<I>B. J. Arnold, CQ Inc., Homer City, PA</I></FONT><BR>
Utility coal specifications usually contain a requirement for a maximum moisture content in order to prevent handling problems and to minimize evaporative losses in the boiler. As most coal cleaning processes are water-based, dewatering and sometimes drying steps are required to meet moisture specifications. Screens are often used for dewatering, with centrifuges and filters used to further reduce moisture in many cases. Algorithms to predict the performance of commercial dewatering devices were developed for the Coal Cleaning Simulator running under Aspen Plus during a project sponsored by the US Department of Energy and the Electric Power Research Institute. This paper discusses the algorithm for predicting the moisture content of coal dewatered by screens. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Use of Fly Ash as a Binder for Iron Ore Pellets:</B><BR>
<I>T. C. Eisele and S. K. Kawatra, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI</I></FONT><BR>
The US iron-ore industry consumes approximately 560,000 tons of bentonite clay binders every year, most of which is shipped from Wyoming to the Great Lakes region at considerable expense. There is therefore incentive for finding a more local alternative to bentonite for this application. In this project the use of various coal fly ashes as binders for iron-ore pellets has been studied.</P>

<I>D. O'Murchu, Outokumpu Tara Mines, Navan, Ireland</I></FONT><BR>
Outokumpu Tara Mines located near Dublin, Ireland is Europes largest producer of lead and zinc concentrates. To reduce dewatering costs and to improve environmnetal and working conditions, elimination of the lead concentrate thermal dryer was required. This paper describes the development and implementation of the pressure ceramic technology at Tara to replace a conventinal vacuum filter/oil-fired dryer system. The pressure ceramic filter is currently dewatering 80,000 tons/year of lead concentrate, producing a cake with less than 6% moisture. Substantial operating cost savings have been realized. Commissioning of a second pressure ceramic filter to handle over 300,000 tons/year of zinc concentrates is scheduled for the first quarter of 1997.</P>

<I>F. F. Peng and Z. L. Lu, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV</I></FONT><BR>
Employing the combination of two polymers might become necessary to enhance both settling rate and water clarity of fine particle suspension in high capacity thickening process. The effects of pH, feed rate, polymer dosage, the sequence and number of polymer additions end rake speed on the settling rate, underflow solid, and water clarity were studied in a dynamic thickening device with adequate mixing feature and various polymer addition points. The results were evaluated quantitatively, using supernatant total solid suspension and settling rate as the measure of effectiveness. The purpose of this paper is to quantify and explain some of the parameters involved in the sedimentation of copper flotation tailings.

<I>K. K. Das and P. Somasundaran, Columbia University, New York, NY and Pradip, Tata Research Development & Design Center., Pune, India</I></FONT><BR>
Flocculation experiments have been conducted on alumina suspensions using different molecular weight polyacrylic acids. In the absence of polymer maximum settling of alumina suspension occurred near its point of zero charge (~pH 9). Under all pH conditions as expected, while low molecular weight (average MW 5000) polyacrylic acid effectively dispersed the alumina suspensions, polymers of higher molecular weight (50000 and above) resulted in flocculation. The effect of pH, ionic strength, dosage and solid/liquid ratio was studied. Surprisingly marked flocculation was obtained with parts per billion (ppb) level polymer dosage. Also interestingly at such ultra-low dosages a minimum in flocculation was observed at ~pH 4.5 close to the reported pKa of polyacrylic acid. Zeta potential studies did not reveal any significant change in the electrokinetics of alumina suspensions due to low dosage addition of polyacrylic acid. It suggests that fewer than 10 molecules per particle might be sufficient to obtain the desired flocculation if the polymer is introduced efficiently.

<I>A. K. Mouat, Carroll College, Helena, MT and A. M. Raichur, R. W. Smith and M. Mishra, University of Nevada, Reno, NV</I></FONT><BR>
The adhesion of Mycobacterium phlei onto minerals processing different degrees of hydrophobicity (hematite, stibnite, coal, talc, orpiment, graphite and molybdenite) was studied by zeta potential, contact angle and flocculation measurements. The bacterium strain studied exhibited a contact angle of 68-70 degrees. The minerals studied exhibited contact angles between 0 and 70 degrees. In general, the magnitude of the contact angle on the minerals, both with and without the presence of M. phlei, was a function of pH. The flocculation of the various mineral suspensions was roughly related to the observed contact angle on the minerals. In general, the less hydrophobic the mineral, the greater was the effect of the bacterium on contact angle and flocculation. An attempt is made to relate the interaction of the minerals and M. phlei, as expressed in the accompanying change in contact angle and flocculation of the minerals, to extended DLVO theory. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Enhanced Vacuum Filtration for Ultrafine Coal Dewatering: </B><BR>
<I>D. P. Tao, J. G. Groppo and B. K. Parekh, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY</I></FONT><BR>
The vacuum filtration was investigated for ultrafine coal dewatering on laboratory- and pilot-scale. It has been shown that enhanced dewatering of ultrafine coals can be achieved with vacuum filtration by modifying surface properties of coal particles. Filter cake containing less than 20% moisture can be obtained by use of flocculants, surfactants, metal ions, or a combination of them. In situ polymerization was explored as a novel process for coal dewatering that can substantially reduce the cake moisture. The effectiveness of coal dewatering was evaluated under various conditions and mechanisms responsible for enhanced dewatering discussed. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Centrifugal Dewatering and Reconstitution of Fine Coal: The GranuFlow Process: </B><BR>
<I>W. W. Wen and R. P. Killmeyer, Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center, Pittsburgh, PA</I></FONT><BR>
A continuous bench-scale testing of a GranuFlow Process was conducted on both high-g force solid-bowl and screen-bowl centrifuges for dewatering and reconstitution of fine-clean-coal slurry at 300 lb/h by the Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center. In this process fine-clean-coal slurry was treated with a bitumen emulsion. In one example, the treated products from a solid-bowl centrifuge appeared to be dry and in a free-flowing granular form, while the untreated products were wet, lumpy, sticky, and difficult to handle. Specifically, test results from the solid-bowl centrifuge indicated that the moisture content, handleability, and dust reduction of the dewatered coal product improved as the addition of emulsion increased from 2 wt% to 8 wt%. Because of the moisture reduction and the granular form of the product, the freezing problem was also alleviated. The preliminary cost estimation of using Orimulsion in the GranuFlow Process was also included.

<I>J. G. Groppo and B. K. Parekh, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY</I></FONT><BR>
Pilot scale dewatering tests were conducted at the Powell Mountain Coal Company's Mayflower Preparation Plant located in St. Charles, VA, using Andritz Hyperbaric Filter (HBF) and WesTech's vacuum drum filter. The feed to the filter was from the Ken-Flote' columns with an average particle size of 25 microns. The HBF provided a dewatered product containing 23.6 percent moisture. The optimum operating conditions of the HBF filter were: 165 cake formation angle, air consumption 460 scf/t, air pressure 3 bar (43 psi) and solids throughput of 34 Kg/m2-hr. The vacuum drum filter provided 27 percent moisture filter cake at a solids throughput of 5 Kg/m2-hr.

<I>D. M. Conner, Svedala Industries, Inc., Waukesha, WI</I></FONT><BR>
An innovative patented process has been developed to convert high volume wastes-fly ash from coal-fired power plants, municipal solid waste (MSW) ash from incineration, solids from wastewater treatment and paper mill sludge-into a high value and environmentally benign product in the form of a lightweight aggregate. Lightweight aggregate is widely used in the building construction industry in the United States, Europe and some Asian countries. This paper will present the development of the process, the process itself and details on the first commercial-scale plant. The commercial plant is owned and operated by Wisconsin Electric Power.

<I>P. R. Taylor and E. E. Vidal, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID</I></FONT><BR>
The use of thermal plasma in materials processing industries is becoming an increasingly active and attractive field for the development of new technology. The potential applications of thermal plasma processing technology cover a wide range of activities, such as: the extraction of metals, the refining/alloying of metals/alloys, the synthesis of fine ceramic powders, spray coatings and the consolidation and destruction of hazardous wastes. A review of thermal plasma applications in materials processing is presented.

<I>M. W. Ginn, Ginn Mineral Technology, Inc., Sandersville, GA</I></FONT><BR>
Thermal processing of industrial minerals adds profit to the manufacturer and value to the customer. This concept known as "Value-added Processing" is one of the most strategic goals of industrial mIneral producers. Calcination of industrial mInerals, such as kaolin, adds value to pigments for the paper industries and functional fillers for the refractory and plastic industries. Accounting principals using EVA concepts, demonstrate the economic advantages and encourage the application of value-added processing. Advanced thermal processing technology combined with new operating models and business designs are key drivers for profitable value migration in industrial minerals. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>The GRATE-CAR System Process Design and Commercialization:</B><BR>
<I>D. W. Rierson, Svedala Industries, Waukesha, WI</I></FONT><BR>
Svedala has a ported kiln process, designed specifically for the direct reduction of pelletized or natural lump iron ores. The process is called ACCAR. This ported kiln technology has been coupled with Svedala's GRATE KILN-System, for iron ore pelletizing, into the GRATE-CAR System for the reduction of the fine grained ore concentrates through the steps of agglomeration, induration and reduction in a single production line. Svedala conducts tests to confirm certain operating parameters of various ores through process simulations of the GRATE-CAR System. Svedala has also assessed the issues of process variables, heat transfer, equipment sizing, retention time and endothermic demand associated with the reduction process. Information is also provided on a 300,000 tpy commercial GRATE-CAR System operating on ilmenite concentrate.

<I>R. G. Reddy and G. P. Singh, The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL</I></FONT><BR>
Copper smelter discard slags contain significant quantities of As, Sb and Bi elements. From the slags dumps, over a period of time, these elements center hydrosphere and atmosphere. Since all the three elements are harmful to human life, it is warranted to minimize their release into the environment. A study was undertaken to reduce to quantities of these elements in the discard slags by a combination of high temperature carbothermic and sulfide treatment of industrial Cu smelter discard slags. Slags samples were treated with C and FeS in the temperature range of 13738 to 15738 K. A low grade matte high in these metals was produced. Removal of metals from slags increased with increase in the time of treatment, temperature and the addition of CaO, SiO2, and CaF2 to the slags. With the addition of 4 wt% CaO to the slag, the maximum removal of As, Bi and Sb were 79%, 37% and 68% respectively were obtained. Based on the present study, key factors which influence the environmentally safer disposal of industrial Cu smelter slags were identified.

<I>G. H. Luttrell and G. T. Adel, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA and R. T. Burchett and C. R. Phillips, Sanford Cohen & Assoc., Montgomery, AL</I></FONT><BR>
Considerable attention has been given to the restoration of low-level radioactive (<1000 pCi/gm) sites that were contaminated during the early years of the atomic energy program. Current cleanup activities which involve the relocation of contaminated soils to licensed disposal sites have been shown to be very costly due to the large volumes of soil which must be excavated, transported, and stored. Recent characterization studies conducted at Virginia Tech suggest that the volume of soil requiring disposal can be greatly reduced by mineral processing operations such as hydroclassification, density separation, and froth flotation. This article describes the application of these technologies for soil remediation and provides examples of commercial-scale flowsheets for two contaminated sites located in the eastern US.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Application of Mineral Processing Techniques for Secondary Materials Recovery:</B><BR>
<I>M. J. Mankosa and P. Venkatraman, Carpo, Inc., Jacksonville, FL</I></FONT><BR>
Recent work conducted at Carpco has evaluated the use of standard mineral processing techniques for secondary materials recovery. These have included silica, chromite and zircon foundry sands, fly ash, plastics and secondary metals. Pilot-scale test work has focused specifically on metal recovery from chopped wire waste material. As a result of the wire chopping process, a waste by product is generated which contains various types of plastic (PVC, PE, etc). aluminum flake and copper wire. The latter two components can consist of up to 10-20% (by weight) of the bulk material. Carpco has developed a gravity concentration technique for the recovery of both the plastic and metal by products. This paper will present results from pilot-scale design tests as well as operation data from a recently installed full-scale recovery system. Applications of other separation techniques on waste material will also be presented. </P>

<I>S. O'Brien, Linatex, Inc., Gallatin, TN and M. Paganon, Linatex Canada, Inc., Montreal, PQ, Canada</I></FONT><BR>
Rising current classifiers have long been utilized in the industrial minerals and sands industry to provide very sharp classifications in somewhat difficult to classify size ranges. Although they have also been used to a affect gravity separations in the past, recent case studies in iron ore processing and environmental remediation are given. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Resource Recovery an Option for the Treatment of Industrial Wastes:</B><BR>
<I>S. K. Mishra, TETRA Technologies, Inc., The Woodlands, TX</I></FONT><BR>
With the increasing regulatory pressure from the environmental authorities, waste management has become a focal point of industrial operation. To offset the waste management cost, industry has made conscious effort to recover usable resources from the waste streams. This paper reviews technological developments and current practices in the processing of waste materials. Method for recovering metallic, non-metallic and organic species from solid wastes and effluents generated by operating plants are discussed. </P>

<I>L. Enloe, P. Wilmont, and M. Gordon, Outokumpu Mintec USA, Englewood, CO</I></FONT><BR>
A higher density feed than was currently being produced was required to de-bottleneck the operation of the refractory ore treating autoclaves at Barrick Gold's Goldstrike mill. This was to ensure efficient oxidation conditions and to maximize throughput for a proposed upgrade. To achieve the ultra-high density feed material, a Supaflo "High Compression" thickener was installed, following pilot plant testwork at site. The pilot plant data is compared to the full scale results. Commissioning and operation of the 30 m High Compression Thickener is reviewed. In particular methods for detecting and prevention of "donut" formation in the thickener bed are presented.</P>

<I>J. T. Donnett, S. K. Kawatra, and T. C. Rao, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI</I></FONT><BR>
This study investigates the use of horizontally-baffled column (7.6 cm inside diameter by 344.2 cm high) to reduce the ash content of a low sulfur bituminious coal. The feed coal contained 43.1% ash, 0.80% total sulfur was 80% bassine 80 nm, and had a heating value of 8379 BTU/lb. The column had 11 horizontal baffles installed above the feed inlet and 15 below. In this paper, the results of this investigation will be reviwed and discussed. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Interaction Between Physical and Chemical Variables in Flotation in Low Rank Coals: </B><BR>
<I>S. Chander and H. Polat, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA</I></FONT><BR>
Relatively large amounts of such hydrocarbons as fuel oils are often needed in flotation of low rank coals. The amount of oil can be decreased considerably by using surfactants as promoters. The reagents which are good candidates as surfactants to promote hydrophobicity can also act as emulsifying and wetting agents. Since the physical and chemical variables influence various sub-processes in different ways, their influence on the performance variables in complex. The results of laboratory tests are presented to show that the duel role of reagents can be judiciously exploited to increase both the recovery and grade of clean coal. The mode and order of reagent addition is critical in enhancing their efficacy as flotation promoters. The results demonstrate the benefits of proper conditioning of the pulp prior to flotation.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Sphalerite Activation: Flotation and Electrokinetic Studies:</B><BR>
<I>J. S. Laskowski, Q. Liu and Y. Zhan, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada</I></FONT><BR>
Sphalerite is commonly floated in alkaline environment, and under such conditions the overall activation mechanism is obscured by the hydrolysis of Cu2+ and precipitation of Cu (OH)2. The electrokinetic and kinetic flotation tests showed that the activation of sphalerite is a two-stage process; the activation products formed on the surface of sphalerite in a near neutral and in alkaline solutions in the first rapid activation stage are "flotation-inactive." These layers, when formed in an alkaline solution, are unstable and are transformed into the "flotation-active" form in the second stage. However, the surface layers formed during activation in alkaline environment by copper in the presence of lead ions are very stable and even after a long conditioning time the flotation rate is not improved. Consequently, while both Cu2+ and Pb2+ activate sphalerite flotation, quite unpredictable effects may result when both are present in the solution. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>First-order Flotation Rate Equation Incorporating Hydrodynamic and Surface Forces: </B><BR>
<I>R. H. Yoon, and L. Mao, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA</I></FONT><BR>
A first flotation rate equation was derived by incorporating both hydrodynamic and surface forces. The hydrodynamic forces were calculated using an appropriate stream function, while the surface forces were calculated using the extended DLVO Theory which considers long-range interactions due to electrostatic force, retarded van der Waals force and hydrophobic force. The model was verified in flotation experiments conducted using well-defined methylated glass spheres. The experimental work was conducted using a single-bubble flotation apparatus, so that contributions from hydrodynamic forces can be calculated. Effects of pH and particle hydrophobicity were investigated. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Measurement and Application of Zeta Potential in Kaolin Processing:</B><BR>
<I>J. Yuan and R. J. Pruett, ECC Intl. Sandersville, GA</I></FONT><BR>
In kaolin processing, separation of impurity minerals such as anatase is often difficult and complicated due largely to the extremely fine particle size of clay. Separation mechanism has been explained using surface properties such as zeta potential. This study focused on determining zeta potential of different types of Georgia kaolin clays and understanding the relationship between zeta potential and the behavior of clays in mineral separation processes. Surface phenomena which reflect conditions at the solid-liquid interface will be discussed. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Anionic Flotation of Apatite, Dolomite and Phosphate Rock Modified by the Presence of a Bacterium: </B><BR>
<I>X. Zheng, R. W. Smith, R. K. Mehta, A. M. Raichur and M. Misra, University of Nevada, Reno, NV</I></FONT><BR>
Experimentation was performed on the flotation of apatite and dolomite separately using anionic collectors in the presence of Mycobacterium phlei. Also, the flotation of mixtures of dolomite and apatite in the presence of anionic collectors and in the absence and presence of the bacterium, was studied. It was found that M. phlei functioned as a depressant for both minerals. However, it functioned as a better depressant for dolomite than for apatite. Experimentation was extended to two different Florida dolomitic phosphate rocks. In this investigation a concentrate grade of less than 1.0% MgO could be achieved. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Wetting Francolite and Quartz by Fuel Oil and Its Significance in the Flotation of Phosphate Rock: </B><BR>
<I>Y. Lu, J. Drelich and J. D. Miller, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT</I></FONT><BR>
Water contact angles in the fuel oil/water/fracolite and the fuel oil/water/quartz systems were measured to describe the wetting characteristics of these minerals. It was found that fracolite is readily wetted by fuel oil, as indicated by a large receding water contact angle of 100 to 120 degrees. In contrast, the fuel oil droplet did not attach at clean quartz surfaces. More interestingly, thin films of fuel oil formed at the fracolite surface are fairly stable, but such films are completely unstable at the quartz surface. Fatty acid dissolved in the aqueous phase helps the fuel oil drops spread at the francolite surface but has negligible effect on the wetting properties of clean quartz surfaces. Based on these experimental results, the significance of high solids conditioning for effective phosphate flotation in the presence of collector and fuel oil is discussed.

SPL operates two mine and concentrator facilities at Toquepala and Cuajone, 24 km apart on the western side of the Andes mountains in Southern Peru. Toquepala commenced operations in 1959 at a design production rate of 33,500 tpd and Cuajone in 1976 at 45,000 tpd. Throughput levels have steadily increased to offset decreasing ore head grades to the current levels of 50,000 and 64,000 tpd respectively. This has been achieved with the original installed equipment, an equipment modernization program, together with improved utilization of availability and changes in operating philosophy. The evolution of these, the retrofitting program, and current operating performance will be described in the paper.

<I>D. Bleazard, D. Hepler, and  L. Dearman, Barrick Goldstrike, Elko, NV</I></FONT><BR>
The maintenance organizations at the Barrick Goldstrike Mine are actively involved in increasing the reliability of mining and processing equipment, resulting in improved equipment availability and an overall reduction in operating costs. Equipment failures are investigated to determine what can be done to reduce or eliminate the failures by either making changes in management practices, equipment design, and/or utilizing Predictive Maintenance (PdM) Technologies. When the appropriate PdM Technology has been identified application procedures and inspection frequencies are determined to monitor the condition of the equipment. The information that is obtained from the PdM inspection is then used to optimize maintenance activities.

<I>J. A. Cormier and S. G. Honan, Battle Mountain Canada Golden Giant Mine, Marathon, ON, Canada</I></FONT><BR>
In July 1992 a gravity circuit was installed in the grinding circuit at Battle Mountain's Golden Giant Mine. Today, the gravity circuit produces over 25% of the total gold produced. A review of the reasons for the installation will be discussed as well as problems encountered and the solutions employed during the operation of the gravity circuit. The cost savings will be presented along with the history of metallurgical improvements. Future circuit modifications and the expected ramifications on the performance of the gravity circuit will be examined. </P>

<I>R. J. Sawyer, Kennecott Corp. Salt Lake City, UT</I></FONT><BR>
The Greens Creek underground polymetallic mine located on Admiralty Island in south east Alaska commenced operations in 1989 and was shut-down due to low metal prices in April 1993. Production restarted in 1996 from a newly discovered higher grade ore zone. The mill produces lead, zinc and bulk lead-zinc flotation concentrates containing high values of gold and silver. The ore mineralology is quite variable depending on the particular stope being mined. Gold is present as electrum and also as finely disseminated inclusions within the the sulfide matrix. Efforts to improve overall payable gold recovery have focused on the application of gravity separation. This paper describes the testwork leading up to the installation of a new gravity circuit and compress testwork and plant operating results. </P>

Placer Dome Canada operates the Campbell Mine at Balmertown, in the north western corner of the province of Ontario. The mine operates at 1500 stpd and produces in excess of 300,000 ounces of gold annually. Recent changes to the gravity concentration circuit have resulted in a 10-15% increase in gravity recovery. The focus of this presentation will be on the changes that have contributed to this improvement. </P>

<I>C. L. McKenzie, Kinross Delamar Mining Co., Jordan Valley, OR</I></FONT><BR>
The Kincross DeLamar Mine has been operated for more than 17 years producing precious metals dore' from ores, principally silver bearing with associated gold coproducts. In late 1995 a new orebody was commissioned, the Stone Cabin orebody, and the site began a phased shift from silver dominance to gold dominance in terms of precious metals revenue. The Knelson Concentrator was selected to remove gold from a portion of the cyclone underflow stream in the grinding circuit. This paper describes the development of the flow sheet, specific mineralogical impacts on Knelson product and downstream materials, and impact on mine/mill grade reconciliation. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>The Leaching Behavior of Rhenium in Ammonium Iodide/Iodine Solutions: </B><BR>
<I>D. Hong, X. Meng and K. N. Han, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Rapid City, SD</I></FONT><BR>
The leaching behavior of rhenium in ammonium iodide solutions with iodine as oxidant has been studied. Experiments were carried out in an autoclave. The effect of stirring speed, temperature, pH of the solution, iodine and iodide concentrations on the dissolution of rhenium was investigated. It was found that high temperature and high pH of the solution was essential for the efficient leaching of rhenium. The dissolution rate was found to be dependent upon the concentration of iodine and iodide. It was concluded that the dissolution of rhenium under the conditions studied was controlled by mass transfer with the apparent activation energy of 6.6 kJ/mole.

<I>X. Meng and K. N. Han, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Rapid City, SD</I></FONT><BR>
The leaching behavior of palladium in ammoniacal solutions has been investigated using the rotating disk technique in an autoclave. The study included the effect of rotating speed, temperature, oxygen pressure, composition of ammoniacal solutions and catalyst on the overall leaching rate. The dissolution of palladium in ammoniacal solutions was discussed in view of the thermodynamics and a kinetic model. Even though the potential-pH diagram suggested that palladium metal can dissolve in ammoniacal solutions at room temperature, it was found that the dissolution was too slow at temperatures below 100C but was significantly improved at higher temperatures. It was also found that the rotating speed of palladium disk had no effect on the leaching rate. The apparent activation energy was found to be 69.7 kJ/mole. Based on the results obtained, it is concluded that the dissolution of palladium is controlled by a chemical reaction.

<I>R. G. Reddy, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL and A. E. Torma, AMROT Intl., Rio Rancho, NM</I></FONT><BR>
The microbilogical oxidation of cadmium sulfide concentrate was investigated using Thiobacillus ferrooxidans. The oxidation rates of CdS concentrate (particle size -200 mesh) were determined as a function of pulp density (2 to 20%) and temperature (20 to 40C). The experimental results showed that the rate of oxidation of CdS increased with increase in temperature and also increased with increase in pulp density. The solubilization of CdS was found to be about 20 times faster with T. ferrooxidan relative to the sterile controls. A possible mechanism was proposed for the T. ferrooxidan bacterium oxidation of CdS. It was concluded that the biooxidation of cadmium sulfide is an effective and practical method for cadmium extraction.

<I>R. Winby, BacTech Ltd., Belmont, WA, Australia and C. L. Brierley, VistaTech Partnership, Ltd., Salt Lake City, UT</I></FONT><BR>
This paper will report the results of bioleaching various chalcopyrite ores and concentrates to solubilize copper. The bioleaching results of different ores will be compared and estimated capital and operating costs of commercial-scale operations will be given. This paper will also report results of arsenic removal by selective precipitation. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Air Sweep Efficiency During Sulfide Mineral Biooxidation in Forced-air Ventilated Ore Heaps: </B><BR>
<I>K. A. Prisbrey and R. W. Bartlett, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID</I></FONT><BR>
When the rate of biooxidation of sulfide minerals in an ore heap is limited by oxygen availability, the process can be accelerated by ventilating the heap with air, blown through pipes from fans. Air flow streamlines and stream functions were computed for a heap, having homogeneous and isotropic intrinsic permeability, with air injected at equal rates from equally spaced injectors located at the bottom of the heap. Air sweep efficiency includes both oxygen utilization and the extent of mineral oxidation over time. Results are presented as a function of injector spacing, heap height, air blowing rate and the time-dependent oxygen demand rate. The oxygen demand rate depends on the sulfide mineral concentration and grain size in the ore and its intrinsic oxidation kinetics. Typical values for fine grained pyritic ores, such as refractory gold ores, are used for example calculations.

<I>R. K. Mensah-Biney, North Carolina State University, Asheville, NC</I></FONT><BR>
Adsorption of gold-thiourea complex onto a cation exchange resin, Amberlite 252, was evaluated in a batch stirred reactor. The data were modeled after the Freundlich isotherm and the observed saturation absorption capacity was about 3.20 meg Au/g dry resin (620 kg/t). Adsorption of the gold-complex decreased with increasing temperature and increasing thiourea concentration. The correlation between initial gold concentration and adsorption capacity was not conclusive. Scanning electron microscopy revealed evidence of deposition of elemental gold on the loaded resin. The proposed mechanism for "adsorption" of gold-thiourea complex consists of an ion exchange followed by a reduction of the gold complex to elemental gold.

Increased gold leaching rates and higher gold recovery were demonstrated with DuPont's activator technology in a plant test at the Homestake mine in Lead, South Dakota. Activators are nitrogen and sulfur aromatic heteroacrylic compounds which catalyze the gold dissolution reaction in cyanide and other lixiviants. The test was run in the west sand plant alternating control and activated vats. Activated vats had gold in the preg solutions earlier, higher gold recovery, and lower residues. Optimization of the technology continues.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>High Concentration Soluble Manganese Removal by Adsorption/Oxidation on Manganese Oxide Ore: </B><BR>
<I>F. F. Peng and Y. Xu, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV</I></FONT><BR>
High concentration manganese removal by adsorption and oxidation in aqueous solution was studied using manganese oxide ore. The operating parameters including pH, flow rate, Mn2+ concentration and oxidant dosage, affect the performance of Mn2+ removal were evaluated in the laboratory packed columns. In multi-column adsorption tests, no further decreasing in pH was observed on pH was lowered to 4.5-5. Adsorption was found the predominated mechanism involved with manganese removal. Extremely low H+/Mn2+ stoichiometry was measured, suggesting that the different adsorption mechanism other than H+/Mn2+ ion exchange might play an important role at low pH. This paper presents the explanation of the results obtained for high concentration manganese removal. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Removal of Lead from Water by the Natural Polymer-Chitosan:</B><BR>
<I>W. N. Harold and B. Pesic, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID</I></FONT><BR>
Chitosan is a derivative of chitin in which some portion of the acetyl group in the 2 position has been removed. Chitin is b(1r4)-2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucan. Both chitina and chitosan have high affinities for transition metals. Pb, and U. In this paper, the adsorption of lead as a function of pH, temperature, Pb and other metals concentration , and chitosan particle size was examined. It was found that chitosan was an excellent natural polymer for removal of lead from aqueous solutions. The kinetics of adsorption was fast, and the loading capacity for lead was relatively high. Rate of adsorption was controlled by intraparticle diffusion mechanisms.

<I>A. L. de Vegt, Paques, Inc., Exton, PA; H. G. Bayer, Kennecott Utah Copper Corp., Bingham Canyon, UT and C. J. Buisman, Tiopaq Sulfur Systems, B. V. Balk, The Netherlands</I></FONT><BR>
Paques has developed and installed treatment systems to remove metals and sulfate from mine waters as insoluble metal sulfides and elemental sulfur using two biological steps. A Paques groundwater treatment system for the Budelco zinc refinery has been in operation since May 1992 treating a flow of 1.3 MGD. Sulfate is reduced to below 200 mg/l, while metal removals exceed 99%. A demonstration plant started in November 1995 at Kennecott's Bingham Canyon Utah copper mine to remediate groundwater and selectively recover copper from the leach water. The principle of the biotechnological methods, full scale experience, and an overview of the test program at the copper mine will be presented. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Sorption of Heavy Metal Ions onto Non-livintg Aquatic Plant Biomass:</B><BR>
<I>G. Wang, M. C. Fuerstenau and R. W. Smith, University of Nevada, Reno, NV</I></FONT><BR>
Contamination of surface waters by heavy metals from mining and industrial sources has become a serous problem throughout the world. Biosorption onto living plants and dead plant biomass holds promise of being able to remove very low concentrations of heavy metal ions from solution, even in the presence of high concentrations of Ca (II) and Mg (II). Further, low-cost schemes are possible. An attractive possibility is the potential of dead biomass derived from higher aquatic plants. Such plant biomaterials are excellent sorbents for heavy metal ions. For example, dried water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) roots, when suspended in water, strongly sorb cadmium, lead, and mercury ions. The sorption is dependent on factors such as reaction time, pH, concentration of metal ions, temperature, the presence of other metal ions and biomass concentration. The metal ions can be readily desorbed and roots regenerated. It also appears that roots can be recycled through a large number of loading-elution cycles without significant loss of sorption properties. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Calcination of Radioactive-waste Simulant in a Thermal Plasma Flow Reactor:</B><BR>
<I>P. R. Taylor and M. Manrique, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID and S. A. Pirzada, Nanomaterials Research Corp., Tuscson, AZ</I></FONT><BR>
This investigation studied the inflight calcination kinetics of nuclear waste simulant using a thermal plasma reactor. A series of experiments were performed to determine the conversion of insoluble aluminum compounds to the soluble compounds and the decomposition of complex organic and nitrite compounds present in the simulant waste. Thermodynamic calculations based on free energy minimization were performed to establish a theoretical basis for this investigation. A kinetic model to describe the conversion of gibsite to sodium aluminate has been proposed. The products of the calcination were characterized using XRD, Gas Chromatography, and chemical analysis by ICP. The results of this investigation indicated 85% gibsite conversion to sodium aluminate, 90% of nitrate decomposition, 52% TOC decomposition and 90% conversion of chromium to soluble compounds. A process is identified for inflight calcination of wastes. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Comparison of Cyclones and Underflow-regulated Cyclones for Dewatering of Mineral Slurries: </B><BR>
<I>S. O'Brien, R. Spears and B. Lott, Linatex Inc., Gallatin, TN</I></FONT><BR>
The limited ability to control the water split out of conventional cyclones under varying feed conditions can be of concern when dealing with the removal of fines from waste streams. Underflow regulated cyclones normally have a restriction device located at the apex. Conventional wisdom dictates that a restriction at the apex normally causes other difficulties. However, by adding a siphon leg to the overflow, the water flow from the cyclone can be controlled without roping the unit. A Linatex developed underflow regulator was compared with a conventional cyclone for its ability to dewater a fine sand slurry.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>UV-Photolysis for the Destruction of Metal-complexed Cyanide:</B><BR>
<I>C. Young, M. Pruss, K. Slaybaugh, and B. Mikelson, Montana Tech of the University of Montana</I></FONT><BR>
Cyanide is a strong lixiviant for metals and is, therefore, favored for finishing and treatment, flotation control, and leaching, particularly gold. Industrial effluents consequently contain various metal-complex cyanides but no proven method exists for their complete destruction (until now?). In this study, photolytic techniques are described and experimentally compared for remediating a suite of metal-complexed cyanides including weak-acid dissociables (WADs) and strong-acid dissociables (SADs). Reaction mechanisms are proposed in accordance with Eh-pH diagrams and analytical results.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Upgrading Schemes for Boron Minerals-through Calcination:</B><BR>
<I>M. S. Celik, Instanbul Technical University, Instanbul, Turkey; T. Batar, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey; and Y. Akin, Instanbul Technical Univerity, Istanbul Turkey</I></FONT><BR>
Boron minerals are primarily upgraded by wet processing methods. However, severe environmental constraints have accelerated the development of dry processing techniques such as calcination. Boron minerals of commercial importance, i.e. colemanite, ulexite, and borax respectively undergo decrepitation, shrinkage and expansion upon heat treatment. Each mineral then requires a different beneficiation scheme for final product. In this study, laboratory and pilot plant studies on calcination of boron minerals conducted in our laboratories are reviewed along with their implications in commercial operations.

<I>A Discussion on Particle Charge, Particle Size and Separation: H. Ban, T. Li, J. L. Schaefer, J. K. Neathery and J. M. Stencel, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY</I></FONT><BR>
Triboelectrostatic separation tests were performed on a bench-scale, analytical separator. Coal, coal combustion fly ash and mineral samples were used in the experiments. Fractions of separated samples were collected and analyzed to characterize the performance of the separation. Particle size distribution and morphological characteristics for these samples were analyzed by a laser diffraction particle size analysis, optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Theoretical analyzes were also performed in an effort to understand the behavior of the particles under different processing conditions. The presentation will discuss the particle separation data relevant to charge distribution and size distribution of the particles.

<I>F. Gheorghiu and C. Cot, Quebec Cartier Mining Co., Fermont, PQ, Canada</I></FONT><BR>
The silica grade of iron concentrate is a basic quality condition and its automat control permits to obtain the increase of spiral efficiency, therefore supplementary benefits of  the concentrating plant. The paper presents the bases and development of the control system model, its facilities and application results. The benefits of the automat control of the silica grade, on the basis of the model described, consist in: i) the observance of the target value of the silica grade, therefore the increase of the control process accuracy (standard deviation 0.15 - 0.17); ii) the stable operation of the spirals; iii) the increase of spiral efficiency, consisting in the increase of the weight/iron recovery yield. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Yield Index: A New Method for the Analysis of Flotation Results:</B><BR>
<I>M. T. Ityokumbul and M. P. Trubelja, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA and B. J. Arnold, CQ Inc., Homer City, PA</I></FONT><BR>
A review of commonly employed methods for the analysis of separation results is presented. The yield index, which is the product of the yield and the rejection of undesirable product (s), is presented and contrasted with the other indices. It is shown mathematically that optimization of flotation results using this index is superior since it concurrently maximizes both the recovery of the valuable constituent and the rejection of the undesirable components. The characteristics of the yield-gangue rejection plot from which the index is determined and its limitations are presented. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>A Modified Procedure to Measure the True Flotation Response of Coal: </B><BR>
<I>M. K. Mohanty and R. Q. Honaker, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, IL and K. Ho, Illinois Clean Coal Institute, Carterville, IL</I></FONT><BR>
Recent studies indicate that the separation performance achieved by multiple-stage cleaning and, in some cases, single stage cleaning using column flotation is superior to the performance achieved by the traditional flotation characterization procedures. This superior performance is believed to be the result of the advanced flotation mechanisms provided by column flotation technologies. The results from a study which re-investigated the traditional release and tree procedures both experimentally and theoretically will be presented in this publication. As a result, a modified coal flotation characterization procedure has been developed which provides superior separation performance on the basis of both ash and total sulfur rejection. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Procedures for the Flotation of Low Rank Coals: </B><BR>
<I>T. Onlin, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsin Chu, Taiwan and D. D. Xu and F. F. Aplan The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA</I></FONT><BR>
Conventional wisdom indicates that as the rank of coal decreases, the amount of oil required for its flotation increases. In reality, it has been found that as the rank of the coal decreases linearly from low or medium volatile bituminous to lignite, the amount of oil required for flotation increases logarithmically. Very low rank coals such as lignite and sub-bituminous (and also sometimes high volatile C bituminous) may, in some cases, require upwards of 50 kg/t of oil for their flotation. Oxidation of the coal surface makes the coal particle respond as would one of lower rank, depending on the extent of oxidation. The authors have evaluated a large number of potential collectors for the flotation of low rank coals, and they have identified several attractive collectors for their flotation. In addition, the effect of high solids conditioning, reagent emulsification and pH is promoting low rank coal flotation has been evaluated.

<I>T. Tempel Newmont Gold Co., Carlin, NV and A. Thabit, Garfield Steel and Machine, Inc., Glenwood Springs, CO
In 1994 Newmont Gold Co commissioned a 2.5 Mt/a refractory gold ore roasting  plant near Carlin, Nevada. Many unique characteristics of this facility required use of specialized materials of construction in the areas of dry grinding, roasting, gas cleaning, and sulfuric acid production. Process conditions and design criteria that necessitated the use of special materials include; siliceous and abrasive ore, low roasting temperatures, gas streams with high concentrations of oxygen and sulfur, and stringent environmental regulations. Materials selected for use were ceramics, corrosion-resistant steels, high temperature steels and polymers, lead, polypropylene and low flammability PVC.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Pressure Oxidation Problems and Solutions: Treating Carbonaceous Gold Ores Containing Trace Amounts of Chlorine (Halogens):</B><BR>
<I>G. L. Simmons, Sante Fe Pacific Gold Corp., Albuquerque, NM and D. R. Baughman, J. C. Gathje and K. C. Oberg, Hazen Research, Inc., Golden, CO
Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corp conducted pressure oxidation pilot plant studies at Hazen Research, Inc. on the Twin Creeks refractory carbonaceous gold ores during 1993 and 1994. Previous laboratory investigation resulted in very good gold recoveries of 90-95%, using CIL cyanidation after batch pressure oxidation. However, results from the pilot plant showed several ore types responded very poorly, with gold extractions of only 45-75%. Since these poor recoveries were unexpected, pilot plant testing was suspended for approximately four months while extensive basic research activities were conducted to determine the cause(s) and identify potential solutions. This paper describes the batch and pilot plant test results, the research activities that eventually identified the cause of the gold recovery problem, and the final semicontinuous and continuous pilot plant operations that confirmed possible solutions. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Flotation of Auriferous Pyrite Using Sante Fe Pacific Gold's N2TEC Flotation Technology: </B><BR>
<I>G. L. Simmons, Sante Fe Pacific Gold Corp., Albuquerque, NM
Many large low grade (refractory) sulfide gold resources exist, in Nevada and other parts of the world, that are not amenable to conventional flotation practice. Over the past few years, Sante Fe Pacific Gold Corp. have investigated non-conventional flotation process options to economically treat low grade resources of this type at it's Lone Tree and Twin Creeks mines. Initial testing using conventional flotation technology applied to the low grade gold resources at Lone Tree and Twin Creeks was unsuccessful. Review and analysis of gold bearing sulfide mineralogical characteristics and flotation chemistry provided a basic understanding that led to the development of SFPG's N2TEC flotation technology. This paper discusses the development of this technology and compares the results with conventional flotation practice. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Novel Method for Heap Biooxidation of Sulfide Concentrates:</B><BR>
<I>J. W. Shield, R. M. Crowell, C. E. Johansson and W. J. Kohr, GeoBiotics, Hayward, CA
Refractory sulfide flotation or gravity gold concentrates are coated onto support rocks and heap biooxidized. The coating is typically less than 0.05 in. thick and the support rock is 0.25 to 0.75 in. diameter. The exposed coating of sulfides reduces biooxidation rate limitations due to oxygen mass transfer. The large spaces between coated rocks reduces resistance to fluid percolation and aeration in the heap. The costs are significantly less than for concentrate biooxidation in stirred tanks. Subsequent gold recoveries exceed those seen in whole ore heap biooxidation and are comparable to stirred tank biooxidation processes. Laboratory and pilot test results indicate this is a viable technology for pretreating sulfide refractory gold ores.

<I>C. E. Semler, Semler Materials Services, Columbus, OH and H. J. H. Pieterse and R. A. Williams, Barrick Goldstrike Mines, Inc., Elko, NV
This paper reviews the knowledge and experience gained at Barrick Goldstrike Mines, Inc., regarding brickwork linings for pressure oxidation autoclaves. A 5-year test program, involving on-line, in-vessel sample exposure, has provided valuable information about the relative performance of a variety of brick and mortar products, for actual processing conditions. Brick and mortar properties, before and after autoclave exposure, will be presented and discussed. The program has resulted in multiple benefits, including development of a new mortar, improved understanding of brick property requirements, and an increase in the autoclave operating time between maintenance shutdowns. Further lining improvements are expected in the future, as the test program continues.

<I>J. Drelich, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT and A. Kwiatkowski, J. Kapczynski, J. F. Biernat and J. Hupka, Technical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland</I></FONT><BR>
The Cu(II) ions transfer rate was studied in a bulk liquid membrane system of an ammoniacal solution of Cu(II) as the feed, aromatic solvent as the membrane with dissolved  1-phenylo-1, 3-tetradekadione as the carrier, and a hydrochloric acid solution as the stripping phase. It was found that at the steady state the Cu(II) ions transport occurs at a constant rate. The transport phenomenon is stimulated by Cu(II) complex formation with b-diketones and ammonia molecules. The principal resistance to the transport of the Cu (II) ions remains at the membrane/stripping solution interface. </P>

<I>T. J. Vargas, M. N. Herrera, B. N. Escobar, N. Parra and C. Gonzalez, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile</I></FONT><BR>
The bioleaching of mineral sulfide pulps in a bench-scale rotating drum reactor has been studied. The reactor includes horizontal paddles in the inner wall for lifting of the mineral pulp. The performance of the reactor was tested in the bioleaching of a -400 mesh refractory pyritic gold concentrate in the presence of a pure Thiobacillus ferrooxidans strain (ATCC 19859). The concentrate was efficiently bioleached at 50% pulp density with the drum operating at a rotating speed of 0.5 rpm. Attempts of bioleaching the concentrate at  the same pulp density in conventional stirred reactor showed severe inhibition of bacterial activity. The results show that the drum reactor allows to operate at much higher pulp densities than the conventional stirred tank reactor. This behavior is explained in terms of an improvement of the bacterial activity due to a better control of the attrition of the mineral particles. </P>

<I>E. Molleman and T. van Sandwijk, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands and G. Van Weert, ORETOME, Ltd., Caledon East, ON, Canada</I></FONT><BR>
This paper reports on testwork exploring the dissolution/reprecipitation reactions: ZnS + 2HCl+ , ZnCl2 + H2S, as part of a process for the production of pure ZnS. In spheroidal form, this would constitute a premium form of zinc refinery roaster feed enabling the production of pure ZnO. The research focused on the influence of proton activity on dissolution of zinc concentrates from Brunswick M&S, Red Dog and Tara. The results and thermodynamic data suggest that the three concentrates contained significant amounts of the more reactive mineral wurtzite, although XRD analysis showed mainly the presence of the mineral sphalerite. </P>

<I>M. G. Ascher and K. L. Purdy, BHP Copper Inc., San Manuel, AZ</I></FONT><BR>
Laboratory electrorefining testing requires a number of factors to be taken into consideration. A few types of laboratory electrorefining tests are described and compared. The design and operation of a full length laboratory electrorefining test setup at BHP San Manuel Metallurgical Laboratories is discussed. Typical problems encountered are presented with a  discussion of solutions used to overcome them. Typical lab results are compared to commercial scale results to show the usefulness of this technique. </P>

<I>Y. C. Guan and K. N. Han, South Dakota School of MInes and Technology, Rapid City, SD</I></FONT><BR>
The leaching kinetics of chalcopyrite in ammonium iodide solutions with iodine has been studied using rotating disc. The variables studied include the concentration of lixiviants, rotating speed, pH of the solution, and reaction temperature. The leaching rate was found to be independent with the disc rotating speed, and a half order with respect to the iodine concentration. The apparent activation energy was measured to be about 5 kJ/mole under the conditions studied. Experimental findings were described by a kinetic model.</P>

<I>J. B. Hiskey, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ and C. E. James, Phelps Dodge Corp. Morenci, AZ</I></FONT><BR>
Diagnostic leaching tests have proved to be an invaluable analytical procedure for gold ores. The success of these techniques is remarkable in that gold ores are typically extremely dilute. This paper presents a diagnostic leaching protocol developed for low-grade copper bearing materials. The procedure employs the application of increasingly stronger lixiviants and can either be applied individually or in a sequential fashion. A benefit of this procedure is that it provides considerable information regarding sample mineralogy. Results are presented for different samples of copper mill tailings containing between 0.168 and 0.225% copper. </P>

<I>D. H. Flinn and R. H. Yoon, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA</I></FONT><BR>
In the absence of a reliable technique to directly measure forces between an air bubble and a solid in water, it was believed that force measurements in which a hydrophobic solid is substituted for an air bubble may provide valuable information. An atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to measure forces between a bare silica surface and a hydrophobized glass sphere in the presence of dodecylamine hydrochloride (DAHCl) at several pH's. The results show general agreement between that appearance of long-range, non-DLVO forces and an increase in floatability, which further suggests that long-range hydrophobic forces are necessary to achieve good flotation.

<I>S. Veeramasuneni and Y. Hu, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, M. R. Yalamanchili, MEMC Electronic Materials Inc., St. Peters, MO and J. D. Miller, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT</I></FONT><BR>
The interaction of soluble salt particles in their saturated brines is of interest from both a fundamental and practical perspective. The state of particle dispersion/aggregation can now be described based on non-equilibrium electrokinetic measurements for alkaline halides. Based on these surface charge results, the extent of interaction of alkali halide particles in their saturated solutions was examined by optical microscopy. These microscopic observations indicate that the sign of the surface charge has significant effect on the extent of particle dispersion/aggregation. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is now begin used to directly measure the interaction forces responsible for the stability of these alkali halide aggregates observed in optical microscopy studies. Finally, these experimental results are described based on the interfacial polar interaction theory. In this regard the nature and the type of interaction forces are examined to improve our understanding of interparticle forces prevailing at high ionic strengths. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>SIMS Study of Adsorption of Collectors on Pyrite: </B><BR>
<I>D. R. Nagaraj and J. S. Brinen, Cytec Industries, Stamford, CT</I></FONT><BR>
Adsorption of sulfide collectors such as xanthate on pyrite has been the subject of extensive studies over several decades using a wide variety of techniques. In spite of this, there are are many unanswered questions as to the identity of adsorbed species on pyrite surfaces. For example, though there is general agreement for the formation of dixanthogen, there is no agreement with regard to the formation of an iron xanthate complex. Far less known in non-xanthate collector systems. We have used Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS) successfully in the past to obtain direct evidence for the identity of the adsorbed collector species on copper sulfides, galena and Cu-activated quartz. The present study is an extension of the SIMS analysis to investigate the adsorption of sulfide collectors on pyrite.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>The Effect of Hydrophobic Agglomerant on the Flotation of Fine Molybdenite: </B><BR>
<I>R. Stocker and S. Catro, Universidad de Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile and J. S. Laskowski, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada</I></FONT><BR>
Flotation recovery of molybdenite particles finer than 15 microns sharply decrease with decreasing size. A totally hydrophobic latex agglomerant (UBC-1), which was previously reported to be very efficient in agglomerating hydrophobic coal particles, has been found to agglomerate such fine molybdenite particles. The agglomeration takes place only in the presence of MIBC which is commonly used as a frother in molybdenite flotation. Adsorption tests confirmed that MIBC is adsorbed onto molybdenite. The use of both UBC-1 agglomerant and MIBC resulted in much improved flotation recoveries of fine molybdenite.

<I>Y. Akin, I. Gulgonul, and M. S. Celik, Instanbul Technical University, Instanbul, Turkey</I></FONT><BR>
The floatability of a typical boron mineral, colemanite (Ca2B6O11.5H2O), is shown to be hindered by the presence of montmorillonite type clay minerals. The clay is found to act in the form of slime coating. The mechanism of slime coating is investigated using pure colemanite and clay and their mixtures with an anionic reagent in a microflotation cell. Adsorption, flotation, solubility, zeta potential and scanning electron microscope studies reveal that slime coating occurs through electrostatic attraction. It is possible to minimize the effect of slime coating either at high surfactant concentration or at high pH values. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Carrying Capacity in a Pilot Flotation Column: </B><BR>
<I>M. T. Ityokumbul and M. P. Trubelja, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA</I></FONT><BR>
Concentrate flow rates have been measured for the flotation of -100 mesh Lower Kittaning coal in a computer-controlled 0.076 m x 3.5 m pilot flotation column. The variables studied were recovery zone height (0.43 m - 2.36 m), air flow rate (1 - 6 1pm), and solid feed concentration (2.5% - 10% solids). The size distribution of concentrate and tailings samples were determined. The results obtained show that the concentrate flow rate was independent of collection zone height, but dependent on the gas flow rate, solid loading and particle size. The results obtained are compared with correlations currently available for predicting carrying capacity in column flotation. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>An Investigation of a Novel Concept for Mineral Liberation Analysis: </B><BR>
<I>K. V. S. Sastry, University of California, Berkeley, CA</I></FONT><BR>
Quantitative information concerning the state mineral liberation is extremely helpful for the design, development and control of mineral processing operations. Currently available methods include microscopy techniques followed by image analysis and physical methods of size and heavy liquid separation. Both methods tend to be slow and are limited to off-line. This paper will describe a novel concept for mineral liberation analysis which can be performed in a few minutes and has potential for on-line application. The technique is based on classifying the particles based on their size and a discriminating property, like stokes diameter, and mathematically transforming such information to yield weight-size-composition information. The paper will discuss the relevant mathematical details and will present results from preliminary experimental investigations that demonstrate the successful application of the concept. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Development of a Detection Method for Measuring Scale Growth Rates in Real Time: </B><BR>
<I>J. P. Chamberlain and P. R. Kraus, Nalco Chemical Co., Naperville, IL</I></FONT><BR>
A new technology for measuring scale growth rates in real time has been developed. This technology is useful for 1) determining the scaling tendency of mineral processing waters, especially when changes in the process affect previously stable process solution, and 2) determining antiscalant performance quantitatively in real plant conditions. This new method can be used in place of the existing technique of monitoring scale growth on metal coupons placed in the plant process water. This paper describes the development of this technology with emphasis on results from field trials at US and Chilean copper concentrators.

<I>P. L. Dunn, E. B. Cruz, G. H. Luttrell and G. T. Adel, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA</I></FONT><BR>
Automatic control of fine coal cleaning circuits has traditionally been limited by the lack of sensors for on-line ash analysis. Although several nuclear-based analyzers are available, none have seen widespread acceptance. In this investigation, image analysis technology is used for on-line determination of ash content in fine coal slurries. The ash content of a flotation tailings stream is correlated to the mean gray level of the slurry. Calibration data obtained from in-plant testing indicate that the sensor is accurate to within 62% ash over a range from 65-85% ash. Sensor development and in-plant testing are discussed.

EIMCO Process Equipment Co has introduced the new SmartCell series of conventional flotation cells. The flagship of this new development is the 4500 ft3 cell that is the largest operating cell available in the industry. This new series of cells includes a cylindrical tank design, a conical draft tube and froth crowder. Optional air control, wash water addition and embedded expert control are available. A discussion of design parameters, energy efficiency, testing results of features and commercial plant results are presented. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>The Use of Taguchi Methods and Computer Techniques for Research and Process Improvement: </B><BR>
<I>C. Flores and K. L. Purdy, BHP Copper Inc., San Manuel, AZ</I></FONT><BR>
The most common experimental approach of study one variable at a time while holding all others constant is extremely inefficient. Use of statistical methods enables engineers and scientists to obtain meaningful information with the fewest experiments, reducing cost and waste effort. In particular, Taguchi methods can be more efficient than traditional full factorial experiment designs, as they can study more variables with fewer runs, and they are more robust against process "noise". Taguchi designs are also simple to formulate and the results can be analyzed by simple PC spreadsheets. The role and benefits of using Taguchi methods in experiments for development and process optimization are discussed. 

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Process Control System Utilization and Equipment Reliability Maintenance: </B><BR>
<I>O. A. Bascur, OSI Software, Inc., The Woodlands, TX and D. R. Potts, Meridium, Roanoke, VA</I></FONT><BR>
Most mining and metallurgical plants have developed predictive maintenance policies based on statistical analysis and specialized techniques, like vibration analysis, oil and lube analysis for critical equipment. Process control strategies have also been installed in several metallurgical sites. These control strategies require instrumentation maintenance from local personnel. The availability of real time and process history to identify the most critical part of the processing system from mechanical integrity is a must for global plant optimization. Specialized performance control monitoring algorithms are required to justify their existence and contribution to the bottom line. Emerging technologies are allowing to combine these techniques into a single total plant system. Tools are required to assist in troubleshooting and adapting these process control instruments and strategies. The key is both plant equipment and process control availability and utuilziation rather than just maintenance.

<I>L. R. Chirinos and K. N. Batallanos, BHP Tintaya SA, Arequipa, Peru and M. P. Neira and M. A. Eamon, BHP Copper, Tucson, AZ</I></FONT><BR>
The Tintaya mine of BHP Copper, located in Southern Peru, includes a copper oxide deposit hosted in a mineralized skarn zone. The ore contains high clays and high acid consuming species resulting in low heap leaching performance. A treatment scheme was adopted that included a wet screening separation. The coarse fraction would be treated in heaps and the fines by agitation leaching, the dissolved copper would then be recovered through SXEW. Testwork determined the optimum heap leaching conditions to treat the oxide in on/off pads of 3 meters height with an initial acid cure followed by a variable acid strength during irrigation. The method resulted in a reduced acid consumption and good copper recoveries.

<I>. V. M. Torres, A. Viana Jr., P. R. M. Andrade and N. J. Duarte, Cia Vale Do Rio Doce, Santa Luzia-MG, Brazil</I></FONT><BR>
The presence of high fluorine levels in copper concentrates affects the conventional sulfuric acid units usually integrated with copper smelters. Consequently, penalties are applied to high fluorine concentrates prices. Several process alternatives to this problem were studied at CVRD Technology Center, in Brazil. A hydrometallurgical process of removing fluorine and upgrading copper concentrates was developed and is presented in this paper.

<I>C. G. Anderson, H. A. Simons Ltd., Vancouver, BC, Canada</I></FONT><BR>
In the majority of operations recovering gold and silver by hydrometallurgical means cyanide is the predominant lixiviant. However, production of massive quantities of silver chloride as an important intermediate processing compound was done on an industrial scale in the nitrous-sulfuric acid pressure leaching of a refractory precious metals concentrate. This proven process required no cyanide. Thus, because of the large volumes encountered during day-to-day operation, the need for efficient and low cost methods of silver chloride precipitation, reduction and materials handling was mandatory. This presentation will cover the evolution of plant scale precipitation, filtration, washing, reduction and control  of silver chloride processing. As well, an in-depth description of the unique leaching system will also be included.

A study consist in 20 column leach tests were performed for the "El Arco" copper ore deposit, located on Baja California, Mexico. The main purpose was to define the basic criteria like recovery and sulfuric acid consumption, for a commercial heap leach system designed to process the oxide copper (Chrysocola) of the deposit. Leach parameters such as, amount of sulfuric acid in the cure solution, cure technique, particle size of the material, leach solution's flowrate application, leach solution's acid strength and height of the lifts, were evaluated to choose those parameters in which the results were the best ones for that particular design.

<I>J. E. Tilk  and W. T. Williams, Copper Range Co., White Pine, MI</I></FONT><BR>
Copper Range Company, White Pine, Michigan, is constructing a solution mining pilot plant at its Southeast No. 1 facilities. The plant will produce one million pounds of cathode copper per year at a designed flow rate of 150 gpm. Challenges in the underground construction of the plant comprise of drilling and blasting of the existing pillars, building concrete walls to contain the solution within designated areas, and installing an infrastructure including more than 50,000 ft of pipes, six pump stations and various controls to maintain a constant flow rate.

<I>M. P. Neira, BHP Copper, Tucson, AZ, T. D. McWaters, BHP Copper N.A., Miami, AZ and  C. Flores and R. Patel, BHP Copper N. A., San Manuel, AZ</I></FONT><BR>
In situ leaching of copper from chalcocite relies on ferric iron concentration in the lixiviant being reduced to ferrous. To re-establish the ferric concentration in solution, ferrous  must be re-oxidized to ferric. This reaction is slow under normal chemical conditions but it is catalyzed by Thiobacillus ferrooxidans bacteria. BHP Copper's Miami In situ unit developed a bio-reactor as a method of oxidizing ferrous to ferric. Testwork defined the effects on oxidation of temperature. CO2, oxygen, and air injection flow rate. This paper summarizes the results of ferrous bio-oxidation using plastic column packing and oxide ores as bio-reactors and the leaching results of the bio-reacted lixiviant on chalcocite ores.

<I>W. R. Boltin, T. B. Vander Wood, J. P. Bradley and L. P. Keller, MVA Inc., Norcross, GA and R. J. Pruett, ECC Int'l., Sandersville, GA</I></FONT><BR>
Aspect ratio (diameter thickness) measurements on clay minerals have typically involved manual electron microscopy analyses of shadowed particles in order to measure both platelet thickness and diameter. Recent advances in automated microanalysis technology and in applications of parallel electron energy loss spectroscopy (PEELS) have led to the development of new techniques that allow for more economical aspect ratio determinations.

<I>J. J. Kellar, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Rapid City, SD</I></FONT><BR>
A tremendous amount of minerals are used as filler materials in a wide variety of industries including pulp/paper, automobile, computer and electronic industries. Oftentimes these fillers are given treatments which modify the surface properties of the filler. Many of these surface treatments are similar to those used during froth flotation. In this presentation the surface treatments given to fillers for the polymer industry will be reviewed. This review will compare the analysis of surface treatments traditionally performed by the flotation chemist with that required for surface treated fillers for polymeric materials. Particular attention will be given to spectroscopic, wetting and adhesive characteristics of the fillers after surface treatment.

<I>M. A. D. Azevedo, J. Drelich, M. R. Yalamanchili and J. D. Miller, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT</I></FONT><BR>
The major non-fiber material present in paper is starch, which is added to improve the inert-fiber bonding and also helps to increase the retention of mineral fillers in the cellulose fibers. In order to develop an efficient de-inking flotation process for the separation of ink particles from wastepaper pulp, it is important to understand the surface chemistry of filler materials and their interactions with cellulose fibers. In this regard, diffuse reflectance (DRIFT) is being used to study adsorption phenomena and particle interactions involved in these systems.

Magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2) is important industrially for its flame-retardant properties as a filler in high-temperature polymers. Surfactants are often applied to increase dispersion and improve adhesion between filler and polymer. The study of surface modified Mg (OH)2 interfaces has been limited by the availability of substrates suitable for many analytical techniques. To help alleviate this problem, three approaches to Mg(OH)2 substrate synthesis have been developed: hydration of MgO crystals; Mg(OH)2 sol-gel thin film dip-coating; and hydration of a magnesium metal disk. The synthesized Mg(OH)2 layers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and Raman spectroscopy before and after adsorption of the surfactants.

<I>B. Markovic, T. Chen and P. Somasundaran, Columbia University, New York, NY</I></FONT><BR>
Performance of mineral filler particles in ceramic applications can be modified drastically by adsorbing polymers of optimum molecular structure and dosage. In this work, a novel scheme of controlled polymer adsorption is used to produce nanocomposite of unique core-shell designs. Towards this purpose, adsorption and desorption behavior of selected polyacrylic acids on three minerals (alumina, titania, and silicon carbide) was examined as a function of relevant parameters. Adsorption of PAA was found to depend markedly on polymer molecular weight, pH, as well as solid loading. Specifically, the adsorption density was found to increase with increase in polymer molecular weight for non-porous alumina while it was found to decrease systematically in the case of porous alumina. This was attributed to the inaccessibility of the pores to the higher molecular polymers. Interestingly, the adsorption density of PAA was found to change when the solid loading was increased. PAA adsorbs on silicon carbide only at low pH values when the particles have very low surface charge suggesting that the adsorption in this case is controlled by electrostatic forces. Using polyacrylic acid as bridging agent between the alumina fillers (core) and nanosize alumina or titania particles (shells), controlled layer by layer deposition of nanoparticle on the core particle surface could be obtained.

<I>S. Mathur and B. M. Moudgil, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL</I></FONT><BR>
Development of robust reagent schemes for processes such as flotation and selective flocculation require that the adsorption mechanisms of surfactants, polymers and other additives which comprise the reagent suite, are well understood. Specifically, adsorption of polymeric additives is attributed to a combination of chemical and electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals forces. Hydrogen bonding, however, is suspected to be a cause of most of the non-selectivity observed in polymer adsorption on fine particles. Since there is evidence in the literature to the contrary, a systematic study was undertaken to investigate the adsorption of a non-ionic polymer - polyethylene oxide (PEO) on several oxides and silicates. It was determined that strong Bronsted acid sites on the surface interact with the ether oxygen, a Lewis base, of PEO to cause adsorption and subsequently flocculation of the substrate particles. The other possible mechanisms such as complexation with adsorbed ions and electrostatic interactions were found not to play a major role in the PEO adsorption process. In this presentation, the adsorption and flocculation studies of oxides and silicates with PEO will be discussed.

<I>J. Drelich, L. Chen, J. D. Miller, and S. Guruswamy, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT</I></FONT><BR>
The adsorption of oleic acid at the surface of titanium dioxide from aqueous solutions was examined by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy using an internal reflection element coated with a thin film of TiO2. Thin film with a thickness of 100-200A was deposited on the surface of a germanium single crystal by RF magnetron reactive sputtering. It was found that adsorption of oleic acid on the surface of TiO2 thin film occurs at neutral pH, from about pH=5.5 to pH=8.0. The electrostatic interaction between carboxylic group of oleic acid and the hydroxylated surface of titanium dioxide appears to be the dominant driving force stimulating the adsorption mechanism in this system.

<I>L. B. Hales, R. P. Klepper, and M. G. Nelson, EIMCO Process Equipment, Salt Lake City, UT</I></FONT><BR>
Large thickener sizing and control traditionally have been independent activities and lack automated controls. Developments in flocculation optimization, instrumentation to detect solids and computer process control technologies have lead to the acceptance of high rate and high density thickeners for tailings disposal as a paste. These thickeners are smaller than conventional thickeners and require automated continuous process control This paper describes the "Embedded Smart Control" system used by EIMCO to optimzie thickener performance.

<I>O. A. Bascur, OSI Software, Inc., The Woodlands, TX</I></FONT><BR>
Intelligent systems (IS) technologies have received much attention in a wide range of process engineering applications including process operations. With the revolutionary progress in information and computer technologies applying the latest technologies in metallurgical complexes has become a serious challenge to both management and technical teams. Objects and components are changing the way everyone relates to their computer and networks. Goals of real time performance monitoring includes maximizing the profitability by maximizing production, improving efficiency, attending product quality, costs, maintenance, environmental and safety regulations. Designers must consider the greatly expanded desktop computing, Microsoft object technology, Internet and how to build these systems. This paper discusses some opportunities and challenges using objects, components in designing applications and integrating intelligent systems tools. Two examples using performance equations and IS technologies applied to mineral processing are presented.

<I>M. J. Laurila, Quality Control, Inc., Lake Zurich, IL</I></FONT><BR>
On-line analyzers have made possible the use of Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) for local control applications in coal preparation plants. This includes FLC control of complete circuits such as heavy media vessels, cyclones and froth flotation. This paper outlines the control strategies employed and presents examples of automatic vs. manual control.

<I>C. L. Karr, B. Weck and K. Nishita, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL</I></FONT><BR>
Researchers at the University of Alabama are investigating artificial intelligence based computer models of mineral processing systems. Two approaches have been found to be particularly effective in the development of data-driven computer models. The first approach employs neural networks which are computational paradigms based on the mechanics of the human brain. The second approach combines fuzzy mathematics with genetic algorrithms to produce an adaptive modeling system. In this paper, the two approaches to modeling are compared and contrasted with respect to accuracy, computational time, and the man hours required to model three mineral processing systems: 1) a grinding circuit, 2) a hydrocyclone separator, and 3) a flotation circuit.

Using a fuzzy logic controller, a signal applied on the processes may be generated through a linguistic protocol expressing an operators intuitive control strategies. In this paper, fuzzy logic controller and PID controller imposed upon the feedback liquid level control systems for a stirred tank are studied and compared. The construction factors including shape of membership functions, number of fuzzy variables, number of inputs, number of rules, and different defuzzification methods are considered in design and formulating the fuzzy logic control strategies and algorithms. From the analysis of the strategies and control performances, an optimum controller may be generated by making use of the best combinations of these fuzzy construction factors.

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Capital Budgeting: Forecasting the Future:</B><BR>
<I>D. K. Dysinger, Montana Tech of the University of Montana, Butte, MT</I></FONT><BR>
Capital budgeting is an investment making process to quantify, evaluate, and compare competing investment alternatives for maximizing the value of shareholder wealth. The absolute and relative values of the components of cash flow, revenue, operating costs, taxes, general and administrative costs, and the costs of capital, are uncertain across time. The degree of uncertainty is the basis of investment risk. Mineral investment is both long term and capital intensive and techniques for reducing uncertainty can have a particularly beneficial effect on the present value of shareholder wealth. The paper discusses and compares a number of tools for quantifying and reducing uncertainty in the decision making process.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Does the Capital Budgeting Process Inhibit Corporate Competitiveness?:</B><BR>
<I>B. W. Cavender, BHP Copper Inc., San Manuel, AZ</I></FONT><BR>
Capital investments are made for a variety of purposes, from providing incremental capacity at existing operations to developing and implementing new technologies intended to radically improve a company's capabilities. These projects generate very different business opportunities and create value in distinctive ways. For incremental improvements, the capital budgeting process assures at least a loose fit between short-term goals and readily available resources. However, the criteria used to evaluate capital projects often prevent a company from committing to more aggressive goals that lie beyond the firm's current abilities or resources. Such projects may not have clearly identifiable future cash flows, and the degree of interaction with other projects and the nature of the risk incurred may be very difficult to estimate. Additionally, by focusing only on quantifiable benefits, the budgeting process often fails to recognize "soft" improvements such as increased operating flexibility or new knowledge generated by such projects. By rejecting these projects, the capital budgeting process may actually harm the company's future competitive position.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Mining Financial Project Evaluation and Global Community:</B><BR>
<I>A. N. T. Lopes, SOMINCOR, Lisboa, Portugal</I></FONT><BR>
Financial Project Evaluation methods, which objectives are sufficient for strict corporate purposes, attempt to provide some measures of the financial attractiveness of a project to the company. Now, mining industry is more and more involved in fighting for its place and image to the society, which implies the assumption not only of its projects environmental costs internalization, but also of the consequences of the way society continues to see mining, with the risks involved to the project. It still supervenes that the mining industry has accepted a re-intensified mission to show clearly in a political and social way to serve the community. This paper intends to address the financial project evaluation methods complementary work in order to obtain the overall evaluation of projects taking in account the global community. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>NPV or IRR? Why Not Both?:</B><BR>
<I>T. F. Torries, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV</I></FONT><BR>
The primary merit criteria used by the mining industry is IRR rather than NPV, although NPV is favored by academicians. While IRR does provide a measure of capital efficiency, which NPV does not, IRR cannot measure additions to wealth, may yield multiple solutions, and may result in non-NPV consistent project ranking. This paper discusses the goals of managers, compares NPV and IRR, and makes conclusions about the preferred measure. Conclusions are that managers require both measures, NPV suffers the same multiple root problem as does IRR, and the employment of incremental IRR to reach NPV consistent project ranking is unnecessary. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>One Project, Two Discount Rates:</B><BR>
<I>G. A. Davis, Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO</I></FONT><BR>
The development timing of a mineral project often depends on its value, where positive NPV projects are developed immediately. Option pricing theory finds that it is better to wait until the NPV of the property is significantly greater than zero before developing it. This paper converts this vague development timing advice into a more concrete decision rule: develop the project when its "development timing NPV" is positive. In calculating the development timing NPV, we use a development timing discount rate that is about twice the normal valuation discount rate. Hence, for one project we need two discount rates, one for the valuation calculation, and one for the development timing decision.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Changing Trends in Aluminum End Markets:</B><BR>
<I>P. A. Dodd, Alumax, Inc., Norcross, GA</I></FONT><BR>
Aluminum end markets have undergone a significant shift since 1991. While the three major categories - building and construction, transportation, and containers and packaging - remain the dominant markets, transportation supplanted packaging as the largest market in 1994. Tremendous growth rates in transportation are due not only to healthy automobile production rates from 1992 to 1994, but also to the ongoing substitution of aluminum for steel in manufacturing autos. Meanwhile, growth in packaging slowed as aluminum captured nearly the entire beverage can market by 1990. These recent trends are likely to continue, making transportation even more dominant in the years to come. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Kaolin and Calcium Carbonate, - Markets, Supply and the Future:</B><BR>
<I>R. A. Burns, Strategic Business Development, Inc. Atlanta, GA</I></FONT><BR>
The production and sales of kaolin and calcium carbonate in North America exceeds 14 million tons in higher value market segments. With a few exceptions, the markets supplied exhibit mature growth rates. In some market sectors, technology changes have and continue to occur shifting pigment-type consumption and growth. New sources of supply will impact current businesses. New product and process developments for kaolin and calcium carbonates are continuing. Each of these issues is examined in developing a view of the future for kaolin and calcium carbonate in North America.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Rail Renaissance - New Opportunities:</B><BR>
<I>D. Bourquard, Norfolk Southern Corp., Norfolk, VA</I></FONT><BR>
In the last decade there have been great changes in the rail cost function driven by innovation and technology. Some of these are obvious and evolutionary - like better materials, larger cars, and more efficient locomotives. Others are unexpected and revolutionary like the use of satellites, the Internet, total supply chain analysis and deregulation. The result is a revised portfolio of situations where rail is the optimum transport choice versus truck, water, or other substitutes. New patterns of mineral production, processing and consumption result. Today's Engineers need to be aware of the new rail possibilities as they locate facilities and design terminals. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>Copper's Evolving Role in End-use Markets:</B><BR>
<I>W. T. Black, Copper Development Assoc. Inc., New York, NY</I></FONT><BR>
Although serving downstream applications for over 10,000 years - 4,000 years longer than man's second oldest metal, gold - copper continues to adapt to the modern world. In fact, despite its long history of use and re-use as our most recycled engineering metal, more than 80% of the copper ever used has been mined and placed in service since World War II. The paper will delineate the most important end-use applications for copper, and discuss the important trends in each, including relationships with competing materials and technologies. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>The United States Fertilizer Manufacturer - An Endangered Species:</B><BR>
<I>K. F. Nyiri, Mississippi Chemical Corp., Yazoo City, MS</I></FONT><BR>
The United States is the world's largest fertilizer manufacturer and the second largest consumer. Access to relatively cheap, locally produced raw materials and a large backyard marketplace have allowed the US fertilizer manufacturers to supply the bulk of their domestic fertilizer requirements, as well as become a dominant player in world trade. But changes in transportation economics are eroding these advantages. Imports of fertilizer raw materials and finished products are increasing. As the worldwide mineral industry expands to satisfy existing and future demand, the position of the US as the leader in world fertilizer production and trade is being challenged. </P>

<p>If you have any ad review or creation responsibilities, you will benefit from regularly reading the 
articles and news found in <b>Advertising Compliance Service</b>. Did you know, for example, that 
one large advertising agency recently settled Federal Trade Commission charges over that ad 
agency's role in creating certain ads? <b>Advertising Compliance Service</b> subscribers know all 
about it. For a brief online discussion of that FTC case, see the <a href="june.htm"><em>June 1996</em></a> news briefs at this 
Web Site.</p>
<p>For a real eye-opener as to what fate awaits many advertising agencies and other advertisers who 
fail to comply with the Federal Trade Commission's rules, check out this <a href="money.htm">list of costly fines and 
penalties</a> assessed in FTC decisions and in court cases against advertising agencies and 
advertisers as reported in <b>Advertising Compliance Service</b>.</p>

&nbsp; <p align=center><font size=5><strong>YOU FACE $11,000 PENALTY PER VIOLATION FOR UNSUBSTANTIATED WEB SITE AD
CLAIMS: FTC CASE </strong></font></center></p>


<P>Many Internet advertisers probably don't realize that their ads on the Net face civil penalties of $11,000 per violation for false claims. One webvertiser recently learned that lesson: It entered a consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that contains the standard FTC "warning" about what could occur in the future:


        <P>"NOTE: A consent agreement is for settlement purposes only and
        does not constitute an admission of a law violation. When the
        Commission issues a consent order on a final basis, it carries
        the force of law with respect to future actions. Each violation
        of such an order may result in a civil penalty of $11,000."

<P>[<a href="money.htm">For a look at some of FTC's past penalties, click here.</a>]

<P>Ads for the "Koolatron" appeared on the Internet's World Wide Web. Ads
for the product were also disseminated by direct mail and through print
ads in newspapers and magazines. These ads contained the following
allegedly false and unsubstantiated claims: 

        "Imagine the versatility and convenience of a cooler that
        worked like a refrigerator. You could have ice-cold drinks at
        softball games, enjoy a picnic without soggy or spoiled food,
        even store insulin or other medicine that needs to be
        refrigerated. Now, imagine that this cooler that worked like a
        refrigerator could also heat food. In fact, according to the
        complaint, the Koolatron's cold storage temperature is highly
        dependent on outside air or room temperatures, and in many
        circumstances it will not maintain cold storage temperatures
        comparable to a home refrigerator. Further, the Koolatron is
        primarily designed to maintain the cool or warm temperatures of
        items that were already cool or warm before being placed in the
        device, and its ability to cool down warm food or heat up cold
        food is limited. It may take up to twelve hours or more for the
        Koolatron to cool down a warm item or heat up a cold item. Just
        plug it in. Koolatron plugs directly into your vehicle's
        cigarette lighter and uses less power than a taillight. If you
        leave it plugged in while the vehicle is off, it will consume
        only three amps of power. Unplugged, Koolatron will hold its
        cooling capacity for up to 24 hours."


<P>But FTC's complaint charged that, in most instances, once unplugged
from a power source, the Koolatron won't hold its cooling capacity for
24 hours, and operating the Koolatron off a car battery when the car is
not running may drain the car battery of all power in as little as
three hours. FTC's complaint also charged that the advertiser
deceptively failed to disclose that use of the Koolatron to cool or
warm perishable food may, in certain circumstances, pose a risk of
buildup of harmful or unsafe bacteria on the food, since in its cooling
mode the device may not always hold food at proper refrigeration
temperatures, and in its warming mode the device does not reach a high
enough holding temperature to kill or prevent the growth of bacteria on
food. 

<P>The proposed settlement would bar the advertiser from misrepresenting
"the comparative or absolute ability of such product to refrigerate or
cool food items or medicines or to maintain proper cold storage
temperatures; the comparative or absolute ability of such product to
heat or warm food items; the comparative or absolute ability of such
product to hold its cooling capacity after being unplugged from a power
source; or the effect of operating such product off a car battery when
the car is not running."
 
<P>The advertiser would also be barred from making claims "about safety or
efficacy, unless, at the time the claim is made, it has competent and
reliable evidence that substantiates the claim." Also, the advertiser
would be barred from making "any claim about the effectiveness or
usefulness of Koolatron or any substantially similar product for use in
cooling or warming food unless it also discloses the potential food
safety risks associated with use of the product."

<P>[The next issue of <STRONG>Advertising Compliance Service</STRONG> also contains an
extended examination of a similar FTC case, which also involved TV and
direct mail ads.]

Comprehensive advertising compliance information emphasizing the practical <br>
analysis of government, industry and media restrictions on advertising <br>
<hr size=3>
<p><U><B>FROM THE EDITOR IN CHIEF</B></U> </p>
<p>In its largest law enforcement action against fraud on the Internet, FTC obtained a 
federal court order temporarily halting an alleged pyramid scheme advertised on 
the Internet. Our lead article, &quot;FTC Halts Alleged Internet Advertising Scheme,&quot; 
reports on this recent FTC action. </p>
<p>Political speech goes to the very heart of what the Constitution's framers intended 
to protect by the First Amendment. When that speech is political speech by 
candidates for public office, the freedom to speak also goes to the very essence 
of free elections. So governmental restrictions on such speech are indeed a rarity. 
That didn't stop Minnesota, however, from adopting a statute that actually 
criminalizes certain types of political speech, specifically, paid political advertising. 
And one politician found himself facing possible criminal penalties for the things 
that were said in his campaign ads. Our next article, &quot;Minn. Statute that 
Criminalizes Campaign Ads Found Unconstitutional,&quot; looks at the highlights of this 
disturbing case. </p>
<p>Our next article, &quot;Your Guide to Current Key Advertising Law Issues (Part 
Two),&quot; examines many of the key issues confronting advertisers, advertising 
agencies and their counsel as we approach the millennium. </p>
<p>Our next article, &quot;What's Marketing's Speed Limit on the Information 
Superhighway?,&quot; looks at some of the speed limits and speed traps for marketers 
as they enter the Brave New World of Internet and World Wide Web 
advertising. </p>
<p>Our final article, &quot;CDA Lawsuit: An Update,&quot; is an update of recent legal 
developments in the landmark challenge to the &quot;Communications Decency Act.&quot; </p>

<hr size=3>
<p><U><B>BRIEF NEWS OF NOTE</B></U> </p>
<p><U><B>FTC FINAL ORDER INVOLVES CAUSE-RELATED MARKETING 
CLAIMS</B></U>--FTC gave its final OK to a consent agreement with Benckiser 
Consumer Products, Inc., of Danbury, Connecticut, settling charges that it made 
false and misleading &quot;cause-related marketing&quot; claims for its &quot;EarthRite&quot; line of 
household cleaning products. The order bars Benckiser from misrepresenting that 
a portion of the revenue from the sale of any household cleaning product is 
donated to any organization. If Benckiser chooses to claim that it donates some 
portion of revenue to an organization, the order requires Benckiser to clearly and 
prominently disclose the method of determining the amount of the donation. </p>
<p>(<I>Benckiser Consumer Products, Inc</I>., FTC Dkt. No. C-3659, May 24, 1996; 
materials relating to this FTC matter are available on the Internet at FTC's World 
Wide Web site at: <a href="http://www.ftc.gov"> http://www.ftc.gov</a>.) </p>
<p><B>NOTE:</B> A consent agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not 
constitute an admission of a law violation. When the Commission issues a consent 
order on a final basis, it carries the force of law with respect to future actions. 
Each violation of such an order may result in a civil penalty of $10,000. </p>
<p><U><B>CSPI ASKS FTC TO STEP UP REGULATION OF WEIGHT-LOSS 
FIRMS</B></U>--Some of the largest commercial weight-loss programs in the U.S. don't 
tell potential customers about the full costs of their services, and fail to provide 
information about how well--or how poorly--they work, according to the Center 
for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI). CSPI examined the largest weight-loss 
programs in the nation and found that some require clients to purchase 
exorbitantly priced foods, others distort the cost of mandatory fees, and none 
routinely disclose data on how much weight their clients actually lose and keep 
off. </p>
<p>CSPI and nine other health organizations, weight-loss experts, and consumer 
advocates petitioned FTC on May 29, 1996 to step up its regulation of the 
industry. </p>
<p>In visits to Washington, D.C.-area weight-loss centers, CSPI found that: </p>
<p>&quot;Jenny Craig advertises the cost of its program as `20 pounds for $20,' but 
additional food purchases of $70-$80 each week are required. Losing 20 pounds 
at 1 pounds per week (a typical rate recommended by health experts) would cost 
more than $1,000. </p>
<p>Nutri/System advertisements tell consumers that they must buy $49 worth of food 
per week, but don't reveal that signing up for the program can cost up to $299. 
The total cost for losing 20 pounds at 1 pounds per week can amount to over 
$900. </p>
<p>Physicians Weight Loss Center implies in its name that the program is supervised 
by physicians. In fact, two of the company's diet programs are not 
physician-supervised.&quot; </p>
<p>CSPI's petition urged FTC to require weight-loss firms to provide consumers with 
standardized information about cost, program duration, effectiveness, staff 
credentials, and possible health risks. The petition charged that the failure to 
disclose such information is an &quot;unfair and deceptive practice.&quot; </p>
<p>(<I>CSPI Release</I>, May 29, 1996.) </p>
<p><U><B>COURT ORDERS JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO STOP &quot;REVIEWS&quot; 
UNDER THE CDA</B></U>--Responding to a complaint filed by the Citizens Internet 
Empowerment Coalition (CIEC) and ACLU, a federal judge ordered the Justice 
Department to halt all &quot;reviews&quot; of complaints under the Communications 
Decency Act (CDA) until the three-judge panel has a chance to rule on the law's 
constitutionality. In issuing the order, Judge Stewart Dalzell said that &quot;the 
government's conduct in subjecting a content provider to private and public 
scrutiny for displaying material that is neither obscene nor child pornography 
clearly runs afoul of both this Court's orders and the government's promises.&quot; </p>
<p>CIEC and ACLU attorneys filed the compliant after several national newspapers 
reported that the FBI had started an investigation of Compuserve for alleged 
CDA violations. The FBI denies that any investigation is underway. But 
Compuserve faced a potentially damaging public relations problem because of the 
reports. </p>
<p>According to CIEC, the American Family Association (AFA) filed a complaint 
with the Justice Department &quot;accusing Compuserve of violating the CDA for 
material in a forum called MacGlamour, despite the fact that the site was labeled 
for adults only and Compuserve provides its users free software to block access 
to unwanted material.&quot; </p>
<p>(<I>CIEC Trial Update No. 12: Special Update</I>, May 16 1996; more information 
about this matter is available at CIEC's web page at http://www.cdt.org/ciec; see 
also: Advertising Compliance Service, &quot;CDA Lawsuit: An Update,&quot; Tab #15, 
New Media, Article #21.) </p>
<p><U><B>SWEEPING LEGISLATIVE RESTRICTIONS PROPOSED FOR 
ALCOHOL ADS</B></U>--Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II (D-MA) has 
introduced six bills designed to have a major impact on alcoholic beverage 
advertising. Rep. Kennedy's &quot;Children's Protection from Alcohol Advertising Act&quot; 
would exclude many advertising and marketing practices that have an impact on 
children. Kennedy's &quot;Sensible Advertising and Family Education Act&quot; (SAFE) 
would mandate that any remaining ads carry a rotating series of health and safety 
warnings. His proposed legislation would mandate that alcoholic beverage labels 
must reveal such information as ingredients, calories and alcohol content. </p>

<center><p><h3><B>FTC HALTS ALLEGED INTERNET ADVERTISING SCHEME</B> </h3></p></center>
<p><U><B>FTC's LARGEST INTERNET FRAUD ACTION</B></U> </p>
<p>In its 12th and largest law enforcement action against fraud on the Internet, FTC 
obtained a federal court order temporarily halting an alleged pyramid scheme 
advertised on the Internet. FTC estimates that the alleged scheme has already 
taken in over $6 million. The court's temporary restraining order freezes the 
defendants' assets and appoints a receiver to manage the company, called 
Fortuna Alliance. FTC wants the court to issue a permanent injunction that will 
provide redress for consumers who FTC says were victims of the alleged scam. </p>
<p><U><B>OLD AS METHUSELAH</B></U> </p>
<p>&quot;This brand new, high-tech scam is as old as Methuselah.&quot; So said Jodie 
Bernstein, Director of FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. She added: </p>
<p>&quot;Behind all the techno-jargon and the mathematical mumbo jumbo, this is just an 
elaborate, electronic version of a chain letter. People are told that if they sign up 
and send money, they'll eventually end up at the top of the pyramid, collecting 
from those at the bottom. But most people never make it to the top. Early entrants 
may make some money, but eventually, the pyramids collapse and most of the 
`members' are left holding the bag.&quot; </p>
<p><U><B>HOME PAGE ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB</B></U> </p>
<p>FTC charged that Fortuna Alliance, L.L.C., and five officers marketed the alleged 
pyramid scheme through a home page on the World Wide Web. FTC said the 
defendants used claims such as &quot;What if you paid...$250 a month which produced 
a minimum of $5,250 income each month for you, While you simply watched?,&quot; 
and &quot;Would you want to continue this arrangement while you kept earning $5,000 
a month,&quot; to induce thousands of consumers to pay between $250 and $1750 to 
join their alleged pyramid scheme by claiming that members would receive over 
$5,000 per month in &quot;profits&quot; as others were induced to &quot;enroll.&quot; In addition, 
Fortuna and its officers provided advice and promotional materials for members 
to set up their own web sites to recruit others to join the pyramid, FTC said. </p>
<p><U><B>FTC'S COMPLAINT</B></U> </p>
<p>According to FTC's complaint, most participants in a pyramid scheme lose 
money, so the claims that consumers who pay Fortuna $250 will receive high 
income or profits of over $5,000 per month are false and misleading. Also, 
providing others with promotional material that contains similar false claims for use 
in recruiting new participants, is deceptive or unfair, in violation of the law, FTC 
noted. FTC's complaint asks the court to order a permanent halt to the alleged 
deceptive practices and to order redress for the people that signed up. </p>
<p>In papers filed with the court, FTC argued that Fortuna already has taken over $6 
million from consumers, and transferred at least $3.55 million of that money to a 
bank in Antigua, W.I. The temporary restraining order directs defendants 
immediately to see that the money is returned to the U.S. </p>

<center><p><h3><B>MINN. STATUTE THAT CRIMINALIZES CAMPAIGN ADS FOUND 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL</B></h3></p></center>

<p><U><B>STATE STATUTE CRIMINALIZES CERTAIN CAMPAIGN ADS</B></U> </p>
<p>Political speech goes to the very heart of what the Constitution's framers intended 
to protect by the First Amendment. When that speech is political speech by 
candidates for public office, the freedom to speak also goes to the very essence 
of free elections. So governmental restrictions on such speech are indeed a rarity. 
That didn't stop Minnesota, however, from adopting a statute that actually 
criminalizes certain types of political speech, specifically, paid political advertising. 
And one politician found himself facing possible criminal penalties for the things 
that were said in his campaign ads. Here are the highlights of this disturbing case: </p>
<p><U><B>MINNESOTA LAW IN QUESTION</B></U> </p>
<p>The Minnesota statute at issue in this recent case is M.S. 211B.06, &quot;False 
Political and Campaign Material.&quot; Subdivision 1 of that statute makes it a gross 
misdemeanor to prepare, disseminate or broadcast certain types of paid political 
advertising. Specifically, that statute says: </p>
<p>&quot;A person is guilty of a gross misdemeanor who intentionally participates in the 
preparation, dissemination, or broadcast of paid political advertising or campaign 
material with respect to the personal or political character or acts of a candidate, 
whether or not defamatory, or with respect to the effect of a ballot questions, that 
the person knows or has reason to believe is false and that is designed or tends to 
elect, injure, or defeat a candidate for nomination or election to a public office or 
to promote or defeat a ballot questions.&quot; </p>
<p><U><B>1994 CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIG</B></U>N </p>
<p>During the 1994 campaign for the Sixth District congressional seat, Tad Jude's 
campaign broadcast a television ad that showed a Minneapolis police 
officer--appearing in a generic police uniform--reading the ad's script. The 
disputed ad's text focused on a crime that had occurred and claimed &quot;Patten may 
never have been released and this crime never committed had legislation authored 
by Tad Jude been enacted.&quot; The ad went on to claim that this legislation was 
stopped by his Congressional opponent for the Sixth District congressional seat, 
Bill Luther, and &quot;his liberal friends in the Minnesota Senate.&quot; </p>
<p><U><B>WHAT HAPPENED NEXT</B></U> </p>
<p>On November 7, 1994, Luther &quot;formally asked the Anoka County prosecutor to 
determine whether [Jude] had committed a crime.&quot; On May 2, 1995, Jude 
received a letter from Hennepin County Attorney's office telling him that they 
would now pursue Luther's complaint. On June 21, 1995, Jude interviewed with 
the Hennepin County Attorney's office. On November 28, 1995, Jude testified to 
the Hennepin County grand jury and was indicted. </p>
<p><U><B>MCLU'S AMICUS BRIEF: STATE FALSE CAMPAIGN MATERIAL LAW 
IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL</B></U> </p>
<p>On January 31, 1996, the Minnesota Civil Liberties Union announced that it 
would file an amicus brief in the criminal case against former congressional 
candidate Tad Jude in Hennepin County District Court. MCLU argued in its brief 
that even false campaign statements are entitled to constitutional protection. </p>
<p>&quot;False or controversial statements are inevitable in the heat of political discussions 
and debate,&quot; said MCLU Executive Director Michael Moore. &quot;Imposing criminal 
sanctions on candidates who make false statements in political ads has a chilling 
effect on free speech that ultimately hinders the political process far more than the 
false statements would.&quot; </p>
<p>MCLU argued that any criminal sanction for political speech is unconstitutional. 
Alternatively, MCLU argued that if the court finds that the state may 
constitutionally sanction political speech, it must apply a more restrictive standard 
than that contained in Minnesota's False Political and Campaign material statute. </p>
<p>MCLU noted that the indictment here was based on two sentences from the ad: 
(1) &quot;Patten may never have been released and this crime never committed had 
legislation authored by Tad Jude been enacted&quot;; and (2) &quot;But Jude's bill was 
stopped by Bill Luther and his liberal friends in the Minnesota Senate.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;In 1990,&quot; MCLU said, &quot;Patten was on a pre-release furlough when he 
committed the offenses described in Jude's ad. However, the offense for which 
Daniel Patten was incarcerated was committed in 1983. Therefore, the legislation 
that Jude introduced in 1988 would not have had any effect on Patten's sentence 
or release date.&quot; </p>
<p>However, MCLU pointed out, &quot;the Jude campaign's media consultant testified 
before the grand jury that he believed that the ad was true and that he had no 
reason to think that Jude knew that the ad was not true. Jude also testified that he 
`took every reasonable step under the circumstances to make sure it was true.'&quot; </p>
<p><U><B>STATUTE OVERLY BROAD AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL</B></U> </p>
<p>On March 1, 1996, Hennepin County Judge Robert Lynn dismissed the 
indictment against Tad Jude. He called the law (M.S. 211B.06) &quot;overly broad&quot; 
and unconstitutional. In response to the ruling Tad Jude said, &quot;I'm not the only 
winner today with Judge Lynn's ruling. The property taxpayers and voters of 
Anoka, Washington, and Dakota Counties are the winners.&quot; </p>
<p><U><B>NOT THE END</B></U> </p>
<p>However, the dismissal of the indictment is not the end of the story. On March 7, 
1996, the State Attorney General's office took the case from Hennepin County 
and seeks to appeal it. </p>
<p>Chris Georgacas, State Republican Chairman, said this decision to appeal the 
indictment has &quot;little to do with the law, everything to do with preserving DFL 
incumbents.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Skip Humphrey [Minnesota's Attorney General] is perpetuating the DFL party's 
current campaign against free speech,&quot; said Georgacas in harshly criticizing 
Attorney General Hubert Humphrey's decision to appeal the ruling by Hennepin 
County District Judge Robert Lynn that a Minnesota law regulating political 
speech is unconstitutional. &quot;Whether through Leland Lynch's ill-considered 
Campaign Advertising Code or now by this appeal, Democrat Party chieftains are 
attempting an all-out effort to restrict challenger candidates from engaging in 
vigorous, yet responsible free speech in this election-year,&quot; said Georgacas. He 
noted that, &quot;No other state in the country has such an over-reaching law.&quot; </p>
<p>Minnesota Attorney General Humphrey has already taken an extremely expansive 
view of his state's jurisdiction over the Internet, including advertising. (See

Jurisdiction?,&quot; Tab #15, New Media, Article #13.) </p>

<center><p><h3><B>YOUR GUIDE TO CURRENT KEY ADVERTISING LAW ISSUES (Part Two.)</B></h3></p></center>

<p>(Ed.'s Note: Part One of this two-part article appears in <B>Advertising Compliance Service</B> at Tab 
#2, General Articles, Article #272.) </p>
<p><U><B>IMPACT OF NEW TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT</B></U> </p>
<p>On February 8, 1996, President Clinton signed into law the Telecommunications Act of 1996. 
The measure sailed through the House on February 1, 1996, 414-16, and then through the 
Senate, by an equally lopsided vote of 91-5. The new telecommunication law is 280 pages in 
length and requires 80 different proceedings by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). 
So complex is this measure that another telecommunications Act may be needed in 1997 to 
correct problems in this labyrinthine act. </p>
<p>The world of advertising is sure to change as a result of this law as cable companies hasten 
delivery of high-speed modems connecting customers to the Internet, enabling new computer 
services and the availability of vast amounts of data cheaply. Telephone companies may offer 
movies on demand and interactive TV. Broadcasters may ultimately offer multiple channels of 
programming, bringing change not only to programming but to advertising as well. </p>
<p>One portion of the new law has nothing to do with deregulation: the Communications Decency 
Act (CDA). The CDA criminalizes the expression of information and ideas over computer 
communications systems. Under the CDA, people may be fined up to $250,000 fine and/or face 
up to two years in prison if they transmit indecent materials over computer networks. </p>
<p>You can expect fierce legal battles over this new measure. The first legal challenge to the Act was 
filed on the very day the measure was signed into law: February 8, 1996! On that date, the 
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), an Internet civil-liberties group, American Civil Liberties 
Union (ACLU), and 18 other civil-liberties groups challenged the Act's censorship provisions on 
First Amendment and other Constitutional grounds. </p>
<p>In a separate action, a coalition representing a broad spectrum of Internet users, access providers, 
content providers and publishers filed a lawsuit on February 26, 1996 in a federal court in 
Philadelphia seeking to overturn the CDA. The challenge argues that the Internet is a unique 
communications technology deserving of First Amendment protections at least as broad as those 
enjoyed as by the print medium. The group--called the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition 
(CIEC)--has 35 members, including advertisers, book publishers, newspaper publishers, editors, 
commercial online service providers, ISP's, non-profit groups, libraries, and civil liberties 
advocates. </p>
<p>Named Plaintiffs in the CIEC suit include such heavyweights as Microsoft Corporation, Microsoft 
Network, Apple Computer, Inc., America Online, Inc., Compuserve, Inc., Prodigy, Inc., 
Recording Industry Association of America, and Newspaper Association of America. </p>
<p>CIEC called its suit &quot;a landmark effort that will determine the fate of the Internet and the future of 
free expression in the Information Age.&quot; CIEC noted that-- </p>
<p>&quot;Every user of the Internet is a content provider under the Communications Decency Act (CDA) 
and could be subject to fines and prison sentences under the new law. If you post messages to an 
open listserv, Usenet newsgroups, participate in IRC or chat sessions, or maintain your own 
personal Web Page, ftp or gopher archive, you may be subject to fines up to $250,000 or 2 
years in prison under the CDA if someone, somewhere, finds the material you post to be 
`indecent' or `patently offensive'&quot;. </p>
<p>These groups are outraged that the measure criminalizes information on the Internet that's now 
legal in the print medium. They believe this Act will make the federal government far bigger and 
more intrusive than ever. </p>
<p>Advertisers and advertising agencies both have a large and rapidly growing presence on the 
Internet, particularly on the World Wide Web. The signing into law of this bill means that if you 
have something on your Web site that might be considered &quot;indecent&quot; in some community 
somewhere in the U.S., you may face a $250,000 fine and/or two years in prison. </p>
<p>You can also expect a growing &quot;chilling effect&quot; that this new law will have on the growing legion of 
advertisers and advertising agencies who have web sites on the Internet's World Wide Web. 
What will the advertising community do while it awaits the outcome of the barrage of lawsuits 
based on this new law? Some Internet observers contend that there will be &quot;a tidal wave&quot; of 
self-censorship on the Internet that will go far beyond what the new law ultimately will mean. After 
all, the prospect of two years in prison and a huge fine certainly raises the stakes for anyone 
considering using this new medium for marketing purposes. </p>
<p>The problem now is the uncertainty caused by the new Act. Until courts have had a chance to 
review the new law--a time-consuming process--advertisers and ad agencies are without clear 
guidance as to what they can and can't do in this new medium. The stakes for content providers 
for Web Sites has gone up enormously. Advertising, after all, is intimately involved with creativity. 
Do advertising creatives now have to &quot;dumb down&quot; their web page offerings in light of what the 
worst judge in the least enlightened jurisdiction might think of their creative efforts? </p>
<p>Also, your Internet Service Provider may have to screen your web pages for anything that one of 
your users somewhere in the U.S. could find &quot;indecent.&quot; Some observers believe the inevitable 
result will be an overblown government bureaucracy that will compel many small advertisers and 
ad agencies to get off the World Wide Web and restrict the remaining advertisers and ad agencies 
to severely restrict their offerings on the Web. </p>
<p>On February 15, 1996, a federal judge did issue a partial temporary restraining order barring 
enforcement of the Communications Decency Act's (CDA) &quot;indecency&quot; provision. However, 
Judge Ronald Buckwalter refused to enjoin those provisions of the Act dealing with &quot;patently 
offensive&quot; communications. </p>
<p>Judge Buckwalter agreed with plaintiffs' claim that the CDA will have a chilling effect on free 
speech on the Internet and concluded that the CDA raises &quot;serious, substantial, difficult and 
doubtful questions.&quot; Moreover, Judge Buckwalter agreed that the CDA is &quot;unconstitutionally 
vague&quot; as to the prosecution for indecency. However, the court left open the possibility that the 
government could prosecute under the &quot;patently offensive&quot; or &quot;obscene&quot; provisions. Many First 
Amendment experts have called these provisions redundant since obscenity is already illegal both 
in Cyberspace and outside of it. These experts say that obscenity laws aren't dependent on a 
particular medium as are indecency laws and have in fact already been enforced against online 
services. </p>
<p><U><B>STREAMLINING OF FTC: ADVERTISING'S CHIEF REGULATOR</B></U> </p>
<p>You can expect the continuing streamlining of FTC in the months and years ahead. Already in 
1996, that agency has taken steps resulting in the elimination of thousands of old FTC orders. 
Under a new &quot;sunset&quot; policy, FTC is clearing the decks of old FTC orders that have long since 
served their purpose. FTC has also eliminating many outdated trade regulation rules and industry 
guides as part of its ongoing program to streamline its oversight of industry activities. Accordingly, 
you can expect a leaner, meaner FTC in the years ahead. </p>
<p><U><B>WILL PUFFERY COME TO AN END?</B></U> </p>
<p>It seems far less likely today than a year ago. Such advertising slogans as &quot;Nobody doesn't Like 
Sara Lee?&quot; have long been considered &quot;puffery&quot; and so immune from substantiation requirements. 
However, a proposed revision to Article 2 of the U.S. Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) by the 
National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws committee would have changed 
all that. </p>
<p>Drafted in the 1950's, the Code recommended that state legislatures adopt a uniform body of 
laws governing key commercial transactions. The Code was later adopted with slight variations by 
every state except Louisiana plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. </p>
<p>American law has always recognized the difference between puffery and factual ad claims. The 
law does not require substantiation for the former, but does for the latter. The committee was 
thinking about requiring it of both. </p>
<p>This clearly would have had a devastating potential impact on the advertising industry if it were 
adopted. The committee's first draft actually would have eliminated the distinction between puffery 
and affirmations of fact altogether. But the advertising industry quickly responded and a later draft 
reinstated the puffery/factual claims distinction. However, some observers contend that this draft 
still amounts to a de facto ban of puffery. So look for swift industry reaction to any proposal that 
would change the centuries-old legal rules involving puffery. </p>
<p><U><B>BROADER ALLOWANCE OF CERTAIN CLAIMS</B></U> </p>
<p>You should look for the broader allowance of certain types of claims in the future by regulators. 
One example: direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs. You can expect at least some 
changes in the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) current rules involving the advertising of 
prescription drugs. Pressure has been building at FDA to loosen certain restrictions on these rules. 
Activity in this area is sure to occur in the months and years ahead. </p>
<p>Another area where you can expect to see a greater allowance of claims is in the health claims 
area. Already, one recent proposal would allow manufacturers of foods containing oatmeal or oat 
bran to claim on the labels that diets high in these grain products and low in saturated fat and 
cholesterol may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. Other proposals are sure to follow in 
the future. </p>
<p><U><B>LONG-STANDING PRINCIPLES OF AD REGULATION WILL CONTINUE</B></U> </p>
<p>Finally, with all the changes, there should be a recognition that the many long-standing principles 
that guide advertising law will continue. A strong working knowledge of the myriad federal and 
state cases, decisions, orders, rules, regulations and rulings involving advertising law is vital for any 
serious advertising professional. This vast body of law will continue to grow and evolve. Your 
goal is to stay current with this important area of law. </p>

<p>By <br>
<p>Stephen R. Bergerson* <br>
<p><U><B>LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS OF CYBERSPACE MARKETING</B></U> </p>
<p>More and more of today's marketing managers are driving sleeker and faster 
technological innovations down the information highway. They've recognized the 
Internet's ability to get them from Marketing Central to the consumer--and back 
again--faster than the speed of light. </p>
<p>But in the excitement of putting their foot to the floor and fixing their focus on the 
finish line, many are turning a blind eye to the legal ramifications of racing into 
marketspace. </p>
<p><U><B>SPEED LIMITS AND SPEED TRAPS</B></U> </p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, there are speed limits on the Superhighway. And 
speed traps. It's still a frontier, but it's anything but lawless. For over 20 years, the 
Internet was a &quot;free&quot; environment, but that was before it was commercialized. 
And where commerce goes, the law always follows. So today's cybermanagers 
need to keep their heads up and their eyes on the road, or they're sure to exceed 
marketspace speed limits. Here's a checklist of the kinds of traps that lie ahead. </p>
<p><U><B>DOMAIN NAMES AND TRADEMARKS</B></U> </p>
<p>Internet domain names like TIDE.COM and CHEEZWHIZ.COM can be 
registered with Internic on a first-come, first-served basis. But if a domain name 
infringes on a pre-existing trademark, the domain name and its owner become 
legal lightening rods and tend to attract sharp, thunderous and very heated 
responses. To avoid being jolted, marketers need to do a trademark search 
before using or registering a domain name, and to give very careful thought to 
registering it with the Federal Trademark Office. </p>
<p><U><B>HOME PAGE COPYRIGHT ISSUES</B></U> </p>
<p>Copyright law creates at least three significant web site ownership issues. Since 
copyright law give a copyright owner nearly exclusive control over the right to 
use, distribute, display, perform and copy or make derivatives of the work, 
copyright ownership questions are important. And the answers are frequently 
surprising, because copyright in a creative work is generally owned by the person 
who created it (not the person who &quot;paid&quot; for it) unless (a) the creator is an actual 
employee who created the work within the scope of their employment or (b) it's 
created by an independent contractor who specifically agrees in writing that the 
commissioning party will own copyright in it. </p>
<p>Since marketers usually hire independent contractors to create their web site 
content code and overall &quot;look and feel,&quot; and all are protected by copyright, they 
need to be aware of the rules of copyright ownership. </p>
<p><U><B>GLOBAL LEGAL EXPOSURE</B></U> </p>
<p>The Internet's global capability has significant legal implications. Both large and 
small &quot;cyvertisers&quot; immediately become global advertisers. Since Internet 
advertising and promotions are seen around the world, and laws vary widely from 
place to place, &quot;cyvertising&quot; creates unprecedented legal exposure. Who has legal 
jurisdiction at every point along the Highway? Is it the state or country where the 
advertising and promotions are uploaded? Downloaded? All? The question hasn't 
been answered yet, but regulators are looking long and hard at where they can set 
their traps. </p>
<p>Some, including Minnesota Attorney General Humphrey, are doing more than 
looking at or talking about it. Humphrey's office has already charged several 
cyvertisers with violating Minnesota's consumer fraud, false advertising and 
deceptive trade practice statues. </p>
<p>FTC is now actively monitoring the Internet and recently announced settlements 
with eight different cyvertisers, and litigation against a ninth. One FTC 
commissioner said &quot;If it's deceptive on earth, it's deceptive in cyberspace.&quot; </p>
<p>So much for the lawless frontier. </p>
<p><U><B>PRIVACY ISSUES</B></U> </p>
<p>There are several ways to get caught in the privacy trap. One is to use a living 
person's name or likeness for commercial purposes. That is recognized as an 
invasion of privacy in nearly every state in this country, not to mention foreign 
laws. </p>
<p>Ignoring the public's growing obsession about the commercial use of personal 
information also raises significant privacy issues. The U.S. Commerce Department 
recently issued a report calling on telephone, on-line, cable and satellite TV 
industries to tell their users exactly what personal information they are gathering, 
how it is to be used and threatening formal regulations if companies don't start 
obtaining explicit approval from consumers before using or sharing &quot;sensitive&quot; 
data. </p>
<p><U><B>CRACKERS AND FLAMERS</B></U> </p>
<p>Since the Internet has its share of crackers who like to infect programs with 
viruses, and flamers, who send insulting or even nasty messages to individuals or 
companies, marketers need to draft sweepstakes and other sales promotion rules 
to provide for contingencies created by these kinds of meddlers. They also need 
to be more careful than ever with eligibility, deadlines, &quot;void in . . .,&quot; and other 
traditional rules issues which take on a whole new hue on the Net. </p>
<p><U><B>CONTENT LIABILITY</B></U> </p>
<p>Content liability creates very real issues for online marketers. As they collaborate 
with online providers, who is responsible for the content, including libel and 
copyright infringement? The service provider? The sponsor? Both? And since all 
Internet users can now alter any advertising message, content liability raises more 
questions than there are answers for. </p>
<p><U><B>INDUSTRY LIABILITY</B></U> </p>
<p>The recently enacted Telecommunications Act of 1996 makes using the Net to 
distribute &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently offensive&quot; material to minors a crime. A federal 
judge has temporarily enjoined enforcement of the former, but allowed it for the 
latter. Since the law doesn't define &quot;patently offensive&quot; and many find lots of ads 
to be just that the time bomb is ticking. </p>
<p><U><B>LICENSING AGREEMENTS</B></U> </p>
<p>Marketers who negotiate rights to use music, photographs, illustrations, 
trademarks, designs or people's names or likenesses on-line need to be sure that 
the licensing agreement specifically allows such use, or they will exceed the scope 
of the license and infringe on the owner's rights. They also need to know that the 
Screen Actors Guide (SAG) is claiming that additional residuals are due its 
members when they appeal in live-action video on the Net or CD-ROM. </p>
<p><U><B>TAXES</B></U> </p>
<p>Where there's revenue, there's revenuers. State, local governments are already 
discussing sales and service tax issues relating to on-line services. Since there are 
50 states plus D.C., and thousands of local governments with tax laws, this will 
get very complicated, so stay in touch with your tax advisor. </p>
<p>As marketers race into space, they need to watch where they're going. There are 
speed limits . . . and speed traps. And the costs of getting pulled over can be very 
high. </p>

<center><p><h3><B>CDA LAWSUIT: AN UPDATE</B></h3></p></center>

<p><U><B>CLOSING ARGUMENTS HEARD</B></U> </p>
<p>On May 10, 1996, a three-judge panel heard closing arguments in the case of 
ACLU v. Reno concerning the so-called &quot;Communications Decency Act&quot; (CDA). 
(Those portions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that criminalize 
expression of information and ideas over computer communications systems are 
known as the CDA.) Ever since the law became effective--February 8, 
1996--people have faced fines of up to $250,000 and/or up to two years in 
prison if they transmitted &quot;indecent&quot; materials over computer networks. </p>
<p><U><B>BACKGROUND</B></U> </p>
<p>On February 15, 1996, however, a federal judge issued a partial temporary 
restraining order barring enforcement of the CDA's &quot;indecency&quot; provision. Judge 
Ronald Buckwalter refused to enjoin those provisions of the Act dealing with 
&quot;patently offensive&quot; communications. </p>
<p>Judge Buckwalter agreed with plaintiffs' claim that the CDA will have a chilling 
effect on free speech on the Internet and concluded that the CDA raises &quot;serious, 
substantial, difficult and doubtful questions.&quot; Moreover, Judge Buckwalter agreed 
that the CDA is &quot;unconstitutionally vague&quot; as to the prosecution for indecency. 
However, the court left open the possibility that the government could prosecute 
under the &quot;patently offensive&quot; or &quot;obscene&quot; provisions. Many First Amendment 
experts have called these provisions redundant since obscenity is already illegal 
both in Cyberspace and outside of it. These experts say that obscenity laws aren't 
dependent on a particular medium as are indecency laws and have in fact already 
been enforced against online services. </p>
<p><U><B>GOVERNMENT'S CLOSING ARGUMENT</B></U> </p>
<p>In its closing argument on May 10, 1996, the government proposed forcing 
Internet users to label indecent or patently offensive words or images with an 
electronic &quot;tag.&quot; After questioning from the judges, the government acknowledged 
the impossibility of implementing this scheme with current technology. </p>
<p>That concession alone, ACLU said, could justify granting plaintiff's motion for a 
preliminary injunction against the CDA's censorship provisions. &quot;It's about time 
that the government conceded what the cyberspace community has known all 
along--that this is an unworkable law,&quot; said Christopher Hansen, who presented 
oral arguments for the ACLU. &quot;And even if it were feasible, it is constitutionally 
unthinkable to give the government the power to restrict valuable speech, or to 
compel people to pejoratively label their speech.&quot; </p>
<p>The government also admitted that the CDA criminalizes speech that does have 
value (e.g., artistic, literary or even medical information) and not just 
&quot;pornography&quot; or other prurient words or images not covered under existing 
obscenity laws. As Hansen told the Court, Congress made sure that the CDA 
applied specifically to libraries and educational institutions, and rejected several 
opportunities to make any exceptions for valuable speech. </p>
<p>&quot;The government is basically saying `trust me' when it comes to determining what 
kind of online words and images will be considered `indecent' or `patently 
offensive,'&quot; said Marjorie Heins, an ACLU lawyer. &quot;But they were not able to 
offer a coherent explanation as to what those terms mean.&quot; </p>
<p><U><B>THREE ESSENTIAL POINTS</B></U> </p>
<p>Overall, ACLU said, plaintiffs succeeded in making three essential points to the 
court: </p>
<UL><LI><p>The CDA is a criminal statute with criminal penalties.
<LI><p>The CDA is aimed specifically at constitutionally protected speech. 
<LI><p>The government's tagging scheme would force everyone to censor himself/herself 
to avoid risk of criminal prosecution.</UL>
<p><U><B>BROAD APPLICABILITY</B></U> </p>
<p>Plaintiffs also reminded the Court that the CDA censorship law applies not only to 
Web Sites, but to newsgroups, chat rooms, and other vital Internet areas. ACLU 
argued in its brief--and the government largely conceded--that various schemes 
for self-censorship would be unworkable in these environments as well. </p>
<p>At the end of the May 10 proceedings, Chief Judge Dolores K. Sloviter said the 
Court would issue a ruling &quot;in due course.&quot; Under expedited provisions, any 
appeal on rulings on the CDA will be made directly to the U.S. Supreme Court. </p>

<h2><p align=center><strong>Your Online Guide to Advertising Compliance 
Service</strong></center></p></h2>

<p>From traditional print and broadcast media to the <i>cutting edge of 
Cyberspace</i>, <strong>ADVERTISING COMPLIANCE SERVICE</strong> is a 
twice-monthly <b>REFERENCE COMPENDIUM</b> that has provided its subscribers 
in-depth, timely and insightful coverage of the <a href="adlaw.htm">vast 
advertising law area </a>for 15 years! U.S. advertising is a $170 billion 
industry. Television accounts for some $60 billion. Radio takes in about $10 
billion. The print, and other, media account for nearly all of the rest. 
<strong>ADVERTISING COMPLIANCE SERVICE</strong> covers all of the important 
cases, decisions, rulings, rules, regulations, consent decrees and orders 
flowing from the federal and state courts and regulatory bodies affecting 
the advertisers, advertising agencies and marketers--large and small--that 
make up this immense industry.</p>

<p> <strong>ADVERTISING COMPLIANCE SERVICE</strong> provides in-depth, 
timely and insightful coverage of legal developments in <i>the burgeoning 
Internet and Web advertising market </i>as well. While relatively tiny compared to 
the traditional media (under $100 million in ad revenues), this market is poised 
to take off <i>like a rocket</i>! And our legal and regulatory system 
is racing to keep up. If you're involved with advertising, it's essential 
to know the latest legal developments. The <strong>ADVERTISING COMPLIANCE 
SERVICE</strong> ensures that you do. </p> Subscribe now and you will receive: </p>

<ul>
<li><b>24 ISSUES</b>, annually, packed with crucial advertising compliance 
information. These Issues are designed to give you <b>DOUBLE VALUE</b>: <I>Immediate 
and Long-Term</i>! Read each Issue as it arrives to stay current with all key 
advertising legal developments. Then, file each information-packed article 
in one of our 26 "tabs." (This step takes no more than a minute or two.) 
This lets you refer back to the valuable information in these articles again and 
again in the future. Use the comprehensive <a href="suppleme.htm">INDEX</a> (Main 
<i>and</i> Supplementary) and numerous <a href="table.htm">TABLES</a> (Main 
<i>and</i> Supplementary) to help you find the topic or case or decision you're 
looking for. (Click "<a href="suppleme.htm">INDEX</a>" to see an online copy of the 
Supplementary Index or "<a href="table.htm">TABLES</a>" to see an example of just 
one Supplementary Table anywhere on this page.)<br>

<li><b>6 SPECIAL REPORTS</b>, annually, with full texts of landmark decisions, 
legislation, rules, regulations, cases and analyses. <br>

<li><b>THE TWO-VOLUME BASIC REFERENCE SET</b> containing Volumes XV and XVI already filed to date in two quality 3-ring binders with the <i>46 most recent issues</i>! (Future 3-ring binders are sent to subscribers periodically to 
house the future growth--<i>and enhance the value</i>--of <b>Advertising 
Compliance Service</b>.) That's <i>over 175 articles and nearly 1,000 information-filled pages</i>! It's a $900 value and it's yours as part of your initial subscription price!<br>

<li>Brand-new <b><a href="suppleme.htm">INDEX</a></b> with over 2,000 entries to <i>speed</i> your research <i>and</i> 
<b><a href="table.htm">TABLES</a></b> of court decisions, Federal Trade Commission cases, and 
National Advertising Division/National Advertising Review Board decisions 
help you make sure your advertising is in compliance with all federal rules and 
self-regulatory guidelines.<br>
</ul>

<p>If you read each <strong>ADVERTISING COMPLIANCE SERVICE</strong> Issue 
and Special Report, you would know: </p>

<ul>
<li>How the government is training its big guns at tobacco advertisers and 
what that portends for other advertisers. The next major target: Alcoholic 
beverage advertisers. (For a glimpse at some of the salvoes fired in the 
anti-tobacco advertising war, check out our "<a href="doc.htm">Important 
Advertising Law-Related Documents</a>" page now!)<br>

<li>How one Appeals Court recently came down in favor of a <i>very expansive 
definition</i> of just what is a "commercial advertisement" for purposes of 
Lanham Act false advertising lawsuits. This fairly common type of advertising 
lawsuit should become even more common now. Other federal courts have also 
ruled that the Lanham Act applies to a broad range of deceptive statements found 
in advertisements. Remedies have ranged from injunctive relief to <b>damage 
awards as high as $40 million</b> in one comparative advertising case.<br>

<li>How legislators, federal regulators and state attorneys general successfully 
made a massive push to gain jurisdictional control of advertising on the 
Internet. Many articles in <b>Advertising Compliance Service</b> examine this 
major trend, keeping our subscribers alert to these important developments. 
Many advertisers--large and small--hit with fines and penalties seem stunned and 
were clearly unaware of their advertising legal compliance duties on this new medium.<br>

<li>As you probably know, two lower federal courts knocked down the vague and 
overbroad Federal &quot;Communications Decency Act (CDA),&quot; as unconstitutional. 
So your Internet and World Wide Web ads (and other speech) are safe, right? 
<i>Wrong</i>! You could be prosecuted for those ads under the CDA <i> from 
February 8, 1996 onwards</i> if your Internet or Web ads fall within that Act! 
How? If the U.S. Supreme Court upholds the CDA when it decides the case next 
year! Under the CDA, information now legal in the print medium (including 
sections of the King James Bible or photographs of Michelangelo's Sistine 
Chapel paintings) may carry a <b>$250,000 fine or two years of prison</b> 
if carried on the Internet. Many experts <i>think</i> the Supreme Court will 
overturn the CDA. But there is definitely no guarantee that they will do so.<br>

<li>Why following traditional advertising guidelines may not be enough 
to ensure that your Internet, Web and online advertising complies with 
all federal, state, local and self-regulatory laws, rules, regulations 
and guidelines.<br>

<li>What &quot;Brave New World&quot; advertisers are facing in the 
wake of the newly passed Telecommunications Act of 1996. What happens to your 
advertising budget when the entire telecommunications industry ends up in 
the hands of a few companies, as some experts believe?<br>

<li>Why the rules on securing copyrights and consent forms on the 
Internet may differ from other traditional media.<br>
</ul>

<p>Recent issues of <strong>ADVERTISING COMPLIANCE SERVICE</strong> have 
given subscribers crucial information on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Circumstances under which a customer letter can be considered 
an &quot;advertisement&quot; vulnerable to court challenges of &quot;false 
and misleading&quot; information.<br>

<li>The many avenues you can pursue when combating your competitors' 
false or misleading advertising claims as well as the many legally 
acceptable claims your ads can make when drawing comparisons to your 
competitors' product.<br>

<li>The courts' new-found and dangerous power to declare published 
articles--about your product or service--&quot;commercial advertising 
or promotion&quot; which can lead to costly litigation and damages. <br>

<li>Why something as simple as a camera angle or camera lens used in a 
television commercial could run afoul of federal rules, resulting in 
costly penalties. <br>

<li>With all advertising media receiving an increasing amount of scrutiny, 
you can't afford NOT to subscribe to <strong>ADVERTISING COMPLIANCE 
SERVICE</strong>. Print out and mail the order form below with a check, 
today, to receive your 24 ISSUES, annually, packed with crucial

<p align=center><font size=4><strong>Advertising Agencies, Advertisers and Their Attorneys 
Astonished<br>
By Size of Costly Fines and Penalties</strong></font></p>
<p>Advertising agencies, advertisers and their attorneys have been amazed by the 
size of costly fines and penalties assessed in Federal Trade Commission (FTC) 
and Court decisions recently. Recent <b>Advertising Compliance Service</b> issues 
have analyzed these decisions offering practical, compliance-oriented analysis and 
commentary. As these decisions illustrate, <i>ignorance of the fast-paced 
developments in advertising law can be a very costly proposition</i>. <u>Remember</u>: 
In each one of these cases, <i>someone</i> had to answer why their--or their 
client's--advertising copy failed to comply with advertising law's countless 
requirements. Here are just a few examples of such cases examined in recent 
<b>Advertising Compliance Service</b> articles:</p>
<p><img src="blue-b~2.gif" align=bottom width=12 height=12> A federal court recently upheld over $16 million in damages against an 
advertiser in a recent Federal Trade Commission case involving allegedly 
deceptive ads. Moreover, the Court held one of the company's officers 
<i>individually liable</i> for that amount! Defendants strenuously argued that the $16 
million exceeded their net worth . . . but to no avail! </p>
<p><img src="blue-b~2.gif" align=bottom width=12 height=12> One large advertising agency is deemed culpable by a federal agency in a case 
costing the ad agency's advertiser-client $100,000.</p>
<p><img src="blue-b~2.gif" align=bottom width=12 height=12> Advertising agency execs and attorneys were aghast when a federal judge hit 
an ad agency with $1 million in damages for deceptive advertising.</p>
<p><img src="blue-b~2.gif" align=bottom width=12 height=12> Advertiser will pay $2.75 million civil penalty to settle charges over national ad 
campaign.</p>
<p><img src="blue-b~2.gif" align=bottom width=12 height=12> Product demonstrations: What <i>you must know</i> to avoid costly penalties and 
lengthy court and/or government proceedings. How one advertiser paid $150,000 
by not heeding this advice.</p>
<p><img src="blue-b~2.gif" align=bottom width=12 height=12> Diet firm agrees to $100,00 consumer refund over &quot;unsubstantiated&quot; ad claims.</p>
<p><img src="blue-b~2.gif" align=bottom width=12 height=12> Advertiser will pay $888,000 civil penalty to settle charges over ad campaign.</p>
<p><img src="blue-b~2.gif" align=bottom width=12 height=12> Advertiser to pay $150,000 penalty to settle charges over nutritional claims.</p>
<p><img src="blue-b~2.gif" align=bottom width=12 height=12> Federal ad regulator's finalized consent agreement contains $480,000 refund 
requirement.</p>
<p><img src="blue-b~2.gif" align=bottom width=12 height=12> Massive direct-mail, sweepstakes case ends with $1.25 million redress to 
consumers.</p>
<p><img src="blue-b~2.gif" align=bottom width=12 height=12> Government regulator cites misleading ads in investment 
newsletter-respondents ordered to pay civil money penalties totaling $300,000.</p>
<p><img src="blue-b~2.gif" align=bottom width=12 height=12> Internet advertisers of credit repair program to pay $17,500 in redress.</p>
<p><img src="blue-b~2.gif" align=bottom width=12 height=12> Deceptive advertising charges lead marketer to accept settlement with federal 
regulator and give refunds up to $195,000.</p>
<p>Court and regulatory history is littered with advertisers and ad agencies of every 
size and stripe who erroneously believed it could never happen to them. These 
decisions demonstrate that there is simply no substitute for keeping current with 
the myriad cases, decisions, rulings, rules, regulations, consent decrees and orders 
flowing from the federal and state courts and powerful regulatory bodies. And 
that's exactly what <b>Advertising Compliance Service</b> has been doing for its 
subscribers for 15 years: Helping them keep current with the most important 
advertising compliance information available. </p>
<p>So if you're in any way responsible for preparing or reviewing any advertising 
copy on any medium, you should ask yourself whether you've been keeping up 
with developments involving advertising law's many strictures. Don't wait until 
your ad is the subject of a competitor lawsuit, a federal administrative action, or a 
state attorney general action, with all the attendant fines, penalties, damages, 
attorneys fees, injunctions, recordkeeping requirements, corrective advertising 
expenditures, bad publicity, etc., etc., that this can entail. Otherwise, you may 
have to answer these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What went wrong?<br>
</li>
<li>Why did this happen?<br>
</li>
<li>Why wasn't this prevented?<br>
</li>
<li>Who is responsible?<br>
</li>
</ol>

&nbsp; <p align=center><font size=5><strong>FTC FINALIZES AGREEMENTS WITH SEVEN 
INTERNET ADVERTISERS</strong></font></center><br>

<p>FTC has made final consent agreements with the following 
seven companies charged with deceptively advertising their products or 
services on the Internet. </p>
<p><i>Robert Serviss, dba Excel Communications</i>: Agreement settles charges that he 
promoted a work-at-home opportunity on the Internet using false and 
unsubstantiated earnings claims. The consent order requires Serviss to have 
substantiation for profits, sales or earnings claims he makes about any 
business opportunity he markets. (FTC Dkt. No. C-3669, June 12, 1996.) </p>
<p><i>Rick Rahim, dba NBDC Credit Resource Publishing</i>: Agreement settles 
charges that he falsely advertised on the Internet that his credit repair 
program, which advises consumers to misrepresent their Social Security 
numbers to obtain a new credit identity, is legal. The consent order bars 
Rahim from misrepresenting the legality of any credit repair product he 
advertises, and requires him to make certain disclosures in ads for such 
products that misrepresenting one's Social Security number or certain other 
information may be a federal crime. (FTC Dkt. No. C-3671, June 12, 1996.) </p>
<p><i>Brian Coryat, dba Enterprising Solutions</i>: FTC agreement settles charges that 
he falsely advertised on the Internet that consumers could use his credit repair 
kit to remove negative, but accurate and up-to-date, information from their 
credit reports; and that he made false and unsubstantiated claims about the 
earnings potential of those who bought his Credit Repair Agency business. 
The consent order bars Coryat from making similar credit repair 
misrepresentations, and requires him to have evidence to back up earnings or 
sales claims for any business opportunity he markets. (FTC Dkt. No. 
C-3666, June 10, 1996.) </p>
<p><i>Randolf D. Albertson, dba Wolverine Capital</i>: This agreement settles charges 
that he falsely advertised on the Internet he could obtain cash grants for 
clients. The order bars Albertson from misrepresenting the number of people 
who are approved for grants or the services or assistance he provides in 
obtaining any financial product or service, and requires him to have evidence 
to back up such claims. (FTC Dkt. No. C-3670, June 12, 1996.) </p>
<p><i>Sherman G. Smith, dba Starr Communications</i>: Agreement settles charges that 
he made false and unsubstantiated earnings claims in his Internet advertising 
for the &quot;U.S. Government Tracer Business Program,&quot; which purportedly 
would show consumers how to make money tracking down people due 
refunds after they had paid off their mortgages. The consent order requires 
Smith to have substantiation for profits, earnings or sales claims for any 
business opportunity he markets. (FTC Dkt. No. C-3668, June 12, 1996.) </p>
<p><i>Lyle R. Larson, dba Momentum</i>: FTC agreement settles charges that he 
falsely advertised on the Internet that, through his &quot;legal&quot; program, consumers 
could remove negative, but accurate and up-to-date information from their 
credit reports. The consent order prohibits such false claims and requires 
Larson to make certain disclosures in ads for credit repair products that 
misrepresenting one's Social Security number or certain other information may 
be a federal crime. (FTC Dkt. No. C-3672, June 12, 1996.) </p>
<p><i>Timothy R. Bean, dba DMC Publishing Group</i>: This FTC agreement settles 
charges that he made false earnings claims in Internet advertising for his 
program to operate a home-based publishing and printing business. The 
consent order requires him to have substantiation for earnings and sales claims 
for any business opportunity he markets. (FTC Dkt. No. C-3665, June 12, 
1996.) </p>

<p align=center><font size=5><strong>FTC LAW JUDGE SUSTAINS CHARGES 
AGAINST &quot;RUST EVADER&quot;</strong></font></center><br>

<p>An FTC administrative law judge has barred RustEvader 
Corporation from using the names &quot;Rust Evader&quot; or &quot;Rust Buster&quot; for a 
purported electronic corrosion control device for cars that the judge said is 
not effective in substantially reducing corrosion, despite the company's ad 
campaign to the contrary. Judge James P. Timony's order follows FTC 
charges that RustEvader made false claims about its Rust Evader product and 
about a demonstration and studies regarding its efficacy. Timony upheld the 
charges in a default judgment he issued following RustEvader's &quot;general failure 
to respond to requests for information during the discovery period before trial 
on the case.&quot; FTC issued a complaint against RustEvader and company 
president, David F. McCready, in August 1995. Both answered the FTC 
complaint in October, 1995, denying the charges. In April, 1996, however, 
the charges against McCready were withdrawn from litigation so FTC could 
consider a proposed settlement agreement. According to Timony's findings, 
RustEvader falsely claimed that: </p>
<p>&quot;Rust Evader is effective in substantially reducing corrosion in motor vehicle 
bodies, and that the company had evidence to back up this claim; a salt-water 
tank demonstration of the product's efficacy accurately reflected how Rust 
Evader protects motor vehicle bodies from corrosion when, in truth, the 
process used in the demonstration is much more effective under water than 
under conditions that a motor vehicle normally encounters; and reports of 
laboratory and other tests performed on the Rust Evader that the firm 
provided to dealers constituted scientific proof that the product substantially 
reduces motor vehicle body corrosion.&quot; </p>
<p>Judge Timony ordered RustEvader Corporation to stop using the terms Rust 
Evader or Rust Buster and to stop making the challenged claims for the Rust 
Evader product. The order also requires RustEvader to have appropriate 
competent and reliable evidence to back up claims about the performance, 
efficacy or attributes of any product for use in motor vehicles. Also, the order 
bars RustEvader from misrepresenting the existence or results of any test or 
study, or that any demonstration or picture proves any material feature or 
quality of any product for use in motor vehicles. </p>

relating to this FTC matter are available on the Internet at FTC's World Wide 
Web site at: http://www.ftc.gov.) </p>

<p align=center><font size=5><strong>MAJOR FTC, STATE CRACKDOWN INVOLVES 
CROSS-BORDER ADS</strong></font></center><br>

<p>&quot;Every year, thousands of consumers respond to enticing classified ads 
in newspapers that tout `money to loan . . . regardless of credit.'&quot; So said 
FTC in announcing a major federal-state crackdown to enforce the new 
Telemarketing Sales Rule. The problem--according to FTC and 15 state 
Attorneys General--is that consumers responding to such ads usually have to 
pay advance fees to get the &quot;guaranteed&quot; loans. &quot;The consumers never receive 
the promised loans and either never hear again from the `loan' companies, or 
are later told they're ineligible for the credit,&quot; FTC noted. FTC's 
Telemarketing Sales Rule makes it illegal for any telemarketer who guarantees 
consumers a loan or other credit to ask for money in advance. FTC and the 
state Attorneys General recently announced the results of this crackdown. The 
sweep consisted of eight cases filed by states and five cases filed by FTC. It 
snared 45 corporations and individuals, including some operating out of 
Canada. </p>
<p>The crackdown on firms operating out of Canada is the first time FTC has 
sued a foreign telemarketing boiler room and highlights the growing number of 
fraudulent telemarketers operating out of Canada. Concurrent with the 
FTC-state crackdown, the Province of British Columbia initiated law 
enforcement proceedings against the same Canadian loan scam operators. </p>
<p>&quot;Cross-border scams are a growth industry and thousands of Americans lose 
money every day to scam artists operating outside our borders,&quot; said FTC 
Chairman Robert Pitofsky. &quot;By joining state and federal law enforcers here 
with authorities in Canada, we believe we will be successful in stopping a 
massive advance-fee loan scheme involving numerous defendants based most 
recently in British Columbia and Ontario. We intend to continue that approach 
in the future.&quot; </p>
<p>Joining in the crackdown were Attorneys General from Arkansas, California, 
Connecticut, Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North 
Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin. </p>
<p>According to FTC, advance-fee loan schemes are often advertised in the 
classified sections of daily newspapers, including &quot;USA Today,&quot; and other 
publications such as &quot;The Globe&quot; and &quot;National Examiner.&quot; </p>
<p>(<EM>Advance Fee Loan Boiler Rooms</EM>, June 10, 1996; materials relating to this 
FTC matter are available on the Internet at FTC's World Wide Web site at: 
http://www.ftc.gov.) </p>

<p align=center><font size=5><strong>FTC FINAL AGREEMENT INVOLVES ALLEGED 
AD AGENCY CULPABILITY</strong></font></center><br>

<p>This recently finalized FTC consent agreement with N.W. 
Ayer &amp; Son, Inc.--which does business as NW Ayer, Inc., of New York 
City--settled charges over that ad agency's role in creating ads for Eggland's 
Best, Inc. eggs. FTC challenged claims regarding the effect of the eggs on 
blood cholesterol. The final order bars Ayer from misrepresenting with regard 
to eggs and any meat, dairy or poultry product the absolute or comparative 
amount of cholesterol, total fat, saturated fat or any other fatty acid or the 
existence or results of any test or study. The order also requires Ayer to have 
competent and reliable scientific evidence to back up any claims that such 
products have any effect on serum cholesterol or any health benefit. </p>
<p>(<EM>NW Ayer, Inc.</EM>, FTC Dkt. No. C-3660, June 6, 1996; materials relating to 
this FTC matter are available on the Internet at FTC's World Wide Web site 
at: <a href="http://www.ftc.gov"> http://www.ftc.gov</a>.) </p>

<p align=center><font size=5><strong>FTC CHARGES INVOLVE SELLER OF HOME-BASED 
BUSINESS AND INFOMERCIALS</strong></font></center><br>

<p>FTC filed suit against FreeCom Communications, 
Inc. and several other companies, charging that the firms and their principals 
misrepresented the earnings potential to consumers who bought their $495 
home-business &quot;starter kits.&quot; FTC alleged that defendants used infomercials 
and mailings to urge consumers to attend their seminars, which were 
conducted throughout the U.S. According to FTC, it was at these seminars 
that the defendants induced consumers to buy the starter kits by making 
claims that each of the business ventures it was selling was a proven 
money-maker. FTC has asked the court to (1) order a permanent halt to the 
alleged misrepresentations, (2) order an asset freeze to preserve funds for 
consumer redress, and (3) appoint a receiver to take control of the 
companies. </p>
<p>FTC's action follows a joint federal-state investigation with the office of the 
Utah Attorney General. Jodie Bernstein, Director of FTC's Bureau of 
Consumer Protection said, &quot;Anyone can be lured by slick sales pitches, or 
testimonials of success. Honest people, trying to earn a living by working for 
themselves, can be duped by promises of making big-time easy money. 
However, few, if any consumers, actually earn substantial income from these 
business ventures.&quot; Utah's Attorney General, Jan Graham, said, &quot;Our office 
has been concerned about the high potential for fraud in home business 
seminars for several years. I appreciate the FTC's eagerness to have the Utah 
Attorney General's Office work with them on this multi-million dollar case 
involving not only Utah victims, but victims from across the country.&quot; </p>
<p>In addition to the corporate defendants, FTC's complaint names as 
defendants several individuals who, at various times, were officers, directors 
and/or shareholders in some or all of the defendant corporations. According 
to FTC, since 1992, defendants promoted and sold home-based business 
opportunities, such as, the resale of distressed merchandise, vending 
machines, color-change T-shirts, the sale of discount travel memberships, 
vitamins, scholarship search services, and estate planning, through its 
infomercials, print advertisements, mail-pieces, telephone solicitations, and/or 
seminars. </p>
<p>According to FTC's complaint, defendants have represented through print 
advertisements and mail-pieces that the defendants offered proven business 
opportunities, that consumers could expect to earn substantial income through 
one of the home-based businesses, and that speakers at the seminars have 
earned substantial income through one of these businesses. For example, 
some of the defendants' print ads and mail pieces contained statements such 
as: </p>
<p>&quot;Allen came to our conference, one like you're being invited to. Now he 
works for himself ... out of his home ... and pays himself a salary three times 
more than his former employer paid. Last year Allen earned: over $200,000. 
(His first year he earned: $111,000).&quot; </p>
<p>FTC also charged that certain testimonials used by the defendants in their 
sales presentations, infomercials, advertisements, and promotional materials 
did not reflect the typical or ordinary experiences of consumers who have 
purchased a business venture from the defendants, and that such 
representations were false and misleading. Finally, FTC charged that, in many 
cases, defendants falsely depicted that certain persons (whose stories are 
described in defendants' sales presentations, ads, promotional materials, and 
by defendants' telemarketers) achieved a certain level of success by using one 
or more of defendants' business ventures. FTC asked the court to 
permanently bar the defendants from making, or to assist others in making, the 
types of representations as alleged in the complaint, to order the defendants to 
rescind contracts with, and refund money to consumers. FTC filed its 
complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, Central Division, 
in Salt Lake City. </p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> The Commission authorizes the filing of a complaint when it has 
&quot;reason to believe&quot; that the law has been or is being violated, and it appears to 
the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest. The complaint is not 
a finding or ruling that a defendant actually has violated the law. The case will 
be decided by the court.&quot; </p>
<p>(<EM>FreeCom Communications, Inc. et al.</EM>, Civil Action No.: 2: 96CV-0492, 
FTC Matter No. 932-2362, June 4, 1996; materials relating to this FTC 
matter are available on the Internet at FTC's World Wide Web site at: 
<a href="http://www.ftc.gov"> http://www.ftc.gov</a>.) </p>

<p align=center><font size=5><strong>FTC STAFF: REPEAL GAMES OF CHANCE RULE</strong></font></center><br>

<p>FTC's staff recommended that the Commission repeal its trade regulation rule on Games 
of Chance in the Food Retailing and Gasoline Industries. Their reasons: The 
rule's costs outweigh its benefits and the abuses that led to the rule are unlikely 
to recur. Rulemaking in this matter is nearing its final stage--review by the five 
Commissioners. </p>
<p>This rule was promulgated in 1969. It establishes requirements for food and 
gasoline retailers in conducting and advertising games of chance. The rule 
requires game promoters, in advertising for games of chance, to provide 
detailed information on the number of prizes available, the odds of winning 
each prize, the geographic area covered by the game and the number of 
participating retailers. The rule applies only to games conducted by food 
stores and gasoline stations. It also regulates various aspects of a game's 
operation and the procedure for posting lists of winners. In 1981, FTC 
granted an exemption to the rule's disclosure requirements for broadcast 
advertising. </p>
<p>In 1995, the Presiding Officer reopened the record for additional comments 
on whether a need for this rule continues to exist. In their respective reports, 
FTC staff and the Presiding Officer recommend that FTC repeal this rule. </p>
<p>If you'd like to comment on the two reports, your comments must be confined 
to information already in the rulemaking record. Deadline: August 6, 1996. 
Send your written comments to: Henry B. Cabell, Presiding Officer, FTC, 6th 
Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20580. (Those in

<p align=center><font size=5><strong>FTC OK'S FINAL CONSENT ORDER IN DIET CASE</strong></font></center><br>

<p>FTC finalized a consent agreement with the Diet Workshop, Inc., a franchiser of 
weight-loss plans and products, and the owner of its company-operated 
territories, Diet Workshop of Boston, Inc., settling charges that they made 
unsubstantiated weight-loss and weight-loss maintenance claims and used 
consumer testimonials deceptively. The final order bars respondents from 
misrepresenting the performance of any weight-loss program and requires 
them to have reliable scientific evidence to substantiate claims about achieving 
or maintaining weight loss, or the rate at which the loss can be expected to 
occur. The order also sets out standards for the type of evidence required to 
support various maintenance claims. Also, ad claims about maintaining weight 
loss must include the statement: &quot;For many dieters, weight loss is temporary.&quot; 
Weight-loss maintenance claims in all but short broadcast ads must be 
accompanied by disclosures regarding the actual experience of Diet 
Workshop customers; short broadcast ads must direct consumers to check 
with the company's local centers for detailed maintenance statistics. The order 
also bars the misleading use of testimonials, and requires atypical testimonials 
to be qualified. </p>

<p align=center><font size=5><strong>FTC OK'S FINAL CONSENT ORDER IN 
CANCER TREATMENT CASE</strong></font></center><br>

<p>FTC has made final a consent agreement with Cancer Treatment 
Centers of America, Inc., Midwestern Regional Medical Center, Inc., and 
Memorial Medical Center and Cancer Institute, Inc. This settles charges that 
they made false and unsubstantiated claims in advertising and promoting their 
cancer treatments. The order requires respondents to have competent and 
reliable evidence--scientific in certain appropriate instances--to support 
representations about patient survivorship or cure rates, or endorsement, or 
efficacy, performance, safety or benefits of any cancer treatment. They also 
are barred from using testimonials in a misleading way. </p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> A consent agreement or consent decree is for settlement purposes 
only and does not constitute an admission of a law violation. When finalized, 
both have the force of law. Any violation of an FTC consent order may result 
in a civil penalty of $10,000. </p>

&nbsp; <p align=center><font size=5><strong>TV MARKETER TO PAY $200,000 FTC PENALTY OVER INFOMERCIAL CLAIMS</strong></font></center><br>
<p>The marketer of an over-the-counter acne treatment, Acne-Statin, 
agreed to pay a $200,000 civil penalty to settle FTC charges that ads claiming the 
product to be an effective treatment for severe or cystic acne were deceptive. The 
claims also violate a 1979 order barring Dr. Atida H. Karr from making 
unsubstantiated claims about the effectiveness or superiority of any acne 
preparation she markets, FTC alleges. </p>
<p>The 1979 order bars Karr and her firms from advertising the effectiveness or 
superiority of any acne preparation unless the claims are supported by competent 
and reliable scientific or medical evidence. Karr paid $175,000 into a consumer 
refund account as part of the 1979 settlement of the initial case. In October 1995, 
FTC alleged that Karr was appearing in TV infomercials making claims about the 
effectiveness and superiority of her product, such as &quot;Most of the people who 
wrote to me had acne for many years and couldn't find anything to clear their skin, 
that is, until they discovered Acne-Statin.&quot; Product endorsers claim Acne-Statin 
was effective in treating their severe or cystic acne. At the time Karr and her 
company made the claims, they lacked competent and reliable scientific or medical 
evidence to support the claims, FTC's complaint alleges. FTC filed suit in U.S. 
District Court seeking civil penalties and a permanent injunction to bar future 
violations of the original order. The consent agreement will end that litigation. 
Under the terms of the consent, Karr will be enjoined from using ads that use the 
words &quot;severe&quot; or &quot;cystic&quot; acne, and will pay a $200,000 civil penalty. </p>
<p>(<EM>Dr. Atida H. Karr</EM>, FTC File No. X960-001, Civil Action No. 95-3784-RSWL 
{SHx}, July 30, 1996; materials relating to this FTC matter are available on the

<p align=center><font size=5><strong>FTC ANTI-FRAUD EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGN 
INVOLVES PRIZE PROMOTION</strong></font></center><br>

<p>FTC announced that Publishers Clearing House would take part 
in the Partnership for Consumer Education--&quot;a cooperative effort among federal 
agencies, private industry, and consumer organizations to provide effective 
consumer education campaigns against fraud.&quot; As part of this campaign, Publishers 
Clearing House, working with FTC, has developed educational materials for 
distribution in prize promotion mailings and Sunday supplements. Messages 
emphasize that consumers don't have to &quot;pay to play,&quot; and that &quot;the best things in 
life are free.&quot; </p>
<p>(FTC Release, July 25, 1996.) </p>

<p align=center><font size=5><strong>FTC WOULD REPEAL USED OIL RULE</strong></font></center><br>

<p>FTC has begun efforts to repeal its Used Oil Rule. The Used Oil Rule's 
labeling and advertising requirements for engine oils have been preempted 
by FTC's newer Recycled Oil Rule, which FTC promulgated in 1995 as required 
by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. </p>
<p>(FTC Release, July 26, 1996.) </p>

<p align=center><font size=5><strong>NEW NAME ON FIBER CONTENT LABELS OF 
CLOTHING PROPOSED</strong></font></center><br>

<p>There may soon be a new name on the fiber content labels of 
certain items of clothing, such as swim suits and ski pants. FTC has proposed to 
allow U.S. manufacturers and other marketers to use the new designated name for 
a fiber that purportedly has stretching properties similar to spandex, but is 
composed of polyester and polyether segments, giving it chemically different 
characteristics. FTC seeks comments on the proposal, which it announced in 
response to a petition filed by Teijin Limited, a Osaka, Japan-based company that 
manufacturers the new fiber under the trade name &quot;REXE.&quot; </p>
<p>The Textile Fiber Products Identification Act requires manufacturers to use the 
generic names of fibers contained in their textile products in the fiber content labels 
of those products. FTC rules and regulations under this statute set out the process 
a manufacturer must go through to establish a new generic fiber name. In October 
1992, Teijin petitioned the FTC to add a fiber name and definition to the list of 
approved generic names established by Rule 7 of the Textile Act maintaining, 
among other things, that the new fiber was in active commercial use in the U.S., 
and that the new fiber does not fall within any existing established generic fiber 
category. </p>
<p>(<EM>Teijin Limited</EM>, FTC Matter No. P968405, July 8, 1996.) </p>

<p align=center><font size=5><strong>VICTORIA STREITFELD NAMED FTC's PUBLIC 
AFFAIRS DIRECTOR</strong></font></center><br>

<p>FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky named Victoria Streitfeld as FTC's 
new Director of Public Affairs, putting her in charge of the office that directs the 
FTC's relations with reporters and other members of the media. </p>
<p>Streitfeld formerly was Director of Communications and spokesperson for Senator 
Bill Bradley. Before that, she held the same positions with the New York State 
Unified Court System. Streitfeld was with the Office of the New York City 
Council President from 1988-1993. She can be reached at 202-326-2718 or 
202-326-2180. </p>
<p>(FTC Release, July 10, 1996.) </p>

<P><B>NOTE:</B> A consent agreement is for settlement purposes only and does 
not constitute an admission of a law violation. When the Commission issues 
a consent order on a final basis, it carries the force of law with respect 
to future actions. Each violation of such an order may result in a civil 
penalty of $10,000. </P>

&nbsp; <p align=center><font size=5><strong>FTC AGREEMENT: INTERNET PROMOTER 
BANNED FROM BUSINESS FOR LIFE</strong></font></center></p>

<p>Advertisers that are not aware of the myriad laws, rules, regulations and administrative decisions affecting their advertising practices are playing a perilous game. A recent Federal Trade Commission (FTC) case illustrates just how perilous that can be-- </p>

<P>An Internet promoter is out of the advance fee credit business forever,
under an agreement he signed to settle FTC charges against him. FTC
charged that he allegedly bolstered his promises of easy credit for
consumers by claiming he had an "excellent record" with the "National
Bureau of Consumer Affairs." FTC charged that the National Bureau of
Consumer Affairs was one of the names under which the promoter
conducted his South Carolina-based fraudulent credit services business.
The settlement negotiated by FTC also requires the promoter to pay
$3,500 in consumer redress, bars him from violating the Telemarketing
Sales Rules' provisions against deceptive or abusive telemarketing
practices, and imposes a broad ban on material misrepresentations in
connection with any product or service he sells in the future.</p> 

<p>FTC's complaint alleged that the promoter advertised VISA cards and
loans with "no credit check" on the Internet and in many publications,
including Income Opportunities and the National Enquirer, and charged
an advance fee of $49. What consumers actually got for their money was
a list of companies offering loans (for which consumers had to
qualify), along with various self-help credit-related materials, said
the agency.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> This consent judgment is for settlement purposes only and does not 
constitute an admission by the defendant of a law violation. Consent 
judgments have the force of law when signed by the judge.</p>

&nbsp; <p align=center><font size=5><strong>FTC LAUNCHES "PROJECT $CHOLAR$CAM"; 
FILES FIVE COMPLAINTS</strong></font></center><br>

<p>On September 5, 1996, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced 
"Project $cholar$cam," under which it filed charges in federal district 
court against five companies, alleging that they took advantage of education 
finance worries to exploit college-bound students and their families. The 
second half of Project $cholar$cam is a major campaign to educate consumers 
in how to identify a fraudulent scholarship search service.  </p>

<p>In each of the five cases announced by FTC, the agency has obtained a
temporary restraining order barring the challenged tactics and freezing
defendants' assets in an effort to preserve funds for possible redress
to consumers. Ultimately, FTC will seek court orders permanently
barring the defendants from engaging in similar fraudulent or deceptive
schemes, and requiring them to give refunds to their customers. </p>

<p>The following is a list of the defendants in Project $cholar$cam and
FTC's allegations in each case:</p>
 
<p>1. <i>Career Assistance Planning, Inc. </i></p>
 
<p>FTC's ALLEGATIONS: "Have sent millions of postcards stating recipients
`may be eligible' for many grants and scholarships and listing an 800
number. Offered a full refund of its $199 fee for students who do not
receive at least $1,000 in scholarship money within one year, or of its
$299 fee for those who do not receive at least $2,000. Ultimately
supplied a list of scholarships that are no longer available or for
which students are ineligible. Some consumers received no list at all.
Consumers received only partial refunds, or none at all. Defendants
also debited consumers' checking accounts or charged their credit
accounts without authorization."</p>
 
<p>(FTC File No. 952 3174; U.S. District Court for the Northern District
of Georgia, in Atlanta, Civil Action No. 1 96-CV-2187-MHS).</p>

<p>2. <i>Christopher Ebere Nwaigwe</i></p>
 
<p>FTC's  ALLEGATIONS: "Obtained mailing lists of college students
organized by field of study and sent at least a thousand letters a day
to students nationwide representing that he has a scholarship for them
or soliciting them to purchase a scholarship list for $10. Stated that
the fee would be refunded for consumers who do not receive a specified
level of funding. Consumers received nothing at all or a list of
agencies that purportedly administer scholarships, but which includes
scholarships for which deadlines had passed or students were

<p>3. <i>Student Assistance Services, Inc.</i> </p>
 
<p>FTC's ALLEGATIONS: "Have sent more than 1 million postcards to high
school and college students advertising scholarship services and
listing an 800 number. Telemarketers told consumers that, for a $179
up-front fee, they could find `unclaimed' scholarship and grant funds
from private companies, and guaranteed to refund the fee if the
students did not get at least $1,000. Consumers received either nothing
at all, or a list of `sources' for financial aid for which they had to
apply on their own or which in fact were contests, loans or work-study
programs. Many sources were no longer available or not suitable for the
student. Students seeking refunds had to apply in writing to each
source on the list and provide rejection letters and, even then, many
did not receive refunds."</p>

<p>FTC's  ALLEGATIONS: "Have mailed more than 1 million post cards to high
school and college students stating that they were eligible for the
defendants' College Scholarship and Grant Program and listing an 800
number. Callers were told that the company was a clearinghouse for
corporations who give scholarships and that millions of dollars in
scholarship funds remain unclaimed. Charged $179 to enroll consumers in
their program on the guarantee that the students would get at least
$1,000. Students received a list with about 40 sources of aid, many of
which were contests, loan or work-study programs, and others of which
were no longer in existence, had expired deadlines or specified
eligibility requirements the students did not meet. In many instances,
the defendants did not give refunds unless students provided a
rejection letter from each source or complied with a variety of other
conditions."</p>

<p>FTC's ALLEGATIONS: "Placed classified ads in college newspapers and
posted flyers on campuses that touted `Money for College!!!!' and
listed an 800 number. Callers were told that, for an up-front fee of
$97, Student Aid would obtain at least $1,000 in scholarships or
grants. Debited consumer's checking accounts without authorization.
Sent some consumers a list which included scholarships and grants for
which deadlines had passed or students did not qualify. Required
students to provide a rejection letter from each source in order to get
promised refunds. </p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> The Commission files a complaint when it has "reason to believe" 
that the law has been or is being violated, and it appears to the 
Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest. The complaint 
is not a finding or ruling that the defendant has actually violated the 
law. The case will be decided by the court. </p>

<p align=center><font size=5><strong>MENU CLAIMS MUST COMPLY WITH FDA RULE</strong></font></p>

<p>Restaurant menu items making such claims as "low fat" or "heart healthy" must be able to show there's a reasonable basis for believing the food is qualified to make this claim, according to recent FDA standards. FDA's July 30, 1996 final rule for the standards gives restaurant owners substantial flexibility in establishing this reasonable basis and in presenting the information to consumers. However, owners must be prepared to show officials that their menu claims are consistent with the claim definitions under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990. </p>

<p>Unlike processed foods, restaurant menu selections needn't supply complete nutrition information. Also, menu items bearing a claim can be shown to meet the rule by more economical means than the strict standards of laboratory analyses required for processed foods. </p>

<p>Example: A restaurant could show that an item was designed to meet the requirements for the claim because it was prepared using a recipe from a recognized health professional association or dietary group, or that the nutritional values for the dish were calculated using a reliable nutrition database. </p>

<p>Also, nutrition information can be given to the consumer by any reasonable means. It doesn't have to be presented in the "Nutrition Facts" format seen on packaged food labels. Nor does it have to appear on the menu. </p>

<p>Example: Information on the fat content of all menu items that bear fat claims could be compiled in a notebook available to consumers on request. </p>

<p>FDA believes the rule's flexibility, limited scope, and compliance date of May 1997 will minimize its economic impact on the restaurant industry. The new menu rules are identical to standards in effect since May 1994 for nutrient content claims on placards and signs in large and medium-sized restaurants, and since May 1995 for such claims in smaller restaurants. </p>

<p align=center><font size=5><strong>FTC EXTENDS DEADLINE FOR JEWELRY 
GUIDES</strong></font></p>

<p>FTC has extended until September 30, 1996, the deadline for public 
comments regarding the portion of its Guides for
the Jewelry, Precious Metals, and Pewter Industries covering claims
about platinum products. FTC granted the extension at the request of
the Manufacturing Jewelers and Silversmiths of America, Inc., an
industry group that requested the extra time to complete a survey of
its members. </p>

<p>FTC's Jewelry Guides are voluntarily and extensively followed by
jewelry and gemstone marketers in advertising their products to
consumers. On May 30, 1996, the FTC announced revisions to the guides,
except for the provision on platinum products, about which it sought
additional comments, setting an original deadline of August 12, 1996. </p>

<p>If you have any comments on these Guides, send them to FTC, Office of
the Secretary, Room H-159, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.,
Washington, D.C. 20580. Identify your comments as "Comments Regarding
Guides for the Jewelry, Precious Metals, and Pewter Industries."</p>

&nbsp; <p align=center><font size=5><strong>FTC GIVES FINAL OK TO AGREEMENT
WITH TV SHOPPING NETWORK</strong></font></center></p>

<P>Home Shopping Network, Inc., and two of its subsidiaries, settled charges that 
they deceptively advertised four mouth sprays--three vitamin sprays and a 
stop-smoking spray--which were promoted on the Home Shopping Club program 
"Spotlight on Ruta Lee." FTC's final consent order requires them to have 
scientific evidence to support any claims (1) that a food, food or dietary 
supplement, or drug cures, treats or prevents any disease or has any effect 
on the structure or function of the human body; and (2) about the performance, 
benefits or efficacy of any smoking-cessation program, product or service.</P>
       
<P><B>NOTE:</B> A consent agreement is for settlement purposes only and does 
not constitute an admission of a law violation. When the Commission issues 
a consent order on a final basis, it carries the force of law with respect 
to future actions. Each violation of such an order may result in a civil 
penalty of $10,000. </P>

<p align=center><font size=5><strong>FTC CHARGES FIRM MISREPRESENTED 
"MONEY-MAKING" REAL ESTATE PROGRAM</strong></font></center></p>

<P>Del Dotto Enterprises, Inc. (DDE), NFN Inc. and David P. Del Dotto agreed 
to settle FTC charges that Del Dotto and his firms made allegedly deceptive 
claims in marketing books and audio tapes about buying real estate and obtaining 
credit--known as the "Cash Flow System,"--including claims that it has helped 
hundreds of thousands of consumers make substantial sums of money buying 
and selling real estate. Under the proposed settlement, defendants would 
be barred from, among other things, misrepresenting the availability of 
government grants, loans, or credit, or the scope of any product or 
service concerning investments, real estate or other business opportunities. 
Also, Del Dotto agreed to pay a judgment of $200,000. </P>

<p>In February 1995, in a complaint filed in federal court, FTC alleged that 
Del Dotto and DDE made false and unsubstantiated claims that consumers trying to 
use the Cash Flow System typically profit from investments in real estate and 
that hundreds of thousands of customers have made substantial sums of money through 
the system. FTC's complaint also alleged that Del Dotto, DDE and NFN Inc. misrepresented 
and failed to deliver other goods and services sold at NFN Inc.-sponsored seminars. </p>

<p>The complaint also alleged that David Del Dotto and NFN Inc. misrepresented the guarantee accompanying a home business package sold at the seminars by failing to inform purchasers that there were conditions to receiving a refund. FTC also challenged as deceptive Del Dotto's and DDE's alleged failure to disclose adequately a restocking fee, amounting to 10% of the purchase price, charged on refunds. </p>

<p>The proposed settlement would permanently bar Del Dotto Enterprises, NFN, 
Inc., and David Del Dotto from making the types of misrepresentations 
alleged in FTC's complaint. Also, defendants would be specifically barred 
from making any representation about the performance, benefits, efficacy or 
success rate of any product or service, the profitability of using any product 
or service, or the profitability of any business opportunity or direct 
marketing activity, unless the representation is true and the defendants 
can substantiate the representation. Also, defendants would be barred from 
representing that any endorsement of a product or service represents the 
typical or ordinary experience of those who use the product or service unless 
it's true. Moreover, defendants would be barred from using such terms as 
"Satisfaction Guarantee," "Money Back Guarantee," "Free Trial Offer," or 
similar representations in advertising unless they refund the full purchase 
price of the advertised product or service at the purchaser's request. 
Defendants also would be barred from failing prominently to disclose material 
limitations on guarantees, warranties and refund policies, and from failing to 
refund money in accordance with guarantees warranties, and refund policies 
within a reasonable period as prescribed by the settlement. </P>

<p>FTC filed the stipulated final judgment and order for permanent injunction 
in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, in San Francisco, 
on September 25, 1996. </p>

<p><B>NOTE:</B> The stipulated final judgment is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by the defendants of a law violation. Consent judgments have the force of law when signed by the judge. </p>

<p>(<I>Del Dotto Enterprises, Inc</I>., NFN Inc. and David P. Del Dotto, Civil Action No. C-95-0425-FMS) (FTC File No. 942-3229, October 2, 1996; materials relating to this FTC matter are available on the Internet at FTC's World Wide Web site at: <a href="http://www.ftc.gov">http://www.ftc.gov</a>.)</p> 
       
<p align=center><font size=5><strong>FTC SETTLEMENT INCLUDES $10,000 FOR REDRESS, $250,000 BOND REQUIREMENT</strong></font></center></p>

<p>Patricia Esme Popp agreed to pay $10,000 to settle FTC charges that she 
enticed consumers to call her nationally advertised 800 number with promises 
of "guaranteed" loans. In fact, all she did was refer consumers to other firms 
to which they could apply for loans, FTC alleged. The settlement resolves charges 
FTC filed in June against Popp, who does business as Glendale Associates, 
Crown Credit Services, and Star Financial Services. In its complaint, FTC 
also had alleged that Popp charged consumers $25 for her "services," a violation 
of the Telemarketing Sales Rule's ban on advance-fee loans. In addition to 
a $400,000 judgment, of which all but $10,000 is waived unless Popp is found 
to have misrepresented her financial condition, FTC settlement would bar Popp 
from violating the Rule and from misrepresenting any credit offer or service 
in the future. The settlement also would protect her future customers by requiring 
her to post a $250,000 bond before engaging in any telemarketing effort and 
before offering any credit services. </p>

<p><B>NOTE:</B> This consent judgment is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by the defendant of a law violation. Consent judgments have the force of law when signed by the judge. </p>

<p>(<I>Patricia Esme Popp</I>, FTC File No. X960084, Civil Action No. 4:96CV183, October 2, 1996; materials relating to this FTC matter are available on the Internet at FTC's World Wide Web site at: <a href="http://www.ftc.gov">http://www.ftc.gov</a>.)</p>

<p align=center><font size=5><strong>FTC STAFF REPORT ON CONSUMERS' FAT CONSUMPTION CITES AD, LABEL CLAIMS</strong></font></center></p>

<p>A recently issued FTC staff report examines changes in consumers' fat, 
saturated fat, and cholesterol consumption from 1977 through 1990. The study 
found that advertising and labeling claims "may have been an important part 
of the information environment helping consumers make better dietary choices 
during the late 1980's."</p>

<p>Jonathan Baker, Director of the FTC's Bureau of Economics, said, "This study is the latest in a long line of staff economic reports examining how seller advertising or information disclosure may help consumers to make more informed choices." </p>

<p>The study looked at detailed food consumption data, as well as annual food production data, from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and consumer survey data on diet-health knowledge from the Food and Drug Administration. According to the study, these different types of independent data permitted examination of consumer knowledge and behavior from several perspectives, allowing a more comprehensive assessment of how diets changed as the policies governing diet-disease claims in advertising and labeling were relaxed in the mid-1980s. </p>

<p>An FTC release noted:</p>

<p>"Overall, the study provides substantial evidence that fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol consumption--for both men and women--fell significantly between 1977 and 1990, as information spread to consumers. Available evidence also indicates that improvements in these dietary characteristics occurred more rapidly and more consistently across food choices after 1985, when health-related claims became more explicit and more frequent in advertising and labeling. For instance, the study found that fat consumption per day fell approximately five percent between 1977 and 1985, but it fell by more than twice that amount between 1985 and 1990 for both men and women."</p>

<p>The study, Information and Advertising Policy: A Study of Fat and Cholesterol Consumption in the United States, 1977-1990, "reflects the views of its authors and not necessarily the views of the Commission or any individual Commissioner."</p>

<p>(<I>Information and Advertising Policy: A Study of Fat and Cholesterol Consumption in the United States, 1977-1990</I>, issued October 7, 1996; materials relating to this FTC matter are available on the Internet at FTC's World Wide Web site at: <a href="http://www.ftc.gov">http://www.ftc.gov</a>.)</p>

<p align=center><font size=5><strong>FTC STREAMLINES GUIDELINES FOR LEATHER, 
IMITATION LEATHER GOODS</strong></font></center></p>

<p>If it looks like leather, is it really leather? Under FTC's recently revised guidelines, the answer is "yes," unless the manufacturer specifically discloses that the product is made of some other material. FTC's new guidelines generally warn manufacturers and retailers against misrepresenting the composition of a variety of products often made from leather--including footwear, luggage, handbags and belts--and are intended to prevent misuse of terms such as waterproof, scratchproof and the like. The new "Guides for Select Leather and Imitation Leather Products" are effective December 2, 1996. </p>

<p>Under the new guidelines, if your products appear to be made of leather but they aren't, you should include a disclosure saying either that the product is not made of leather or the actual type of material from which it is made. If leather is embossed or processed to simulate a different type of leather, you should disclose the leather's true type. Also, you should disclose the composition of backing material in certain situations. The guidelines caution against misrepresentations about the leather content in products containing ground, reconstituted, or bonded leather, and state that such products, when they appear to be made of leather, should be accompanied by a disclosure as to the percentage of leather or other fiber content. The guidelines also say that these disclosures should be included in any product advertising that might otherwise mislead consumers as to the product's composition. </p>

<p>The new guidelines define the terms waterproof, dustproof, warpproof, scuffproof, scratchproof, scuff resistant and scratch resistant to "prevent misuse and misunderstandings."</p>

<p>Guidelines lack the force of law but are meant to encourage voluntary compliance with the Federal Trade Commission Act. </p>

<p>(<I>"Guides for Select Leather and Imitation Leather Products"</I>, FTC File No. P958011, October 3, 1996; materials relating to this FTC matter are available on the Internet at FTC's World Wide Web site at: <a href="http://www.ftc.gov">http://www.ftc.gov</a>.)</p>

<p align=center><font size=5><strong>FTC GRANTS PETITION INVOLVING 
COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING</strong></font></center></p>

<p>FTC has granted in part the petition of Pendleton Woolen Mills, Inc. to reopen and modify a 1979 order, thus allowing Pendleton to engage in lawful, price restrictive, cooperative advertising and to unilaterally terminate a reseller of its products for failing to adhere to Pendleton's announced resale prices or sale periods. FTC denied Pendleton's request for one modification in the order on grounds that the change could be construed to allow agreements on advertised prices that go beyond cooperative advertising programs.</p>

<P>Do you advertise to children? Will your advertising reach substantial numbers of children? Then you should be aware of the rules, regulations, guidelines and decisions of a large variety of advertising monitors. Here's a partial list of such entities:

<UL>
<LI>Federal Trade Commission (FTC);
<LI>Food and Drug Administration (FDA);
<LI>Congress;
<LI>State Legislatures;
<LI>The Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) (the children's advertising review arm of the ad industry's self-regulatory system.
</UL>

<P>A recent administrative decision illustrates how just one of those entities--the Federal Trade Commission--can step in when it believes advertising directed to children runs afoul of its rules. FTC also entered into a separate consent order with the same advertising agency over low-fat ads.</p>

<P>FTC finalized two consent orders with Grey Advertising, Inc., of New York 
City, settling charges over the role the advertising agency played in 
advertising a paint-sprayer toy marketed by Hasbro, Inc., and The Dannon 
Company's "Pure Indulgence" line of frozen yogurt. The order in connection 
with the Hasbro toy resolves allegations that the commercial at issue used 
a hidden motorized air compressor to misrepresent how easily children could 
operate the sprayer. This order bars Grey from using deceptive demonstrations 
or otherwise misrepresenting the performance of any toy.</P>

<P>The second order settles charges that the commercial at issue falsely implied 
that some of the flavors in the Pure Indulgence line were low in fat and 
calories, and lower in fat than ice cream. This order bars Grey from 
misrepresenting the fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, or calories in any 
frozen yogurt, frozen sorbet, and most ice cream products.</P>

<P>Grey Advertising, Inc. is the third largest advertising agency in the U.S.</P>

<P>(<I>Grey Advertising, Inc.</I>, FTC File No. 952 3231, FTC Dkt. No. C-3690 (the 
toy ad order), November 1, 1996. You can find much more information about these cases in  <B>Advertising Compliance Service</B> in the following article: "Advertiser to Pay $280,000 Civil Penalty in Toy Advertising Case," Tab #4, False, Unfair, Deceptive, Article #72. 

<P> <I>Grey Advertising, Inc.</I>, FTC Dkt. No. C-3691 (the frozen yogurt order), November 1, 1996.

<P>See, also, <B>Advertising Compliance Service</B>, "FTC Chair Gives Advertising's "State of the Union" Message at AAF Conference," Tab #4, False, Unfair, Deceptive, Article #69  <EM>and</EM> <B>Advertising Compliance Service</B>, Bulletin #366, page 2.

<P>Materials relating to this FTC matter are available on the Internet at FTC's World Wide Web site at: <a href="http://www.ftc.gov">http://www.ftc.gov</a>.)</P>

<p align=center><font size=5><strong>FTC FINALIZES CONSENT ORDER WITH 
 INVENTOR</strong></font></center></p>

<P>The inventor of the "Rust Evader" agreed to pay $200,000 in consumer 
redress and abide by a ban on use of the names "Rust Evader" or "Rust Buster" 
for this or similar devices, as part of a now-finalized agreement he 
signed with FTC.</P>

<P>The final order also bars McCready from claiming that this or similar 
devices prevent or substantially reduce corrosion, and from misrepresenting 
the existence or results of test or studies or that any demonstration proves 
any material feature of any product for use in motor vehicles; requires him 
to have substantiation to back up performance or efficacy claims about any 
product for use in motor vehicles; and bars him from conditioning warranty 
coverage for any consumer product on the purchase by consumers of a 
certain brand-named or trade-named product or service.</P>

<P>(<I>RustEvader Corporation</I>, FTC Docket No. D-9274, November 1, 1996; 
see, also, <B>Advertising Compliance Service</B>, Tab #2, General Articles, 
Article #277 <EM>and</EM> <B>Advertising Compliance Service</B>, Bulletin #366, page 3; materials relating to this FTC matter are available on the 
Internet at FTC's World Wide Web site at: <a href="http://www.ftc.gov">http://www.ftc.gov</a>.)</P>


<p align=center><font size=5><strong>FTC FOCUSES ON PRICE RESTRICTIVE COOPERATIVE AD PROGRAMS</strong></font></center></p>

<P>Let's say you entered into a consent agreement with FTC many years ago that contain requirements that bind your company's actions to this day. But market or other conditions have changed significantly since the day you signed that agreement. Are you without recourse? No. You may petition FTC to modify that consent order based on those changed conditions. 

<p>In a recent illustrative case, FTC granted in part and denied in part a petition from Onkyo U.S.A. Corporation, of Ramsey, New Jersey, to modify a 1982 consent order. FTC granted Onkyo's request to modify the order to allow the company 
to implement price restrictive cooperative advertising programs.

<P>(<I>Onkyo U.S.A. Corporation</I>, FTC Dkt. No. C-3092, November 1, 1996; see also   <B>Advertising Compliance Service</B>, Bulletin #366, page 3.)</P>

<P><B>NOTE:</B> A consent agreement is for settlement purposes only and does 
not constitute an admission of a law violation. When the Commission issues 
a consent order on a final basis, it carries the force of law with respect 
to future actions. Each violation of such an order may result in a civil 
penalty of $10,000. </P>

<h2 align=center>PRESIDENT CLINTON ANNOUNCES 
HISTORIC STEPS TO REDUCE 
CHILDREN'S USE OF TOBACCO</h2>
<hr>
<p>President Clinton today announced the nation's first comprehensive program to 
prevent children and adolescents from smoking cigarettes or using smokeless 
tobacco and beginning a lifetime of nicotine addiction. The President's 
announcement comes a little more than a year after the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) issued its proposed rule to reduce the access and appeal of 
tobacco products for children and adolescents. </p>
<p>The FDA rule-making on children and tobacco prompted the largest outpouring 
of public response in the Agency's history with more than 95,000 individual 
comments received, totaling more than 700,000 pieces of mail when form letters 
are counted. The final rule was put on display today at the Federal Register and 
will be published in the Federal Register next week. </p>
<p>Each day, almost 3,000 young people in the United States become regular 
smokers, and nearly 1,000 of them will die prematurely from diseases related to 
tobacco use. Each year, more than 400,000 Americans die from smoking-related 
diseases, more Americans than are killed each year by AIDS, alcohol, car 
accidents, murders, suicides, illegal drugs, and fires combined. </p>
<p>In the past four years, the United States has experienced dramatic increases in 
tobacco use by youngsters. Between 1991 and 1995, the percentage of eighth- 
and tenth-graders who smoke increased 34 percent. In 1995, more than a third of 
12th-graders reported smoking in the past month, and daily smoking in that group 
was up to 21.6 percent. Among 10th-graders, current use was up to 27.9 
percent, and daily use was up to 16.3 percent. </p>
<p>The President's goal is to cut in half tobacco use by children and adolescents over 
the next seven years. </p>
<p>&quot;This is the most important public health initiative of our generation,&quot; said Health 
and Human Services Secretary Donna E. Shalala. &quot;Our children's futures are at 
stake. President Clinton's action will ensure that children get their information 
about tobacco from their parents -- and not from Joe Camel.&quot; </p>
<p>The President's initiative to protect children is based on the final FDA rule that will 
make it harder for young people to buy cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and will 
reduce the appeal of tobacco products to children under 18. The rule is based on 
the Agency's finding that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products are delivery 
devices for nicotine, an addictive drug. In addition to the rule, the FDA will 
propose to require tobacco companies to educate children and adolescents about 
the health risks of tobacco use as part of the President's initiative. This national 
mass media campaign would be monitored for its effectiveness. </p>
<p>Cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products remain legal products that can be 
marketed and sold to adults, 18 years and older. </p>
<p>&quot;Nicotine addiction is a pediatric disease that often begins at 12, 13, and 14 only 
to manifest itself at 16 and 17 when these children find they cannot quit,&quot; said 
Commissioner of Food and Drugs David A. Kessler, M.D. &quot;By then our children 
have lost their freedom and face the prospect of lives shortened by terrible 
diseases.&quot; </p>
<p>The President's initiative follows the recommendations of major medical and 
scientific organizations such as the American Medical Association and National 
Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine. It is a prevention strategy based on 
reducing children's access to tobacco products and limiting the appeal of these 
products to children. The tobacco industry spends more than $6 billion annually 
on advertising and promotion. </p>
<p>Besides the final rule, the FDA will propose to require tobacco companies to 
provide strong educational messages for children on the real dangers of smoking 
and using smokeless tobacco. This national multi-media campaign would include 
television spots, and it would be monitored for its effectiveness. FDA intends to 
begin consultations about this campaign with the nation's six tobacco companies 
with a significant share of sales to children. Under Section 518 of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the FDA may require companies to inform 
consumers about the unreasonable health risks of their products. </p>
<p>&quot;We have to tell our children the truth about the diseases caused by smoking,&quot; 
Kessler said. &quot;For too long we have sent conflicting messages to our children and 
then have acted surprised when they begin to smoke.&quot; </p>
<p>In reviewing the public comments and developing a final rule, the FDA made a 
number of changes to more narrowly tailor provisions to children. For instance, 
there was little evidence presented that mail-order sales are used by children and 
adolescents, while they are used by adults in rural areas. Similarly, vending 
machines in facilities totally inaccessible to persons under 18 will accommodate 
adults while preventing easy access by young people. </p>
<p>The FDA rule reduces children's easy access to tobacco products by: </p>
<ul>
<li><i>Requiring age verification by photo ID for anyone under the age of 27 
purchasing tobacco products; </i></li>
<li><i>Banning vending machines and self-service displays except in &quot;adult&quot; 
facilities where children are not allowed, such as certain nightclubs 
totally inaccessible to anyone under 18; and </i></li>
<li><i>Banning free samples, the sale of single cigarettes, and packages 
containing fewer than 20 cigarettes. </i></li>
</ul>
<p>The FDA rule limits the appeal of tobacco products to children by: </p>
<ul>
<li><i>Prohibiting billboards within 1,000 feet of schools and playgrounds. 
Other advertising is restricted to black-and- white text only; this 
includes all billboards, signs inside and outside of buses, and all 
advertising in stores. Advertising inside &quot;adult only&quot; facilities like 
nightclubs can have color and imagery. </i></li>
<li><i>Permitting black-and-white text-only advertising in publications with 
significant youth readership (under 18). Significant youth readership 
means more than 15 percent or more than 2 million readers under 18; 
there are no restrictions on print advertising below these thresholds. </i></li>
<li><i>Prohibiting sale or giveaways of products like caps or gym bags that 
carry cigarette or smokeless tobacco product brand names or logos. </i></li>
<li><i>Prohibiting brand-name sponsorship of sporting or entertainment 
events (including teams and entries), but permitting it in the corporate 
name. </i></li>
</ul>
<p>These provisions will be phased in between six months and two years from the 
date of publication in the Federal Register to give businesses adequate time to 
comply. </p>

<h2 align=center>KEY ELEMENTS OF THE PRESIDENT'S 
PLAN TO REDUCE CHILDREN'S USE OF 
TOBACCO</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><i>President Clinton today established the nation's first-ever 
comprehensive program to protect children from the dangers of 
tobacco and a lifetime of nicotine addiction with the publication of the 
Food and Drug Administration's final rule on tobacco and children, 
and with FDA's initiation of a process to require tobacco companies 
to educate children and adolescents -- using a national multi-media 
campaign -- about the dangers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. </i><p><i>This comprehensive and coordinated plan is intended to reduce 
tobacco use by children and adolescents by 50 percent in seven years. 
It builds on previous actions taken by Congress and others such as the 
ban on television advertising and state laws to prohibit the sale or use 
of tobacco by children. It follows recommendations by the American 
Medical Association and the National Academy of Science's Institute 
of Medicine. Experts have consistently recommended that the keys to 
achieving the goal are reducing access and limiting the appeal to 
children. This ambitious initiative accomplishes that objective while 
preserving the availability of tobacco products for adults. </i></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reducing Easy Access by Children</h3>
<p>Children and adolescents continue to have easy access to tobacco products. In 
13 studies reviewed by the Surgeon General, minors were successfully able to 
buy cigarettes 67 percent of the time. Of the nine studies of vending machines, 
illegal sales were successful on average 88 percent of the time. The FDA rule will: </p>
<ul>
<li>Require age verification and face-to-face sale (except for mail orders), and 
eliminate free samples, and the sale of single cigarettes and packages with 
fewer than 20 cigarettes. </li>
<li>Ban vending machines and self-service displays except in facilities where 
only adults are permitted, such as certain nightclubs totally inaccessible to 
persons under 18. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Reducing Appeal to Children</h3>
<p>Tobacco products are among the most heavily advertised and promoted products 
in the United States, with the tobacco industry spending more than $6 billion 
annually. Children and adolescents are widely exposed to and influenced by this 
advertising and promotion. One study found that 30 percent of 3-year-olds and 
91 percent of 6-year-olds could identify &quot;Joe Camel&quot; as a symbol of smoking. 
Another study found that 86 percent of underage smokers who buy their own 
cigarettes purchase one of the three most heavily advertised brands. The FDA 
rule will: </p>
<ul>
<li>Ban outdoor advertising within 1,000 feet of schools and publicly-owned 
playgrounds. Permit black-and-white text- only advertising for all other 
outdoor advertising, including billboards, signs inside and outside of buses, 
and all point-of-sale advertising. Advertising inside &quot;adult only&quot; facilities like 
nightclubs can use color and imagery. </li>
<li>Permit black-and-white text-only advertising in publications with significant 
youth readership (under 18). Significant readership means more than 15 
percent or more than 2 million. There are no restrictions on print advertising 
below these thresholds. </li>
<li>Prohibit sale or giveaway of products like caps or gym bags that carry 
cigarette or smokeless tobacco product brand names or logos. </li>
<li>Prohibit brand-name sponsorship of sporting (including teams and entries) 
or entertainment events, but permit it in the corporate name. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Educating Children About Real Dangers of Smoking</h3>
<p>In addition to the rule and its provisions aimed at reducing access and appeal, the 
FDA will propose to require each of the six tobacco companies with significant 
sales to children to educate young people about the real health dangers associated 
with the use of tobacco products. This national multi-media campaign, including 
television spots, would be monitored for its effectiveness. </p>
<p>The FDA will initiate the process under Section 518 of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act, which allows the FDA to require companies to notify 
consumers about the unreasonable health risks of their products. </p>
<h3>Focusing on Children</h3>
<p>In reviewing the more than 95,000 individual comments received from the public 
during the comment period, the FDA made a number of changes aimed at more 
narrowly targeting the rule to its goal: reducing the use of tobacco products among 
children and adolescents under 18. Changes include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Vending machines and self-service displays will be allowed in facilities 
where only adults are permitted. By removing vending machines and 
self-service displays from sites accessible to children, the rule's goal will still 
be achieved, and the Agency will closely monitor the effectiveness of this 
provision for two years to determine if additional restrictions are necessary. </li>
<li>Mail-order sales will be permitted. This provision will allow adults in rural 
or isolated areas to have access to these products. There was little 
evidence presented that children use mail order at the present time, but the 
Agency will monitor future trends. </li>
<li>Advertising using color and imagery will be permitted in &quot;adult only&quot; 
facilities totally inaccessible to persons under 18, provided that the 
advertising is not visible from the outside and is not removable. </li>
</ul>
<p>Some state and local laws that are different from, or in addition to, this rule will be 
preempted under this rule. However, the Agency is establishing an expedited 
process for state and local government to apply for waivers for more stringent 
laws or regulations. The FDA believes the requirements it is establishing set an 
appropriate floor but as a matter of policy, the Agency should leave open the 
possibility for state or local governments to adopt more restrictive requirements. 
State laws not related to the rule -- such as local bans on smoking in restaurants 
-- will not be affected. </p>

<h2 align=center>CHILDREN'S FUTURE AT RISK FROM 
EPIDEMIC OF TOBACCO USE</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><i>President Clinton's initiative to reduce tobacco use by children is the 
result of an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration into 
industry practices and an extensive review of successful measures in 
preventing children from using tobacco products. After the proposed 
rule was published on August 11, 1995, the public was invited to 
comment until January 2, 1996. The Agency received more than 
95,000 different comments, totaling more than 700,000 pieces of mail. 
The subsequent review and analysis of those comments, as well as the 
Agency's initial work, provide a solid base for the FDA's measures to 
reduce access and limit appeal of tobacco products for children. </i><p><i>Today, an estimated 4.5 million children and adolescents smoke in the 
United States, and another 1 million use smokeless tobacco. Each 
year, another 1 million young people join the ranks of regular 
smokers, and nearly one out of every three young people who smoke 
will have their lives shortened from the terrible diseases caused by 
smoking. </i></p>
<p><i>This public health crisis is worsening. Children are starting to smoke 
at younger and younger ages: Today, the average teenage smoker 
begins to smoke at 14 1/2 years old and becomes a daily smoker 
before age 18. And those children soon regret this loss of freedom. 
The Gallup Poll in 1992 found that 70 percent of smokers between the 
ages of 12 and 17 regret beginning to smoke and 66 percent want to 
quit. </i></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Children at Risk</h3>
<p><b><i>Children are becoming addicted to nicotine.</i></b> More than 80 percent of all 
adult smokers had tried smoking by their 18th birthday and more than half of them 
had already become regular smokers by that age. Although only 5 percent of daily 
smokers surveyed in high school said they would definitely be smoking five years 
later, close to 75 percent were smoking 7 to 9 years later. Of the almost 3,000 
young people who become regular smokers each day, nearly 1,000 of them will 
have their lives shortened from tobacco-related diseases. </p>
<h3>Costs of Smoking Staggering</h3>
<p><b><i>Health care costs associated with tobacco use are rising.</i></b> The Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention estimated that in 1993 the health care costs 
associated with smoking totaled $50 billion: $26.9 billion for hospital costs; $15.5 
billion for doctors; $4.9 billion in nursing home costs; $1.8 billion for prescription 
drugs, and $900 million for home-health care expenditures. The Office of 
Technology Assessment calculated the social costs attributable to smoking in 
1990 at $68 billion. The calculation was based on $20.8 billion in direct health 
care costs and $6.9 billion in lost productivity from sickness and disabilities and 
$40.3 billion in lost productivity from premature deaths. </p>
<h3>Benefits Outweigh Costs</h3>
<p><b><i>Protecting the future health of our children provides a benefit that will 
continue to pay dividends for our society.</i></b> The annual benefits from reduced 
disease caused by smoking are projected to be $28 to $43 billion. These benefits 
are achieved through annual net medical cost savings of $2.6 billion, annual 
morbidity-related productivity savings of $900 million, and annual benefits of 
reduced mortality of $24.6 to $39.7 billion. Under the final rule, manufacturers of 
tobacco products are projected to have one-time costs of $78 to $91 million and 
annual operating costs of $2 million. Retailers are projected to have one-time 
costs of $96 million and annual costs of $78 million, compared to the $45 billion 
to $50 billion spent annually on tobacco products at the retail level. </p>

<h2 align=center>LEGAL ISSUES RELATING TO FDA RULE 
ON CHILDREN AND TOBACCO</h2>
<hr>
<p align=center><b><i>FDA JURISDICTION</i></b> </p>
<p><b>FDA has concluded that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are delivery 
devices for nicotine, a drug that causes addiction and other significant 
pharmacological effects.</b> The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act provides 
that a product is a drug or device if it is an article (other than food) &quot;intended to 
affect the structure or any function of the body.&quot; </p>
<p>Nicotine in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco does &quot;affect the structure or any 
function of the body&quot; because: </p>
<ul>
<li><i>-- nicotine in these products causes and sustains addiction; </i><p><i>-- nicotine in these products causes other mood-altering effects, 
including tranquilization and stimulation; </i></p>
<p><i>-- nicotine in these products controls body weight. </i></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Manufacturers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco &quot;intend&quot; these effects 
because: </p>
<ul>
<li><i>-- the addictive and pharmacological effects are so widely known and 
accepted, a reasonable manufacturer can foresee the products will be 
used by consumers for these effects; </i><p><i>-- consumers use these products predominantly for pharmacological 
purposes; </i></p>
<p><i>-- manufacturers know that nicotine in their products causes 
pharmacological effects and that consumers use their products 
primarily to obtain these effects; </i></p>
<p><i>-- manufacturers of these products design the products to provide 
consumers with a pharmacologically active dose of nicotine; and </i></p>
<p><i>-- an inevitable consequence of the design of these products to provide 
consumers with a pharmacologically active dose of nicotine is to 
sustain consumers' addiction to nicotine. </i></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p align=center><b><i>RULE PROTECTS APPROPRIATE COMMERCIAL SPEECH</i></b> </p>
<p><b>The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld restrictions on commercial speech if 
certain standards are met.</b> Given that selling cigarettes and smokeless tobacco 
to children under 18 is already illegal in every state, the rule is aimed at regulating 
commercial speech to ensure that an illegal activity is not promoted. Furthermore, 
the rule is narrowly tailored to meet the tests established by the U.S. Supreme 
Court in its opinions on commercial speech, including 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. 
Rhode Island. </p>
<ul>
<li><i>-- Protecting the health of children under 18 is a substantial 
government interest justifying restrictions on tobacco advertising that 
appeals to children; </i><p><i>-- Advertising and promotion have been shown to play a material role 
in children beginning and continuing to use tobacco products, and 
therefore the regulations directly advance the government's interest; 
and </i></p>
<p><i>-- Permitting unrestricted advertising in publications primarily read 
by adults and permitting companies to sponsor events in the corporate 
name -- instead of the brand identifications so appealing to young 
people -- are examples of how the rule is narrowly tailored to advance 
the government's interest. </i></p>

<h2 align=center>REDUCING CHILDREN'S USE OF 
TOBACCO</h2>
<h2 align=center>A Chronology</h2>
<hr>
<p><b>February 25, 1994:</b> The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), responding to a 
petition asking FDA to regulate low-tar and low- nicotine cigarettes, writes a 
letter to the Coalition on Smoking or Health stating that the Agency will consider 
the question of whether it has jurisdiction over nicotine-containing tobacco 
products. </p>
<p><b>March 25, 1994:</b> Food and Drug Commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D., 
testifies before the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment of the House 
Committee on Energy and Commerce on FDA's preliminary evidence -- including 
industry patents and analyses of nicotine-to- tar ratios -- that cigarette companies 
control the levels of nicotine in a manner that creates and sustains addiction in the 
vast majority of smokers. </p>
<p><b>April 14, 1994:</b> The Subcommittee on Health and the Environment of the House 
Committee on Energy and Commerce hears testimony from the chief executives 
of seven tobacco companies on the industry's views on nicotine addiction and on 
industry practices with regard to nicotine, and each executive denies that nicotine 
in tobacco products is addictive. </p>
<p><b>April 28, 1994:</b> The Subcommittee on Health and the Environment of the House 
Committee on Energy and Commerce hears testimony from two former Philip 
Morris scientists, Victor DeNoble and Paul Mele, on their company-sponsored 
research establishing the addictive properties of nicotine. </p>
<p><b>June 21, 1994:</b> Food and Drug Commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D., testifies 
before the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment of the House Committee 
on Energy and Commerce on evidence developed by the FDA of the cigarette 
industry's manipulation of nicotine, specifically one company's breeding of high 
nicotine levels in one strain of tobacco and the use of chemical compounds in 
cigarettes to enhance nicotine delivery to smokers. </p>
<p><b>August 2, 1994:</b> FDA's Drug Abuse Advisory Committee holds a public hearing 
on the addictiveness of nicotine-containing tobacco products and concludes that 
products currently marketed contain nicotine at levels sufficient to create and 
sustain addiction in consumers. </p>
<p><b>August 10, 1995:</b> President Clinton announces the proposed FDA rule to reduce 
the access and appeal of tobacco products to children and adolescents and his 
goal of reducing children's use of tobacco products by 50 percent within seven 
years of final Agency action. The rule is published the next day in the Federal 
Register and a public comment period begins. </p>
<p><b>January 2, 1996:</b> The public comment period for the proposed FDA rule closes, 
with a total of more than 95,000 different comments -- more than 700,000 pieces 
of mail -- received. </p>
<p><b>January 18, 1996:</b> The Department of Health and Human Services and the 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration issue the final Synar 
Rule designed to ensure that states and territories adopt and enforce laws 
prohibiting the sale or distribution of tobacco products to children. </p>
<p><b>March 18, 1996:</b> FDA re-opens the public comment period for the limited 
purpose of seeking comments on the statements of three former Philip Morris 
employees about that company's manipulation of nicotine in the design and 
production of cigarettes and to seek comments on further explanations of certain 
provisions in the proposed rule. </p>
<p><b>April 19, 1996:</b> The limited comment period closes. </p>
<p><b>August 23, 1996:</b> President Clinton announces the publication of the final FDA 
rule to restrict access and reduce appeal of tobacco products for children and 
adolescents and FDA's proposal to mount a national mass-media campaign for 
young people on the dangers of tobacco use. </p>

<hr>
<h1 align=center>Executive Summary</h1>
<h1 align=center>The Regulations Restricting the<br>
Sale and Distribution<br>
Of Cigarettes and Smokeless 
Tobacco<br>
To Protect Children and 
Adolescents</h1>
<h2>I. Introduction</h2>
<p>With the August 1996 publication of a final rule on tobacco in the <cite>Federal 
Register</cite>, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will regulate the sale and 
distribution of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to children and adolescents. The 
action results from the agency's assertion of jurisdiction over tobacco products. 
This was based on an intensive FDA investigation of the tobacco industry, 
tobacco use and its health consequences. The rule will prohibit the sale of 
cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to those under 18 while leaving them on the 
market for adults. </p>
<p>Tobacco use is the single leading preventable cause of death in the United States.<sup>1</sup> 
It kills more than 400,000 Americans each year <sup>2</sup> -- more people each year than 
AIDS, car accidents, alcohol, homicides, illegal drugs, suicides, and fires, 
combined.<sup>3</sup> </p>
<p>The use of tobacco products, and the resulting nicotine addiction, begins 
predominantly in children and adolescents and is, consequently, a pediatric 
disease. Approximately 3 million American adolescents currently smoke, and an 
additional 1 million adolescent males use smokeless tobacco.<sup>4</sup> Each year, another 
1 million young people become regular smokers.<sup>5</sup> Approximately one out of every 
three of these young people will die prematurely as a result.<sup>6</sup> </p>
<p>Studies suggest that anyone who does not begin to use tobacco as a child or 
adolescent is unlikely to start as an adult. Eighty-two percent of adults who ever 
smoked had their first cigarette before age 18, and more than half of them had 
already become regular smokers by that age.<sup>7</sup> Among smokers ages 12 to 17 
years, 70 percent already regret their decision to smoke and 66 percent say that 
they want to quit.<sup>8</sup> </p>
<p>Furthermore, studies show that children and adolescents are starting to smoke at 
earlier and earlier ages.<sup>9</sup> Data reported in December 1995 showed that the 
proportion of 8th- and 10th-graders who reported smoking in the 30 days before 
the survey had risen by one-third since 1991, to about 19 percent and 28 percent 
respectively.<sup>10</sup> </p>
<p>Similar problems exist with underage use of smokeless tobacco. School-based 
surveys in 1991 estimated that 19.2 percent of 9th- to 12th-grade boys use 
smokeless tobacco.<sup>11</sup> </p>
<p>Finally, studies show that young people do not fully understand the serious health 
risks of these products, or believe that those risks do not apply to them. They are 
also very impressionable and therefore vulnerable to the sophisticated marketing 
techniques employed by the tobacco industry, techniques that associate the use of 
tobacco products with excitement, glamour, and independence.</p>
<p>The wealth of information assembled by the agency about nicotine's addictive 
properties led FDA to conclude that it has jurisdiction over tobacco products. 
The age of onset of nicotine addiction, and its well-known consequences, 
suggested the best way for the agency to regulate tobacco to protect the public 
health. </p>
<p>Of the fifty million12 people who smoke cigarettes, 77-92 percent are addicted.<sup>13</sup> 
Because an outright ban of tobacco products could have profound health 
consequences for these tens of millions of addicted smokers, FDA has chosen 
instead to focus on preventing children and adolescents from becoming addicted 
to these products in the first place. Evidence in the administrative record (the 
collection of documents gathered by FDA during its investigation and made 
publicly available) demonstrates that the most effective way to achieve this goal is 
to limit the access to, and appeal of, cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to children 
and adolescents.</p>
<p>Specifically, the rule makes the sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to 
children and adolescents, anyone younger than 18 years of age, a federal 
violation. In addition, the rule requires manufacturers, distributors, and retailers to 
comply with certain conditions regarding the sale, distribution and promotion of 
tobacco products. It prohibits all free samples and limits retail sales in most 
circumstances to face-to-face transactions. As a result, vending machines and 
self-service displays are prohibited, except in facilities where the retailer or 
operator ensures that no person younger than 18 is present or is permitted to 
enter at any time. </p>
<p>The rule limits advertising generally to a black-and-white, text-only format to 
ensure that advertising is not used to create demand for these products among 
young people and thus undermine the restrictions on access. Billboards and other 
outdoor advertising are prohibited within 1,000 feet of schools and public 
playgrounds. The sale and distribution of non-tobacco items, such as hats and tee 
shirts that carry cigarette logos, such as Joe Camel, are prohibited, and 
sponsorship of sporting and other events is limited to the corporate name only.</p>
<hr>
<h2>II. Background</h2>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration proposed to regulate tobacco products on 
August 10, 1995. This proposed rule, which was published in the <cite>Federal 
Register</cite> on August 11, resulted from a more than yearlong investigation by FDA 
into the role that nicotine plays in tobacco products, patterns of tobacco product 
use, and the role of advertising and promotional practices in young people's 
decision to use tobacco products. </p>
<p>From publication of the proposed rule in August 1995 until January 1996, FDA 
accepted comments from the public. Reactions came from many sections of 
society, including the tobacco and advertising industries, medical and public 
interest groups, and individual citizens. FDA reopened the comment period for 
one month from mid-March to mid-April to accept public comments on specific 
documents that were added to the public record. </p>
<p>The agency received more comments on the proposed rule -- some 700,000 
pieces of mail -- than at any other time in the history of federal rule making. Both 
supporters and opponents organized campaigns to generate reactions to the 
proposed rule; the agency identified more than 500 different types of form letters. 
One massive campaign, which opposed the rule, generated over 300,000 pieces 
of mail -- 42 percent of all the mail received. Some 95,000 people, including 
more than 35,000 children, sent individual views. The children's comments were 
overwhelmingly supportive. The largest single comment, submitted by the cigarette 
industry, consisted of approximately 45,000 pages.</p>
<p>Although many of the comments were addressed to specific provisions of the 
proposed regulation, tens of thousands of letters contained general comments. 
Many expressed strong overall opposition to the rule; many others expressed 
strong support. Comments came from every corner of the country, from federal, 
state and local government officials, from smokers who felt the government was 
inappropriately meddling in their lives, and from smokers desperate, but unable, to 
quit. The agency heard from employers and employees in the affected industries, 
including tobacco farmers, wholesalers, cigarette manufacturers, and laborers who 
fear that the regulation may cause the loss of their employment. One supportive 
letter came from a coalition of medical associations representing 125 groups with 
more than 18 million members. Supporters and opponents alike agreed that 
children under age 18 should not use nicotine-containing tobacco products.</p>
<p>Some comments opposing the proposed rule argued that FDA should not regulate 
tobacco and should focus instead on its traditional responsibilities. Still others said 
FDA should not interfere with the free choice of adults, and some feared that the 
rule was just the first step toward a total ban. Additional comments opposing the 
proposed rule in general argued that there is no need to regulate tobacco because 
the products are already highly controlled. </p>
<p>In contrast, comments supporting the proposed rule said that existing tobacco 
regulations do not address the health consequences of tobacco, nor do they 
effectively prevent sales to minors. Many pointed out that tobacco use is the single 
most preventable cause of death in the United States, and that, because of the 
serious health risks associated with these products, it is essential that the 
government take action to reduce the number of young people who begin 
smoking or using smokeless tobacco. A number of comments indicated that 
children and adolescents are drawn to the images associated with smoking and 
that steps should be taken to prevent young people from being bombarded by 
these tobacco messages. </p>
<hr>
<h2>III. Overview of Statutory and Constitutional 
Authority</h2>
<p>The federal Food and Drug Administration's authority to carry out its mission to 
protect the public health derives primarily from the federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (the act).<sup>14</sup> This statute provides the agency authority to regulate a 
wide array of consumer products, including drugs and devices.</p>
<p>In order to assert jurisdiction over cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, these 
products must meet at least one of the definitions of a regulated product. As 
discussed thoroughly in the 1996 Jurisdictional Determination,<sup>15</sup> FDA has 
concluded: (1) that cigarettes are &quot;combination products,&quot; having both a drug 
component, including nicotine, and device components, namely processed 
tobacco, the ventilation system, and filters; and (2) that smokeless tobacco is a 
combination product that consists of a drug component, nicotine, and device 
components, specifically processed tobacco, and for some products, a porous 
pouch. </p>
<p>Congress gave the agency considerable latitude to decide whether to regulate 
drug/device combination products using the act's drug authorities, device 
authorities, or both. FDA has determined that tobacco products are most 
appropriately regulated under the device provisions of the act, including the 
restricted device authority in section 520(e) of the act, which allows the agency to 
impose restrictions on the sale, distribution, and use of a product. </p>
<p>During the public comment period, some opponents challenged FDA's legal 
authority to impose the proposed restrictions, arguing that the agency's action 
would violate various laws and parts of the Constitution, including the Separation 
of Powers and Nondelegation doctrines, and the First, Fifth, Ninth and Tenth 
Amendments. After carefully considering these arguments, the agency has 
concluded that the statutory and constitutional bases of FDA's jurisdiction and 
regulation are sound. </p>
<hr>
<h2>IV. The Rule</h2>
<p>The provisions of the rule are based on the agency's investigation of tobacco 
products and nicotine's addictiveness, the evidence in the public administrative 
record, and the review and consideration of the comments received on the 
proposed rule. In some instances, that review strengthened FDA's original 
position; in others, it caused the agency to either eliminate or modify some 
provisions.</p>
<h3>1. Restricting Access to Children and Adolescents</h3>
<p>The rule makes the sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products to children 
and adolescents younger than age 18 a violation of federal law. Currently, young 
people purchase an estimated $1.26 billion of tobacco products annually. <sup>16</sup> 
Despite laws in all 50 states that prohibit sales to minors, numerous studies show 
that adolescents have little difficulty purchasing tobacco products. The 1994 
Surgeon General's report examined 13 studies of over-the-counter sales and 
determined that approximately 67 percent of minors were able to purchase 
cigarettes illegally.<sup>17</sup> Significant numbers of young people successfully purchase 
smokeless tobacco as well, with 90 percent of smokeless tobacco users in junior 
high and high school saying they buy their own smokeless tobacco.<sup>18</sup> </p>
<p>Other studies indicate that actively enforced access restrictions have been 
effective. For example, a comprehensive community intervention in Woodridge, 
Illinois, involving retailer licensing, regular compliance checks, and penalties for 
merchant violations, reduced illegal sales from 70 percent to less than five percent 
in under two years.<sup>19</sup> Rates of both experimentation and regular smoking 
decreased more than 50 percent among seventh and eighth grade students in this 
community.</p>
<p>This study, as well as other studies reviewed by FDA, led the agency to draft a 
comprehensive proposal to reduce young people's access to cigarettes and 
smokeless tobacco, and to make explicit the responsibility of manufacturers, 
distributors, and retailers to prevent cigarette and smokeless tobacco product 
sales to persons under 18 years of age. The access portion of the rule has several 
major provisions, including:</p>
<p><strong>a. Minimum Age</strong> </p>
<p>The regulation prohibits retailers from selling cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to 
anyone younger than 18 years of age. Retailers must verify that purchasers are 18 
or older by checking identification that includes the bearer's date of birth and 
photograph. The rule requires retailers to check the identification of anyone 26 or 
younger. Acceptable identification could include a driver's license or college 
identification card. </p>
<p>The need for this provision is supported by studies indicating that minors who 
purchase cigarettes and smokeless tobacco from stores are rarely asked for 
identification. One study found that 67 percent of teenagers, whose mean age was 
15 years, were asked no questions when they attempted to purchase cigarettes.<sup>20</sup> </p>
<p><strong>b. Minimum Package Size</strong> </p>
<p>Under the rule, retailers are prohibited from opening any cigarette package or 
smokeless tobacco product to sell or distribute individual cigarettes or smaller 
amounts of tobacco. <sup>21</sup> In addition, the regulation establishes 20 cigarettes as the 
minimum package size. Both provisions are designed to prevent the kind of sales 
that are attractive to young smokers -- small, inexpensive, easy to conceal 
&quot;kiddie&quot; packs. </p>
<p>Although kiddie packs have only recently begun appearing in the United States, 
studies in countries where they have been available show that kiddie packs are 
preferred by adolescents far more than by adults. For example, one study in 
Australia showed that 56.3 percent of all 14 to 15 year old smokers had 
purchased kiddie packs in the month prior to the survey, compared with only 8.8 
percent of adult smokers.<sup>22</sup> </p>
<p><strong>c. Vending Machines</strong> </p>
<p>The rule bans the use of vending machines in almost all circumstances. Vending 
machines represent one of the major ways that children currently obtain cigarettes. 
Numerous studies and surveys show that significant percentages of young people 
are able to purchase cigarettes from vending machines, even in areas that have 
laws restricting the placement of those machines or requiring the use of locking 
devices. </p>
<p>The 1994 Surgeon General's Report examined nine studies of vending machine 
sales and found that children and adolescents successfully purchased cigarettes 
from vending machines 88 percent of the time.<sup>23</sup> In addition to studies 
demonstrating how easily children can purchase cigarettes from vending machines, 
the proposed rule cited surveys of children's actual purchasing behavior. Vending 
machines are most popular with the youngest smokers, with 22 percent of 13 year 
olds who smoke purchasing cigarettes from them compared with 2 percent of 17 
year olds.<sup>24</sup> </p>
<p>The provision to eliminate the use of vending machines generated numerous 
comments. Comments in opposition argued that the provision would be 
unnecessary if state and local governments enforced existing laws prohibiting the 
sale of tobacco products to children under the age of 18. They also argued that 
most vending machines are located in areas that are off-limits to children, such as 
night clubs or casinos, or in areas that children rarely frequent, such as industrial 
plants and private offices.</p>
<p>Conversely, nearly all comments in favor of the provision argued that vending 
machines, including those in &quot;adult-only&quot; locations and those with locking devices, 
offer children easy access to tobacco products. Tens of thousands of school 
children wrote letters asking that vending machines be eliminated.</p>
<p>FDA has decided that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco should not be sold from 
vending machines except in those limited locations in which the retailer or operator 
ensures that no person younger than 18 is present or permitted to enter at any 
time. This exception to the ban on vending machines is intended to be narrow and 
carefully circumscribed.</p>
<p>While the agency agrees that some children who are determined to use cigarettes 
or smokeless tobacco may find or create new ways of obtaining them, FDA has 
concluded that the removal of vending machines from sites accessible to young 
people will eliminate what is currently a popular and easy means of access to 
tobacco, especially for younger children. In addition, if other access restrictions 
are imposed, such as requiring customers to provide proof of age, without also 
eliminating vending machines, use of vending machines among children and 
adolescents would likely increase. Therefore, the agency has concluded that the 
provision is an important part of the overall effort to reduce children's access to 
cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. </p>
<p>FDA will monitor compliance with the provisions governing vending machines for 
two years and will propose additional restrictions if there is evidence at that time 
that young people are continuing to purchase tobacco products from these 
machines.</p>
<p><strong>d. Self-Service Displays</strong> </p>
<p>The rule also bans the use of self-service displays of tobacco products, with 
certain exceptions,<sup>25</sup> to prevent young people from helping themselves to these 
products. This will reduce the likelihood of theft and increase the involvement of 
sales clerks in transactions with young people. Self-service displays permit 
children and adolescents to quickly, easily, and independently obtain cigarettes 
and smokeless tobacco. A study by the National Academy of Sciences' Institute 
of Medicine found that over 40 percent of grade school students who smoked 
daily shoplifted cigarettes, at some time, from self-service displays.<sup>26</sup> One study 
found that tobacco sales to minors dropped 40 to 80 percent after enactment of 
ordinances prohibiting self-service displays and requiring vendor-assisted sales.<sup>27</sup> 
In addition, the Institute of Medicine reported that placing products out of reach 
&quot;reinforces the message that tobacco products are not in the same class as candy 
or potato chips.&quot; <sup>28</sup> </p>
<p><strong>e. Mail Order Sales and Redemption of Coupons</strong> </p>
<p>The proposed rule would have prohibited the use of mail-order sales and 
mail-order redemption of coupons because there is no reliable way to verify the 
consumer's age. At the time FDA issued the proposed rule, the standard industry 
practice simply required the consumer to provide a birth date or check a box to 
signify that he or she was of legal age.</p>
<p>The agency received many comments on this provision. Opponents argued that 
young people do not buy cigarettes through the mail because they do not have 
checks or credit cards with which to pay for them. Many adults stated that they 
prefer mail-order sales because the products are unavailable in stores or are less 
expensive. Others said mail order sales serve those in rural or isolated areas, and 
that the rule would eliminate the principal or sole source of tobacco for those 
adults.</p>
<p>After reviewing the comments, FDA decided to allow mail order sales of tobacco 
products. There is little or no evidence to show that young people use mail order 
sales to any significant degree. However, the agency is concerned that children 
and adolescents may turn to mail order sales if access to tobacco products is 
denied in other ways. Therefore, FDA will monitor mail order sales to ensure that 
they do not provide young people with a mechanism for purchasing cigarettes and 
smokeless tobacco.</p>
<p>Mail-order redemption of coupons for free cigarettes or discounted cigarettes will 
not be permitted on the basis that the agency did receive evidence that young 
people were able to obtain free samples in this manner. Evidence from the 
attorney general of Massachusetts showed that as part of an operation conducted 
by his office, 30 young people mailed in coupons for free samples of smokeless 
tobacco. Virtually all of them received their free samples in the mail.<sup>29</sup> </p>
<p>Contrary to the concerns expressed by a number of adults, this provision does not 
prevent adults from receiving coupons through the mail as long as they redeem the 
coupons in person where a sales clerk can verify the customer's age.</p>
<p><strong>f. Free Samples</strong> </p>
<p>The regulation prohibits the distribution of free samples of cigarettes or smokeless 
tobacco. Free samples are often distributed at &quot;mass intercept locations,&quot; such as 
street corners and shopping malls, and at events such as festivals and concerts. 
Free samples represent a &quot;risk-free&quot; and &quot;cost-free&quot; way for young people to 
obtain cigarettes or smokeless tobacco. Surveys and reports demonstrate that 
young people can obtain free samples easily in spite of voluntary industry codes. 
For example, one survey in New Jersey found that one-third of approximately 
500 high school students who were current or former smokers reported receiving 
free cigarette samples before the age of 16.<sup>30</sup> </p>
<p>A few comments opposed any restrictions on free samples, claiming that 
eliminating free samples would violate the rights of adult consumers, reduce 
choices for adults, or deprive adults of an opportunity to save money. In contrast, 
many comments, including several that opposed the remainder of the rule, 
supported a ban on free samples. Comments cited instances where young people 
easily obtained free samples of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.</p>
<p>While the ban on free samples will affect adults, no suggestions were made on 
how to prevent free samples from reaching young people. The agency determined 
that the benefits gained from eliminating free samples for young people outweigh 
any inconvenience to adults. </p>
<h3>2. Reducing Appeal of Advertising to Children and 
Adolescents</h3>
<p>In August 1995, FDA announced its proposal to restrict cigarette and smokeless 
tobacco advertising in ways that would reduce the appeal of such ads to children 
and adolescents. FDA's purpose in proposing the advertising restrictions was to 
ensure that the access restrictions are not undermined by advertising that heightens 
the appeal of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to young people. The proposed 
rule included a range of restrictions that attempted to preserve the components of 
advertising and labeling which can provide product information for adult smokers, 
while eliminating the imagery and color that make advertising appealing to children 
and adolescents.</p>
<p>Briefly, the final regulation generally limits tobacco advertising in all existing media 
forms to a black-and-white, text-only format. Outdoor advertising is prohibited 
within 1,000 feet of public playgrounds, elementary schools or secondary schools. 
Advertisements in publications read primarily by adults and advertisements placed 
in adult-only locations are exempt from any advertising restrictions. </p>
<p>Tobacco companies will not be permitted to sell or distribute promotional items 
such as tee shirts, caps, and sporting goods identified with tobacco products, for 
example through use of a brand name or logo. Similarly, logos, brand names, and 
other identifiers of tobacco products cannot be used in sponsorship of musical, 
cultural, and other events or on teams and entries. However, sponsored events 
and entries in the name of a tobacco company may continue.</p>
<p>Tobacco products are among the most heavily advertised in this country, 
accounting for advertising and promotional expenditures of more than $6 billion in 
1993.<sup>31</sup> Studies show that tobacco advertising significantly influences children and 
adolescents in their decision to start smoking or using smokeless tobacco, and it 
must be considered in any serious effort to reduce tobacco use among youth.</p>
<p>This aspect of FDA's proposal produced substantial comment that either praised 
the proposed restrictions as critical to reducing the numbers of children and 
adolescents who begin using tobacco or attacked the advertising provisions as 
unwise and unconstitutional. Based on its review of the comments, studies, 
surveys and expert opinion, the agency has refined some of the advertising 
restrictions to ensure that they are narrowly tailored to achieve FDA's public 
health objectives.</p>
<p><strong>a. Impact of Advertising</strong> </p>
<p>FDA relied heavily on two reports that summarized the evidence concerning the 
effect of advertising on young people's tobacco use. One came from the Institute 
of Medicine, and the other was the 1994 Surgeon General's Report. Both reports 
concluded that advertising was an important factor in young people's tobacco use, 
and that restrictions on advertising must be part of any meaningful approach to 
reducing smoking and smokeless tobacco use among young people.</p>
<p>In reviewing the literature, FDA found hundreds of studies examining 
psychological and social factors affecting tobacco use. These studies were 
conducted by noted researchers in the fields of medicine, psychology, marketing, 
public health, and other disciplines, and were published in respected, 
peer-reviewed scientific journals. Overall, the research provides strong evidence 
that restrictions on the advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco will serve 
to protect the health of children and adolescents. </p>
<p>Collectively, the studies show that children and adolescents are widely exposed 
to, aware of, respond favorably to, and are influenced by cigarette advertising. 
One study found that 30 percent of 3 year olds and 91 percent of 6 year olds 
identified Joe Camel as a symbol for smoking.<sup>32</sup> Other studies have shown that 
young people's exposure to cigarette advertising is positively related to smoking 
behavior and their intention to smoke. Still others have suggested that cigarette 
advertising helps young people to decide what is normal or socially acceptable 
behavior, and that those who overestimate the prevalence of smoking seem to be 
more likely to begin smoking and progress to regular smoking. Finally, brand 
advertising appears to be particularly effective with children and adolescents. The 
three most heavily advertised brands are smoked by 86 percent of young people 
who smoke; by contrast, adults are far more likely to choose one of the &quot;generic&quot; 
brands, which are advertised less.<sup>33</sup> </p>
<p>The tobacco and advertising industries were critical of FDA's proposed 
regulation, focusing their criticism on the failure of the evidence to establish 
empirically that advertising causes young people to use tobacco, or on whether 
each proposed restriction would substantially reduce young people's smoking and 
use of smokeless tobacco. Moreover, they argued that FDA should not eliminate 
imagery and color since these are essential elements of effective advertising to 
adults. </p>
<p>In contrast, a comment from the nation's largest psychological association 
contended imagery and color in advertisements should be eliminated because of 
their effectiveness in appealing to children. The comment maintained that children 
generally have less information-processing ability than adults, are less able or less 
willing to heed the factual information in advertisements, and are less motivated to 
carefully consider information such as tar and nicotine content or the Surgeon 
General's warnings in cigarette and smokeless tobacco advertising.</p>
<p>In the final regulation, FDA narrowed the advertising restrictions as much as 
possible to retain the informational value that advertising has for adults. 
Information regarding price, tar and nicotine levels, and taste, information typically 
important to adults who smoke, can be communicated effectively to adults 
through words alone. </p>
<p><strong>b. The First Amendment</strong> </p>
<p>Those opposed to the regulation criticized the proposed rule for violating the First 
Amendment and understating the protection that commercial speech is afforded. 
In support of this contention, their comments not only relied on traditional First 
Amendment jurisprudence, but cited as well to two recent cases, Rubin v. Coors, 
115 S. Ct. 1585, and 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 116 S. Ct. 1495 
(May 13, 1996). FDA in no way underestimates the protection afforded 
commercial speech, and did weigh its proposal against the Supreme Court's 
recent rulings in deciding on the provisions of the final rule.</p>
<p>Other comments maintained that tobacco advertising concerns unlawful activity 
and that therefore it is not protected by the First Amendment. These comments 
pointed out that it is unlawful in all 50 states to sell tobacco to children under the 
age of 18. Opponents argued that it is lawful for adults to buy tobacco, and 
therefore the advertising for those products cannot be considered to be unlawful. 
Based on its consideration of these arguments, FDA found that a credible basis 
exists on which to conclude that, at least to the extent that tobacco advertising is 
related to sale of these products to children under 18, it is not speech protected 
by the First Amendment.</p>
<p>However, the agency did not rest its regulation solely on this rational, but 
considered whether the rule meets the standards for regulating commercial speech 
under the three-prong test established in Central Hudson Gas and Electric Corp. 
v. Public Service Commission of New York.<sup>34</sup> The agency's analysis under each 
prong is provided below. </p>
<p>(1) Is the government's interest substantial?<br>
Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. More 
than 400,000 people die each year from tobacco-related illnesses.<sup>35</sup> Most people 
who become addicted to cigarettes begin smoking before they reach the age of 
18. <sup>36</sup> Of the one million young people who become regular smokers each year, a 
third will die prematurely as a result from tobacco use. <sup>37</sup> Even those who 
opposed the regulation did not seriously contest that the government had a 
substantial interest in protecting the health of individuals under 18 years of age.</p>
<p>(2) Do the regulations directly advance the government's interest?<br>
Some comments asserted that the agency needs to prove conclusively by 
empirical evidence that the restrictions that it enacts will completely solve the 
problem of youth tobacco use. The agency found, based on the available 
evidence, expert opinion, surveys, and studies, that advertising plays a material 
role in children's tobacco use, and that the regulation will contribute to a reduction 
in young people's use of tobacco. </p>
<p>(3) Are the provisions of the regulation are narrowly drawn?<br>
Comments opposing the proposed restrictions asserted that to meet this 
requirement, the restrictions must be the &quot;least restrictive means&quot; available. In 
contrast, a number of comments said that to satisfy this requirement, the 
restrictions must accomplish a &quot;reasonable fit&quot; between the regulation and the 
governmental interest to be served. The agency agreed with the latter 
interpretation, and found that its regulation meets this requirement by restricting 
only those elements of advertising and promotion that affect young people, while 
preserving those aspects of advertising that provide information to adults.</p>
<p><strong>c. Major Advertising Provisions</strong> </p>
<p>The advertising portion of the final rule contains several major provisions including 
the following:</p>
<p>1. Billboards Near Schools and Playgrounds</p>
<p>Tobacco advertisements on billboards and other outdoor advertising are 
prohibited within 1,000 feet of elementary and secondary schools and public 
playgrounds. These are places where children and adolescents spend a great deal 
of time, and, thus, where they can be influenced by exposure to advertising.</p>
<p>Some comments asserted that young people do not pay attention to billboards. 
Other comments said that billboards are unavoidable and should be banned 
everywhere, not just within 1,000 feet of schools and playgrounds. Evidence of 
the unavoidability of billboards was found in the outdoor industry's own marketing 
materials on outdoor advertising, which stated: &quot;Outdoor is right up there. Day 
and night. Lurking. Waiting for another ambush.&quot; <sup>38</sup> However, because of the 
agency's determination to ensure that its regulations are narrowly tailored, it did 
not accept these comments. </p>
<p>Moreover, evidence provided in part by the tobacco industry supports the 
importance of billboards as advertising vehicles for young people. One survey 
conducted by BKG Youth for Advertising Age showed that 46 percent of 
children eight to 13 years old said they most often saw cigarette advertising on 
billboards, out pacing magazines. <sup>39</sup> A study conducted by the R.J. Reynolds 
Tobacco Company reported that 51 percent of 10-17 year olds surveyed said 
that they had seen or heard of Joe Camel from a billboard advertisement. <sup>40</sup> </p>
<p>2. Text-only Format</p>
<p>The final rule limits cigarette and smokeless tobacco advertising to black text on a 
white background, eliminating the imagery and color young people find so 
appealing. There are, however, two exceptions in which color and imagery in 
tobacco advertisements are permitted: publications with a primarily adult 
readership, and adult-only facilities. Adult publications are defined as those: (1) 
whose readers age 18 or older constitute 85 percent or more of the publication's 
total readership, or (2) that are read by two million or fewer people under age 18. 
Based on current readership figures, publications such as Rolling Stone and 
Sports Illustrated would be limited to text-only advertisements, while Time and 
Newsweek would be free from restrictions. <sup>41</sup> </p>
<p>Those objecting to this provision said that the text-only restriction was a pretext to 
banning cigarette advertising generally, and that cigarette advertising does not 
cause children to start smoking. In contrast, nearly three-quarters of those 
supporting the text-only provision primarily argued that such action was needed to 
eliminate the appeal of tobacco products, and that the advertising makes tobacco 
use more appealing to children and adolescents. The text-only provisions apply to 
traditional media such as magazines, newspapers and billboards, as well as to 
direct mail.</p>
<p>3. Sale and Distribution of Non-tobacco Items and Services</p>
<p>The final rule prohibits the tobacco industry from disseminating any non-tobacco 
item or service that identifies it with tobacco products. This requirement is 
intended to include such items as tee shirts, caps, sporting goods, and other items 
that display cigarette brand names or use other ways to connect them with 
tobacco products. Promotional items are advertisements for these products and 
very often end up in the hands of young people. A 1992 Gallup survey found that 
about half of adolescents who smoke and one quarter of adolescents who do not 
smoke owned at least one of these items. <sup>42</sup> </p>
<p>The agency concluded that a ban of these items was necessary in order to 
eliminate the appeal that these objects have for young people and to prevent 
wearers or users of these items from becoming walking advertisements. In 
addition, the rule prevents a company from offering any gift or item (whether 
identified with a tobacco brand or not) to any customer. This is essential to 
prevent the something-for-nothing appeal that such &quot;free&quot; products have for young 
people.</p>
<p>FDA originally proposed to prohibit the tobacco industry from running contests, 
lotteries, or games of chance. Because contests, lotteries, and games of chance 
are already limited to those over 18, and cannot be based on the purchase of a 
product, the agency has made a change and is not prohibiting them in the final 
regulation. However, they must follow the rules for advertising and appear in 
black text on a white background.</p>
<p>4. Sponsorship of Events</p>
<p>The final rule permits tobacco companies to sponsor events, entries, and teams in 
the corporate name. However, it prohibits tobacco companies from sponsoring 
any sporting, cultural, or other event in the brand name, logo, colors or anything 
else that would associate it with particular cigarettes or smokeless tobacco 
products. In addition, the final rule has been modified to also prohibit tobacco 
brand name sponsorship of race cars as well as other teams or entries.</p>
<p>Studies show that tobacco-brand sponsorship associates tobacco use with 
exciting, glamorous, or fun events, such as car racing and rodeos. It also provides 
an opportunity for &quot;embedded advertising&quot; that actively creates a &quot;friendly 
familiarity&quot; between tobacco and sports enthusiasts, many of whom are children 
and adolescents.</p>
<p>The leading source for television viewership estimates that auto racing is watched 
64 million times a year by those younger than 18.<sup>43</sup> And unlike print 
advertisements, which are typically seen for a few seconds, sponsored events with 
the brand name are viewed for hours at a time. </p>
<p>Further, auto racing, a primary type of tobacco-sponsored event, is becoming 
increasingly popular with young people, as other corporate sponsors have 
discovered. According to the president of Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, Inc., the 
creator of The Flintstones and other cartoons, who recently began sponsoring the 
&quot;Wacky Racing Team&quot; in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series, &quot;In NASCAR we 
found a great kids business.&quot; <sup>44</sup> Finally, race car drivers are extremely popular 
with young people and often are looked up to as heroes.<sup>45</sup> </p>
<h3>3. Educating Young People About Health Risks</h3>
<p>FDA proposed to require tobacco manufacturers to establish and fund a national 
public education program to counter the effects of the pervasive advertising that 
for decades has influenced young people to begin and continue using tobacco 
products. </p>
<p>This approach was based, in part, on historical experience. From July 1, 1967 to 
December 31, 1970, the Federal Communications Commission, as part of the 
&quot;Fairness Doctrine,&quot; required broadcasters to provide a significant amount of time 
for anti-smoking messages on television and radio. One anti-smoking message 
appeared for every three or four industry-sponsored, cigarette advertisements 
until a ban on all cigarette advertisements on television and radio became effective 
on January 1, 1971.</p>
<p>For several years, the American public was exposed to both pro- and 
anti-smoking messages. During this time, per capita cigarette consumption 
declined 7 percent, from 4,280 in 1967 to 3,985 in 1970. <sup>46</sup> Most of the 7 
percent decline (4.5 percent) was attributable to the anti-smoking messages. This 
was the first time since the early 1930's that per capita consumption declined 
consecutively for 3 years, and was one of the largest declines ever recorded. 
Additionally, a study of nearly 7,000 adolescents found that adolescent smoking 
rates declined during this period. <sup>47</sup> When the anti-smoking messages ended on 
television and radio, per capita cigarette consumption began to rise.</p>
<p>FDA received many comments on the proposed educational campaign, with the 
majority favoring the provision. They raised many issues concerning the 
administration of the program as proposed, including, for example, whether the 
proposed funding would be equitable or sufficient, and whether industry's level of 
involvement would jeopardize its effectiveness.</p>
<p>After considering the comments, FDA determined that educating children and 
adolescents about the unreasonable risks these products pose is analogous to the 
notification it has required for other devices under section 518(a) of the federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. In section 518(a) of the act, Congress provided 
FDA with the authority to require device manufacturers to notify device users 
about unreasonable risks of substantial harm posed by a device in order to 
eliminate those risks. </p>
<p>The agency intends to initiate the section 518(a) notification process by sending 
letters to the six tobacco companies that sell a significant number of tobacco 
products to young people. These letters will explain why the agency believes that 
a national, multi-media campaign under section 518(a) to educate young people is 
necessary to reduce the risks tobacco products pose. The letters will also offer 
the companies the opportunity to consult with FDA about the necessity, and the 
scope, of a notification campaign. </p>
<h3>4. Additional Requirements</h3>
<p>The agency proposed to take additional regulatory action if significant reductions 
in use of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco among young people were not met 
within seven years. Based on the comments, the agency has decided to delete this 
provision. The agency will monitor the effectiveness of the regulations and the 
extent to which the individual provisions are followed.</p>
<h3>5. Relationship Between Regulation And State Laws</h3>
<p>Under section 521(a) of the act, state and local requirements pertaining to the sale 
and distribution of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco that are different from, or in 
addition to, the federal requirements, are preempted. Most of the state and local 
laws that would be affected are weaker, for example, state vending machine 
restrictions. State and local laws unrelated to the rule, such as restrictions on 
smoking in restaurants, will not be affected. Under section 521(b), state and local 
governments can submit applications for exemptions from preemption, and FDA 
is prepared to consider any such applications it receives in an expeditious manner. </p>
<h3>6. Analysis of Economic Impact</h3>
<p>In financial terms, the rule is expected to produce significant health-related 
benefits, ranging between $28 billion to $43 billion each year. FDA estimates that 
the rule will impose one-time costs of between $174 and $187 million, and 
recurring annual operating costs of between $149 and $185 million. The agency 
calculated the economic benefits by estimating how many adolescents would not 
start smoking because of this rule, and then, using existing risk data, predicted 
how much sickness and death from tobacco products would be prevented. The 
calculations estimating the cost of implementing the rule were based on comments 
and several extensive economic reports from the affected industries predicting the 
rule's impact.</p>
<h3>7. Implementation</h3>
<p>Most of the provisions of this rule go into effect one year after publication in the 
<cite>Federal Register.</cite> There are two major exceptions: (1) Six months after 
publication, retailers must begin enforcing the 18-year-old minimum age of 
purchase provision by checking purchasers' identification; (2) because most 
sponsorship contracts are long term, companies will have two years to meet the 
sponsorship requirements which prohibit sponsorship of events in the name of a 
tobacco product.</p>

<h1 align=center>Executive Summary</h1>
<h1 align=center>Annex: Nicotine in Cigarettes<br>
And Smokeless Tobacco Is a Drug<br>
And These Products Are Nicotine Delivery 
Devices<br>
Under the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act</h1>
<h2 align=center>Jurisdictional Determination</h2>
<p>This document explains the basis for the Food and Drug Administration's assertion of jurisdiction 
over cigarettes and smokeless tobacco under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the 
Act). FDA regulates a diverse range of products under the Act, including foods, drugs, medical 
devices, and cosmetics. The distinguishing feature that characterizes these products is their 
intimate and potentially harmful relationship with the human body. The products that FDA 
regulates include those that are ingested, inhaled, implanted, or otherwise used in close contact 
with the human body.</p>
<p>Cigarettes, which deliver a pharmacologically active dose of nicotine to the body through 
inhalation, and smokeless tobacco, which delivers a pharmacologically active dose of nicotine to 
the body through buccal absorption, share this distinguishing feature. Like the products that FDA 
traditionally regulates, cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are inhaled or placed within the human 
body; like many of these products, they deliver a pharmacologically active substance to the 
bloodstream; and like these products, they have potentially dangerous effects. Indeed, no 
products cause more death and disease than cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.</p>
<p>FDA is asserting jurisdiction over cigarettes and smokeless tobacco under the drug and device 
provisions of the Act. Specifically, FDA has concluded that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are 
combination products consisting of nicotine, a drug that causes addiction and other significant 
pharmacological effects on the human body, and device components that deliver nicotine to the 
body. FDA last considered whether cigarettes were drugs or devices in the late 1970's. <cite>See 
Action on Smoking and Health v. Harris,</cite> 655 F.2d 236 (D.C. Cir. 1980). Since that time, 
substantial new evidence has become available to FDA. This evidence includes the emergence of 
a scientific consensus that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco cause addiction to nicotine and the 
disclosure of thousands of pages of internal tobacco company documents detailing that these 
products are intended by the manufacturers to affect the structure and function of the human body. 
This new evidence justifies the Agency's determination that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are 
delivery systems for the drug nicotine.</p>
<p>Under the Act, a product is a drug or device if it is an article (other than food) &quot;intended to affect 
the structure or any function of the body.&quot; Sections 201(g)(1)(C), 201(h)(3). The statutory 
definition is &quot;intended to define 'drug' far more broadly than does the medical profession.&quot; <cite>United 
States v. An Article of Drug . . . Bacto-Unidisk,</cite> 394 U.S. 784, 793, 798 (1969). The legal 
question of whether cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are subject to FDA jurisdiction is one that 
&quot;FDA has jurisdiction to decide with administrative finality.&quot; <cite>Weinberger v. Bentex 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,</cite> 412 U.S. 645, 653 (1973).</p>
<p>After intensive investigation and careful consideration of the public comments, FDA concludes 
that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco meet the statutory definition of a drug and a device. This 
conclusion is based on two determinations: (1) nicotine in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco does 
&quot;affect the structure or any function of the body,&quot; and (2) these effects on the structure and 
function of the body are &quot;intended&quot; by the manufacturers.</p>
<p>The Agency's determination that nicotine in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco does &quot;affect the 
structure or any function of the body&quot; is based on three central findings:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nicotine in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco causes and sustains addiction. </li>
<li>Nicotine in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco causes other psychoactive (mood-altering) 
effects, including tranquilization and stimulation. </li>
<li>Nicotine in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco controls weight. </li>
</ol>
<p>The Agency's determination that the manufacturers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco &quot;intend&quot; 
these effects is based on five central findings:</p>
<ol>
<li>The addictive and other pharmacological effects of nicotine are so widely known and 
accepted that it is foreseeable to a reasonable manufacturer that cigarettes and smokeless 
tobacco will cause addiction to nicotine and other significant pharmacological effects and 
will be used by consumers for pharmacological purposes, including sustaining their 
addiction to nicotine. </li>
<li>Consumers use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco predominantly for pharmacological 
purposes, including sustaining their addiction to nicotine, mood alteration, and weight loss. </li>
<li>Manufacturers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco know that nicotine in their products 
causes pharmacological effects in consumers, including addiction to nicotine and mood 
alteration, and that consumers use their products primarily to obtain the pharmacological 
effects of nicotine. </li>
<li>Manufacturers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco design their products to provide 
consumers with a pharmacologically active dose of nicotine. </li>
<li>An inevitable consequence of the design of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to provide 
consumers with a pharmacologically active dose of nicotine is to keep consumers using 
cigarettes and smokeless tobacco by sustaining their addiction to nicotine. </li>
</ol>
<p>This document is divided into six sections. Section I describes the evidence and legal basis 
supporting the Agency's finding that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco &quot;affect the structure or any 
function of the body.&quot; Section II describes the evidence and legal basis supporting the Agency's 
finding that the manufacturers &quot;intend&quot; these effects on the structure and function of the body. 
Section III explains the Agency's conclusion that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are 
combination products that contain a &quot;drug&quot; and a &quot;device.&quot; Section IV explains why the Agency's 
decision to assert jurisdiction over cigarettes and smokeless tobacco is justified by the new 
evidence now available to the Agency. Section V demonstrates that Congress has not precluded 
or preempted the Agency's assertion of jurisdiction over cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. 
Section VI addresses procedural issues relating to the Agency's assertion of jurisdiction over 
cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. These sections are summarized below. </p>
<hr>
<h2>I.	Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco &quot;Affect the 
Structure or any Function of the Body&quot; Within the 
Meaning of the Act </h2>
<p>The nicotine delivered by cigarettes and smokeless tobacco has significant pharmacological effects 
on the structure and function of the body.</p>
<p>First, the nicotine in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco causes and sustains addiction. Nicotine 
exerts psychoactive, or mood-altering, effects on the brain that motivate repeated, compulsive use 
of the substance. These pharmacological effects create dependence in the user. The 
pharmacological processes that cause this addiction to nicotine are similar to those that cause 
addiction to heroin and cocaine.</p>
<p>Second, the nicotine in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco produces other important 
pharmacological effects on the central nervous system. Under some circumstances and doses, the 
nicotine has a sedating or tranquilizing effect on mood and brain activity. Under other 
circumstances and doses, the nicotine has a stimulant or arousal-inducing effect on mood and 
brain activity.</p>
<p>Third, the nicotine in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco affects body weight.</p>
<p>These effects on the structure and function of the body are significant and quintessentially 
drug-like. Moreover, these effects are the same as the effects of other drugs that FDA has 
traditionally regulated, including stimulants, tranquilizers, appetite suppressants, and products, such 
as methadone, used in the maintenance of addiction. For these reasons, the Agency finds that 
cigarettes and smokeless tobacco &quot;affect the structure or any function of the body&quot; within the 
meaning of the Act. </p>
<hr>
<h2>II.	Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco Are &quot;Intended&quot; to 
Affect the Structure and Function of the Body Within the 
Meaning of the Act</h2>
<p>To determine whether effects on the structure or function of the body are &quot;intended&quot; by the 
manufacturer, the Agency must objectively evaluate all the relevant evidence of intent in the record 
before it. &quot;The FDA is not bound by the manufacturer's subjective claims of intent,&quot; but rather can 
find actual intent &quot;on the basis of objective evidence.&quot; <cite>National Nutritional Foods Ass'n v. 
Matthews,</cite> 557 F.2d 325, 334 (2d Cir. 1977). In the case of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, 
the Agency finds that three types of objective evidence provide independent bases for finding that 
the manufacturers intend to affect the structure and function of the body: (1) the evidence of the 
foreseeable pharmacological effects and uses of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco; (2) the 
evidence of the actual consumer use of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco for pharmacological 
purposes; and (3) the evidence of the statements, research, and actions of the manufacturers 
themselves. Considered independently or cumulatively, this evidence convincingly demonstrates 
that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are intended to be used for pharmacological purposes. </p>
<h3>A.	A Reasonable Manufacturer Would Foresee that Tobacco Products 
Will Cause Addiction and Other Pharmacological Effects and Will Be 
Used by Consumers for Pharmacological Purposes </h3>
<p>When Congress enacted the current definition of &quot;drug&quot; in 1938, it was well understood that &quot;[t]he 
law presumes that every man intends the legitimate consequences of his own acts.&quot; <cite>Agnew v. 
United States,</cite> 165 U.S. 36, 53 (1897). Consistent with this common understanding, FDA's 
regulations provide that a product's intended pharmacological use may be established by evidence 
that the manufacturer &quot;knows, or has knowledge of facts that would give him notice,&quot; that the 
product is being widely used for a pharmacological purpose, even if the product is not being 
promoted for this purpose. 21 CFR 201.128, 801.4. Thus, FDA may find that a manufacturer 
intends its product to affect the structure or function of the body when it would be foreseeable to 
a reasonable manufacturer that the product will (1) affect the structure or function of the body and 
(2) be used by a substantial proportion of consumers to obtain these effects. For example, when it 
is foreseeable to a reasonable manufacturer that a product will produce drug effects in consumers 
and be purchased by a substantial proportion of consumers for drug purposes, FDA may 
consider the product a &quot;drug.&quot; </p>
<p>In the case of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, no reasonable manufacturer could fail to foresee 
that these products will have significant pharmacological effects on consumers and be widely used 
by consumers for pharmacological purposes. All major public health organizations in the United 
States and abroad with expertise in tobacco or drug addiction now recognize that the nicotine 
delivered by cigarettes and smokeless tobacco is addictive. The first major organization to do so 
was the American Psychiatric Association, which in 1980 defined the &quot;tobacco dependence 
disorder&quot; and the &quot;tobacco withdrawal syndrome.&quot; Since 1980, nicotine in tobacco products has 
also been recognized as addictive by the U.S. Surgeon General (1986 and 1988), the American 
Psychological Association (1988), the Royal Society of Canada (1989), the World Health 
Organization (1992), the American Medical Association (1993), and the Medical Research 
Council in the United Kingdom (1994). Every expert medical organization that submitted 
comments to FDA on whether nicotine is addictive concluded that it is. The tobacco industry's 
public position that nicotine is not addictive is simply not credible in light of this overwhelming 
scientific consensus. </p>
<p>The scientific consensus that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco cause addiction to nicotine makes 
it foreseeable to a reasonable manufacturer that these products will affect the structure and 
function of the body. This scientific consensus also makes it foreseeable that cigarettes and 
smokeless tobacco will be used by a substantial proportion of consumers for a pharmacological 
purpose-namely, to satisfy their addiction.</p>
<p>It is also foreseeable that the nicotine in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco will cause, and be used 
for, other significant pharmacological effects. It is well established that the nicotine in cigarettes 
and smokeless tobacco has psychoactive or mood-altering effects in the brain. Under some 
circumstances, nicotine can have a sedative or tranquilizing effect on the brain; under other 
circumstances, nicotine can have a stimulating or arousal-inducing effect. In this regard, nicotine is 
similar to other addictive drugs such as opiates, which can have both stimulating and sedating 
effects. In addition, nicotine plays a role in weight regulation, with substantial evidence 
demonstrating that cigarette smoking leads to weight loss. </p>
<p>Because a reasonable manufacturer would foresee that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco will 
cause and be used for these well-established pharmacological effects in a substantial proportion of 
consumers, the Agency finds that these drug effects and drug uses are intended by the 
manufacturers. </p>
<h3>B.	Consumers Use Tobacco Products to Obtain the Pharmacological 
Effects of Nicotine and to Satisfy Their Addiction </h3>
<p>A second basis for establishing that a product is intended to affect the structure or function of the 
body is evidence showing that consumers actually use the product for pharmacological purposes. 
In fact, courts have recognized that even in the absence of any other evidence of intent to affect 
the structure or function of the body, such an intent may be established by evidence showing that 
consumers use the product &quot;predominantly&quot; for pharmacological purposes. <cite>ASH,</cite> 655 F.2d at 
239-240.</p>
<p>In the case of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, the evidence establishes that consumers do use 
these products &quot;predominantly&quot; for pharmacological purposes. Major recent studies have 
concluded that 77% to 92% of smokers are addicted to nicotine in cigarettes. The U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services estimates that 75% of young regular users of 
smokeless tobacco are addicted to nicotine in these products. The comments from the American 
Heart Association, the American Lung Association, and the American Cancer Society, whose 
member physicians provide health care for tobacco users in the United States, confirm that &quot;the 
vast majority of people who use nicotine containing cigarettes and smokeless tobacco do so to 
satisfy their craving for the pharmacological effects of nicotine; that is, to satisfy their drug 
dependence or addiction.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition, a large proportion of consumers also use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco for other 
pharmacological purposes. A recent survey found that over 70% of young people 10 to 22 years 
old who are daily smokers reported that they use cigarettes for relaxation. The same survey found 
that over 50% of young people who are daily users of smokeless tobacco reported that they use 
smokeless tobacco for relaxation. Other surveys show that between one-third and one-half of 
young smokers report that weight control is a reason for their smoking.</p>
<p>This evidence that consumers actually use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco predominantly to 
obtain the pharmacological effects of nicotine leads FDA to find that cigarettes and smokeless 
tobacco are intended to affect the structure and function of the body. </p>
<h3>C.	The Statements, Research, and Actions of the Cigarette 
Manufacturers Show that the Manufacturers Intend to Affect the 
Structure and Function of the Body </h3>
<p>A third basis for establishing that a manufacturer intends to affect the structure or function of the 
body is evidence from the statements, research, and actions of the manufacturer that reveals that 
the manufacturer knows that its product will, or designs its product to, affect the structure or 
function of the body. It is a canon of statutory construction that words used by Congress should 
ordinarily be interpreted in accordance with their plain meaning. The plain meaning of &quot;intend&quot; 
includes &quot;to have in mind&quot; or &quot;to design&quot; for a particular use. The <cite>American Heritage Dictionary,</cite> 
for instance, defines &quot;intend&quot; as: &quot;1. To have in mind; plan. 2.a. To design for a specific purpose. 
b. To have in mind for a particular use.&quot; Consistent with the plain meaning of &quot;intend,&quot; FDA may 
consider whether the statements, research, and actions of the manufacturer show that the 
manufacturer &quot;has in mind&quot; that its product will, or &quot;designs&quot; its product to, affect the structure or 
function of the body.</p>
<p>The administrative record contains three decades of documents and other evidence from the 
major cigarette manufacturers. This evidence, most of which has only recently become available, 
establishes that the manufacturers do &quot;have in mind&quot; that their products will have and be used for 
pharmacological effects. First, the evidence shows that the cigarette manufacturers know that 
nicotine is a pharmacologically active drug. In internal documents, for instance, researchers for 
Philip Morris Inc. call nicotine &quot;a powerful pharmacological agent with multiple sites of action&quot; and 
&quot;a physiologically active . . . substance . . . [which] alters the state of the smoker by becoming a 
neurotransmitter and a stimulant&quot;; a researcher for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. (RJR) calls 
nicotine &quot;a potent drug with a variety of physiological effects&quot;; and researchers for Brown &amp; 
Williamson Tobacco Corp. and its parent company, BAT Industries PLC (formerly the 
British-American Tobacco Co.) (BATCO), call nicotine &quot;pharmacologically active in the brain&quot; 
and &quot;an extremely biologically active compound capable of eliciting a range of pharmacological, 
biochemical, and physiological responses.&quot;</p>
<p>Second, the evidence establishes that the cigarette manufacturers have conducted extensive 
research to understand precisely how nicotine affects the structure and function of the body. In 
one year alone, Philip Morris conducted 16 different studies on the effects of nicotine, including 5 
experiments to determine the pharmacological effects of nicotine on the human brain. RJR's 
similarly extensive research found that the nicotine in cigarettes produces measurable changes in 
brain wave activity, such as &quot;a significant increase in beta2 magnitude&quot; (an effect associated with 
anxiety relief) and &quot;a significant decrease in delta magnitude&quot; (an effect associated with improved 
mental condition). Through the Council for Tobacco Research, an organization formed by the 
major tobacco companies, the manufacturers funded dozens of sophisticated investigations 
concerning nicotine, including numerous studies that demonstrate nicotine's ability to alter the 
function of the human brain.</p>
<p>Third, the evidence shows that the manufacturers know that one of the pharmacological effects of 
nicotine is to cause and sustain addiction. Researchers and senior officials of Brown &amp; Williamson 
and BATCO expressly acknowledge this fact in their internal documents, stating that &quot;smoking is a 
habit of addiction&quot; and that &quot;nicotine is addictive.&quot; Philip Morris scientists also know of nicotine's 
addiction potential. They conducted a series of nicotine &quot;self-administration&quot; experiments using the 
tests used by the National Institute on Drug Abuse to determine whether a substance has 
addiction potential. These studies found that rats would self-administer nicotine, which is one of 
the hallmark characteristics of an addictive drug. Moreover, through the Council for Tobacco 
Research, the cigarette manufacturers funded research that reported that &quot;smoking is a form of 
dependence no less binding than that of other addictive drugs.&quot;</p>
<p>Fourth, the evidence shows that the manufacturers know that consumers smoke cigarettes 
primarily to obtain the pharmacological effects of nicotine. This point is repeatedly acknowledged 
in internal company documents. For example, researchers for Philip Morris have stated that 
nicotine is &quot;the primary reason why people smoke&quot; and that nicotine is &quot;the physiologically active 
component of smoke having the greatest consequence to the consumer&quot;; researchers for RJR 
have stated that &quot;the confirmed user of tobacco is primarily seeking the physiological 'satisfaction' 
derived from nicotine&quot; and that &quot;[w]ithout any question, the desire to smoke is based upon the 
effect of nicotine on the body&quot;; and BATCO's director of research has stated that &quot;[t]he tobacco 
smoking habit is reinforced or dependent upon the psycho-pharmacological effects mainly of 
nicotine.&quot; This knowledge of the central role of nicotine in cigarette smoking was communicated to 
the highest levels of the companies. In 1969, for instance, Philip Morris' vice president for 
research and development told the Philip Morris board of directors that &quot;the ultimate explanation 
for the perpetuated cigarette habit resides in the pharmacological effect of smoke upon the body 
of the smoker.&quot;</p>
<p>Fifth, the evidence shows that in their internal documents, the cigarette manufacturers expressly 
refer to cigarettes as devices for the delivery of nicotine. For instance, researchers for Philip 
Morris have described cigarettes as a &quot;dispenser for a dose unit of nicotine&quot; and as a &quot;nicotine 
delivery device&quot;; a senior researcher for RJR has described cigarettes as a &quot;vehicle for delivering 
nicotine&quot;; and researchers for BATCO have described cigarettes as the &quot;means of providing 
nicotine dose in a metered fashion&quot; and as a device that provides the smoker &quot;very flexible control 
over titrating his desired dose of nicotine.&quot;</p>
<p>This evidence establishes that cigarettes are intended by the manufacturers to affect the structure 
and function of the body. It demonstrates that the manufacturers know that nicotine is 
pharmacologically active; that consumers smoke primarily to obtain the pharmacological effects of 
nicotine; and that cigarettes function as devices for the delivery of nicotine. The evidence thus 
shows that when the manufacturers offer cigarettes for sale, they &quot;have in mind&quot; that their products 
will be used for the particular purpose of affecting the structure and function of the body.</p>
<p>In addition to the evidence showing that cigarette manufacturers &quot;have in mind&quot; the use of 
cigarettes for pharmacological purposes, the record shows that the manufacturers &quot;design&quot; 
cigarettes to ensure the delivery of a pharmacologically active dose of nicotine to the smoker. The 
evidence in the record shows that the manufacturers have conducted extensive product research 
and development to find ways to maintain adequate nicotine levels in low-tar cigarettes. 
According to one former senior official at Philip Morris, &quot;a key objective of the cigarette industry 
over the last 20-30 years&quot; was &quot;maintaining an acceptable and pharmacologically active nicotine 
level&quot; in low-tar cigarettes. Internal industry documents in the record disclose research to 
determine the dose of nicotine that must be delivered to provide &quot;pharmacological satisfaction&quot; to 
the smoker, as well as estimates by industry scientists of the minimum and optimum doses of 
nicotine that cigarettes must deliver. </p>
<p>Among the many examples in the record of product research and development to enhance relative 
nicotine deliveries, Philip Morris conducted extensive research to identify &quot;the optimal nicotine/tar 
ratios for cigarette acceptability of relatively low-delivery cigarettes&quot;; RJR developed alternative 
tobacco products that provide a &quot;more efficient and direct way to provide the desired nicotine 
dosage than the present system involving combustion of tobacco&quot;; and Brown &amp; Williamson 
investigated chemical manipulation to raise smoke pH, thereby increasing &quot;free&quot; nicotine delivery, 
and used genetic engineering to breed a high-nicotine tobacco plant called Y-1.</p>
<p>The record before the Agency shows that several methods of enhancing nicotine deliveries are 
used in the manufacture of commercial cigarettes. Tobacco blending to raise the nicotine 
concentration in low-tar cigarettes is common. As the vice chairman and chief operating officer of 
Lorillard Tobacco Co. has stated, &quot;the lowest tar segment is composed of cigarettes utilizing a 
tobacco blend which is significantly higher in nicotine.&quot; Another common technique for enhancing 
nicotine deliveries in low-tar cigarettes is the use of filter and ventilation systems that by design 
remove a higher percentage of tar than nicotine. Yet a third type of nicotine manipulation is the 
addition of ammonia compounds that increase the delivery of &quot;free&quot; nicotine to smokers by raising 
the alkalinity or pH of tobacco smoke. These ammonia technologies are widely used within the 
industry.</p>
<p>The record establishes that an important reason why the manufacturers design cigarettes that 
provide pharmacologically active doses of nicotine is to satisfy the demands of users. The 
manufacturers concede in their comments that their &quot;intent is to design, manufacture and market . . 
. cigarettes to meet the preferences of adult smokers.&quot; The preferences of most smokers, 
however, include obtaining sufficient nicotine to sustain their addiction and to experience nicotine's 
mood-altering effects. What the cigarette manufacturers describe as producing cigarettes that 
satisfy consumer preferences is, in reality, producing cigarettes that provide the pharmacological 
effects of nicotine sought by consumers. The effect of maintaining a pharmacologically active dose 
of nicotine in cigarettes is to keep consumers smoking by sustaining their addiction.</p>
<p>The evidence that the manufacturers &quot;design&quot; cigarettes to provide a pharmacologically active 
dose of nicotine is further proof that the manufacturers intend cigarettes to affect the structure and 
function of the body. Taken together, the evidence shows that the cigarette manufacturers: (1) 
&quot;have in mind&quot; the use of cigarettes for the particular purpose of delivering the pharmacological 
effects of nicotine, and (2) &quot;design&quot; their products to provide these effects. This evidence 
convincingly demonstrates that the pharmacological effects of cigarettes are &quot;intended&quot; by the 
manufacturers. </p>
<h3>D.	The Statements, Research, and Actions of the Smokeless Tobacco 
Manufacturers Show that the Manufacturers Intend their Products to 
Affect the Structure and Function of the Body </h3>
<p>The administrative record also contains evidence of the statements, research, and actions of the 
smokeless tobacco manufacturers. Like the evidence of the statements, research, and actions of 
the cigarette manufacturers, this evidence establishes that the smokeless tobacco manufacturers 
intend to affect the structure and function of the body.</p>
<p>First, the evidence in the record shows that the smokeless tobacco manufacturers know that 
nicotine is a pharmacologically active drug and that consumers use smokeless tobacco to obtain 
the pharmacological effects of nicotine. As a senior vice president for United States Tobacco Co. 
(UST) stated, &quot;virtually all tobacco usage is based upon nicotine, 'the kick,' satisfaction.&quot; 
Researchers affiliated with Brown &amp; Williamson acknowledge that &quot;nicotine . . . absorbed through 
. . . the lining of the nose or mouth . . . will quickly enter a direct route, in the blood, to the brain.&quot;</p>
<p>Second, the evidence shows that the smokeless tobacco manufacturers manipulate the nicotine 
delivery of their products in a manner that promotes tolerance and addiction to nicotine. This 
manipulation is accomplished through the use of chemicals that alter the pH of the smokeless 
tobacco. Moist snuff brands that are marketed as &quot;starter&quot; brands have a low pH and 
consequently deliver a low level of &quot;free&quot; nicotine to the user, limiting the absorption of nicotine in 
the mouth. The low nicotine deliveries allow the new user to develop a tolerance to nicotine 
without experiencing adverse reactions such as nausea and vomiting. In contrast, moist snuff 
brands that are marketed to experienced users have a high pH and consequently deliver a high 
level of &quot;free&quot; nicotine to the user, increasing the amount of nicotine available for absorption. The 
increased nicotine deliveries provide sufficient nicotine to sustain the user's addiction.</p>
<p>Third, the evidence shows that smokeless tobacco use and addiction to nicotine has substantially 
increased among teenagers since the manufacturers began to manipulate nicotine deliveries. 
Before the introduction of starter brands with low levels of nicotine delivery, virtually no teenagers 
and young adults used smokeless tobacco. After the smokeless tobacco manufacturers began to 
market low-nicotine &quot;starter&quot; brands in the 1970's, however, use of smokeless tobacco by 
teenagers rose dramatically. Use of smokeless tobacco by adolescent males aged 18 to 19, for 
instance, increased almost 1,500% between 1971 and 1991. Most of the regular teenage users of 
smokeless tobacco graduate to higher nicotine brands. An analysis by the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention found that the pattern of smokeless tobacco use by teenagers &quot;support[s] 
the hypothesis that snuff users in earlier stages of tobacco use and nicotine addiction use brands 
with low levels of free nicotine and then 'graduate' to brands with high levels.&quot;</p>
<p>This evidence of: (1) knowledge of nicotine pharmacology, (2) manipulation of nicotine deliveries, 
and (3) graduation to higher nicotine brands among young users is a sufficient basis to establish 
that the smokeless tobacco manufacturers intend to affect the structure and function of the body. </p>
<p>In addition to this industry-wide evidence of intended use, the record contains numerous 
documents from the nation's largest smokeless tobacco manufacturer, UST. The UST documents 
in the record show that: </p>
<ul>
<li>UST officials in the early 1970's recommended the development of products with &quot;three 
different . . . strengths of nicotine[:] . . . a. High nicotine, strong tobacco flavor . . . b. 
Medium strength of nicotine . . . c. Low nicotine, sweet product.&quot; In particular, UST 
officials recommended the development of a product that provided &quot;mild&quot; nicotine 
satisfaction targeted at &quot;new users . . . age group 15-35.&quot; </li>
<li>Shortly after these recommendations, UST began aggressively to market low-nicotine 
products, targeted &quot;for you guys just starting out.&quot; Marketing techniques included free 
sampling on college campuses and at sports events. Advertisements included instructions 
on use for new users. </li>
<li>Numerous UST documents and statements refer to an explicit &quot;graduation process&quot; in 
which users of smokeless tobacco are encouraged to start with low-nicotine starter brands 
and then progress to higher nicotine brands. For instance, a UST vice president has stated 
that Skoal Bandits, one of UST's low-nicotine brands, &quot;is the introductory product, and we 
look towards establishing a normal graduation process.&quot; </li>
</ul>
<p>These UST documents confirm that smokeless tobacco manufacturers deliberately produce 
brands with a range of nicotine deliveries in order to allow users to progress (or &quot;graduate&quot;) from 
low-delivery products to high-delivery products. They thus corroborate the Agency's finding that 
smokeless tobacco is intended to affect the structure and function of the body. </p>
<h3>E.	The &quot;Intended Use&quot; of a Product Is Not Determined Only on the 
Basis of Promotional Claims </h3>
<p>The principal legal argument of the tobacco industry is that the intended use of a product must be 
determined exclusively on the basis of the promotional claims made by the manufacturer. Under 
the industry's legal theory, the Agency must disregard the voluminous internal tobacco industry 
documents showing that the manufacturers have in mind, and design their products to provide, the 
pharmacological effects of nicotine. The tobacco industry also urges the Agency to disregard the 
evidence of the foreseeable pharmacological effects and uses of cigarettes and smokeless 
tobacco, as well as the evidence of the actual consumer use of these products for pharmacological 
purposes.</p>
<p>The Agency rejects the industry's legal argument. First, the industry's position is contrary to the 
plain language of the Act. The Act does not say that only products &quot;promoted&quot; to affect the 
structure or function of the body are drugs or devices. Rather, the Act says that products 
&quot;intended&quot; to affect the structure or function of the body are drugs or devices. The plain meaning 
of &quot;intend&quot; is significantly broader than the meaning of &quot;promote.&quot; As summarized above, the plain 
meaning of &quot;intend&quot; includes &quot;to have in mind&quot; and &quot;to design&quot; for a particular use. The evidence 
that is relevant to determining the uses that a manufacturer &quot;has in mind&quot; or &quot;designs&quot; includes not 
just the promotional claims of the manufacturer, but also the internal statements of the 
manufacturer, as well as the manufacturer's research and actions. Moreover, the ordinary meaning 
of &quot;intend&quot; also encompasses the reasonably foreseeable consequences of the manufacturer's 
actions, thereby making consideration of the foreseeable pharmacological effects and uses of a 
product relevant to its intended use.</p>
<p>Second, the industry's position is contrary to FDA's regulations. These regulations provide that the 
term &quot;intended use&quot; refers to the &quot;objective intent&quot; of the manufacturer. Under these regulations, 
the Agency determines the intent of the manufacturer objectively by evaluating all of the relevant 
evidence in the record from the perspective of a reasonable fact-finder. FDA's regulations 
expressly direct the Agency to consider the manufacturer's &quot;knowledge&quot; of the use of the product; 
the manufacturer's &quot;expressions&quot; and &quot;oral or written statements&quot;; and the &quot;circumstances 
surrounding the distribution of the article.&quot; 21 CFR 201.128, 801.4. Thus, the regulations 
expressly provide that the Agency should consider a broad range of evidence in determining 
intended use, not merely the manufacturer's promotional claims.</p>
<p>Third, the industry's position is contrary to judicial decisions interpreting the Act. These decisions 
have applied the Act's definitions of drug and device to two different types of products. The first 
type of product is one that contains no known drug ingredients and has no known 
pharmacological effects or uses. In cases involving such products, the courts recognize that a 
manufacturer's promotional claims have a crucial role in establishing intended use. Even a product 
like mineral water can be brought within FDA's jurisdiction by advertisements that make 
pharmacological claims. <cite>See Bradley v. United States,</cite> 264 F. 79 (5th Cir. 1920).</p>
<p>The situation is fundamentally different, however, when the product contains a known drug 
ingredient like nicotine that has known pharmacological effects and uses. When a product is 
pharmacologically active, the courts have recognized that &quot;a fact finder should be free to pierce . . 
. a manufacturer's misleading . . . labels to find actual therapeutic intent on the basis of objective 
evidence.&quot; <cite>National Nutritional Foods Ass'n v. FDA,</cite> 504 F.2d 761, 789 (2d Cir. 1974). Thus, 
contrary to the industry's contention, the courts have recognized that in determining intended use, 
FDA may consider a wide range of evidence beyond the manufacturer's promotional claims, 
including evidence of the pharmacological effects of the product, <cite>e.g., United States v. 
Undetermined Quantities . . . &quot;Pets Smellfree,&quot;</cite> 22 F.3d 235, 240 (10th Cir. 1994); the 
purposes for which consumers actually use the product, <cite>e.g., ASH,</cite> 655 F.2d at 239-240; the 
medical use of the product, <cite>e.g., United States v. An Article of Device . . . Toftness Radiation 
Detector,</cite> 731 F.2d 1253, 1257 (7th Cir. 1984); and how the product was formulated, <cite>e.g., 
American Health Products Co. v. Hayes,</cite> 574 F. Supp. 1498, 1508 (S.D.N.Y. 1983).</p>
<p>Fourth, the industry's position is contrary to FDA's administrative precedent. In a broad range of 
instances, FDA has asserted jurisdiction over products based on the likely pharmacological 
effects and uses of the product-not express promotional claims. Indeed, in many of these 
instances, the manufacturer's promotional claims were designed to disguise the actual intended use 
of the product. </p>
<p>Fifth, the industry's position is contrary to the public health objectives of the Act. If promotional 
claims alone determined the intended use of a product, virtually any manufacturer of drugs or 
devices could avoid the Act's reach by simply refraining from making pharmacological claims for 
the product. For instance, under the industry's interpretation, a company could market a potent 
tranquilizer or amphetamine for its &quot;pleasurable&quot; effect and escape FDA regulation. To protect the 
public from the unregulated distribution of products with pharmacologically active ingredients, the 
Agency must be able to look beyond a manufacturer's promotional claims when determining 
whether to regulate such products.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the Agency rejects the tobacco industry's legal theory that intended use is 
determined exclusively on the basis of promotional claims. The Agency also rejects the premise of 
the industry's position-namely, that their promotional claims demonstrate that cigarettes and 
smokeless tobacco are not intended to affect the structure and function of the body. To the 
contrary, as internal tobacco company documents indicate, promises of &quot;satisfaction&quot; in tobacco 
advertisements imply that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco will provide consumers with desired 
pharmacological effects of nicotine. These implied drug claims lend support to the Agency's 
finding that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are intended to affect the structure and function of 
the body. </p>
<h3>F.	Response to Additional Comments </h3>
<p>This section responds to additional comments regarding the evidence of the intended use of 
cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and the Agency's use of this evidence. </p>
<h3>G.	Considered Cumulatively, the Evidence Overwhelmingly 
Demonstrates that Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco Are Intended to 
Affect the Structure and Function of the Body </h3>
<p>As summarized above, the evidence in the record provides several independent bases for the 
Agency's finding that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are &quot;intended&quot; to affect the structure and 
function of the body. Independently, each of these distinct categories of evidence is a strong and 
sufficient basis for the Agency's conclusion that the manufacturers of cigarettes and smokeless 
tobacco intend the pharmacological effects and uses of their products. Considered together, they 
are mutually corroborating. Both independently and taken as a whole, therefore, the evidence in 
the administrative record overwhelmingly establishes that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are 
&quot;intended to affect the structure or any function of the body&quot; within the meaning of the Act. </p>
<hr>
<h2>III. Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco Are Combination 
Products Consisting of &quot;Drug&quot; and &quot;Device&quot; 
Components </h2>
<p>The Agency's findings in sections I and II establish that the nicotine in cigarettes and smokeless 
tobacco is a &quot;drug&quot; under section 201(g)(1)(C) of the Act. These findings show that the nicotine in 
cigarettes and smokeless tobacco &quot;affect[s] the structure or any function of the body&quot; and that 
these effects are &quot;intended.&quot; These findings thus demonstrate that the nicotine in cigarettes and 
smokeless tobacco meets the statutory definition of a &quot;drug.&quot;</p>
<p>Cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are not simply packaged nicotine, however. They also include 
delivery devices that deliver nicotine to the body. Section 201(h)(3), 21 U.S.C. 321(h)(3). In the 
case of cigarettes, the device components work together upon combustion outside the body to 
form a nicotine-containing aerosol, which then delivers nicotine to the body when inhaled by the 
smoker. In the case of smokeless tobacco, the device components function by presenting nicotine 
to the consumer in a form that is palatable and absorbable by the buccal mucosa. Unlike the drug 
nicotine, these device components achieve their primary intended purpose without chemical action 
in or on the body and without being metabolized.</p>
<p>The presence of both drug and device components in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco make 
these products &quot;combination products&quot; under section 503(g) the Act, 21 U.S.C. 353(g)(1). </p>
<hr>
<h2>IV.	FDA's Assertion of Jurisdiction Over Cigarettes and 
Smokeless Tobacco at This Time Is Justified </h2>
<p>FDA has always exercised jurisdiction over tobacco products when there is sufficient evidence in 
the record to establish that these products are &quot;intended&quot; to treat or prevent disease or to affect 
the structure or function of the body. Over thirty years ago, for instance, the Agency asserted 
jurisdiction over a brand of cigarettes when the evidence established that the brand was intended 
to reduce body weight. <cite>United States v. 354 Bulk Cartons . . . Trim Reducing-Aid Cigarettes,</cite> 
178 F. Supp. 847 (D.N.J. 1959).</p>
<p>The Agency last considered whether to regulate cigarettes in the late 1970's, when the Agency 
rejected petitions by Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) urging the Agency to regulate 
cigarettes as drugs or devices. The Agency agreed with ASH that &quot;objective evidence other than 
manufacturers' claims can be material to a determination of intended use&quot; and that &quot;evidence of 
consumer use can be one element of objective evidence to be weighed in determining if the 
intended purpose of a product subjects it to regulation under the Act.&quot; However, the Agency 
concluded that the evidence presented by ASH in the petition was insufficient to establish that 
cigarettes and smokeless tobacco were in fact intended to affect the structure and function of the 
body. The court deferred to the Agency's determination not to regulate cigarettes as drugs but 
expressly left open the possibility that FDA might, at a later date, revisit its decision and determine 
that it did indeed have jurisdiction over cigarettes. <cite>ASH v. Harris,</cite> 655 F.2d 236 (D.C. Cir. 
1980).</p>
<p>The evidence regarding the intended use of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco has changed 
dramatically since <cite>ASH.</cite> First, a scientific consensus has emerged since 1980 that nicotine is 
addictive and has other significant pharmacological effects and that cigarettes and smokeless 
tobacco are used by consumers to obtain pharmacological effects. As summarized above, no 
major public health organization had determined that nicotine was an addictive drug before 1980. 
Between 1980 and 1994, however, every leading scientific organization with expertise in 
addiction concluded that nicotine is addictive. This new evidence thus shows that the 
pharmacological effects and uses of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco have become foreseeable.</p>
<p>Second, scientific evidence accumulated since 1980 has shown that the vast majority of people 
who use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco use these products to satisfy addiction or to obtain 
other pharmacological effects. As summarized above, this new evidence now shows that 77% to 
92% of smokers are addicted to nicotine and provides a basis for estimating that 75% of young 
regular smokeless tobacco users are addicted to nicotine. This new evidence establishes that 
consumers use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco predominantly for pharmacological purposes.</p>
<p>Third, FDA, congressional, and other investigations have recently uncovered a wealth of 
documents from a wide range of tobacco companies that show that the manufacturers have long 
known of the pharmacological effects and uses of nicotine and have designed their products to 
provide pharmacologically active doses of nicotine to consumers. Virtually none of this information 
was available to FDA in 1980.</p>
<p>Information developed since 1980 also demonstrates that the Agency has a unique public health 
opportunity to reduce substantially the more than 400,000 deaths from tobacco use each year in 
the United States. This information shows that for most people tobacco use and nicotine addiction 
begin in childhood and adolescence, and that an increasing number of American children and 
adolescents are using cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. The data now suggest that if children and 
adolescents can be prevented from initiating tobacco use during their teenage years, they are 
unlikely to begin tobacco use later in life, thereby preventing the onset of tobacco-related disease 
and premature death.</p>
<p>Before the importance of youth-centered interventions was identified, most of the regulatory 
approaches available under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to address 
tobacco-related disease and death, such as removal of the products from the market, were not 
believed to be feasible solutions. It is now apparent, however, that FDA's authority to restrict the 
sale, distribution, and use of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to people under the age of eighteen 
is an effective tool to reduce the adverse health consequences of tobacco use. Thus, asserting 
jurisdiction over cigarettes and smokeless tobacco now presents an opportunity to use the 
Agency's resources effectively for substantial public health gains.</p>
<p>The court in <cite>ASH</cite> specifically recognized that FDA was permitted to modify its position and that 
any new FDA position would be accorded deference by the courts. Id. at 242 n.10. In light of the 
substantial new information, FDA has reviewed its earlier determination not to assert jurisdiction 
over tobacco products. The new evidence persuades the Agency to conclude that its previous 
position is no longer consistent with the relevant facts and should be changed. The evidence 
before the Agency is now sufficient to establish that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are in fact 
intended to affect the structure and function of the body. </p>
<hr>
<h2>V.	Congress Has Not Precluded or Preempted FDA from 
Regulating Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco </h2>
<p>FDA disagrees with the comments of the tobacco industry that assert that Congress has 
precluded or preempted FDA from regulating cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. The plain 
language of the Act does not exclude cigarettes or smokeless tobacco from FDA jurisdiction. 
Tobacco products are expressly excluded from the jurisdiction of the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act and from the jurisdiction of the 
Environmental Protection Agency under the Toxic Substances Control Act. The absence of any 
similar exclusion in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act demonstrates that Congress has 
not chosen to exclude cigarettes and smokeless tobacco from FDA jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The legislative history of the Act confirms that the Act should not be interpreted to preclude FDA 
jurisdiction over tobacco products. Congress has long known that FDA will assert jurisdiction 
over cigarettes when the evidence establishes that the cigarettes are intended to affect the 
structure or function of the body. For instance, FDA asserted jurisdiction more than 30 years ago 
over cigarettes that were intended to reduce weight. This demonstrates that Congress has not 
&quot;ratified&quot; or &quot;acquiesced in&quot; an interpretation of the Act that would preclude FDA from regulating 
tobacco products intended to affect the structure or function of the body.</p>
<p>Moreover, even if Congress had acquiesced in such an interpretation of the Act, congressional 
acquiescence in a prior agency interpretation does not prevent an agency from changing its 
interpretation. <cite>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co.,</cite> 463 U.S. 29, 45 
(1983). In the case of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, a change in interpretation would be 
justified by the new evidence in the record-evidence never previously before either the Agency or 
Congress.</p>
<p>The Agency also disagrees that other federal statutes preempt FDA jurisdiction over cigarettes 
and smokeless tobacco. Both the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act and the 
Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act have provisions that expressly specify 
the limited extent to which these laws preempt FDA and other federal agencies from regulating 
cigarettes or smokeless tobacco. In the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, for 
instance, federal agencies are preempted only from requiring &quot;statement[s] relating to smoking and 
health . . . on any cigarette package.&quot; 15 U.S.C. 1334(a). The narrow preemption provisions that 
Congress expressly included in these statutes do not apply to FDA's assertion of jurisdiction over 
cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.</p>
<p>No other federal statutes contain provisions preempting FDA regulation of tobacco products. In 
the absence of an express preemption provision, one federal statute preempts another federal 
statute only where there is an irreconcilable conflict between the two laws. <cite>Connecticut Nat'l 
Bank v. Germain,</cite> 503 U.S. 249, 253 (1992). There is no irreconcilable conflict between FDA 
jurisdiction and other federal statutes. </p>
<hr>
<h2>VI.	FDA Employed Procedures That Provided an 
Opportunity for Full Public Participation and Exceeded 
All Legal Requirements </h2>
<p>FDA went to great lengths to involve the public in the process by which the Agency made its final 
jurisdictional determination. The Commissioner made public his intention to investigate the role of 
nicotine in tobacco products, testified twice before Congress on the Agency's findings, wrote to 
all the major cigarette and tobacco companies requesting information on the role of nicotine in 
their products, and held a public advisory committee meeting on the abuse potential of nicotine. 
Although the Agency is not required to undertake rulemaking to establish jurisdiction over new 
products, the Agency published in the <cite>Federal Register</cite> its initial jurisdictional findings and 
comprehensive legal analysis in a 325-page document, supported by over 600 footnotes, and 
sought public comment on those findings. The Agency placed over 210,000 pages of supporting 
documents in a public docket. FDA received over 700,000 comments on the Jurisdictional 
Analysis and the accompanying proposed rule. The Agency has responded to substantive 
comments in this Annex and in the preamble to the Final Rule.</p>
<p>FDA disagrees with the comments of the tobacco industry that the record supporting the 
Jurisdictional Analysis or the procedures the Agency followed were inadequate. The procedures 
the Agency employed in reaching its final determination exceeded the requirements of the 
Administrative Procedures Act (APA) and the Agency's own procedural requirements.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> These news briefs appeared in a past  issue of <b>Advertising 
Compliance Service</b> and examined advertising law-related actions during the month 
of October 1996.</p>

<p align=center><font size=4><strong>FTC GIVES FINAL OK TO AGREEMENT<br>
INVOLVING TV SHOPPING NETWORK</strong></font></center></p>

<P>Home Shopping Network, Inc., and two of its subsidiaries, settled charges that 
they deceptively advertised four mouth sprays--three vitamin sprays and a 
stop-smoking spray--which were promoted on the Home Shopping Club program 
"Spotlight on Ruta Lee." FTC's final consent order requires them to have 
scientific evidence to support any claims (1) that a food, food or dietary 
supplement, or drug cures, treats or prevents any disease or has any effect 
on the structure or function of the human body; and (2) about the performance, 
benefits or efficacy of any smoking-cessation program, product or service.</P>
       
<P><B>NOTE:</B> A consent agreement is for settlement purposes only and does 
not constitute an admission of a law violation. When the Commission issues 
a consent order on a final basis, it carries the force of law with respect 
to future actions. Each violation of such an order may result in a civil 
penalty of $10,000. </P>

<p align=center><font size=4><strong>SETTLEMENT INVOLVES FTC CHARGES OF MISREPRESENTING<br>
"MONEY-MAKING" REAL ESTATE PROGRAM</strong></font></center></p>

<P>Del Dotto Enterprises, Inc. (DDE), NFN Inc. and David P. Del Dotto agreed 
to settle FTC charges that Del Dotto and his firms made allegedly deceptive 
claims in marketing books and audio tapes about buying real estate and obtaining 
credit--known as the "Cash Flow System,"--including claims that it has helped 
hundreds of thousands of consumers make substantial sums of money buying 
and selling real estate. Under the proposed settlement, defendants would 
be barred from, among other things, misrepresenting the availability of 
government grants, loans, or credit, or the scope of any product or 
service concerning investments, real estate or other business opportunities. 
Also, Del Dotto agreed to pay a judgment of $200,000. </P>

<p>In February 1995, in a complaint filed in federal court, FTC alleged that 
Del Dotto and DDE made false and unsubstantiated claims that consumers trying to 
use the Cash Flow System typically profit from investments in real estate and 
that hundreds of thousands of customers have made substantial sums of money through 
the system. FTC's complaint also alleged that Del Dotto, DDE and NFN Inc. misrepresented 
and failed to deliver other goods and services sold at NFN Inc.-sponsored seminars. </p>

<p>The complaint also alleged that David Del Dotto and NFN Inc. misrepresented the guarantee accompanying a home business package sold at the seminars by failing to inform purchasers that there were conditions to receiving a refund. FTC also challenged as deceptive Del Dotto's and DDE's alleged failure to disclose adequately a restocking fee, amounting to 10% of the purchase price, charged on refunds. </p>

<p>The proposed settlement would permanently bar Del Dotto Enterprises, NFN, 
Inc., and David Del Dotto from making the types of misrepresentations 
alleged in FTC's complaint. Also, defendants would be specifically barred 
from making any representation about the performance, benefits, efficacy or 
success rate of any product or service, the profitability of using any product 
or service, or the profitability of any business opportunity or direct 
marketing activity, unless the representation is true and the defendants 
can substantiate the representation. Also, defendants would be barred from 
representing that any endorsement of a product or service represents the 
typical or ordinary experience of those who use the product or service unless 
it's true. Moreover, defendants would be barred from using such terms as 
"Satisfaction Guarantee," "Money Back Guarantee," "Free Trial Offer," or 
similar representations in advertising unless they refund the full purchase 
price of the advertised product or service at the purchaser's request. 
Defendants also would be barred from failing prominently to disclose material 
limitations on guarantees, warranties and refund policies, and from failing to 
refund money in accordance with guarantees warranties, and refund policies 
within a reasonable period as prescribed by the settlement. </P>

<p>FTC filed the stipulated final judgment and order for permanent injunction 
in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, in San Francisco, 
on September 25, 1996. </p>

<p><B>NOTE:</B> The stipulated final judgment is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by the defendants of a law violation. Consent judgments have the force of law when signed by the judge. </p>

<p align=center><font size=4><strong>FTC SETTLEMENT INCLUDES $10,000 FOR REDRESS,<br>
$250,000 BOND REQUIREMENT</strong></font></center></p>

<p>Patricia Esme Popp agreed to pay $10,000 to settle FTC charges that she 
enticed consumers to call her nationally advertised 800 number with promises 
of "guaranteed" loans. In fact, all she did was refer consumers to other firms 
to which they could apply for loans, FTC alleged. The settlement resolves charges 
FTC filed in June against Popp, who does business as Glendale Associates, 
Crown Credit Services, and Star Financial Services. In its complaint, FTC 
also had alleged that Popp charged consumers $25 for her "services," a violation 
of the Telemarketing Sales Rule's ban on advance-fee loans. In addition to 
a $400,000 judgment, of which all but $10,000 is waived unless Popp is found 
to have misrepresented her financial condition, FTC settlement would bar Popp 
from violating the Rule and from misrepresenting any credit offer or service 
in the future. The settlement also would protect her future customers by requiring 
her to post a $250,000 bond before engaging in any telemarketing effort and 
before offering any credit services. </p>

<p align=center><font size=4><strong>FTC STAFF REPORT ON CONSUMERS' FAT CONSUMPTION<br>
APPROVINGLY CITES AD, LABEL CLAIMS</strong></font></center></p>

<p>A recently issued FTC staff report examines changes in consumers' fat, 
saturated fat, and cholesterol consumption from 1977 through 1990. The study 
found that advertising and labeling claims "may have been an important part 
of the information environment helping consumers make better dietary choices 
during the late 1980's."</p>

<p>Jonathan Baker, Director of the FTC's Bureau of Economics, said, "This study is the latest in a long line of staff economic reports examining how seller advertising or information disclosure may help consumers to make more informed choices." </p>

<p>The study looked at detailed food consumption data, as well as annual food production data, from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and consumer survey data on diet-health knowledge from the Food and Drug Administration. According to the study, these different types of independent data permitted examination of consumer knowledge and behavior from several perspectives, allowing a more comprehensive assessment of how diets changed as the policies governing diet-disease claims in advertising and labeling were relaxed in the mid-1980s. </p>

<p>An FTC release noted:</p>

<p>"Overall, the study provides substantial evidence that fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol consumption--for both men and women--fell significantly between 1977 and 1990, as information spread to consumers. Available evidence also indicates that improvements in these dietary characteristics occurred more rapidly and more consistently across food choices after 1985, when health-related claims became more explicit and more frequent in advertising and labeling. For instance, the study found that fat consumption per day fell approximately five percent between 1977 and 1985, but it fell by more than twice that amount between 1985 and 1990 for both men and women."</p>

<p>The study, Information and Advertising Policy: A Study of Fat and Cholesterol Consumption in the United States, 1977-1990, "reflects the views of its authors and not necessarily the views of the Commission or any individual Commissioner."</p>

<p>(<I>Information and Advertising Policy: A Study of Fat and Cholesterol Consumption in the United States, 1977-1990</I>, issued October 7, 1996; materials relating to this FTC matter are available on the Internet at FTC's World Wide Web site at: <a href="http://www.ftc.gov">http://www.ftc.gov</a>.)</p>

<p align=center><font size=4><strong>FTC STREAMLINES GUIDELINES FOR LEATHER,<br>
IMITATION LEATHER GOODS</strong></font></center></p>

<p>If it looks like leather, is it really leather? Under FTC's recently revised guidelines, the answer is "yes," unless the manufacturer specifically discloses that the product is made of some other material. FTC's new guidelines generally warn manufacturers and retailers against misrepresenting the composition of a variety of products often made from leather--including footwear, luggage, handbags and belts--and are intended to prevent misuse of terms such as waterproof, scratchproof and the like. The new "Guides for Select Leather and Imitation Leather Products" are effective December 2, 1996. </p>

<p>Under the new guidelines, if your products appear to be made of leather but they aren't, you should include a disclosure saying either that the product is not made of leather or the actual type of material from which it is made. If leather is embossed or processed to simulate a different type of leather, you should disclose the leather's true type. Also, you should disclose the composition of backing material in certain situations. The guidelines caution against misrepresentations about the leather content in products containing ground, reconstituted, or bonded leather, and state that such products, when they appear to be made of leather, should be accompanied by a disclosure as to the percentage of leather or other fiber content. The guidelines also say that these disclosures should be included in any product advertising that might otherwise mislead consumers as to the product's composition. </p>

<p>The new guidelines define the terms waterproof, dustproof, warpproof, scuffproof, scratchproof, scuff resistant and scratch resistant to "prevent misuse and misunderstandings."</p>

<p>Guidelines lack the force of law but are meant to encourage voluntary compliance with the Federal Trade Commission Act. </p>

<p align=center><font size=4><strong>FTC GRANTS PETITION INVOLVING<br>
COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING</strong></font></center></p>

<p>FTC has granted in part the petition of Pendleton Woolen Mills, Inc. to reopen and modify a 1979 order, thus allowing Pendleton to engage in lawful, price restrictive, cooperative advertising and to unilaterally terminate a reseller of its products for failing to adhere to Pendleton's announced resale prices or sale periods. FTC denied Pendleton's request for one modification in the order on grounds that the change could be construed to allow agreements on advertised prices that go beyond cooperative advertising programs.</p>

<p align=center><font size=4><strong>FTC LAUNCHES "PROJECT $CHOLAR$CAM";<br>
FILES FIVE COMPLAINTS</strong></font></center><br>

<p>On September 5, 1996, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced 
"Project $cholar$cam," under which it filed charges in federal district 
court against five companies, alleging that they took advantage of education 
finance worries to exploit college-bound students and their families. The 
second half of Project $cholar$cam is a major campaign to educate consumers 
in how to identify a fraudulent scholarship search service.  </p>

<p>In each of the five cases announced by FTC, the agency has obtained a
temporary restraining order barring the challenged tactics and freezing
defendants' assets in an effort to preserve funds for possible redress
to consumers. Ultimately, FTC will seek court orders permanently
barring the defendants from engaging in similar fraudulent or deceptive
schemes, and requiring them to give refunds to their customers. </p>

<p>The following is a list of the defendants in Project $cholar$cam and
FTC's allegations in each case:</p>
 
<p>1. <i>Career Assistance Planning, Inc. </i></p>
 
<p>FTC's ALLEGATIONS: "Have sent millions of postcards stating recipients
`may be eligible' for many grants and scholarships and listing an 800
number. Offered a full refund of its $199 fee for students who do not
receive at least $1,000 in scholarship money within one year, or of its
$299 fee for those who do not receive at least $2,000. Ultimately
supplied a list of scholarships that are no longer available or for
which students are ineligible. Some consumers received no list at all.
Consumers received only partial refunds, or none at all. Defendants
also debited consumers' checking accounts or charged their credit
accounts without authorization."</p>
 
<p>(FTC File No. 952 3174; U.S. District Court for the Northern District
of Georgia, in Atlanta, Civil Action No. 1 96-CV-2187-MHS).</p>

<p>2. <i>Christopher Ebere Nwaigwe</i></p>
 
<p>FTC's  ALLEGATIONS: "Obtained mailing lists of college students
organized by field of study and sent at least a thousand letters a day
to students nationwide representing that he has a scholarship for them
or soliciting them to purchase a scholarship list for $10. Stated that
the fee would be refunded for consumers who do not receive a specified
level of funding. Consumers received nothing at all or a list of
agencies that purportedly administer scholarships, but which includes
scholarships for which deadlines had passed or students were
ineligible, incorrect addresses, or sources that did not in fact award
scholarships."</p>
 
<p>(FTC File No. 962 3242; U.S. District Court for the District of
Maryland, Northern Division, in Baltimore, Civil Action No.
HAR-96-2690).</p>

<p>3. <i>Student Assistance Services, Inc.</i> </p>
 
<p>FTC's ALLEGATIONS: "Have sent more than 1 million postcards to high
school and college students advertising scholarship services and
listing an 800 number. Telemarketers told consumers that, for a $179
up-front fee, they could find `unclaimed' scholarship and grant funds
from private companies, and guaranteed to refund the fee if the
students did not get at least $1,000. Consumers received either nothing
at all, or a list of `sources' for financial aid for which they had to
apply on their own or which in fact were contests, loans or work-study
programs. Many sources were no longer available or not suitable for the
student. Students seeking refunds had to apply in writing to each
source on the list and provide rejection letters and, even then, many
did not receive refunds."</p>
 
<p>(FTC File No. 962 3235; U.S. District Court for the Southern District
of Florida, Fort Lauderdale Division, Civil Action No. 96-6995
CIV-Roettger).</p>
 
<p>4. <i>College Assistance Services, Inc.</i></p>
 
<p>FTC's  ALLEGATIONS: "Have mailed more than 1 million post cards to high
school and college students stating that they were eligible for the
defendants' College Scholarship and Grant Program and listing an 800
number. Callers were told that the company was a clearinghouse for
corporations who give scholarships and that millions of dollars in
scholarship funds remain unclaimed. Charged $179 to enroll consumers in
their program on the guarantee that the students would get at least
$1,000. Students received a list with about 40 sources of aid, many of
which were contests, loan or work-study programs, and others of which
were no longer in existence, had expired deadlines or specified
eligibility requirements the students did not meet. In many instances,
the defendants did not give refunds unless students provided a
rejection letter from each source or complied with a variety of other
conditions."</p>
 
<p>(FTC File No. 962 3226; U.S. District Court for the Southern District
of Florida, Miami Division, Civil Action No. 96-6996 CIV-Highsmith).</p>

<p>5. <i>Student Aid Incorporated </i></p>
 
<p>FTC's ALLEGATIONS: "Placed classified ads in college newspapers and
posted flyers on campuses that touted `Money for College!!!!' and
listed an 800 number. Callers were told that, for an up-front fee of
$97, Student Aid would obtain at least $1,000 in scholarships or
grants. Debited consumer's checking accounts without authorization.
Sent some consumers a list which included scholarships and grants for
which deadlines had passed or students did not qualify. Required
students to provide a rejection letter from each source in order to get
promised refunds. </p>
 
<p>(FTC File No. 962 3217; U.S. District Court for the Southern District
of New York; in New York City, Civil Action No. 96 CIV 6548).</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> The Commission files a complaint when it has "reason to believe" 
that the law has been or is being violated, and it appears to the 
Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest. The complaint 
is not a finding or ruling that the defendant has actually violated the 
law. The case will be decided by the court. </p>

<p align=center><font size=4><strong>MENU CLAIMS MUST COMPLY WITH FDA RULE</strong></font></p>

<p>Restaurant menu items making such claims as "low fat" or "heart healthy" must be able to show there's a reasonable basis for believing the food is qualified to make this claim, according to recent FDA standards. FDA's July 30, 1996 final rule for the standards gives restaurant owners substantial flexibility in establishing this reasonable basis and in presenting the information to consumers. However, owners must be prepared to show officials that their menu claims are consistent with the claim definitions under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990. </p>

<p>Unlike processed foods, restaurant menu selections needn't supply complete nutrition information. Also, menu items bearing a claim can be shown to meet the rule by more economical means than the strict standards of laboratory analyses required for processed foods. </p>

<p>Example: A restaurant could show that an item was designed to meet the requirements for the claim because it was prepared using a recipe from a recognized health professional association or dietary group, or that the nutritional values for the dish were calculated using a reliable nutrition database. </p>

<p>Also, nutrition information can be given to the consumer by any reasonable means. It doesn't have to be presented in the "Nutrition Facts" format seen on packaged food labels. Nor does it have to appear on the menu. </p>

<p>Example: Information on the fat content of all menu items that bear fat claims could be compiled in a notebook available to consumers on request. </p>

<p>FDA believes the rule's flexibility, limited scope, and compliance date of May 1997 will minimize its economic impact on the restaurant industry. The new menu rules are identical to standards in effect since May 1994 for nutrient content claims on placards and signs in large and medium-sized restaurants, and since May 1995 for such claims in smaller restaurants. </p>

<p align=center><font size=4><strong>FTC EXTENDS DEADLINE FOR JEWELRY 
GUIDES</strong></font></p>

<p>FTC has extended until September 30, 1996, the deadline for public 
comments regarding the portion of its Guides for
the Jewelry, Precious Metals, and Pewter Industries covering claims
about platinum products. FTC granted the extension at the request of
the Manufacturing Jewelers and Silversmiths of America, Inc., an
industry group that requested the extra time to complete a survey of
its members. </p>

<p>FTC's Jewelry Guides are voluntarily and extensively followed by
jewelry and gemstone marketers in advertising their products to
consumers. On May 30, 1996, the FTC announced revisions to the guides,
except for the provision on platinum products, about which it sought
additional comments, setting an original deadline of August 12, 1996. </p>

<p>If you have any comments on these Guides, send them to FTC, Office of
the Secretary, Room H-159, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.,
Washington, D.C. 20580. Identify your comments as "Comments Regarding
Guides for the Jewelry, Precious Metals, and Pewter Industries."</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> These news briefs appeared in past issues of <b>Advertising 
Compliance Service</b> and examined advertising law-related actions during the month 
of June 1996.</p>

<p align=center><font size=4><strong>FTC FINALIZES AGREEMENTS WITH SEVEN 
INTERNET ADVERTISERS</strong></font></center><br>

<p>FTC has made final consent agreements with the following 
seven companies charged with deceptively advertising their products or 
services on the Internet. </p>
<p><i>Robert Serviss, dba Excel Communications</i>: Agreement settles charges that he 
promoted a work-at-home opportunity on the Internet using false and 
unsubstantiated earnings claims. The consent order requires Serviss to have 
substantiation for profits, sales or earnings claims he makes about any 
business opportunity he markets. (FTC Dkt. No. C-3669, June 12, 1996.) </p>
<p><i>Rick Rahim, dba NBDC Credit Resource Publishing</i>: Agreement settles 
charges that he falsely advertised on the Internet that his credit repair 
program, which advises consumers to misrepresent their Social Security 
numbers to obtain a new credit identity, is legal. The consent order bars 
Rahim from misrepresenting the legality of any credit repair product he 
advertises, and requires him to make certain disclosures in ads for such 
products that misrepresenting one's Social Security number or certain other 
information may be a federal crime. (FTC Dkt. No. C-3671, June 12, 1996.) </p>
<p><i>Brian Coryat, dba Enterprising Solutions</i>: FTC agreement settles charges that 
he falsely advertised on the Internet that consumers could use his credit repair 
kit to remove negative, but accurate and up-to-date, information from their 
credit reports; and that he made false and unsubstantiated claims about the 
earnings potential of those who bought his Credit Repair Agency business. 
The consent order bars Coryat from making similar credit repair 
misrepresentations, and requires him to have evidence to back up earnings or 
sales claims for any business opportunity he markets. (FTC Dkt. No. 
C-3666, June 10, 1996.) </p>
<p><i>Randolf D. Albertson, dba Wolverine Capital</i>: This agreement settles charges 
that he falsely advertised on the Internet he could obtain cash grants for 
clients. The order bars Albertson from misrepresenting the number of people 
who are approved for grants or the services or assistance he provides in 
obtaining any financial product or service, and requires him to have evidence 
to back up such claims. (FTC Dkt. No. C-3670, June 12, 1996.) </p>
<p><i>Sherman G. Smith, dba Starr Communications</i>: Agreement settles charges that 
he made false and unsubstantiated earnings claims in his Internet advertising 
for the &quot;U.S. Government Tracer Business Program,&quot; which purportedly 
would show consumers how to make money tracking down people due 
refunds after they had paid off their mortgages. The consent order requires 
Smith to have substantiation for profits, earnings or sales claims for any 
business opportunity he markets. (FTC Dkt. No. C-3668, June 12, 1996.) </p>
<p><i>Lyle R. Larson, dba Momentum</i>: FTC agreement settles charges that he 
falsely advertised on the Internet that, through his &quot;legal&quot; program, consumers 
could remove negative, but accurate and up-to-date information from their 
credit reports. The consent order prohibits such false claims and requires 
Larson to make certain disclosures in ads for credit repair products that 
misrepresenting one's Social Security number or certain other information may 
be a federal crime. (FTC Dkt. No. C-3672, June 12, 1996.) </p>
<p><i>Timothy R. Bean, dba DMC Publishing Group</i>: This FTC agreement settles 
charges that he made false earnings claims in Internet advertising for his 
program to operate a home-based publishing and printing business. The 
consent order requires him to have substantiation for earnings and sales claims 
for any business opportunity he markets. (FTC Dkt. No. C-3665, June 12, 
1996.) </p>

<p align=center><font size=4><strong>FTC LAW JUDGE SUSTAINS CHARGES 
AGAINST &quot;RUST EVADER&quot;</strong></font></center><br>

<p>An FTC administrative law judge has barred RustEvader 
Corporation from using the names &quot;Rust Evader&quot; or &quot;Rust Buster&quot; for a 
purported electronic corrosion control device for cars that the judge said is 
not effective in substantially reducing corrosion, despite the company's ad 
campaign to the contrary. Judge James P. Timony's order follows FTC 
charges that RustEvader made false claims about its Rust Evader product and 
about a demonstration and studies regarding its efficacy. Timony upheld the 
charges in a default judgment he issued following RustEvader's &quot;general failure 
to respond to requests for information during the discovery period before trial 
on the case.&quot; FTC issued a complaint against RustEvader and company 
president, David F. McCready, in August 1995. Both answered the FTC 
complaint in October, 1995, denying the charges. In April, 1996, however, 
the charges against McCready were withdrawn from litigation so FTC could 
consider a proposed settlement agreement. According to Timony's findings, 
RustEvader falsely claimed that: </p>
<p>&quot;Rust Evader is effective in substantially reducing corrosion in motor vehicle 
bodies, and that the company had evidence to back up this claim; a salt-water 
tank demonstration of the product's efficacy accurately reflected how Rust 
Evader protects motor vehicle bodies from corrosion when, in truth, the 
process used in the demonstration is much more effective under water than 
under conditions that a motor vehicle normally encounters; and reports of 
laboratory and other tests performed on the Rust Evader that the firm 
provided to dealers constituted scientific proof that the product substantially 
reduces motor vehicle body corrosion.&quot; </p>
<p>Judge Timony ordered RustEvader Corporation to stop using the terms Rust 
Evader or Rust Buster and to stop making the challenged claims for the Rust 
Evader product. The order also requires RustEvader to have appropriate 
competent and reliable evidence to back up claims about the performance, 
efficacy or attributes of any product for use in motor vehicles. Also, the order 
bars RustEvader from misrepresenting the existence or results of any test or 
study, or that any demonstration or picture proves any material feature or 
quality of any product for use in motor vehicles. </p>

<p align=center><font size=4><strong>MAJOR FTC, STATE CRACKDOWN INVOLVES 
CROSS-BORDER ADS</strong></font></center><br>

<p>&quot;Every year, thousands of consumers respond to enticing classified ads 
in newspapers that tout `money to loan . . . regardless of credit.'&quot; So said 
FTC in announcing a major federal-state crackdown to enforce the new 
Telemarketing Sales Rule. The problem--according to FTC and 15 state 
Attorneys General--is that consumers responding to such ads usually have to 
pay advance fees to get the &quot;guaranteed&quot; loans. &quot;The consumers never receive 
the promised loans and either never hear again from the `loan' companies, or 
are later told they're ineligible for the credit,&quot; FTC noted. FTC's 
Telemarketing Sales Rule makes it illegal for any telemarketer who guarantees 
consumers a loan or other credit to ask for money in advance. FTC and the 
state Attorneys General recently announced the results of this crackdown. The 
sweep consisted of eight cases filed by states and five cases filed by FTC. It 
snared 45 corporations and individuals, including some operating out of 
Canada. </p>
<p>The crackdown on firms operating out of Canada is the first time FTC has 
sued a foreign telemarketing boiler room and highlights the growing number of 
fraudulent telemarketers operating out of Canada. Concurrent with the 
FTC-state crackdown, the Province of British Columbia initiated law 
enforcement proceedings against the same Canadian loan scam operators. </p>
<p>&quot;Cross-border scams are a growth industry and thousands of Americans lose 
money every day to scam artists operating outside our borders,&quot; said FTC 
Chairman Robert Pitofsky. &quot;By joining state and federal law enforcers here 
with authorities in Canada, we believe we will be successful in stopping a 
massive advance-fee loan scheme involving numerous defendants based most 
recently in British Columbia and Ontario. We intend to continue that approach 
in the future.&quot; </p>
<p>Joining in the crackdown were Attorneys General from Arkansas, California, 
Connecticut, Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North 
Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin. </p>
<p>According to FTC, advance-fee loan schemes are often advertised in the 
classified sections of daily newspapers, including &quot;USA Today,&quot; and other 
publications such as &quot;The Globe&quot; and &quot;National Examiner.&quot; </p>

FTC matter are available on the Internet at FTC's World Wide Web site at:

<p align=center><font size=4><strong>FTC FINAL AGREEMENT INVOLVES ALLEGED<br>
AD AGENCY CULPABILITY</strong></font></center><br>

<p>This recently finalized FTC consent agreement with N.W. 
Ayer &amp; Son, Inc.--which does business as NW Ayer, Inc., of New York 
City--settled charges over that ad agency's role in creating ads for Eggland's 
Best, Inc. eggs. FTC challenged claims regarding the effect of the eggs on 
blood cholesterol. The final order bars Ayer from misrepresenting with regard 
to eggs and any meat, dairy or poultry product the absolute or comparative 
amount of cholesterol, total fat, saturated fat or any other fatty acid or the 
existence or results of any test or study. The order also requires Ayer to have 
competent and reliable scientific evidence to back up any claims that such 
products have any effect on serum cholesterol or any health benefit. </p>
<p>(NW Ayer, Inc., FTC Dkt. No. C-3660, June 6, 1996; materials relating to 
this FTC matter are available on the Internet at FTC's World Wide Web site 
at: <a href="http://www.ftc.gov"> http://www.ftc.gov</a>.) </p>

<p align=center><font size=4><strong>FTC CHARGES INVOLVE SELLER OF HOME-BASED<br>
BUSINESS AND INFOMERCIALS</strong></font></center><br>

<p>FTC filed suit against FreeCom Communications, 
Inc. and several other companies, charging that the firms and their principals 
misrepresented the earnings potential to consumers who bought their $495 
home-business &quot;starter kits.&quot; FTC alleged that defendants used infomercials 
and mailings to urge consumers to attend their seminars, which were 
conducted throughout the U.S. According to FTC, it was at these seminars 
that the defendants induced consumers to buy the starter kits by making 
claims that each of the business ventures it was selling was a proven 
money-maker. FTC has asked the court to (1) order a permanent halt to the 
alleged misrepresentations, (2) order an asset freeze to preserve funds for 
consumer redress, and (3) appoint a receiver to take control of the 
companies. </p>
<p>FTC's action follows a joint federal-state investigation with the office of the 
Utah Attorney General. Jodie Bernstein, Director of FTC's Bureau of 
Consumer Protection said, &quot;Anyone can be lured by slick sales pitches, or 
testimonials of success. Honest people, trying to earn a living by working for 
themselves, can be duped by promises of making big-time easy money. 
However, few, if any consumers, actually earn substantial income from these 
business ventures.&quot; Utah's Attorney General, Jan Graham, said, &quot;Our office 
has been concerned about the high potential for fraud in home business 
seminars for several years. I appreciate the FTC's eagerness to have the Utah 
Attorney General's Office work with them on this multi-million dollar case 
involving not only Utah victims, but victims from across the country.&quot; </p>
<p>In addition to the corporate defendants, FTC's complaint names as 
defendants several individuals who, at various times, were officers, directors 
and/or shareholders in some or all of the defendant corporations. According 
to FTC, since 1992, defendants promoted and sold home-based business 
opportunities, such as, the resale of distressed merchandise, vending 
machines, color-change T-shirts, the sale of discount travel memberships, 
vitamins, scholarship search services, and estate planning, through its 
infomercials, print advertisements, mail-pieces, telephone solicitations, and/or 
seminars. </p>
<p>According to FTC's complaint, defendants have represented through print 
advertisements and mail-pieces that the defendants offered proven business 
opportunities, that consumers could expect to earn substantial income through 
one of the home-based businesses, and that speakers at the seminars have 
earned substantial income through one of these businesses. For example, 
some of the defendants' print ads and mail pieces contained statements such 
as: </p>
<p>&quot;Allen came to our conference, one like you're being invited to. Now he 
works for himself ... out of his home ... and pays himself a salary three times 
more than his former employer paid. Last year Allen earned: over $200,000. 
(His first year he earned: $111,000).&quot; </p>
<p>FTC also charged that certain testimonials used by the defendants in their 
sales presentations, infomercials, advertisements, and promotional materials 
did not reflect the typical or ordinary experiences of consumers who have 
purchased a business venture from the defendants, and that such 
representations were false and misleading. Finally, FTC charged that, in many 
cases, defendants falsely depicted that certain persons (whose stories are 
described in defendants' sales presentations, ads, promotional materials, and 
by defendants' telemarketers) achieved a certain level of success by using one 
or more of defendants' business ventures. FTC asked the court to 
permanently bar the defendants from making, or to assist others in making, the 
types of representations as alleged in the complaint, to order the defendants to 
rescind contracts with, and refund money to consumers. FTC filed its 
complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, Central Division, 
in Salt Lake City. </p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> The Commission authorizes the filing of a complaint when it has 
&quot;reason to believe&quot; that the law has been or is being violated, and it appears to 
the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest. The complaint is not 
a finding or ruling that a defendant actually has violated the law. The case will 
be decided by the court.&quot; </p>
<p>(FreeCom Communications, Inc. et al., Civil Action No.: 2: 96CV-0492,

matter are available on the Internet at FTC's World Wide Web site at: 
<a href="http://www.ftc.gov"> http://www.ftc.gov</a>.) </p>

<p align=center><font size=4><strong>FTC STAFF: REPEAL GAMES OF CHANCE RULE</strong></font></center><br>

<p>FTC's staff recommended that the Commission repeal its trade regulation rule on Games 
of Chance in the Food Retailing and Gasoline Industries. Their reasons: The 
rule's costs outweigh its benefits and the abuses that led to the rule are unlikely 
to recur. Rulemaking in this matter is nearing its final stage--review by the five 
Commissioners. </p>
<p>This rule was promulgated in 1969. It establishes requirements for food and 
gasoline retailers in conducting and advertising games of chance. The rule 
requires game promoters, in advertising for games of chance, to provide 
detailed information on the number of prizes available, the odds of winning 
each prize, the geographic area covered by the game and the number of 
participating retailers. The rule applies only to games conducted by food 
stores and gasoline stations. It also regulates various aspects of a game's 
operation and the procedure for posting lists of winners. In 1981, FTC 
granted an exemption to the rule's disclosure requirements for broadcast 
advertising. </p>
<p>In 1995, the Presiding Officer reopened the record for additional comments 
on whether a need for this rule continues to exist. In their respective reports, 
FTC staff and the Presiding Officer recommend that FTC repeal this rule. </p>
<p>If you'd like to comment on the two reports, your comments must be confined 
to information already in the rulemaking record. Deadline: August 6, 1996. 
Send your written comments to: Henry B. Cabell, Presiding Officer, FTC, 6th 
Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20580. (Those in 
excess of four pages should be accompanied by four copies). Limited copies 
of the two reports are available from the FTC's Public Reference Branch, 
Room 130, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.

<p align=center><font size=4><strong>FTC OK'S FINAL CONSENT ORDER IN DIET CASE</strong></font></center><br>

<p>FTC finalized a consent agreement with the Diet Workshop, Inc., a franchiser of 
weight-loss plans and products, and the owner of its company-operated 
territories, Diet Workshop of Boston, Inc., settling charges that they made 
unsubstantiated weight-loss and weight-loss maintenance claims and used 
consumer testimonials deceptively. The final order bars respondents from 
misrepresenting the performance of any weight-loss program and requires 
them to have reliable scientific evidence to substantiate claims about achieving 
or maintaining weight loss, or the rate at which the loss can be expected to 
occur. The order also sets out standards for the type of evidence required to 
support various maintenance claims. Also, ad claims about maintaining weight 
loss must include the statement: &quot;For many dieters, weight loss is temporary.&quot; 
Weight-loss maintenance claims in all but short broadcast ads must be 
accompanied by disclosures regarding the actual experience of Diet 
Workshop customers; short broadcast ads must direct consumers to check 
with the company's local centers for detailed maintenance statistics. The order 
also bars the misleading use of testimonials, and requires atypical testimonials 
to be qualified. </p>

<p align=center><font size=4><strong>FTC OK'S FINAL CONSENT ORDER IN 
CANCER TREATMENT CASE</strong></font></center><br>

<p>FTC has made final a consent agreement with Cancer Treatment 
Centers of America, Inc., Midwestern Regional Medical Center, Inc., and 
Memorial Medical Center and Cancer Institute, Inc. This settles charges that 
they made false and unsubstantiated claims in advertising and promoting their 
cancer treatments. The order requires respondents to have competent and 
reliable evidence--scientific in certain appropriate instances--to support 
representations about patient survivorship or cure rates, or endorsement, or 
efficacy, performance, safety or benefits of any cancer treatment. They also 
are barred from using testimonials in a misleading way. </p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> A consent agreement or consent decree is for settlement purposes 
only and does not constitute an admission of a law violation. When finalized, 
both have the force of law. Any violation of an FTC consent order may result 
in a civil penalty of $10,000. </p>

<p align=center><font size=4><strong>TV MARKETER TO PAY $200,000 FTC PENALTY<br>
OVER INFOMERCIAL CLAIMS</strong></font></center><br>
<p>The marketer of an over-the-counter acne treatment, Acne-Statin, 
agreed to pay a $200,000 civil penalty to settle FTC charges that ads claiming the 
product to be an effective treatment for severe or cystic acne were deceptive. The 
claims also violate a 1979 order barring Dr. Atida H. Karr from making 
unsubstantiated claims about the effectiveness or superiority of any acne 
preparation she markets, FTC alleges. </p>
<p>The 1979 order bars Karr and her firms from advertising the effectiveness or 
superiority of any acne preparation unless the claims are supported by competent 
and reliable scientific or medical evidence. Karr paid $175,000 into a consumer 
refund account as part of the 1979 settlement of the initial case. In October 1995, 
FTC alleged that Karr was appearing in TV infomercials making claims about the 
effectiveness and superiority of her product, such as &quot;Most of the people who 
wrote to me had acne for many years and couldn't find anything to clear their skin, 
that is, until they discovered Acne-Statin.&quot; Product endorsers claim Acne-Statin 
was effective in treating their severe or cystic acne. At the time Karr and her 
company made the claims, they lacked competent and reliable scientific or medical 
evidence to support the claims, FTC's complaint alleges. FTC filed suit in U.S. 
District Court seeking civil penalties and a permanent injunction to bar future 
violations of the original order. The consent agreement will end that litigation. 
Under the terms of the consent, Karr will be enjoined from using ads that use the 
words &quot;severe&quot; or &quot;cystic&quot; acne, and will pay a $200,000 civil penalty. </p>

Internet at FTC's World Wide Web site at: <a href="http://www.ftc.gov">

<p align=center><font size=4><strong>FTC ANTI-FRAUD EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGN<br>
INVOLVES PRIZE PROMOTION</strong></font></center><br>

<p>FTC announced that Publishers Clearing House would take part 
in the Partnership for Consumer Education--&quot;a cooperative effort among federal 
agencies, private industry, and consumer organizations to provide effective 
consumer education campaigns against fraud.&quot; As part of this campaign, Publishers 
Clearing House, working with FTC, has developed educational materials for 
distribution in prize promotion mailings and Sunday supplements. Messages 
emphasize that consumers don't have to &quot;pay to play,&quot; and that &quot;the best things in 
life are free.&quot; </p>
<p>(FTC Release, July 25, 1996.) </p>

<p align=center><font size=4><strong>FTC WOULD REPEAL USED OIL RULE</strong></font></center><br>

<p>FTC has begun efforts to repeal its Used Oil Rule. The Used Oil Rule's 
labeling and advertising requirements for engine oils have been preempted 
by FTC's newer Recycled Oil Rule, which FTC promulgated in 1995 as required 
by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. </p>
<p>(FTC Release, July 26, 1996.) </p>

<p align=center><font size=4><strong>NEW NAME ON FIBER CONTENT LABELS OF<br>
CLOTHING IS PROPOSED</strong></font></center><br>

<p>There may soon be a new name on the fiber content labels of 
certain items of clothing, such as swim suits and ski pants. FTC has proposed to 
allow U.S. manufacturers and other marketers to use the new designated name for 
a fiber that purportedly has stretching properties similar to spandex, but is 
composed of polyester and polyether segments, giving it chemically different 
characteristics. FTC seeks comments on the proposal, which it announced in 
response to a petition filed by Teijin Limited, a Osaka, Japan-based company that 
manufacturers the new fiber under the trade name &quot;REXE.&quot; </p>
<p>The Textile Fiber Products Identification Act requires manufacturers to use the 
generic names of fibers contained in their textile products in the fiber content labels 
of those products. FTC rules and regulations under this statute set out the process 
a manufacturer must go through to establish a new generic fiber name. In October 
1992, Teijin petitioned the FTC to add a fiber name and definition to the list of 
approved generic names established by Rule 7 of the Textile Act maintaining, 
among other things, that the new fiber was in active commercial use in the U.S., 
and that the new fiber does not fall within any existing established generic fiber 
category. </p>
<p>(Teijin Limited, FTC Matter No. P968405, July 8, 1996.) </p>

<p align=center><font size=4><strong>VICTORIA STREITFELD NAMED FTC's PUBLIC 
AFFAIRS DIRECTOR</strong></font></center><br>

<p>FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky named Victoria Streitfeld as FTC's 
new Director of Public Affairs, putting her in charge of the office that directs the 
FTC's relations with reporters and other members of the media. </p>
<p>Streitfeld formerly was Director of Communications and spokesperson for Senator 
Bill Bradley. Before that, she held the same positions with the New York State 
Unified Court System. Streitfeld was with the Office of the New York City 
Council President from 1988-1993. She can be reached at 202-326-2718 or 
202-326-2180. </p>

not constitute an admission of a law violation. When the Commission issues 
a consent order on a final basis, it carries the force of law with respect 
to future actions. Each violation of such an order may result in a civil 
penalty of $10,000. </P>

<p align=center><font size=5><strong>Advertising Law: News Briefs from August 1996</strong></font></center><br>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> The following news briefs appeared in a past issue of <b>Advertising 
Compliance Service</b> and examined advertising law-related actions during the month 
of August 1996.</p>

<p align=center><font size=4><strong>FTC AGREEMENT: INTERNET PROMOTER<br>
BANNED FROM BUSINESS FOR LIFE</strong></font></center></p>

<p>An Internet promoter is out of the advance fee credit business forever,
under an agreement he signed to settle FTC charges against him. FTC
charged that he allegedly bolstered his promises of easy credit for
consumers by claiming he had an "excellent record" with the "National
Bureau of Consumer Affairs." FTC charged that the National Bureau of
Consumer Affairs was one of the names under which the promoter
conducted his South Carolina-based fraudulent credit services business.
The settlement negotiated by FTC also requires the promoter to pay
$3,500 in consumer redress, bars him from violating the Telemarketing
Sales Rules' provisions against deceptive or abusive telemarketing
practices, and imposes a broad ban on material misrepresentations in
connection with any product or service he sells in the future.</p> 

<p>FTC's complaint alleged that the promoter advertised VISA cards and
loans with "no credit check" on the Internet and in many publications,
including Income Opportunities and the National Enquirer, and charged
an advance fee of $49. What consumers actually got for their money was
a list of companies offering loans (for which consumers had to
qualify), along with various self-help credit-related materials, said
the agency.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> This consent judgment is for settlement purposes only and does not 
constitute an admission by the defendant of a law violation. Consent 
judgments have the force of law when signed by the judge.</p> 

<p>(National Bureau of Consumer Affairs et al., FTC File No. X96 0070,
Civil Action No. 2 96 1675 18, August 13, 1996; materials relating to
this FTC matter are available on the Internet at FTC's World Wide Web

What is the InterVU Network?
</FONT>
</B>
</FONT>
<P>The InterVU Network is an economical way for Internet Content Providers to speed the delivery of high quality video files that are embedded in their Web sites.  The InterVU service also offloads these large files from the Content Provider's primary Web server, expediting Web site and video access to all viewers. </P>

The InterVU Network Solution
</FONT>
</B>
</FONT>

<P>
The traditional approach to distributing video and other large data files is to replicate the Web site on one or more servers, each with its own communication line to the Internet.   These servers may be at the same facility or scattered across the Internet to provide multiple access points. To retrieve a file, the viewer must manually select a mirror server from a displayed list of mirror servers without any knowledge as to whether the server selected will provide the fastest download, or even whether the server is functional.  This approach is generally inefficient and does not result in a consistent improvement in delivery performance.
</P>
<P>
Using the InterVU Network, large audio-video files associated with Web presentations are duplicated on InterVU Network servers for access by viewers who use the intelligent InterVU Player. When a viewer requests a video, content on all of these servers is managed and monitored by an InterVU Control Center around the clock.
</P>
<P>
Content Providers participating in the InterVU service receive performance, usage and demographic statistics.  Content Providers also benefit from the increased exposure generated from the InterVU Video Guide.  The Video Guide consists of Web pages that catalog the audio-video files contained on the InterVU Network servers, so that a viewer can conveniently find videos (and their related Web sites) of interest.
</P>
<BR>
<A NAME="ANCHOR3001600"></A>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B><FONT COLOR="#DC143C">
Technology Overview
</FONT>
</B>
</FONT>
<P>
The InterVU Network uses InterVU's Smart Mirror&#153; Technology to manage the process of selecting the proper server to be used for file downloads.  Smart Mirror Technology identifies the InterVU Network server that is electronically closest to a viewer from a group of mirrored servers which are various distances away (more hops, Internet connections or Internet congestion) from the viewer.  By following a pointer (URL) to the closest server, the data "virtually" crosses these extra hops rather than traveling through them.
</P>
<UL>
<LI TYPE=DISC>The InterVU Network servers only contain the audio-video files for a Web site.  The HTML pages including the text, static graphics and, when appropriate, back end databases, all reside on the Content Provider's primary server. The  cost of the primary Web site server and its communication lines is reduced because the site doesn't need the capacity to distribute huge audio-video files.
<BR><BR>
<LI>When a viewer is browsing the Web site using the InterVU Player for viewing videos, an InterVU Network server is automatically accessed based on a calibration which previously chose this server as offering the fastest download time.<BR>
<BR>  
<LI>The Smart Mirror Technology is scaleable.  Additional InterVU Network servers can be added at any time without notifying the viewers or requiring changes to the InterVU Player or the Content Provider's Web site.
</UL>
<P>
InterVU Network servers are connected to the Internet at different locations such that each server is closer (in a communication speed sense) to a set of viewers than any of the other servers.  Video files are duplicated on each of the mirror servers, so viewers can acquire the same file from different servers.
</P>
<A NAME="ANCHOR114995"></A>
<FONT SIZE=+1>SmartVU&#153; Network Optimizer</FONT>
<P>
The InterVU SmartVU Network Optimizer is a utility attached to the InterVU player which analyzes Internet video download performance by testing selected video servers located on  the global InterVU Network.  At the end of the test, an InterVU Network server is selected to provide the "best" overall video performance based on Internet access connections. Each time the viewer clicks on a video which is hosted on the InterVU Network, the viewer is seamlessly and automatically redirected to the optimal InterVU Network server to receive the highest performance from the Internet. 
</P>

<P>
Program Operation:  Pressing the "Start" button initiates  Stage 1 which identifies a list of mirrored video servers that are most likely to provide superior video delivery performance. These sites are listed in the dialog box and presented as numbered dots which are located geographically on the "radar screen".   Stage 2 calculates the number of Internet "electronic links" or hops from each of the mirrored sites being analyzed.  Each of the video sites are then relocated onto the radar screen based on these electronic link measurements.  The number of electronic links are indicated on the outside ring of the radar screen.  Stage 3 tests for optimal video delivery from each of the video sites to the viewer.  In the fourth and final stage, the SmartVU program determines the optimal mirrored site based on an analysis of the test results.   Clicking "OK" saves this site as the video source for the viewer whenever a video is viewed that is on the InterVU Network.  Final test results are automatically emailed to the InterVU Control Center for the continuous improvement of your video delivery performance.

</FONT>

<P>
To use the InterVU Network, a viewer needs both the SmartVU Network Optimizer and an InterVU Network Enabled Player.  InterVU has presently made available the SmartVU Network Optimizer and the InterVU Player to support the following environments:<BR>
<BR>
<PRE>
      Movie Formats:	MPEG	

Operating Systems:	PC Windows NT and Windows 95	

  	  Browsers:	PC: All 32 bit forms of the Netscape Navigator, 2.0 and greater
			(Note: the current InterVU Player for the Macintosh is not yet "Network Enabled")
</PRE>
<BR>
 InterVU also has an effort underway to integrate Smart Mirror functionality into other players, enabling content developers who work in other formats to benefit from the InterVU Network service.  InterVU is planning on expanding the InterVU Network to support other browser environments, OSs, and video formats:<BR>
<BR> 
<PRE>
      Movie Formats:	AVI, Quicktime, & other cool third party low bit rate A/V formats

Operating Systems:	Windows 3.11

	Browsers:	MAC: 	Netscape Navigator, 2.0 and greater
				Cyberdog

			PC:	Explorer
</PRE>
<BR>
Content Providers can now offload the heavy bandwidth load associated with video from their
Web site and provide a compelling high speed, high quality interactive video experience for their Web
site visitors.

Summary
</FONT>
</B>
</FONT>

<P>The InterVU Network is an easy, economical way for Web Content Providers to improve the delivery of video files embedded in Web pages.  The InterVU Network addresses Internet throughput problems by physically separating the video content from Web pages, and placing them on multiple dedicated video servers which are placed at strategic locations to provide the best redundant high-speed coverage.  The InterVU Network improves performance by seamlessly redirecting a Web video request to a InterVU Network server that can provide the most efficient delivery route and sustained delivery capability.  The InterVU Network accomplishes this using InterVU's proprietary technology.
</P>

<P>InterVU's concentrated effort on the development of the InterVU Network has enabled the company to gain extensive knowledge about Internet performance. We are developing a series of service solutions which will enable Content Providers to significantly improve the quality, speed and cost-effectiveness of video delivery to the viewer without burdening the performance of existing infrastructure.</P>

The InterVU Network Value - Complete Satisfaction
</FONT>
</B>
</FONT>
<P>
Content Providers heighten viewer satisfaction by offering higher quality video in a shorter amount of time. They also benefit from lower operating costs and reduced requirements for additional expensive high speed Internet connections.  Video files are offloaded to InterVU Network servers.  These servers provide faster delivery of video segments because they are distributed across the Internet on a variety of Internet Backbones, thus reducing the delays incurred with transmitting files from a single point.
</P>
<P>
The InterVU Network offers usage-based pricing.  Content Providers pay for video messages delivered to viewers, without any additional cost for bandwidth or distribution infrastructure.  The InterVU Network is the <B>low cost, high quality solution</B> for video delivery on the Internet.
<P>
Costs for the Content Provider are further minimized because there is no need to purchase either proprietary video encoding technology (InterVU uses standard MPEG-1) or proprietary video server software.  The only effort required of the Content Provider is to add a flag for each MPEG file with a standard HTML embed tag that indicates the video can be found on the InterVU Network servers.</P>
<P>
Access to the regular page text data at the Web site is less subject to the traffic jams and frustrating delays created by the bandwidth hogs - large video files - which are moved to the InterVU Network servers.
</P>
<P>
The viewer also benefits from the advanced features of the InterVU Player and its special controls which improve the viewing experience.  Features include first-frame preview, video-size adjust, auto-loop, autoplay and family viewing controls.</P>
<P>
There is no expense or inconvenience to the viewer for accessing the InterVU Network.  Viewers just download a free copy of the InterVU Player which is available for Windows 95 and Windows NT for now. Macintosh 68K and PowerPC owners can use the current InterVU Player 0.96 for viewing video from a single site on the InterVU Network.  The viewer also benefits from the many features supported by the Player including cached playback, video-save for hard disk storage, and parental guidance controls for family viewing.
</P>
<P>
In summary, video enhanced Web sites create a more compelling Web offering.  The InterVU Network delivers video quickly and efficiently, which ultimately increases viewer traffic at the Web site.  Customer satisfaction results in more repeat visitors -- which is, of course, the key to future business.</P>

<H3>InterVU's Position Statement</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The InterVU Network is for Content Providers and Website developers who want to provide the highest quality video messages on the Internet.  The InterVU Network uses Smart Mirror&#153; Technology to deliver on-demand video content to viewers at the fastest speed.  Unlike hosting at a single Internet site, the InterVU Network employs an intelligent, globally distributed network that automatically delivers video content to viewers from the electronically closest site.

<H4>What software and hardware are needed to create MPEG video clips?</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are several cards available for MPEG encoding. Each
has certain benefits. For example, a company called <A HREF="http://vitechts.com">Vitec Multimedia</A>, in Sarasota, FL has one product that will give you considerable flexibility in encoding size--thus bandwidth--and costs approximately $700. Unfortunately, this card has no ability to encode sound. Their other product will encode both video and sound for around $1000.  Though we haven't seen it yet, <A HREF="http://www.b-way.com">Data Translation</A> offers their Broadway product for under $1000.
<BR>
<BR>A higher end option, is from <A HREF="http://www.realmagic.com">Sigma
Designs</A>. Their encoder card is called Real Magic Producer.
It comes with powerful video editing software by Adobe but its cost will
definitely make you wallet sting (~$5000). 
<BR>
<BR>There are also software-only video encoding systems, but they are very
slow. There are several available for free from various WEB sites, such
as <A HREF="http://www.visiblelight.com/mpeg.htp">The MPEG Plaza</A>.

<H4>How do I use the InterVU Player and its features in the Web pages I create?</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To add the InterVU Player to your Web pages, you use the EMBED tag which allows documents of varying data types to be embedded into an HTML file. This command has three required attributes, SRC, WIDTH, and HEIGHT. The command will also support parameters designed to customize video playback; these parameters are listed below. On the other hand, if you wish to have the file play by itself in a Netscape window, you may also use a standard HTML reference such as: <P>&lt;A REF=&quot;http://www.yoursite.com/coolvideo.mpg&quot;&gt;Link
to MPEG&lt;/A&gt;.</P>
<H4>Required Parameters:</H4>
<P><B>SRC=&lt;URL&gt; </B></P>
<UL>
<P>The <B>EMBED</B> tag allows documents of varying data types to
be embedded into an HTML file. This command has three required
attributes, <B>SRC</B>, <B>WIDTH</B>, and <B>HEIGHT</B>. The command
will also support parameters designed to customize video playback.</P>
<B>SRC=&lt;URL&gt;</B>
<UL>
The URL, or Internet location, of the source MPEG document.
This file must have a MIME type of video/mpeg or video/x-mpeg.
This parameter is required. 
</UL>
<BR>
<B>WIDTH=&lt;size in pixels&gt;</B>
<UL>
The <B>WIDTH</B> attribute specifies the width of the displayed
image of the embedded MPEG document in pixels. You'll need to
add 10 pixels to the width of the video in order to show the frame
around the displayed image. If <B>DOUBLESIZE</B> or <B>HALFSIZE</B>
attributes are also used, you will have to use double or half
of the actual video size, respectively, in your calculation (details
below). If <B>WIDTH</B> is <I>greater</I> than the size of the
video plus the frame, then the excess will be displayed as a white
border surrounding the Player. If <B>WIDTH</B> is <I>less</I>
than the size of the video plus the frame, then the Player will
be cropped and centered within the remaining area. This parameter is required.</UL>
<BR>
<B>HEIGHT=&lt;size in pixels&gt;</B>
<UL>
The <B>HEIGHT</B> attribute specifies the height of the displayed
document in pixels. You'll need to add 29 pixels to the height
of the video frame in order to show the control bar of the InterVU Player. If the <B>CONBAR=NO</B> attribute is set, then only
10 pixels would be added (details below). If <B>DOUBLESIZE</B>
or <B>HALFSIZE</B> attributes are also used, you will have to
use double or half of the actual video size, respectively, in
your calculation (details below). If <B>HEIGHT</B> is <I>greater</I>
than the size of the video plus the frame, then the excess will
be displayed as a white border surrounding the Player. If <B>HEIGHT</B>
is <I>less</I> than the size of the video plus the frame, then
the Player will be cropped and centered within the remaining area.
This parameter is required.</UL>
<BR>
<B>AUTOPLAY=&lt;YES&gt;</B>
<UL>
The <B>AUTOPLAY</B> attribute is an optional parameter. If
set to YES, the video starts playing automatically when the &quot;Web page&quot;
is selected or viewed. The default is <B>NO</B>. Specifying <B>AUTOPLAY=NO</B>
(or by not including the <B>AUTOPLAY</B> parameter) will cause
the first frame of the video to be displayed when the page is
loaded. The user must then start the video manually.
</UL>
<BR>
<B>PLUGINSPAGE=&lt;URL&gt;</B>
<UL>
When a page is viewed that needs a plug-in not found on the
client, a special icon is displayed in place of the plug-in. The
first time the unknown plug-in type is invoked, a dialog box is
automatically opened. This dialog box contains two buttons: Plug-in
Info and Cancel. Clicking on Plug-in Info causes Navigator to
open a URL. The URL is either the location specified in the PLUGINSPAGE
attribute in the EMBED tag, or if the attribute is not used, the
Netscape page that lists current plug-ins. The URL generally contains
information on obtaining the plug-in or the ability to download
and save the plug-in in the correct location on the client. InterVU
encourages content providers to include the <B>PLUGINSPAGE</B>
attribute with a value of <B>&quot;http://www.intervu.com&quot;</B>
in their HTML pages to make it easier for users to access the
InterVU Player.
</UL>

<H4>Additional optional parameters:</H4>



<B>SM=&lt;video path&gt;</B><BR>
<I>This feature is not available for the Macintosh version at this time.</I>
<UL>  
This parameter directs the Player to obtain the video file from the InterVU Network server.  The video path is the directory tree in which the video file is placed.  InterVU assigns a unique video path  to each customer.
</UL> 
<BR>
<B>PG=&lt;XYZ&gt;</B><BR>
<I>This feature is not available for the Macintosh version at this time.</I>
<UL>
This parameter is used to communicate the rating of the video. The interpretation is:
<UL>
X = The "adult" rating of the video.<BR>
Y = the "profanity" rating of the video.<BR>
Z = the "violence" rating of the video.<BR>
</UL>
Each X, Y and Z is a value from 0 to 2, where
<UL>
2 = suitable for family viewing.<BR>
1 = parental guidance advised, mature audience, equivalent to broadcast TV.<BR>
0 = extreme content, potentially very offensive.<BR>
</UL>
To enable the end user to send a recommended rating of the video back to the Web site, use the parameter NOTIFY="email address", where the email address is the full email address of the recipient of the email.
</UL>
<BR>
<B>FRAMERATE=&lt;Number&gt;</B><BR>
<UL>
You may use this attribute to decrease the frame rate for
the MPEG file being displayed. Use positive integers from 1 to
25, representing how many frames (or separate video images) are
played per second. The smaller the number you enter, the slower
the video will play. It is best to adjust the number entered in
the parameter until you get the result you would like. Please
note that sound is dependent on the file playing at its normal
rate. So if the FRAMERATE option is used, the file will play without
sound.
</UL>
<BR>
<B>LOOP=&lt;Number&gt;</B>
<UL>
If you would like the video to loop, you may use this attribute
and enter the number of times you would like it to loop. Each
time the start button is pressed, the video will play the specified
number of times.
</UL>
<BR>
<B>DOUBLESIZE=&lt;YES&gt;</B><BR>
<UL>
This attribute configures the InterVU Player
to play the video at double the encoded size. The default value
is <B>NO</B>. The <B>DOUBLESIZE</B> attribute may not be used
with <B>HALFSIZE</B> in the same <B>EMBED</B> statement. The <B>HEIGHT</B>
and <B>WIDTH</B> attribute values must be changed when this attribute
is used.
</UL>
<BR>
<B>HALFSIZE=&lt;YES&gt;</B><BR>
<UL>
This attribute configures the InterVU Player to play the video at half the encoded size. The default value
is <B>NO</B>. The <B>HALFSIZE</B> attribute may not be used with
<B>DOUBLESIZE</B> in the same <B>EMBED</B> statement. The <B>HEIGHT</B>
and <B>WIDTH</B> attribute values must be changed when this attribute
is used.
</UL>
<BR>
<B>CONBAR=&lt;NO&gt;</B>
<UL>
You may disable the &quot;controls&quot; bar of the InterVU Player with this option. When the control bar is disabled, just click on the video to start/stop the video. You will need to recalculate
the number of pixels you add to the original video size so the display area will not show space for the control bar. The control bar's height is 19 pixels, so instead of adding 29 pixels, you
will only need to add 10 pixels. The default value is <B>YES</B>.
</UL>
<BR>
<B>FRAMES=&lt;YES&gt;</B>
<UL>
This attribute is required if you are creating a Web page
with Netscape FRAMES. For viewers using a Mac, the video will
autoplay. For all other viewers, the <B>FRAMES</B> attribute will
be ignored, and the video will play according to how you set the
<B>AUTOPLAY</B> attribute (where the default is <B>NO</B>.) </UL>
<BR>
<B>PALETTE=&lt;FOREGROUND&gt;</B><BR>
<UL>
The <B>PALETTE</B> option configures how colors are displayed
when the InterVU Player is viewed on machines that are running in 256-color mode. Leaving
this to default as <B>FOREGROUND</B> allows the InterVU Player to take control of all 256-colors and obtain the best possible
image quality for displayed movies; other images embedded within
the browser window may suffer slight degradation in quality. If
<B>PALETTE</B> is set to <B>BACKGROUND</B>, then Netscape is allowed
to retain control of all 256 colors. This will result in slight
degradation in the quality of the displayed movie, and may improve
surrounding images, however results vary widely depending on image
content. This setting is ignored when the client is running in
color modes greater than 256-color. In those modes, best color
fidelity is achieved at all times regardless the of <B>PALETTE</B>
setting. 
</UL>

<H4>HTML Example:</H4>

<UL>
<B>&lt;EMBED SRC=&quot;Sample.mpg&quot;, WIDTH=174, HEIGHT=134,
CONBAR=NO, LOOP=YES&gt;</B>
</UL>
<UL>
Note: When using the <B>EMBED</B> tag, a space is required
before each attribute. An optional comma may be added to improve
readability.</UL>

<H4>What have you found frame rates to be on Pentium 100's or PowerMacs using 28.8 kbps modem links, a robust server, optimized regularly, MPEG hardware, and 160 x 120 window size?</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The video stream bandwidth requirement is the pacing item. For MPEG-1, the
&quot;normal&quot; stream size should be around 1.5 megabits per second (mbps). A 28.8 kbps will
not play a &quot;normal&quot; MPEG video very fast (1 frame per 2 seconds.)
We reduce the size of the video frame to reduce the bandwidth requirements
by approximately a factor of four. Therefore, the frame rate increases to 2 fps on a 28.8 kbps modem for a 120 x 160 image. Often times the video is compressed more to increase throughput. This increase may improve throughput by 50% to approximately 8 fps. Some display artifacts may be introduced with this level of compression. 
<BR>
<BR>The server performance is dependent on the bandwidth requirements of the video
stream. The number of users supported is heavily dependent on the bandwidth requirements described above, the type and configuration of the server, the amount of disk activity, the connection to the network, and the type and quantity of other users on the server. Depending on the bandwidth of the video stream as defined above, you may expect to support anywhere
from 5 to 50 simultaneous users of the server. 
<BR>
<BR>MPEG hardware enables the personal computer to play larger videos without system performance degradation.  The Player does not currently make use of MPEG decoding hardware. 
<BR>
<BR>
Video size a very important factor for remote playback since using a smaller
video lowers the transmission bandwidth needs. During local cached playback,
the performance of the personal computer is the limiting factor for real time decoding.

<H4>I recently downloaded the InterVU Player for Netscape 2.0+.
I made an HTML file on my hard drive and embedded a small MPEG video in
it. It worked great! But when I uploaded this page to my Web site on my
local server and viewed it in Netscape online, it didn't work. Netscape
would ask me if I wanted to use naplayer.exe. Then a dummy picture would
appear where the video should be. So I made a link on the page to download
the video. And when I click on that, a new document loads up with the video
embedded in the page! I even went to your example page and the embedded
video did not work. Does my server need any configuration?</H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>See if these comments regarding the installation help you
identify where the configuration problem lies. The server is probably not the problem. WEB servers only dish up files per the browsers request; however, your server does need to be configured such that the MIME type for MPEG files is either video/mpeg or video/x-mpeg. 
<BR>
<BR>To see if you have the InterVU Player installed correctly, here
are a few things to check. First, select &quot;Help&quot; on the Netscape
Menu Bar, then &quot;About Plug-ins&quot;. You should see &quot;video/mpeg&quot;
and &quot;video/x-mpeg&quot; listed. If these entries are not included,
then the Player was not installed correctly. 
<BR>
<BR>The InterVU Player is installed in two directories. The file Npivmpg.dll
is located in the plugin directory of Netscape and calls Ivplayer.dll and sndstrm.dll,
located in the InterVU directory, which is a subdirectory of the plugin
directory. If Npivmpg.dll can not find Ivplayer.dll or Sndstrm.dll, the program will abort.
Make sure all files are where they belong. 
<BR>
<BR>Finally, select &quot;Options&quot; from the Netscape menu bar, then
&quot;General Preferences&quot; and then the &quot;Helpers&quot; tab. If
&quot;video/mpeg&quot; is included in the list of file types, make sure
that nothing is listed under the action column for that entry. Netscape
may get &quot;confused&quot; if a helper application and a plug-in are simultaneously
installed for the same file/MIME type. 
<BR>
<BR>The way the InterVU Player, or more specifically, Netscape, &quot;knows&quot;
that a file is an MPEG video is if you name the file with either an MPG,
MPE, or MPEG extension. This extension type is what net folks call a MIME
extension. Not all extensions are &quot;approved&quot;, or official. Those
extensions which are pending MIME type approval have the prefix &quot;x-&quot;
... as in x-mpeg. Did you save your file with one of the above extensions?
<BR>
<BR>This information should help you figure out what is causing your specific
problem.
