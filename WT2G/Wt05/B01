<I>Research regarding the active ingredients of herbs seems to be a key point for the acceptance of herbal remedies in the West.  This research is very valuable.  It lends credibility to herbal remedies, and the body of scientific knowledge naturally grows to include what herbal practitioners have known for centuries.<P>

However, there is another camp of practitioners who would rather herbs remain classified and studied from the traditional perspective that classifies herbs by their functions and energetic properties, as is the case in Chinese medicine.<P>

Chinese herbs are categorized according to their functions and properties within the Chinese model of the human body.  The Qi of herbs have a certain temperature, their substantial aspect has one or more tastes associated with it.  These properties benefit us medicinally when applied to the appropriate imbalance found through traditional Chinese diagnosis.<P>

The active ingredient in Chinese herbs cannot always be accurately determined by scientific methods, practitioners of TCM understand that the active ingredient is not a chemical, but an energetic property.<P>
The following satire is a humorous description of one man's interpretation of what happens when Western science attempts to understand a Chinese herb.<P></I>
<HR>
<H2>A Rose is a Rosa Sericea Pteracantha is a Rose</H2>
In the 1950s, some researchers in India found that if you gave some rats
Centella asiatica (Brahmi or Gotu Kola) it took them longer to drown when
dropped into a big barrel of water whose sides they could not climb.  (I
would hope these researchers were Christian, Moslem or Atheists, otherwise
they've been doing Karma-Time as brine shrimp in bioassays or, if Jaina,
perhaps even worse)<P>


The Chinese added Panax and (Naturally) they started testing LOTS of their
patent medicines.<P>


Then the Russians added Eleutherococcus, Rhodiola, some Aralias and
(Naturally) they started testing everything on their athletes.<P>


Then Korean researchers started to work with THEIR Panax and THEIR patent
medicines.<P>


So did researchers in Malaysia and Thailand, reporting work on THEIR
patent medicines and traditional formulas.<P>


The dust settles.<P>


The Indians start working on THEIR Ayurvedic patents, meanwhile claiming
that Pakistan is stealing their secrets.<P>


The Chinese publish 1,473 monographs on THEIR products that stimulate
Non-Specific Resistance.  The West completely ignores the monographs
because, as usual, the Chinese refuse to use Control Groups.  The Chinese
counter that "Control Groups" are a capitalist ploy;  it costs as much to
NOT test animals as to TEST animals and the Dogs of the West and their
Kremlin Bootlickers (it is now late 1960's) are only seeking to waste the
People's Money.  Taiwan may YET be invaded, since they, too, have been
doing their OWN counter-research with Control Groups.<P>


The Russians now have ALL their athletes taking Russian Non-specific
Resistance herbal preparations, are marketing OTC versions across the
USSR...and besides, Prof.V.K.Taktishtashvilli discovered the whole thing in
1827, while working with potatoes.<P>


(In the U.S. Joe Namath had won some sporting event and in Great Britain,
the Home Secretary is STILL denying any involvement, despite the blurred
photographs making the rounds of the London tabloids, with Her Jeweled
Crista Battlebum III, a prized Yorkshire Terrier)<P>


It's 1970.  We now have a body of research, purely observational, and using
newly-developed bio-assay techniques, showing a number of plant medicines
and traditional formulas and patents (including some Deer's Horn and
plankton studies) that increase non-specific resistance and generally
increase the capacity for stress in a variety of mammals...
including us.  All work to this point has been done with WHOLE plants and
WHOLE formulas; their traditional uses were the basis for their testing,
and the various countries (and the patent owners) are now marketing these
products with new knowledge and a (perhaps) better understanding of their
value in human use.  Along the line, someone decided the effect needed a
"pharmaceutical" term and invented the word "adaptogen" and
"Non-specific-resistance-stimulant" was generally dropped. NSRS was a poor
acronym, anyway, except in Malaysia, where it also meant "Female Wild Boar in
Heat" in one widely-spoken language and was retained.<P>


Enter (bumpda-bumpda-bump) the Medical-Pharmaceutical folks.<P>


The Germans isolate 72 Panaxosides and Panaxolides, with three separate
camps claiming "Their" group can prove which individual ones are
Responsible for the Adaptogenisis. All three groups have completely
different lists of "active" compounds.<P>


The Japanese answer by isolating 473 (!) of these, but call them
Ginsenosides, and can separate their effects into their effects on liver,
pituitary, glucocorticalsteroid, reproductive, etc.<P>


The Koreans ALSO find 473, but apply different numbers to them, and claim
they can prove only THEIR Panax is the best.<P>


The Japanese (the numbers AND names for the ginsenosides have already
undergone three revisions, although one major pharmaceutical manufacturer
has created a new constituent category completely, based on presence of
ferulic acid skeletal remnants, but won't publish the specifics, since they
are now patented) claim THEIR sub-species to be the best, as well as the
phylogenetic precurser to the Korean variety.<P>


The Germans have begun work on semi-synthetic (and patentable) analogs to
certain ferulic-acid skeletal-remnant panaxosides, in a mutual agreement
with an unnamed Japanese pharmaceutical manufacturer.<P>


(Great Britain has found that Raspberries work splendidly.
The FDA is pursuing Laetrile clinics.)<P>


An adaptogen is now classed as a compound, usually plant-derived, that
increases resistance to environmental stress in laboratory animals and
humans.  In some research circles the term has been changed to a newer one:
Non-Specific Resistance Stimulants, or NSRS.<P>


The Soviets win 1,212 medals (out of a possible 1,002) in the 1972
Olympics.  The IOC promises an investigation.<P>


A body of observations meant to explain the mechanisms whereby a number of
traditional herbal medicines seem to enhance resistance to stress has now
been reduced to gnarly, secretive, heavy-metal pharmaceutical in-fighting,
in the attempt to market patentable pharmaceutical chemicals that will
produce the effects of the original plants.<P>


(There exist a few artful exaggerations in the above story)<P>
Moral of the story:  
<H4>The adaptogenic aspect IS THE HERB.</H4>

TREATING the UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS of RADIATION and
CHEMOTHERAPY with CHINESE MEDICINE

   As Chinese medicine becomes more available as a system
accessible to the general public, more and more people
suffering with cancer are coming to utilize the rejuvenating
effects of the Chinese <A HREF="HerbInd.htm">herbal</A>, <A HREF="../Acup/AcuInd.htm">acumoxa</A>, <A HREF="../Nutrition/NutInd.htm">dietary</A> and <A HREF="../QiKung/QiKunInd.htm">qigong</A>
therapies to prolong life and aid in their recovery from this
poweful illness.  Although Chinese medicine has evolved
primary treatments for the treatment of cancer, in this
country there are still legal problems with this approach,
and most western cancer patients at this time will choose to
combine biomedical treatment with alternative therapies.
Although a limited number of successes have been recorded
with biomedical treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and
radiation, time and research have shown limitations to
success, and the search for better treatments and cures
continues.  Many forms of cancer, although proven to be
unresponsive to chemotherapy, continue to be treated by this
method.  Often chemotherapy, surgery and radiation will cause
damage to healthy as well as to diseased tissues, and weaken
the immune system.  This is where Chinese medicine can be
very helpful.<P>


   The concept of "side effects" is not recognized as such in
Chinese medicine.  The toxic effects of certain medicinals is
recognized according to degree, and if it is necessary to use
a 'toxic' substance medicinally, it will be prepared in a
special manner or combined with other medicinals to reduce or
eliminate toxicity if possible.  For example, fu zi/rx.
aconiti is considered toxic, but it has a very strong
medicinal power to mobilize and rescue yang qi to the spleen
and kidney.  It is usually combined in Chinese herbal
prescriptions with sheng jiang/rx. zingiberis and gan cao/rx.
glycyrhhizae to neutralize the toxic effect.  Sometimes the
principle of du yao gong xie/use toxin to attack pathogenic
evil is used clinically; we can look at the modern use of
chemotherapy according to this principle, if not in the
degree of its clinical application in biomedicine.  In
Chinese medicine, it is considered unthinkable to damage the
host or the zheng qi/correct qi in any clinical intervention.<P>


   Chinese herbal medicine treats the use of most
chemotherapeutic agents and radiation as "heat toxins" that
damage the yin and qi.  However, such chemotherapy drugs as
cisplatin lower sperm counts (weaken jing/essence), cause
stomatitis (heart fire), diarrhea (damage to spleen qi),
hearing loss, and leukopenia.  In Chinese medical analysis,
cisplatin will kill fast-growing cells, such as mucosa and
intestinal lining as well as cancer cells, weaken kidney jing
and yang, weaken spleen yang, aggravate heart fire all at the
same time .  This shows the extreme effects of toxic
substances on the body, which can cause damage to yin, yang,
qi and blood, and cause extreme hot and cold reactions
concurrently.  In Chinese cancer hospitals, the use of
chemotherapy and radiation are often combined with the use of
herbal medicine to protect the body/mind from damage as much
as possible.  Dosages of chemotherapeutic drugs also tends to
be lower than in western countries.  In my opinion, it makes
clinical sense to use the least toxic dose possible of anti-
cancer drugs, radiation or surgery given concurrently with
herbal prescriptions to protect the body and zheng qi/correct
qi from damage. This may help relieve discomfort and
suffering to the patient, and also minimize the suppression
of immune function.  This is a realistic expectation,
considering the more lengthy goal of using Chinese herbs,
diet, qigong and acumoxatherapy more extensively in cancer
therapy in the west.. Presently, a practitioner of Chinese
medicine may be asked to do the job of a "mop-up crew",
cleaning up the side-effects of excessive drug treatment. In
filling this demand, however, we can do much good.  At the
same time, this effort should not compromise us in seeing the
shortcomings of this type of therapy.<P>


  In Chinese medicine, the optimum functioning of
spleen/stomach qi is considered critical to life.  According
to the classics, when spleen/stomach qi is damaged or in
decline, a patient's life and health are in danger.
Chemotherapy drugs often will damage the lining of the
stomach and intestines, leading to symptoms of nausea,
vomiting, loss of appetite, and a burning sensation.  The
toxins produced by cancer cells will often weaken the
spleen/stomach qi as well. Chinese adjunctive cancer therapy
includes supporting the spleen/stomach qi and its function of
digestion and assimilation.  Formulas such as shen ling bai
zhu tang/ Ginseng, Poria and Atractylodes Decoction and  liu
jun zi tang/Six Gentlemen Decoction are ideal for this
purpose, containing herbs to strengthen the  spleen/stomach
such as Ren Shen/Ginseng and Bai Zhu/Atractylodes, as well as
herbs to clear phlegm and damp such as Ban Xia/Pinellia and
Chen Pi/Citrus Peel.  These formulas could be either
supplemented or replaced by Yin tonics in cases of extreme
heat and/or dryness of the Stomach, which would be aggravated
by this formula if used alone.  However, many types of cancer
show accumulation of phlegm and damp, and Six Gentlemen
Decoction will be efficacious in these cases.<P>


   Supplementing the yin is also very important for many
patients receiving conventional cancer treatment.  the fire
and toxin created by both radiation and most chemotherapeutic
drugs, wastes the yin, leading to dry mouth, thirst, mouth
sores, constipation and scanty, dark urination.  The pulse
may be rapid and thready, the tongue red, dry and cracked.
The shen may also be disturbed by the heat buildup in the
chest. Aggressive treatment over time can often disturb the
kidney and heart/shao yin aspect, leading to insomnia,
restlessness, disorientation, sterility, lower back pain, and
palpatation. Formulas such as liu wei di huang wan/Rehmannia
Six Flavor Pill, tian wang bu xin dan/Celestial Emperor's
Heart Supplementing Pill, and zhi bai di huang
wan/Anemerrhena, Phellodendron and Rehmannia Six Flavor Pill
are very useful in these cases. When there are signs of lung
and stomach yin vacuity, including stomach pain and burning,
dry mouth, dry cough, dry skin, a peeled red tongue with
scanty yellow coat, and a thin, thready, rapid pulse, sha
shen mai dong yin/Glehnia and Ophiopogonis Cool Decoction is
a choice formula.  Finally, yi guan jian/Linking Decoction is
very useful for liver and kidney yin vacuity with liver qi
depression, a common pattern encountered with cancer
patients.<P>


   It is important to support the zheng qi/correct qi to
defend the body against the various forms of cancer, which
can only thrive in a disordered body and mind.  The weakening
of zheng qi/correct qi by stress, environmental toxins,
dietary and lifestyle indiscretions can take its toll,
allowing cancer to proliferate, and even pass on a
constitutional predisposition to the disease.  The medicinal
mushrooms are all very effective for strenghtening and
repairing body/mind intelligence and immune function. Both
xiang gu/lentinus (shitake) and ling zhi/ganorderma (reishi)
mushrooms have been shown to have strong anti-tumor effects
in recent studies, and are powerful strengthening agents to
the zheng qi .  In the Shen Nung P'en Tsao/Divine
Husbandman's Materia Medica, ling zhi is considered to be a
"superior" herb, with strong supplementing properties to all
of the yin viscera.  In recent Chinese studies, it was also
shown to be valuable in reducing the damaging effects to
blood and yin from chemotherapy.  Cordyceps/dong chong xia
cao is another medicinal fungi from the Chinese pharmacoepia
used to aid in recovery from a severe illness, and especially
strengthens immune function.<P>


   Huang qi/astragalus is one of Chinese medicine's supreme
qi supplementers, and has been shown to be the most effective
herb to restore damaged immune systems. It is presently used
routinely in oncology departments of Chinese hospitals.  In a
joint study between a Texas pharmaceutical company and a
hospital in Beijing, it was found that astragalus was most
effective when combined with nu zhen zi/ligustrum, another
yin supplementing herb for the liver and kidney, which has
been shown in modern studies to have a strong immune
strengthening effect.  Astragalus is a major component with
ren shen/ginseng (also shown to have anti-tumor and immune-
enhancement effects) in bu zhong yi qi tang/Supplement the
Middle and Augment the Qi Decoction, a major yang and qi
supplementing formula.<P>


Many of the chemotherapy anti-cancer agents were
discovered in the plant world.  Today, massive searches and
clinical trials are sponsored in the rain forests and
wilderness regions around the world for new cancer cures.  At
the present time, clinical trials and research are being
sponsored by pharmaceutical companies on Chinese herbs that
have anti-cancer properties. Vincristine and vinblastine,
taken from madadasgar periwinkle, were discovered by the
Lilly drug company during clinical trials done on so-called
"folk treatments" used in different cultures for cancer
treatment. However, it may be that the vast herbal
pharmacopia may be best utilized in the traditional method of
polypharmacy, where many ingredients are combined to reduce
and eliminate side effects while balancing all the systems of
the body.<P>


  To conclude, Chinese herbal medicine is the therapy of
choice in treating the side-effects of Western oncological
treatments, and is proven in its effectiveness.  However, we
should not ignore the tremendous potential of Chinese
medicine in the treatment of cancer as a major therapy in its
own right.<P>

Color Significance in Oriental Herbs

<BR>

Translated by <A HREF="mailto:KihyonKim@aol.com">Kihyon Kim</A><BR>
From "Oriental Medicine, A Modern Interpretation"

</TD></TR> </TABLE>

<HR>

<H1>Color</H1>

<H3>The Reason for adding Color to the Qi-Taste Theory.</H3>
	Color is observed greatly in the study of syndromes. A commonly used phrase in Oriental diagnosis is "Observing the shape and watching the color." In the study of herbal properties, however, color is not emphasized as much. Accordingly, among the herbal properties, one usually speaks of Qi and Taste, but I have felt a great need for the observation of color in the study of herbal properties. As a result of having always paid attention to the observation of color, I have found some things which will not only be referred to in the current study of herbal properties, but the observation of color will eventually become one of the most important topics in the study of herbology. Thus, I am adding color to the Qi-Taste Theory and will discuss this theory in this next section. <P>

	Even in modern chemical experiments, a great importance is put on the observation of color. Looking at phenomena in nature, the reason for colors varying in all matters is that their properties and constituents are all different. Even in the same plant, the changing of pigment in relation to the light, nutrition and seasons is due to the changes in its constituents. Accordingly, there is also a change in the properties.<P>


<H3>The Relationship between Herbal Properties and Color.</H3>

<OL>
<LI>
<H4>Yellow colored herbs and the Spleen</H4>
"Spleen controls muscles"<BR>
The following substances have been used effectively on the site of inflammation long before the invention of iodine tincture (anti-inflammatory). Even now, these substances are used as a folk medicine when iodine tincture is not available. 


<OL TYPE=a>
<LI>Rhubarb (Da Huang) is ground with vinegar and rubbed on the site of inflammation.
<LI>Ox gallstone is ground and rubbed on the site of inflammation.
<LI>Raw rehmannia root (Sheng Di Huang) is pounded and attached to the site of inflammation.
<LI>Gardenia fruit (Zhi Zi) is soaked and pounded in vinegar and attached to the site of inflammation.
<LI>Egg yolk is attached to the site of inflammation.
</OL>

	These substances all have some effects in reducing inflammation and we can discover a similarity in the color. The sites of inflammation where where the medicines were attached all become deep yellow in color so that one cannot in any way differentiate whether iodine tincture was rubbed or raw rehmannia root was attached or ox gallstone or rhubarb was rubbed. Accordingly, we can infer that there is an inseparable relationship between the property that disperses inflammation of the skin and the deep yellow color. There are more remedies aside from the above examples. Coptis, which is yellow, is used as an eyewash for the inflammation of the eye lid. Turmeric, which is also yellow, is held in the mouth for swelling and pain of the gum. Scutellaria is cooked and drunk for the swelling and pain of throat. These remedies all have a common color pigment and are used effectively for eliminating inflammation.<P>

<LI><H4>White colored herbs and the Lungs</H4>
	As a cough medicine pinellia, white atractylodes, morus bark, apricot seed, lily, ophiopogon, platycodon, glehnia, fritillary and coix are most important. All of these herbs are white colored. As discussed in the Zang-Fu chapter, the color white is related to the Lungs. Herbs that stop cough and dispel phlegm generally contain white color. So we can infer the relationship between herbal properties which act on the Lungs and the color white. 
<P>

<LI><H4>Black colored herbs and the Kidneys</H4>

<OL TYPE=a>
<LI>Cooked rehmannia (Shu Di Huang)<BR>

	"Fills the bone, produces Essence and Blood -- treats Five strains and Seven injuries in man; injury to Middle and bleeding during pregnancy, irregular menstruation and all diseases after pregnancy in woman." (Li Shi Zhen)<BR>

	"Tonifies Blood and Qi, tonifies Kidney Water and True Yin." (Yuan Su)<P>

<LI>Scrophularia (Xuan Shen)<BR>

"The King herb for the Kidney channel." (Yuan Su)<BR>

"Tonifies Kidney Qi and brightens eyes." (Ben Jing)<BR>
"Tonifies Yin, descends Fire, promote urination and eliminates Blood stagnation." (Li Shi Zhen)<P>

	<LI>Cistanche (Rou Cong Rong)<BR>
 
"Treats Five Strains and Seven Injuries, Cold and Heat pain in the male genitals, strengthens Yin and augments Vital Qi." (Ben Jing)<BR>

"Used for impotence and blood in urine in man and infertility, leukorrhea and genital pain in woman." (Da Ming)<BR>

"Patients with deficiency of the Fire in the Gate of Life can be tonified with this herb; it is a Kidney channel Blood level herb." (Wang Hao Gu)<BR>

"Supports Ministerial Fire, tonifies Essence and stimulates Yang. It can treat infertility due to Blood Deficiency in women." (Zhang Jing Yue)<P>

	<LI> Black Ink (an herbal product, not something you find in a pen)<BR>

"Stops bleeding, treats post-delivery vertigo due to Blood Deficiency, metrorrhagia and sudden blood in stool - grind with vinegar and take it." (Kai Bao)<BR>

"Promotes urination and menstruation." (Li Shi Zhen)<BR>
	Grinding and drinking black ink at the time of vomiting of blood or blood in the stool has a miraculous effect. The carbon has the power to absorb toxins, so it is also used widely for colonics. However, this is a chemical explanation. Speaking in terms of color, black ink has the color of the Water Element and the Kidney is the organ of the Water Element. Heart is the organ of the Fire Element and blood belongs to the Heart. Thus, by the basic principle of Water controlling Fire, black colored carbon can be interpreted as having the property to stop bleeding. <P>

<LI>Iron <BR>

"Its color is black and belongs to the Water Element. Its property can suppress the Wood Element, thus it is suitable for treating epilepsy." (Li Shi Zhen) <BR>

"Kidney tonics should not be stored in iron containers." (Li Shi Zhen) <P>

<LI>Magnetite <BR>

"Nourishes Kidney Qi and fills up Essence and Marrow: It can be used for all patients with deafness and dizziness due to Kidney Deficiency." (Zong Shi)<BR>

"Magnetite has black color of Water Element and enters Kidneys; that is the reason for using it to treat all conditions of the Kidneys." (Li Shi Zhen)<P>
</OL>

<LI><H4>Blue-Green colored herbs and the Liver</H4>
<OL TYPE=a>

<LI>Green tangerine peel (Qing Pi)<BR>

"Its sour taste enters the Liver. It eliminates hypochondriac pain and relieves stagnated anger. It eliminates Hernial disorders and has the function of decongesting the Liver." (Zhang Jing Yue)<BR>

"It enters Jueyin (Liver) and Shaoyang (Gall Bladder) channels and treats diseases of Liver and Gall Bladder." (Yuan Su)<BR>

"Green tangerine peel is a conductant herb for the Liver channel." (Li Dong Yuan)<P>

<LI>Sweet wormwood (Qing Hao)<BR>

"Because it received the Qi of Spring-Wood (Liver) and Shaoyang (Gall Bladder) energy, its treatment symptoms are all Shaoyang and Jueyin diseases in the Blood Level." (Li Shi Zhen)<BR>

"It treats chill and fever of malaria." (Li Shi Zhen)<BR>

"It treats the Blood Level diseases of Liver, Kidney and Triple Burner." (Zhang Jing Yue)<P>

<LI>Prunella Spike (Xia Ku Cao)<BR>
 
"It is said in the Materia Medica that prunella can best treat scrofula, disperses Knotted Qi and has the effect of tonifying the blood vessels of the Jueyin, but there is no discussion on its ability to eliminate the Cold and Heat." (Zhu Dan Xi)<BR>

"It is able to clear Liver Fire and Blood Heat. Thus, it treats red eyes, catarract and pterygium. It can suppress the Liver and improve hearing and vision." (Zhang Jing Yue)<P>

	Those enumerated here are especially notable ones; all medicines from the plants have a blue-green color to some extent.<P>

<LI>Copper (Zi Ran Tong)<BR>
 
"This is the consolidated liquid of copper. It has a sour taste and is slightly toxic and enters the Liver and Gall Bladder. Therefore, it eliminates the Wind-Phlegm through vomiting or diarrhea, brightens the eyes and eliminates Childhood Nutritional Impairment." (Li Shi Zhen)<P>

<LI>Azurite (Gong Qing) <BR>

"It has blue-green color and governs the Liver." (Han Bao Sheng)<BR>

"It treats glaucoma and deafness. It brightens the eyes, benefits the nine orifices, opens the Blood vessels, nourishes the Spirit and augments the Liver Qi." Ben Jing<P>

<LI>Scorpion (Quan Xie)<BR>

"It has a blue-green color which belongs to Wood Element and is a Liver channel herb. Thus, it treats Windstroke and all types of disorders due to Wind. It opens Wind-Phlegm obstruction, deviation of eyes and mouth, hemiplegia, difficult speech, malaria, deafness, Hernial disorders, wind boil, urticaria, Wind-Phlegm30 in infants and epileptic seizure. This too is an important herb in the treatment of Wind." (Zhang Jing Yue) <BR>

"Treats all diseases of Jueyin. It treats dizziness and convulsion due to Wind, chills and fever of malaria, tinnitus, deafness - these symptoms all belong to the category of Jueyin- Wind-Wood. Thus, Li Dong Yuan has said, "Hernial disorders and leukorrhea both belong to Wind and scorpion is an important medicine to treat Wind." (Li Shi Zhen)<BR></OL><P>

<LI><H4>Red colored herbs and the Heart</H4>

<OL TYPE=a>
<LI>Salvia (Dan Shen)<BR> 

	"It is red in color and has a bitter taste, neutral temperature and descending property. It is Yang within Yin and enters the Heart and Pericardium channels. It is a Blood Level herb for those two channels. Si Wu Tang (Four Substance Decoction)31 treats all women's diseases, whether they are before or after delivery or whether menstrual flow is excessive or deficient. These disorders can all be treated equally effectively with a decoction of salvia alone. Salvia breaks up stagnated Blood, produces new Blood, calms the fetus, facilitates the removal of a dead fetus, stops metrorrhagia and leukorrhea and regulates channels. It is very effective and is in the category of Chinese angelica, rehmannia, cnidium and peony." (Li Shi Zhen)<BR>

"It nourishes and regulates Blood, produces new Blood and moves stagnated Blood. Thus, it can calm the fetus, facilitate removal of a dead fetus and stop metrorrhagia and leukorrhea. It regulates imbalances in the channels. It is a Blood Level medicine of the Heart, Spleen, Liver and Kidney." (Zhang Jing Yue)<BR>

"It nourishes the Spirit, settles the Will, stops irritability due to pathogens in the Blood, eliminates pus, stops pain, produces new flesh and makes muscles grow." (Da Ming)<P>

<LI>Carthamus (Hong Hua)<BR>

"It breaks up stagnated Blood in large doses, but nourishes Blood in small doses." (Zhu Dan Xi)<BR>

"It enters the Heart and nourishes the Blood, assists Chinese angelica and governs new Blood. (Zhang Yuan Su) <BR>

"It has a pungent, sweet, bitter taste and warm temperature. It is a Blood Level herb of the Liver channel." (Wang Hao Gu)<BR>

"It activates Blood, moistens dryness, stops pain, dispels swelling and opens channels." (Li Shi Zhen)<P>

<LI>Rubia root (Qian Cao Gen)<BR>

"It has red color, warm temperature and slightly sour and salty tastes. It enters the Nutritive Level due to the red color, and moves stagnation due to its warm temperature. Also, it enters the Liver due to its sour taste and goes into the Blood due to its salty taste. It is a Blood Level herb of the Pericardium and Liver channels. It circulates and activates the Blood." (Li Shi Zhen)<BR>

	"It has a bitter taste, thus it is able to move stagnated Blood and it has a cool temperature, thus it is able to stop bleeding. It treats vomiting of blood and nose bleeding due to excess strain and continuous metrorrhagia. It also opens stagnation in the channels." (Zhang Jing Yue)<P>

<LI>Sappan wood (Su Mu)<BR>

"It is a Blood Level herb of the three Yin channels (Heart, Liver and Spleen). It harmonizes Blood when used in a small amount, but breaks up Blood when used in large amounts." (Li Shi Zhen) <BR>

"Indications for sappan wood include irregular menstruation in women, epigastric pain, Blood and Qi stagnation in the abdomen, distention and discomfort due to Blood stagnation after delivery. Also, it disperses carbuncle and dead Blood, it eliminates pus, stops pain and eliminates blood stagnation due to trauma." (Zhang Jing Yue)<P>
	
<LI>Cinnabar (Zhu Sha)<BR>

"It has a red color and governs Heart." (Han Bao Sheng)<BR>

"It is the main herb for the Blood Level of the Heart channel." (Wang Hao Gu)<BR>

"Its color belongs to the Fire Element. It enters the Heart and can calm the Spirit and goes into the Blood Vessels." (Zhang Jing Yue)<P>
</OL></OL><P>

	The relationship between the yellow colored herbs and the Spleen was not exemplified, but there is a definite correlation between the yellow color and the herbal properties. Han Bao Sheng has said "realgar belongs to the Earth Element. Thus, it has a yellow color and controls the Spleen." Polygonatum has a yellow color and Li Shi Zhen has said, "it received pure Qi of Wu Ji (Spleen-Earth), thus it is a superior herb for tonifying the Spleen. Earth is also the mother of all things." On the property of chicken, Li Shi Zhen said, "the yellow rooster belongs to the Earth Element so it is suitable for the Spleen and Stomach." Also, tonics generally contain a yellow color - ginseng contains a yellow color and so does licorice, astragalus and white atractylodes.<P>
 
	With the above mentioned examples, though vague, one can guess that there is a certain relationship between the color and property of an herb. As we advance this study, I firmly believe that we can make herbology even more complete. Among the above examples, there might be points that differ from practice, but the purpose of recording them here is to show proof that among the practitioners of herbology up to now, there have been many who observed the color. Among them were Li Shi Zhen, Han Bao Sheng and Zhang Jing Yue. <P>

Ginseng & 
Astragalus 
Combination (Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang)

<BR>

</Center>

<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>Ginseng and Astragalus 
	Combination (GAC)</FONT> 
	is a very commonly used formula in traditional Oriental medicine. Its
inclusion as an approved prescription in the Japanese Ministry of Health and
Welfare's health insurance scheme also attests to its efficacy.  Although it is
mainly used for fatigue and various types of prolapse, its creator, Li
Dong-Yuan, mainly designed it to treat febrile diseases.  In this
article I wish to re-examine Dong-Yuan's notes at the time he formulated GAC and
compare them with modern usage and research.

<HR>

Li Dong-Yuan lived from 1180 A.D. to 1251 - the period the Song dynasty fell to
the invading Jin (Tartars) and Yuan (Mongols).  The story goes that as the Jin
army advanced South, an epidemic (febrile disease) broke out in the walled cities, -
it is said that in one city alone between one thousand and two thousand bodies
were taken out of its 12 gates every day.<P>

In the treatment of this epidemic Dong-Yuan writes in the Nei Wai Shang Bian Huo
Lun (Clarifying Doubts about Injury from Internal and External Causes):<BLOCKQUOTE>
"...use Sweet and Cold to purge Fire, but if there is tiredness (Qi deficiency)
or injury it should be warmed, and I say again, warmth can expel strong Heat.  Bitter Cold herbs should not be used as they will purge the Stomach
Earth.  Sweet and Warm should be used to tonify the Middle and cause Yang to
rise, Sweet and Cold is used to Purge fire (not to treat fever due to
deficiency)."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The doctors of Dong-Yuan's time considered this illness to be Shang Han 
(Cold Injury), a type of infectious disease, and therefore treated their patients
with diaphoretic, emetic and laxative methods (according to Shang Han Lun
theory) to purge the pathogen from the body.  However, after this type of
treatment most patients took an acute turn for the worse and died.
Dong-Yuan reasoned that this febrile disease was not due to Shang Han or other
exogenous influences, but was due to malnutrition, fatigue, anxiety and other
endogenous causes.  In contrast to exogenous diseases like Shang Han he called
diseases that were endogenous Nei Shang (Internal Injury).
Since Shang Han diseases are the reaction of the body to an invading pathogen
and Nei Shang is an internal deficiency, Dong-Yuan goes on to say: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Exogenous diseases should be purged,  deficient Nei Shang should be tonified.
If the doctor fails to recognize the difference between these two and attempts
to purge an endogenous disease, the deficiency will become more deficient.  If
deficiency is made more deficient (by purging) or if excess is made more
excessive (by tonifying), then the doctor will kill the patient." </BLOCKQUOTE> 
To treat these types of deficiency he designed GAC.  (See Minor Cinnamon &
Paeonia, Steve Clavey, for more about Qi deficient fever.)

<HR>

<H3>Indications and Pathology In modern TCM</H3>
GAC has three main uses: 
<UL>
<LI>Collapse of Central Qi, Pure Yang Failing to Rise 
<LI>Spleen Not Governing Blood 
<LI>Qi Deficient Fever
</UL>
<P>

The first usage, collapse of central Qi, is a condition which arises from
chronic Spleen Qi deficiency where there is a lack of tone of the skeletal and
smooth muscles, and supportive tissue.  This in turn leads to gastric atony,
floating kidney, hernia, rectal prolapse, uterine prolapse and other forms of
prolapse.  Constipation may also occur due to loss of tone of the intestinal
smooth muscles or, contrarily, diarrhea may occur due to a lack of fluid
absorption.  Loss of tone of the muscles of the urinary bladder may also cause
trouble initiating urination.  Muscular contraction, therefore, does not occur
until a large volume of urine has accumulated.  Urinary incontinence in the
elderly, infants, postoperative and postpartum patients can also occur due to
atonicity of the sphincter muscles.<P>

Pure Yang failing to rise is a condition characterized by dull headaches,
dizziness upon standing, vague consciousness, sleepiness, fatigue and weak
extremities.  Although not necessarily part of this condition, many of these
patients tend to have hypotension with especially low diastolic pressure.  This
is accompanied by reduced CNS excitement and loss of tone of the sweat glands,
so the patient may sweat very easily (even upon only mild exertion).
Spleen not governing Blood is characterized by persistent but scanty,
intermittent haemorrhaging.  This usually occurs in the lower body or
subcutaneously.  It is thought that this is due to loss of tone of the blood
vessel walls or thrombocytopenia and may be compounded by reduced digestive
function leading to an insufficient supply of protein and thus coagulants.
The third usage, Qi deficient fever, was the  disorder which Dong-Yuan was
addressing when designing GAC.  This type of fever may accompany an exogenous
febrile disease, as was most likely the case in Dong-Yuan's time, or may be only
due to general deficiency.  In either case, however, the patient usually suffers
from both mental and physical fatigue which may be accompanied by dull
headaches, chills and 
sweating.  The fever itself is low-grade and may only be subjective.  In cases
where the condition has come about due to an external pathogen, the patient is
usually in the recovery stage from influenza or other similar illnesses but does
not quite have the vitality to fully recover.  Modern research has not yet been
able to shed much light on the mechanism of this type of fever, but it is
thought that a generally weakened metabolism and bodily functions with autonomic
nervous system disorders, may cause an imbalance in the body's thermostat.
Habitual hyperthermia, a constitutional propensity to higher body temperature,
may also be a factor.

<HR>


<H3>Formula Ingredients</H3> 
Astragalus tonifies Qi, helps Yang to rise and consolidates the Surface (skin),
it stimulates the central nervous system, has cardiotonic and sex hormone-like
actions, it strengthens muscle tone and promotes general metabolism.  It has
been found that in small quantities Astragalus raises blood pressure, but that
in large quantities (over 30g/day) it lowers it. This, perhaps, partially
justifies its use pharmacologically in Bu Yang Huan Wu Tang, a
formula used for apoplexy which contains between 30g and 100g of Astragalus!
Ginseng stimulates the CNS, increases digestive absorption and strengthens
general bodily functions.  Atractylodes promotes the absorption of fluid from
the digestive tract thus stimulating diuresis.  Licorice strengthens general
bodily functions and works with Astragalus to increase its efficacy.  Ginseng,
Astragalus and Atractylodes promote protein synthesis, and with Dang Gui also
promote macrophage phagocytosis and antibody production.
Bupleurum and Cimicifuga, when used in small quantities with Astragalus, help Qi
to rise and strengthen muscle tone*.  Dang Gui tonifies Blood and aids the
action of the other herbs through nourishing the body and promoting circulation,
it also prevents the parching herbs from over drying.
<P>


*Note that in larger quantities, Bupleurum and Cimicifuga are mainly used for
their anti-inflammatory and antipyretic actions (Heat clearing).  Their use in
this context, however, is to aid the rising qualities of Astragalus.   It has
been reported that, experimentally, although a marked increase in muscle tone
was reported when  Astragalus, Bupleurum and Cimicifuga were used in
combination; the action of only Bupleurum and Cimicifuga together was found to
be quite weak. <P>


Citrus (chen pi) and Ginger (sheng jiang )increase peristalsis and
the secretion of stomach juices, aiding the absorption of the other ingredients,
while Jujube harmonizes the ingredients and promotes digestion.

<HR>


<H3>Formulation In modern TCM theory</H3> 
GAC is considered to be a variation of Four Major Herb Combination (Si Jun Zi
Tang), and although this is true from the point of view of GAC being a
Qi tonic, historically Dong-Yuan based his formula on Minor Bupleurum
Combination (xiao chai hu tang), a prescription from the Shang Han
Lun used to treat Shao Yang Bing.  He removed the Scute (huang qin) and Pinellia (ban xia) from MBC and then added Astragalus (huang qi), Cimicifuga (sheng ma), Atractylodes (bai zhu), Dang Gui and Citrus (chen pi).<P>

As mentioned before, since Dong-Yuan reasoned that sweet-warming herbs should be
used for Qi deficient conditions, he removed the pungent-warming Pinellia and
bitter-cooling Scute.  Scute is mainly used to clear excess Heat in MBC.  Since
the fever due to Nei Shang is due to deficiency, the inclusion of Scute would be
inappropriate.  The inclusion of Pinellia is also not necessary in GAC, as its
anti-emetic, antitussive and expectorant actions are mainly used for Phlegm-Damp
accumulation.  Its parching effects may also be too strong for deficient
conditions - especially when combined with the other herbs in GAC.<P>

An elegant variation of GAC also designed by Dong-Yuan is Tiao Zhong Yi Qi Tang
(Regulate the Middle and Invigorate Qi Decoction).  This is for
Collapse of central Qi accompanied by a heavy body sensation, loose to watery
stools, abdominal distention, sticky sensation in the mouth and other middle
Jiao Damp symptoms.   From GAC, he took Atractylodes macrocephala (Bai Zhu)
and replaced it with Atractylodes lancea (Cang Zhu) for its stronger Damp
expelling properties, removed Dang Gui because of its "sticky" nature,
and added Saussurea (mu xiang) to move Qi.  The addition of Saussurea, Coix
(yi ren), Atractylodes lancea and/or Hoelen (fu ling) to GAC would
also achieve similar results.
Dong-Yuan is primarily known as being the founder of the Earth Tonifying school
and therefore focused much attention on the tonification of Spleen Qi. The Pi
Wei Lun (Treatise on the Spleen and Stomach) explains his Spleen
tonification theories and treatment, while the Nei Wai Shang Bian Huo Lun is a
treatise on the differentiation and treatment of exogenous and endogenous
diseases.
Although fever due to a deficiency of Yin was a well recognized pattern before
Dong-Yuan's time (Anemarrhena Phellodendron & Rehmannia Formula, [qi ju di huang
wan] being an example of a formula used to treat this condition),
this type of Qi or Yang-Qi deficient fever was not really fully understood.
Even now, very few texts even mention this relatively common clinical
phenomenon.  That Dong-Yuan was able to recognize and formulate a treatment
method for this condition says much about the depth of knowledge and innovative
character of this man.

<HR>


<H3>Pharmacology</H3>
<EM>Protection against Chemotherapy</EM><BR>
GAC shows protective effects on the kidney and bone marrow in patients being
treated with chemotherapy. When used in high doses (up to three times normal
dose) pre and post chemotherapy, serum markers like BUN, serum creatinine were
decreased relative to controls, and white blood cells and platelets were
maintained significantly [1]. Adverse toxic effects induced by antitubercular
medication (rifampicin, streptomycin and isoniazid), including fever, hepatic
dysfunction, agranulocytosis and systemic eruption were significantly moderated
in a 58 year old patient. Adjuvent therapy with GAC and Minor Bupleurum
Combination (xiao chai hu tang ) suppressed the hepatodermatological
toxicosis moderately and the high fever completely [2].<P>


<EM>Stress Regulating Action</EM> <BR>
GAC has a regulatory effect on the adrenal cortex and autonomic nervous
function. Studies from Japan on patients with non ulcer dyspepsia and
psychovegetative syndrome demonstrated that when serum cortisol was high,
administration of GAC decreased it, and when low  and normal increased it. This
modulatory effect is thought to be mediated by ACTH secretion [3].<P>


<EM>Effect on Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (OSAS)</EM><BR>
GAC has been used with some success on patients with OSAS. This disorder is
characterised by recurrent obstruction of the upper airway leading to hypoxia
and frequent arousal from sleep. Patients often present with daytime sleepiness,
obesity, snoring, digestive system dysfunction, loss of appetite, impotence,
weakness and poor muscle tone.  These symptoms are consistent with the TCM
diagnosis "Spleen failing to hold muscular structures in place" for which GAC
is the indicated formula. The probable mechanism of OSAS is weakening of the
structures which support the epiglottis with consequent airways blockage. This
formula has been found to be effective in Japan [4] and by the author.<P>


<EM>Effect on Immunity</EM><BR>
In clinical tests with 35 patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis,
Sjoegren's syndrome or bacterial infections, administration of GAC was shown to
significantly increase natural killer cell (NK) activity. Eight of the patients
had an improvement in clinical symptoms and it was noted that these patients
also had the greatest rise in NK activity. Interestingly, it was found that
patients who already had a high NK activity before administration of GAC,
demonstrated a slight decrease in NK activity. <P>

These results were also supported with in vitro research. Human peripheral blood
lymphocytes cultured with GAC demonstrated an augmentation of NK activity.
However, NK activity in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with high activity
prior to treatment was suppressed by GAC. The authors suggest that GAC has a
biphasic (regulatory) action on human NK activity both in vivo and in vitro [5].
Oral and intraperitoneally administered GAC has been shown to enhance the
phagocytic activity of peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) in mice as well as
stimulating the phagocytosis of spleen cells and bone marrow cells [6].<P>


<EM>Effect on Male Fertility</EM><BR>
GAC can be used to treat male infertility. In order to demonstrate this
pharmacologically, GAC was used on cultured hamster epididymal cells. A
significant increase in 3H-leucine uptake was observed in the treated group
suggesting that GAC has a stimulative effect on epididymal function [7].
Experiments with mice have also shown that in mice treated with adriamycin
(ADR), GAC significantly inhibited a decrease of testis weight compared to mice
treated only with ADR. The GAC treated group had a decrease of seminiferous
tubules without germ cells, however at the same time there was a significant
increase in the proportion of normal seminiferous tubules and the Sertoli cell
ratio of spermatocytes as compared with the ADR-treated group[8].

Minor Cinnamon & Peonia Combination (Xiao Jian Zhong Tang)

<BR>
</FONT>

by Steve Clavey

</TD></TR> </TABLE>

</Center>


<H3>Formula Constituents</H3>
Gui Zhi (cinnamon twigs) and Sheng Jiang  (raw ginger slices) are both Pungent,
Warm and diaphoretic: Zhi Gan Cao (licorice root prepared with honey), Da Hong
Zao (big red dates), and malt sugar (yi tang) are Sweet, Warm, and tonify the
Spleen. Bai Shao (Peony) is slightly Cold, Sour, nourishing to Liver Blood, and
analgesic.<P>


This formula is obviously Gui Zhi Tang (Cinnamon Combination) with increased Bai
Shao, plus malt sugar. One ancient commentator (Wang Ang) stresses the
importance of the malt sugar by noting:
<BLOCKQUOTE>The malt sugar is actually the sovereign herb in this formula, as is shown by
the fact that it is not called "Gui Zhi Shao Yao", but Jian Zhong (meaning
"strengthening the centre"). But these days when people use Xiao Jian Zhong
Tang, they never use malt sugar, and thereby miss Zhong Jing's point.  1</BLOCKQUOTE><P>


The formula contains warm natured herbs to expel Cold, Sweet herbs to calm
acuteness, and Pungent herbs to open Qi flow. The malt sugar, as we have seen
above, is the main constituent, and is used to tonify Spleen Qi. Used with warm
pungent herbs like Gui Zhi and Sheng Jiang, the sweet and pungent flavors
combine to form Yang, promoting Yang's rising, warming, and moving qualities.
The malt sugar, Da Zao, and Gan Cao, with the increased Bai Shao, combine as
sour and sweet flavors to form Yin, increasing Yin's contracting, quiet nature.
This harmonizes Yin and Yang. Zhang Zhong Jing warns, however, that this formula
should not be used if there is vomiting, as it is too sweet.<HR>



<H3>Formula Indications</H3>
Palpitations, anxiety, abdominal pain, tiredness, white moist tongue coat, pulse
choppy and wiry, or weak and languid.
Auxiliary indications include restless Heat in the hands and feet, dry throat
and mouth, nosebleeds, aching limbs, spermatorrhoea, and urgency to move the
bowels. (These symptoms are from the Jin Gui Yao Lue).<HR>


<H3>Pathology </H3>
The disease mechanism here is Spleen Yang deficiency, leading to abdominal pain,
or to Yin-Fire flaring up. The basis of Xiao Jian Zhong Tang syndrome is a
constitutional Spleen Yang deficiency, or a Yang deficiency brought about by
illness. Throughout the ages, however, commentators have expressed different
opinions, some saying the symptoms are due to "Spleen and Heart deficiency",
others that they are from "Spleen deficiency overcome by Liver", while yet
others explained them as a result of "Qi and Blood xu". All of these syndromes
can result from Spleen deficiency, and in fact all commentators are unanimous in
recognizing the Spleen Yang deficiency. So we would be justified in attributing
the symptoms characteristic of Xiao Jian Zhong Tang to a generalized deficiency
of Yin and Yang, Qi and Blood, but with Spleen Yang deficiency the most
outstanding and obvious.<P>

If, in the middle Jiao, Yin is greater than Yang, then Yin's congealing,
quiescent nature has the tendency to occlude the flow of Qi and Blood, producing
symptoms like abdominal pain and a choppy wiry pulse. Weak Yang has insufficient
rising, warmth, and movement, leading to tiredness, shortness of breath, and
weak pulse.<P>

On the other hand, when Spleen Qi and Yang become seriously deficient, Yin and
Yang will be thrown out of harmony, leading to deficient Fire. This "deficient
Fire" is not the Yin-deficient Fire that results from lack of body fluids, but a
low-grade fever resulting from Qi or Yang deficiency, and producing the symptoms
listed in the Jin Gui Yao Lue. The mechanism works like this:- Normally Qi
should reach the upper Jiao from the middle Jiao and then circulate throughout
the body and limbs. Ministerial "Yin" Fire should be smouldering in the Kidneys,
warming the various Qi-transformation processes necessary for proper Kidney
function.<P>

But when the Qi of the middle Jiao is deficient, it may drop, and with it Damp
may pour down into the lower Jiao, causing blockage and forcing the Yin-Fire to
rush up and occupy the original place of the Qi in the middle Jiao. 
This is why Li Dong-Yuan calls this type of Fire "the thief of Yuan Qi", saying
"Qi and Fire cannot both occupy the same place".  2 <P>

It is a matter of Yin and Yang shifting places; of disturbance in ascending and
descending functions. It could also be described, in simplified fashion, in
terms of Water rebelling back into Earth, which normally should itself control
Water, in the Wu Xing Sheng cycle.<P>

Symptoms of this type of Qi or Yang-deficient Fire will be fever, spontaneous
sweating, desire for warm drinks, tiredness, shortness of breath, pale tongue,
and weak enlarged pulse, as well as the "dry throat and mouth, restless hands
and feet, spermatorrhoea", and so on described in the Jin Gui Yao Lue.
Li Dong-Yuan, in the Pi Wei Lun, is credited with the most complete and
influential description of this phenomenon, and the formula he designed to deal
with the problem  "Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang (Ginseng and Astragalus Combination) is
still widely used today. But his theory and treatment were in turn originally
based on Zhang Zhong Jings' Xiao Jian Zhong Tang. The idea is to warm and
nourish Spleen Yang, encouraging it to rise, so that Damp no longer descends
into the lower Jiao. When the lower Jiao is opened and unblocked by Damp, the
Yin Fire will return to its place of concealment in the lower Jiao, thus
eliminating the fever. If the fever is mistaken for Yin-deficient Xu-Fire,
however, the Sweet Cold moistening Yin-tonic herbs, which are very rich and
greasy, are used to build up the Yin, this will of course further increase
Spleen Damp and weaken Spleen Yang, and make the problem worse.  3<HR>



<H3>Locus Classicus</H3>
In the Shang Han Lun it states:
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Two or three days after an invasion by Cold, if there are palpitations and an
anxious feeling in the chest, Xiao Jian Zhong Tang should be used. (Clause 102)
There is no mention here of previous treatment by sweating or purging, which
means that the surface condition is still present. Palpitations without having
undergone sweating or purging means that the Zheng Qi is weak; an anxious
feeling in the chest shows disturbance by the pathogen. Together they suggest
that the Zheng Qi is weak and the pathogen is indicating a tendency to go
internal. Xiao Jian Zhong Tang is used to support Zheng Qi and clear the
pathogen from the surface."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

The Shang Han Lun also states:
<BLOCKQUOTE>"After a Cold invasion, when the Yang pulse is choppy, and the Yin pulse is
wiry, this shows that there is acute pain in the abdomen. First use Xiao Jian
Zhong Tang; then if the problem is not completely cleared up, use Xiao Chai Hu
Tang". </BLOCKQUOTE>
This indicates a treatment method for abdominal pain from Spleen Yang
deficiency, using first Xiao Jian Zhong Tang, then, if necessary, Xiao Chai Hu
Tang. While there is controversy about the exact meaning of "Yang pulse" and
"Yin pulse" (Yang being either "superficial" or "the cun position"; Yin being
either "deep" or "the chi position"), it is clear that in acute abdominal pain
both a wiry pulse and a choppy pulse will be present. Wiry, straight, thin,
long, and strong, shows severe pain; choppy, thready, slow, short, irrhythmic,
and rough shows impeded Qi and Blood circulation. Together, they show a
stagnation of Qi and Blood leading to acute pain. If the Yin pulse is taken to
mean "the chi position" then the pulse is also indicating the location of the
pain: the lower abdomen. The choppy pulse would be demonstrating the situation
in the rest of the body: blockage of Qi and Blood circulation, which had only
reached crisis point in the lower abdomen. The interesting method of first using
Xiao Jian Zhong Tang, and then Xiao Chai Hu Tang is commented upon by Ke Qin:
"Pain in the abdomen is always a (potentially) dangerous symptom. One dose of
Xiao Jian Zhong Tang may not be successful. Planning for the event, Xiao Chai Hu
Tang should be used to lead the pathogen into Shao Yang and provide a route of
escape (i.e. out of Yin and into Yang). This is what is meant in the saying:
When (it) comes out of Yin into Yang, it means a cure".
Ke Qin goes on to stress, though, that the use of Xiao Chai Hu Tang is only
necessary if the abdominal pain is not relieved with Xiao Jian Zhong Tang.  4

with quoting Li Dong Yuan's "Qi and Fire cannot both occupy the same place". In
English, the phenomenon is never discussed at all, as far as I know, except for
brief listings in tables of symptom differentiation, (under fever), with no
explanation. This in spite of the fact that Qi deficient fever is quite common
clinically. The detailed explanation found above comes from Zhong Yi Ti Jie

RHUBARB (Da Huang ) Rheum palmatum

<BR>
</FONT>

by Will Maclean and Peter Townsend

</TD></TR> </TABLE>

</Center>

<HR>

Rhubarb (RH) is the dry root and root stock of 
	Rheum palmatum L., Rheum tanguticum 
	Maxim. ex Balf. or Rheum officinale Baill. of the family Polygonaceae.
The most commonly used species is R. palmatum. 
Rhubarb root is one of the  oldest and best known Chinese herbal medicines,
first appearing in the Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica (Shen
Nong Ben Cao Jing) of the latter Han dynasty. <HR>


<H3>Indications</H3>
Rhubarb is used as a laxative, antiphlogistic, and haemostatic in the treatment
of constipation, diarrhoea, jaundice, gastro-intestinal haemorrhage, menstrual
disorders,  conjunctivitis, traumatic injuries,  superficial suppurative sores
and ulcers. It is also applied externally for thermal burns.
In TCM terms it Drains Heat and accumulations from the Yangming level, Clears
Damp Heat, Cools the Blood, Invigorates Blood, eliminates Stagnant Blood and
Clears Toxic Heat and purges knotted Heat and stool from the colon.
Concepts in purgation
In order to understand the use of purges in TCM it is important to understand
the concepts and principles of purgation as applied in herbal practice. The 3
main types of purging are as follows:<P>
<OL>

<LI> Cold purge (heat clearing): for symptoms such as constipation due to
inflammation and paralysis of the colon - i.e. knotted Heat.
<LI> Warm purge (inner warming): for acute circulatory disturbance of the
digestive tract due to consumption of cold food and drink, and cold environment
- i.e. cold accumulation or Yang deficient constipation.
<LI> Moistening purge (moisten dry intestine): for constipation due to dehydration
or poor nutrition resulting in dryness of the intestine (insufficient colonic
membrane secretions) - i.e. dry intestine constipation.
<LI> Water expulsion: for hydrothorax, ascites, oedema. </OL><P>


The following formulas are included in this category:<UL>
<LI>Minor Rhubarb Combination (cold purge)
		(xiao cheng qi tang)
<LI>Major Rhubarb Combination (add Mirabilitum to Minor Rhubarb
Combination)
		(da cheng qi tang)
<LI>Coptis & Rhubarb Combination (cold purge)
		(san huang xie xin tang)
<LI>Persica & Rhubarb Combination (cold purge)
		(tao he cheng qi tang)
<LI>Cimicifuga Combination (cold purge - mild)
		(yi zi tang)
<LI>Apricot Seed & Linum Formula (moistening purge, ma zi ren wan)    	
	Wen Pi Tang (warm purge)</UL><HR>


<H3>Cautions for Using Purges</H3>

<OL><LI> As purging formulas (especially cold purge and water expelling formulas) can cause digestive disorders, they should only be used for as long as it takes to  achieve the desired action.
 
<LI> Purges should not be used during pregnancy as they may cause spontaneous
  abortion.
 
<LI> If there is a surface condition with mild interior excess, first resolve the
  surface then purge if necessary. If both surface and interior symptoms are of
  the same severity resolve the surface and purge the interior simultaneously.
 
<LI> As purges are mainly used to expel interior excess, if there are also
  deficiencies present, tonics should be added.
 
<LI> As many cases of constipation are simply due to lack of exercise and
  improper diet, these factors should always be considered before using purging
  formulas.
</OL>

<HR>


<H3>A Note on Purging</H3>
When purging is referred to, most of us will equate it to treatment with
laxatives in the normal western sense of the word. However, in TCM purging is
not simply used to move stool out of the bowels. Following is a summary of the
type of conditions for which purging methods are designed:<P>


<H4>1) Anti-inflammatory</H4>
The Cheng Qi Tang formulas (Minor Rhubarb Combination [xiao cheng qi tang],
Persica & Rhubarb Combination [tao he cheng qi tang] ) etc., were not originally
designed for treating constipation. Their original application was in febrile
diseases where symptoms of high fever, delirium and convulsions occurred. The
purging action was used to reduce inflammation. Other formulas, such as Major
Bupleurum Combination (da chai hu tang), are useful in treating cholecystitis,
gastroenteritis and gastric/duodenal ulcers. Rhubarb has been found to have an
inhibitory action on anaerobic bacteria, candida albicans and several other
pathogenic microorganisms (see pharmacology). The effect of Rhubarb on anaerobic
bacteria is significant in the treatment of cholecystitis and inflammatory
conditions of the bile duct as it has been found that these bacteria are the
main aggravating factor in these conditions - especially if  accompanied with
constipation. 

<H4>2) Expel toxic substances from the body</H4>
Toxic substances in the colon are expelled by purging. It is also thought
metabolised blood  from internal haemorrhaging, bruising and inflammation, may
become "toxic" (as a result of haemoglobin metabolite overload), and have an
adverse effect on the organism, giving rise to "Blood stagnation".  In these
cases Blood moving and purging herbs are used together to expel the stagnant
blood. The purging method has also been known to be effective for certain types
of neuralgia and is widely employed following traumatic injury. Formulas such as
Persica & Rhubarb Combination (tao he cheng qi tang) are very useful in the
acute stages of haematoma, contusions, sprains etc.

<H4>3) Haemostatic</H4>
Purging formulas are especially effective for upper body haemorrhage. As well as
epistaxis, haemoptysis and bleeding of the gums, they have also been shown to be
effective for cerebrovascular accident. Many contemporary Chinese doctors use RH
formulas, particularly Major Rhubarb Combination (da chai  hu tang), in order to
swiftly eliminate the accumulated Heat and Phlegm via the "big exit". There is
clinical evidence from a number of large scale studies that this method of
removing phlegm by enforcing the downward movement of the digestive channels is
effective on a large percentage of acute stroke patients [34].

<H4>4) Cathartic</H4>
Since Rhubarb can also cause constipation if used on its own over a long period
of time, it is often used with Mirabilitum. Licorice is also added to prevent
cramps and protect the Spleen.
In cases of "dry" constipation, such as seen in infants, the elderly and
postpartum conditions, herbs which contain oily substances such as Linum (huo ma
ren), Dang Gui, Apricot Seed (xing ren) and Persica (tao ren) are used with
cathartic agents e.g. Apricot Seed & Linum Formula (ma zi ren wan).

<H4>5) Expel Fluids</H4>
Certain herbs in this category have a very powerful cathartic effect, that is
they cause massive evacuation of fluids and water from body cavities and the
intestines in conditions such  as hydrothorax, ascites, pulmonary oedema etc.
These herbs have very severe actions and many are toxic, therefore extreme
caution should be exercised when using them.<HR>


<H3>Main Constituents</H3>
The main constituents of RH are a series of Anthraquinone derivatives: emodin,
rhein, aloe-emodin, chrysophanol, physcion, alizarin, citreorosein,  etc. 
Dianthrones: sennoside A~F, sennidin A, palmidin A-C, rheidin A-C etc.
Other Glycosides:  stilbene, naphthalene, chromones, phenylbutanone etc.
Tannins: lindleyin, rhatannin, catechin, epicatechin, gallic acid, cinnamic acid
etc.<HR>



<H3>Pharmacology</H3>
<H4>Antibacterial & Antiviral action</H4>
The anthraquinones, aloe emodin, emodin and rhein were found to inhibit in vitro
growth of Bacillus subtilis and  Staphylococcus aureus, with rhein being the
most effective [1]. Antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Micrococcus
luteus, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Fusobacterium varium and
Bacteriodes fragilis was also noted [2, 3]. The antibacterial activity appears
to be the result of mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibition. Rhein, emodin
and aloe emodin specifically interfere with NADH dehydrogenase. The water
extract  has been found to have an action against Herpes [33] and Influenza
virus [34].<P>


<H4>Haemostatic effect</H4>
Significant haemostatic effect has been demonstrated in Rheum spp, both
experimentally and clinically. RH has been found effective in treatment and
prevention of experimental gastric bleeding and ulcer formation in rats [4], and
in clinical gastro-intestinal bleeding [5, 6, 7]. RH shortened coagulation time,
reduced capillary permeability, and improved capillary fragility. It also
promoted platelet formation by the bone marrow and induced proliferation of
blood capillaries [8, 9]. <P>


<H4>Antineoplastic effect</H4>
Emodin was found to be a strong inhibitor of respiration in Ehrlich ascites
carcinoma cells [10]. This was also observed in leukaemia L1210 cells [11].
Emodin strongly inhibited the oxidation and dehydrogenation of some amino acids
and intermediate metabolites of glucose in Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells. At
50mg/ml emodin inhibited the oxidation and dehydrogenation of lactic acid in
these cells by 87 & 91% respectively. It was further reported that the
anthraquinone derivatives rhein, emodin and aloe emodin had an in vivo
inhibitory effect against P388 leukaemia in mice. Their survival time was
markedly increased and the ascites volume and tumour cell number were decreased
[12]. In general, it is thought that the antineoplastic activity of RH is mainly
due to the inhibition of oxidation and dehydrogenation of the cancer cells [13].

<H4>Purgative action</H4>
The purgative activity of RH appears to be due to rhein and the sennoside
components [14]. Sennoside content correlated highly with laxative activity,
whereas the correlation between anthraquinone content and laxative activity was
low [15]. Studies on the oxidised products of sennosides suggest that the
sennosides act predominantly on large intestine motility after their degradation
by colonic microorganisms [16]. The mechanism appears to be hydrolysis of
sennosides by microbial b-glycosidase in a stepwise fashion to sennidins A & B,
which are then reduced to rheinanthrone, the laxative principle [17, 18]. The
active principles of RH  seem to act by stimulating Auerbach's plexus or the
submucosal nerve plexus [19]. Other investigators found that RH increased the
water content of the large intestine, producing a watery stool [20].
Interestingly, small doses of RH (0.05-0.3g/kg) in some patients can be used to
treat diarrhoea or may increase constipation. At these dosage levels, it is
thought that the effect of the tannins in binding stool overcomes the laxative
effect. It may also be due to the differences in gut flora and consequent
metabolites. Certain species contain more tannins than others, for example R.
palmatum contains about 11% tannin, whereas other species range from 4-7%.

<H4>Psychotropic action</H4>
Rhubarb has a suppressive action on rat ultromotivity. The ultromotive stimulant
action of methamphetamine was markedly reduced. Irritability and aggressiveness
induced in rats was markedly suppressed by the administration of RH, and,
although rather mild, conditioned evasive response was also suppressed. Also,
stereotypical behaviour and circling movement induced by apomorphine was
suppressed [21].

<H4>Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) reducing action</H4>
Recent work in China and Japan has demonstrated that oral or rectal
administration of RH is useful in reducing Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) in patients
with chronic renal failure, and may prevent or delay progression to end stage
uraemic syndrome. Clinical trials found that progression to renal failure was
retarded and uraemic symptoms of nausea and anorexia were significantly reduced
[22, 23]. The active principles involved in this effect appear to be the tannin
fraction [24].<P>

A common method of delivery today is via enema, usually conducted once or twice
per week. This method supplements dialysis in areas with inadequate facilities,
and enables a reduction in the need for dialysis in some patients. It is thought
the surface area of the large intestine enables enough osmotic transfer of BUN
from the blood to the intestinal lumen to significantly reduce the load on the
kidney [25]. Oral administration has also been utilised successfully, using such
formulas as Wen Pi Tang, which includes between 4 and 12 grams of RH.

<H4>Anti-inflammatory and Antipyretic action</H4>
Lindleyin, one of the tannin fractions of rhubarb, has about the same
anti-inflammatory action as aspirin and phenylbutazone and suppresses early
stage inflammation [26-28]. It also has a peripheral analgesic action which is
comparable with aspirin and phenylbutazone; its effect on joint inflammati      	milar to aspirin [29]. Also, the bound tannins have a free radical scavenging
action [30]. Rabbits with fever induced by subcutaneous inoculation of
pneumococci responded with decreased body temperature after oral administration
of RH [31].<HR>


<H3>Sample clinical studies</H3>
<H4>Endometriosis</H4>
	Seventy six women with endometriosis of the "Blood Stasis with lower
abdominal masses" type were treated in Long Hua Hospital, Shanghai, with a
prescription featuring rhubarb as the chief ingredient. Total effectiveness rate
was 80.26%, with reduction in dysmenorrhoea in 88.89%, pelvic pain 66.72%,
dysparenuria 72.12%, reduction in mass size 22.15%; three cases of twenty two
infertile women fell pregnant (13.63%). The results support the idea that
rhubarb can eliminate Blood Stasis and invigorate the circulation of Blood. 
Other common rhubarb based combinations used for the treatment of endometriosis
include Persica and Rhubarb Combination (tao he cheng qi tang) and Nei Yi Wan,
composed of rhubarb, amber (hu po) and tortoise shell (bie jia).<P>


<H4>Hypertension during pregnancy</H4>
Shanghai Medical University conducted a double blind study with processed
rhubarb (low dose of 0.75g/day) in pregnant women at risk of pregnancy induced
hypertension (PIH). Rhubarb (140 cases) and placebo (125 cases) was given to
women at risk of PIH consecutively from the 28th week of gestation to delivery,
with another 68 pregnant women as control. In the treated group, 5.7% of the
women developed PIH, whereas in the untreated group 20.8% developed PIH. This
result was statistically significant (P<0.01). The mechanism of this apparent
protection may be related to the inhibition of Plasminogen activator inhibitor
(PAI), plasma Fibronectin (Fn), and decreased damage to the vascular endothelium
[38] .  Interestingly, the tannin components of  Rh have also been found to have ACE
inhibiting actions [39].<P>

<H4>Acute inflammatory diseases</H4>
RH has Heat clearing, antipyretic and purgative action and as such is much
employed in compound prescriptions like Persica & Rhubarb Combination (tao he
cheng qi tang), Major Rhubarb Combination (da cheng qi tang), Coptis and Rhubarb
Combination (san huang xie xin tang), Major Bupleurum Combination (da chai hu
tang) etc., for acute inflammatory diseases characterised by fever,
constipation, abdominal distension, thirst and general malaise. Rhubarb
prescriptions have been found effective in such biomedically defined disorders
as acute appendicitis, acute pancreatitis, acute cholecystitis, and other acute abdominal infections [35, 36].<P>


<H4>Pharmacokinetics and Toxicity</H4>
RH is readily absorbed after ingestion. The serum drug concentration peaks after
two hours, and when used for purgation, the bowels generally move after 6 - 8
hours. Habituation may be a problem in some patients with long term use for
constipation, and thus RH generally should be phased out and other appropriate
therapeutic measures instituted or other herbs which address the "root" of the
problem added to the formula.<P>

Generally, RH is low in toxicity, but intoxication could result from overdosage,
especially of the fresh herb. Toxic symptoms include nausea, vomiting,
dizziness, abdominal colic and jaundice. Long term use of the anthraquinone
cathartics could lead to liver cirrhosis and hypokalaemia [32].  <HR>


<H3>Use in Combination</H3>
<H4>Rhubarb and Mirabilitum (mang xiao)</H4>
The Bitter & Cold characteristics of Rhubarb aid in the dispersal of Heat and
the removal of stagnant Damp-heat. Mirabilitum (mang xiao) is salty and cold, it
moistens dryness and softens hardness. These two substances work synergistically
to resolve stagnation and accumulation of the intestines and stomach as well as
disperse Heat. They are most commonly used together in the treatment of Heat
accumulation type constipation, resulting from knotted dryness of the stomach
and intestines, or  febrile diseases due to a knotted pathogen resulting in Yang
Ming type Fever, abdominal distension and pain, and constipation with dry stool.
This combination used with Licorice (gan cao) results in the formula Regulate
Stomach Cheng Qi Tang (tiao wei cheng qi tang). Licorice, which is Sweet and
Warm,  counteracts the overly Cold and strong acting actions of Rhubarb and
Mirabilitum and protects the Stomach Qi from damage.<P>


<H4>Rhubarb and Coptis (huang lian)</H4>
A combination of these  two herbs is known as da huang huang lian xie xin tang.
Both herbs are Bitter & Cold and clear Heat. Rhubarb is superior in its
descending action while Coptis has a superior Heat clearing, Damp drying action.
When the two are combined they are very effective in the treatment of pain and
distension  due to knotted Heat pathogen.  If these two herbs are also combined
with Scute which cools Hot Blood and stops bleeding, it creates the formula
Coptis and Rhubarb Combination (san huang xie xin tang). This formula is very
effective for treating epistaxis and haemoptysis   due to a Heat pathogen in the
Blood causing frenetic Blood syndrome, the combination of these three herbs is
not only used for clearing excess Heat from the Qi level (Qi Fen) but also used
to purge Heat toxin from the Blood level and resolve the various symptoms that
occur due to this.<P>


<H4>Rhubarb and Capillaris (yin chen)</H4>
This combination of herbs is effective for the clearing and dispersal of
Damp-heat and it is very commonly used to treat jaundice. The combination of
these two herbs with Gardenia (zhi zi) is known as Capillaris Combination (yin
chen hao tang).  This formula drains Heat from the Gall Bladder, with Gardenia
aiding the expulsion of Damp-heat through the urine. This is a standard
combination used to treat jaundice due to excess type Damp-heat.<P>


<H4>Rhubarb and Cinnamon Bark (rou gui)</H4>
Rhubarb is very Cold and disperses and descends, Cinnamon bark is used as an
adjunct herb to prevent  damage to Spleen Yang. This method of treatment is
known as the Synergy of Hot and Cold and is a common treatment for habitual
constipation.<P>


<H4>Rhubarb and Gypsum (calcined, duan shi gao)</H4>
The combination of these two herbs powdered and made into a paste can be useful
in the treatment of burns and other excess heat skin conditions.
Another external use of Rhubarb is in a 10:2 mixture with powdered licorice for
the treatment of chronic leg ulcers. <P>

Other common combinations include Rhubarb and Moutan (mu dan pi) for the
treatment of Blood stagnation, Rhubarb and Zhi Shi for the treatment of excess
stomach accumulation, Rhubarb and Apricot Seed (xing ren) for the treatment of
dry deficient type constipation, Rhubarb and Persica (tao ren) for the treatment
of dry type constipation and/or Blood stagnation.<HR>

 

<H3>Processing</H3>
When used to regulate the Blood and break up Stagnant Blood use small quantities
of RH; when purging use larger amounts (up to 15 grams in Yangming syndrome);
unprocessed RH is a stronger purge than processed; RH fried in wine (jiu da
huang) can clear Heat from the upper body; charred RH (da huang tan) is used to
stop bleeding. When used as a purge, RH should be added about 5 minutes before
the end of cooking time (hou xia); to regulate Blood and clear Stagnant Blood it
may be cooked longer. RH (especially the raw, unprocessed product) is  generally
contraindicated during pregnancy, during menstruation and breast-feeding,
post-partum,  in exterior syndromes, and for Spleen and Stomach Xu Cold
conditions. Use caution in cases involving Qi, Blood and Yang Xu.<HR>

The principles of formula writing

<HR>
<H2>Introduction</H2>

What is meant by "principles" of writing a formula is mainly the theory of compatibility between the King (principle herb), minister, assistant, and guiding herbs in the herbal formula.<P>

<H2>King herb (principle)</H2>
A king herb is one which produces the primary effects in treating the cause or the main symptoms of a disease.  It dominates the whole formula.

<H2>Minster herb</H2>
A minister herb has the primary function of helping to strengthen the effect of the king herb and secondarily to treat symptoms that accompany the disease that the king herb is treating.

<H2>Assistant herb</H2>
The duty of the assistant herb can be divided into three categories.
<OL><LI> Assist the king and minister to strengthen their therapeutic effects or treat less important symptoms by its own action.
<LI> Reduce or clear away the toxicity of the king and/or minister herbs so as to prevent the appearance of toxic effects or undesired side effects.
<LI> Reduce the potential for vomiting in serious cases due to the potent effects of the other herbs.  The assistant herb performs this function by opposing the irritating property of the king herb without lowering its therapeutic effects.  
</OL>

<H2>Guiding herb</H2>
Guiding herbs can be subdivided into two types:
<OL><LI> Known as the "medicinal guide" which leads the other herbs in the prescription to the affected site in the body.
<LI> Known as "mediating herbs", these herbs which coordinate the effects of the other herbs in the prescription.
</OL>

The establishment of  which herbs play the roles of king (principle), minister, assistant and guiding herbs in a prescription should be based on their respective importance of effect, potency and dosage.  <P>


The dosage of an ingredient in a formula is not the only basis for the determination of the king herb.  Its usual dosage should be taken as a reference.  Metals, stones, shells, and other heavy herbs are not necessarily the king herbs even though they appear to dominate in weight dosage.  On the other hand, some poisonous herbs, used in small dosage may be the king herbs rather than minister, assistant or guiding herbs.<P>

Methods for Formula Modifications


<BR>

<HR>

<H2>1.  Modification of herbs:</H2>

When the main symptoms of a syndrome remain constant, but the secondary symptoms don't fit the specific picture presented for the usual use of a formula, changes in the secondary herbs can be made to better treat the individual symptoms of the patient.  Changes are made only to the secondary herbs, never to the King herbs.  New herbs can be added to a formula and/or the original herbs can be taken away.<P>

For example:  <B>Si Jun Zi Tang </B>is for Spleen/Stomach Qi deficiency.  If the patient also has Qi stagnation, Chen Pi can be added to regulate the Qi.  It is then named <B>Yi Gong San</B>.  If the patient also has phlegm damp, Chen Pi and Ban Xia can be added to regulate Qi and resolve phlegm damp.  Then this formula becomes <B>Liu Jun Zi Tang</B>.<P>

<B>Gui Zhi Tang </B>is for wind cold attack due to an exterior deficiency (of wei Qi).  If the patient also has a cough or asthma, Hou Po and Xing Ren can be added to lower the adverse flow of Qi and relieve asthma.  It is then named <B>Gui Zhi Jia Hou Po Xing Zi Tang</B>.  If the patient has accompanying symptoms such as a sensation of fullness in the chest which demonstrates that the chest Yang has been blocked, Bai Shao with its sour, cool, yin/soft natures should be excluded from the formula.  With this modification, the formula becomes <B>Gui Zhi Qu Shao Yao Tang</B>.  If the patient has the symptoms of an oppressing sensation in the chest and slight cold which indicates that the Yang Qi has been seriously impaired, Shao Yao should be excluded from the formula and Fu Zi should be added so as to warm the channels to ensure the flow of Yang Qi.<P>

<H2>2.  Modification of dosages:
</H2>
This refers to increasing or decreasing the dosage of an herb in a formula without any change in its ingredients.  This method can either change the potency of the original prescription or extend the scope of the treatment.  Sometimes the primary and secondary roles of the herbs in a formula may be changed so as to suit them to new indications.<P>

For example:<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER>
<TR><TD></TD><TH>Zhi Gan Cao</TH><TH>Fu Zi</TH><TH>Gan Jiang</TH></TR>
<TR><TH>Si Ni Tang</TH><TD>6 g</TD><TD>5-10 g</TD><TD>5 g</TD>
<TR><TH>Tang Mai Si Ni Tang</TH><TD>6 g</TD><TD>15 g</TD><TD>10g</TD></TR></TABLE><P>
</CENTER>

<B>Si Ni Tang </B>is for Yang (Kid, Ht, Sp) deficiency marked by diarrhea with indigestion, vomiting, chills, cold limbs, body aches, deep thready week pulse.<P>

<B>Tang Mai Si Ni Tang </B>is for diarrhea with undigested food.  Cold limbs, no chills, flush face, very deep and faint pulse.  Severe Yang deficiency with false heat (Yin cold is so overly strong that the Yang separates from it and floats to the exterior.)

<B>Gui Zhi Jia Shao Yao Tang </B>is a modified version of the original formula: Gui Zhi Tang.  Plus, it has a double dosage of Shao Yao which extends its scope of treatment to a certain degree.  It's indicated for <B>Gui Zhi Tang </B>syndromes accompanied by fullness and pain in the abdomen.

<H2>3.  Modification of the form of administration</H2>

This means that the same formula can produce different effects based on its form of administration.  Pills or powders are of slow-acting and have lasting effects; decoction is for speedy and drastic effects.<P>

For example, <B>Li Zhong Wan (Tang) </B>is used for Spleen Yang Deficiency, but if the condition of the illness is mild and chronic, the pill is preferable.  If the case is serious and acute.  It is better to take the decoction instead.<P>

The above mentioned three modifications of formulas can either be applied separately or be made simultaneously.  Clinically it depends on the specific condition of the patient's illness.<P>

<font size=5>Chinese herbal medicines </font>have been in use for 4,000 years, yet their

properties are just now being studied on a cellular and molecular level.  Some

500 herbs are currently being used by Chinese doctors, which they can combine

to make innumerable remedies.  One that has been tested relatively extensively

is Juzen taiho-to (TJ-48), which is a hand prepared mixture of ten dried and

pulverized herbal plants.  In Chinese traditional medicine it has been used to

treat cases of extreme fatigue, and anemia.  However, recent studies have

focused on its ability to reduce the toxicity of anti-tumor agents.

Researchers also noted that TJ-48 augments antibody production and activates

macrophages by oral administration.  The exact mechanism of pharmacological

action are still unclear.<P>

 

Other studies by Chinese and Japanese investigators have shown a role between

herbal preparations containing zinc and reduced symptoms of fatigue and

related conditions.  Tests done by Yu-Q, et. al.  demonstrate that the amount

of available zinc is much higher in an herbal preparation than in an equal

molar amount of zinc sulfate, and the clinical effects are noticeably greater.

There are also less adverse side effects with the herbal form.  This is

because zinc derived from plants is bound to an amino acid, or chelated, which

makes it easier to be absorbed by the body and carried to where it is needed.

Their study suggested that the herbal preparation they were examining could

raise the zinc level and cure anemia.<P>

 

The importance of zinc to overall body health is well documented.  It is a co-

factor in 70 enzyme systems, and zinc has been shown to increase the number

and efficiency of T cells.  When B cells make antibodies they use up zinc;

consequently, an adequate supply is necessary for proper functioning of the

immune system.  Moreover, macrophages are more active when zinc is in good

supply.  Some studies suggest at least 25mg daily is needed to properly

restore and maintain the immune system.<P>

 

The relationship between the immune system, the thymus gland, and serum zinc

levels is being studied by Nicola Fabris of Italy, and was recently reported

at an international conference.  Zinc can help reverse some of our failing

immune functions, he states, by restoring our thymus gland, which usually

starts to shrink after the age 60 and is followed by declines in the levels of

T and B cells.  This drastic shrinkage is caused by a gradual decline of zinc

in the body, which seems to spontaneously happen as one grows older.  This may

be because the body becomes less efficient at assimilating the metal or the

amount in the diet decreases.  Whichever, the proper size and functioning of

the thymus can be restored by daily ingestion of small doses (at least 15mg)

of chelated zinc.  In one mouse study, the thymus was restored to within 80%

of its youthful size.  Human subjects also showed increased thymus size and

elevated levels of T-cells and active hormones similar to those seen in young

people.<P>

 

Since Chronic Fatigue Syndrome has been connected to certain dysfunctions of

the immune system it would stand to reason that restoring it could lead to a

reduction or elimination of some symptoms.  It is unclear if debilitating

fatigue, the most troubling symptom, would be helped by treating the immune

system alone.<P>

 

TJ-48 has been used to treat fatigue historically, and has been shown to be an

immunomodulatory agent recently.  Parameters tested by H. Yamada included

natural killer (NK) cell activity, blastogenesis by PHA, several T-lymphocyte

subsets, and serum triglyceride levels.  Over one year, the target group

showed a remarkable elevation in NK cell activity, with a corresponding

reduction in lipo-protein values.  One study using mice given lethal doses of

tumor inducing chemicals had the death rate significantly slowed by orally

administering TJ-48 afterwards for one week.  The researchers noted that

atrophy of the thymus was less than in the control group, and this they

attribute to TJ-48.  Similar studies have proven that it is a promising anti-

tumor agent, so its traditional use for treating anemia and chronic fatigue

are being ignored.<P>

 

Another herbal preparation with demonstrated anti-tumor properties is Shi-un-

kou.  It also has the ability to reduce the activity of Epstein-Barr Virus

(EBV).  It was tested as a mixture and broken down into its constituent herbs

for individual testing.  Two, Angelica acutiloba and Macrotomia euchroma,

proved particularly effective.  Since these tests were done on mice, injected

with the tumor promotor TPA which artificially allows EBV to overwhelm the

immune system, its relevance to CFS patients is not known.  However, it has

been used to treat fatigue in the past so there could be a connection.<P>

 

Further exploration of traditional Chinese herbal medicine will no doubt

uncover other useful therapies for treating CFS.  For now, it seems we will

have to be content with reading between the lines of related journal articles,

where other important diseases are being investigated.<P>

Age to Dose Dosing Guideline

<BR>

</TD></TR> </TABLE>

</Center>



<HR>

The standard dose of herbal extracts for an average adult is 6 grams per day.  However, not everybody is an "average adult."  The fundamental concept in dosing is to realize that one size does not fit all.  Every person is unique and must be treated individual.<P>

The principle behind the <B>Age-To-Dose Dosing Guideline</B> is based on the maturity of the organs to metabolize, utilize and eliminate herbs.  This chart is very detailed and is especially useful for infants and younger children.  The recommendations are taken from "Herbology" published by Nanjing College of Traditional Chinese Medicine in 1986.<P>

The principle behind <B>Weight-To-Dose Dosing Guideline</B> is based on the effective concentration of the herb after it is distributed to different parts of the body.  This dosing strategy is especially useful for patients whose body weight falls outside of the normal range which may require an increase or a decrease in dose.  All calculations are based on Clark's Rule in "Pharmaceutical Calculations" written by Mitchell Stoklosa and Howard Ansel and published by Lea and Febiger in Philadelphia.<P>

These two charts provide every herbal practitioner with a handy reference for dosing for those patients who fall outside the definition of an "average adult."  It is still important to keep in mind, however, that these charts serve only as a guideline -  not an absolute rule.  One must always remember to treat each patient as an individual, not as a chart!<P>

A Chinese Look at Western Pharmaceuticals

<BR>

From  <A HREF="../TCMSchools/Sub.htm"> <I>Oriental Medicine</I> </a>Volume 3, #4
<HR>
Chinese herbs are described in terms of their energetic properties.  An herb that enters the lung meridian that is warm and pungent will have the effect of relieving the lungs of Wind-Cold, by expelling phlegm, opening up the sinuses and relieving asthma.  This sort of herb would be perfect for what we in the West call "catching a cold."<p>

In this article, we will go in the other direction.  We'll begin with common Western medications and describe their actions in terms of Chinese herbal properties to provide some perspective on how a practitioner of Chinese medicine can approach and understand their clinical use by other health professionals.


<HR>
<H2>Valium (Diazepam)</H2>

Valium is an anti-anxiety, and anti-tension drug. It has sedative, and hypnotic effects, but over time, one can develop tremors, dizziness, headache, muscle cramps, nervousness, and renewed anxiety. In other words, it can create the same symptom pattern it is designed to treat. So it has the contradictory effect of sedating, and yet causing restlessness. Valium sedates, and suppresses the liver yang and/or liver fire from a Chinese medicine point of view, but by suppressing rising liver yang or fire, Valium dries out the liver, creating a state of yin deficiency with heat which causes restlessness, tremor, irritability, and vertigo. The dry or cotton mouth and thirst with bitter taste is a clear sign of the hot, dry effect of Valium. Valium's strong sedation/relaxation response appears contrary to its nature of aggravating liver yang and heat. This is similar to alcohol, which is also heating (and damp), but has an initial relaxation response followed by agitation as heat builds up in the liver.<p>

<HR>

<H2>



Insulin 
</H2>
Like other hormones produced by the body, insulin is another transformation of jing/essence. Insulin is yin, sweet, and cold in nature, entering lung, spleen, and kidney channels, but activated by the kidney yang function. It is very connected to the yun/hua metabolic function, and therefore has a yang component as well. Diabetics without treatment tend to develop yin vacuity, in the upper, middle or lower burners (or combination thereof), so that a xiao ke/wasting and thirsting pattern tends to dry out the lung, spleen, or kidney yin. It is no surprise, then, that Chinese herbal treatment of wasting and thirsting pattern is generally composed of yin, blood, and sometimes qi supplementing herbs. When we receive diabetics as patients, however, the yin vacuity is 'masked' by use of insulin. If the Chinese medical physician (carefully) is able to delay an insulin dose, you will see yin vacuity signs come back quickly, such as rapid thready pulse, and red, shrivelled tongue. Any type of hormone replacement therapy must develop side effects over time, because simple replacement of bodily substances does not take the complexity of the endocrine system into account. The body has a buffer reaction to any foreign substance over a period of time and even as yin builds up from insulin intake, the condition of the internal organs remains the same. Therefore, over a period of time, we see the development of blurry vision or loss of eyesight (liver yin, and blood vacuity), numbness, and tingling of the extremities (liver blood vacuity and congestion), impotence (kidney qi vacuity, weakening of jing/essence), and increased susceptibility to infections. Chinese medical treatment can help abate the development of these symptoms.<P>

<HR>
<H2>



Progesterone 
</H2>
Progesterone as produced by the body increases in secretion between ovulation and menstruation (the premenstrual phase). According to Chinese medicine, yang qi is more exuberant at this time and the heat produced by increased kidney yang activity is apparent. Progesterone influences and regulates breast tissue, uterine muscle, and menstrual bleeding. Its side effects when taken as a hormone supplement are diverse and complex; an interesting one is bleeding of the gums. According to Chinese medicine, this would indicate stomach heat and possible 'vicarious menstruation,' the rising up of menstrual blood to the upper part of the body.

 Either endogenous production or artificial supplementation with progesterone has been linked to premenstrual syndrome, with breast distention, irritability, depression, flu-like symptoms, and abdominal distention. From a Chinese medicine point of view, we can say that there is liver qi congestion and accumulation of damp/heat. In such cases, vaginal yeast infections, and/or candida may develop as well.

 Progesterone can be classified as a warm, qi-raising medicinal that also has sweet, damp and congestive qualities. It tends to enter and accumulate in the liver and stomach channels, and disperses kidney yang and qi. Over a period of time, it will cause increasing kidney yang and qi vacuity and, as this develops, congestion of dampness, blood, and qi will increase from the inability of the qi mechanism to distribute this drug through the body efficiently.<p>

 It is highly preferable to use natural progesterone when necessary. Rather than trying to replace the endogenous hormone, natural progesterone give several natural hormone precursors from soybean, yam, and herbal extracts. The body then synthesizes hormonal material from these sources, and its intelligence and integrity remain unimpaired.<p>

<HR>
<H2>



Amoxycillin/Penicillin  
</H2>
Side effects to this drug include skin rash, nausea, vomiting, and digestive upset and, most significantly, depression of renal function. Amoxycillin, used for a wide variety of bacterial infections especially of the respiratory and urinary tract, is very cold, bitter, and toxic; it enters lung, spleen, stomach, bladder, and kidney channels. Although accumulation of damp can follow the use of antibiotics, mainly by impairment of kidney and spleen yang functions (including destruction of the intestinal flora), long-term use of such bitter and cold substances can damage the yin as well, leading to yin vacuity heat over time. The original antibiotic, penicillin, was taken from mold/fungi cultures. Molds and fungi modify the human body's internal environment, leading to great disturbance of intestinal flora, digestion, immune function, and hormonal balance. Long-term allergies, candida, yeasts, and functional imbalances can develop from even short-term use of antibiotics. If they must be taken, they should be followed with acidophilus and formulas to strengthen spleen, clear damp, and regulate qi.<p>


<HR>
<H2>

DPT
</H2>
 Vaccines are generally a problem in terms of their ability to overwhelm the body's natural defenses, even as they are designed to enhance immunity to specific pathogenic qi. DPT is a combination of three vaccines; it includes diphtheria toxoid, a poison emitted by the diphtheria bacterium, tetanus toxin, and pertussin. Pertussin especially is known to have potential toxic effects, such as neurological damage, high fever, or seizure. We can say that pertussin especially is hot, highly toxic, drying; it enters the liver channel, causing stirring of the liver yang.<p>


According to Xu Da-cun, the body can effectively deal with only one pathogenic qi at a time. When given a combination vaccine, three different disorders are introduced deep into the body. The wei/defensive and qi levels are bypassed, and the pathogenic qi in the vaccine enters directly into the ying/constructive and xue /blood levels, there to incubate as hidden toxins indefinitely. Because of the direct introduction of pathogenic material into the blood and lymph, the body reaches a 'stalemate' with the vaccine, leading to a possible compromised immune system if it cannot deal adequately with this scenario. Vaccines are being introduced in increased quantities, closer time intervals, and at younger ages than before. Perhaps we should investigate vaccination methods to be more careful to protect the immune function, especially of young children. It is possible that abuses of vaccination may contribute to eventual development of autoimmune disorders, such as allergies, multiple sclerosis, and chronic fatigue syndrome.<p>

<HR>


<H2>
Vincristine/vinblastine
</H2>
  This is a pair of `anticancer' drugs, used widely in lymphatic cancers. They are unique in that they were originally synthesized from a natural source, flos periwinkle (fl. vinca rosea). Given in purified form, often in combination with other anti-cancer drugs, they are highly toxic and can cause great damage to blood, qi, yin, and the viscera. Chemotherapy drugs in general are considered by Chinese medicine to generate 'hot toxins.' They destroy tissue, especially rapidly growing cells such as mucosa, hair follicles, and abnormal (cancer) cells. The most notable side-effects of vincristine and vinblastine are neurotoxic and myelosuppressive; influencing motor and neuron function, along with bone marrow depression. It therefore effects the xue/blood level and damages liver blood and kidney yin, yang, and jing/essence. It would be of great benefit to use herbs to supplement liver and kidney, and clear heat toxin if this drug is to be used with reduced side effects. One beneficial formula would be Modified Generate the Pulse Powder with Rx. Glehnae and Rx. Moutan (jia jian sheng mai san).<p>


<HR>
<H2>
AZT (Zidovudine, Retrovir)  
</H2>
Originally designed as a chemotherapy drug for cancer, AZT has become famous as a treatment for AIDS, for its alleged ability to interfere with HIV replication. In recent months, AZT has become notorious for its vicious side-effects, most notably bone-marrow suppression and depression of solid blood materials (platelets, RBC, leukocytes). Therefore, it directly suppresses humoral immunity, considered as ying/constructive qi in Chinese medicine, as well as produces anemia (xue/blood level). Like other forms of chemotherapy, it is very hot and toxic; it will damage kidney yin, and yang as well as liver blood. If your patients are using this medication (usually with ddl and other strong drugs), herbs to build blood, yin, and kidney yang must be taken.<p>


<HR>
<H2>Lithium 
</H2> There's an interesting story about how lithium carbonate was discovered. People who went to bathe in certain hot springs reported spontaneous remission of depression, along with feelings of euphoria. Researchers then began analyzing the content of these hot springs and found that the natural salt lithium helped alleviate depression. Lithium is one of the trace minerals that is needed by the body in very small amounts. One of the dietary health problems that most people suffer from in America is demineralization. In my opinion one of the best defenses against illness is maintaining proper mineral content of the body (see "Minerals and Body Alchemy" in Oriental Medicine, Vol 3 #2). Trace mineral elements play a role in the conduction and maintenance of the qi flow of the body. The minerals possess subtle electromagnetic properties. Lithium as a medication is used to counteract manic depression. It appears to stabilize the ups and downs of mood swings. The taste of lithium is salty; its nature is cold; it enters the kidney meridian;, and has a descending action. In Chinese herbal medicine we use salts to bring other medication to the kidneys. If you want to tonify the kidney you combine a little salt water with the Rehmannia Six Pills. Lithium in modern biomedical practice is prescribed as a single salt in large doses in order to maintain a very strong suppressive influence on the psyche. This will lead to accumulation of lithium in the body if used over a lengthy period, with a buildup of fluids, increased clear urination, as well as a feeling of heaviness, dullness, and bloating. In my opinion, lithium may be more effective clinically when combined with other trace minerals in small amounts, along with herbs to strengthen the kidney and spleen yang functions.<p>


<HR>
<H2>

Prozac (Fluoxetine)  
</H2>
This is one of the most widely praised and condemned medications, credited both with saving lives from suicidal depressions and causing homicidal behavior (almost in the same breath). Prozac is used primarily for conditions of panic disorder, depression, and obsessive compulsive disorder. It's pharmaceutical category is that of a serotonin uptake inhibitor. Neurotransmitters are another expression of jing/essence, produced in the extraordinary organ, the brain. The substance of the brain is seen in Chinese medicine as being produced from marrow governed by the kidney. The neurotransmitters include aspects of both kidney yin and yang. As a result, Prozac influences the kidney yin and yang systems. Inhibition of serotonin release causes an internal accumulation and stagnation of serotonin. A Western understanding of the effects of Prozac stops with the inhibition of the serotonin neuroreceptors; but for the Chinese practitioner, the inhibition can then lead to a stagnation of fluids in the body, especially around the kidney and the brain. Prior to Prozac, other antidepressants suppressed norepinephrine as well as serotonin, which caused unwanted side-effects such as urinary inhibition, impotence, constipation, and severe dry mouth. In Chinese medicine these are clearly yin vacuity signs.<p>


Prozac was originally proclaimed a "clean antidepressant:" that is, one with no side-effects. Even though Prozac wasn't supposed to influence norepinephrine uptake, according to pharmacist/acupuncturist Robert Zeiger it is a "dirty" drug; it has the same side-effects as the other antidepressants but they're more masked by a more sophisticated design.<p>


One of the complaints about Prozac is a tingling, spicy taste in the mouth. In Chinese herbal medicine excessive doses of kidney yang tonics will produce a dry mouth with a pungent taste. The following side-effects of Prozac are now recognized as well: headaches (liver yang rising or dispersal of yang qi upwards from the kidney), nervousness and tremor (build-up of liver wind and yang); insomnia (agitation of the hun or shen, kidney and heart yin vacuity); reduced concentration (also connected with the kidney), and gradual development of anxiety as Prozac consumes the yin. My experience with Western medications is that a major symptom being treated often reappears as one of the side-effects. Prozac seems to narrow the focus of an individual to the 'here and now,' reduce outside distraction as well as self-reflection on stored emotions or conflicts. This perhaps is the most controversial effect of Prozac; that it strongly influences the psychological orientation, effecting the very life-will of a person (the hun, shen, po, yi, and zhi may all be affected).<p>


 Other side-effects include abnormal dreams involving either the shen/heart spirit or the hun/ethereal soul. Hot flashes and palpitations are associated with kidney or liver yang rising with a deficiency of kidney/heart yin similar to what occurs at menopause. So Prozac acts to disperse the kidney yang upward and outward, showing 'opening orifice' effects (awakening the senses) . For those patients who are suffering immobilizing depression this may mean a feeling of increased energy and awareness. This would be a very different experience for someone whose depression is caused by repressed anger with an inability to express negative emotions. Chinese medicine considers this type of depression to be under liver qi depression/gan qi yu. Taking Prozac, in my opinion, would be a very negative experience for such a patient. It could easily lead to the violent symptoms described in courts and in lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies. In short, different constitutional types will react differently to Western medications, and appropriate cautions and contraindications should be listed.<p>
<HR>
<H2>

 Summary  
</H2>
There are problems with the use of pharmaceutical drugs as medicine. They work allopathically, attacking specific pathogens, tissues, or symptoms, but because of their synthetic origin, disturb the equilibrium of the body and mind. They are either extreme yin or yang and their therapeutic bandwidth is beyond that which the body/mind can absorb within the visceral or meridian structure. Without an understanding of individual constitutional sensitivity, there can be disastrous side effects. This is what distinguishes the approaches of Chinese medicine, which are designed to work within the therapeutic bandwidth of the dynamic human ecology, according to the special and unique characteristics of each individual case.<p>

<H1>INTRODUCTION</H1>

As Chinese herbal medicine becomes increasingly widely practised in the West, reports of occasional adverse effects are appearing in the literature and questions are being asked about safety. If we are to retain the confidence and support of the public we must address these issues in a spirit of openness and with a willingness to learn the relevant lessons.<P>

In this article I present a wide-ranging, though not exhaustive, review of reports in the English-language literature of adverse events involving Chinese herbs. In particular, I have devoted attention to a series of cases of liver damage, including two fatalities, which have occurred in the UK in patients taking Chinese herbs for skin disease. This is the first time all this information has been gathered together in one place.<P>

It is important to remember that these adverse events are extremely unusual. Chinese herbal medicine is generally both safe and effective, and there are many patients who have experienced dramatic benefits to their health from treatment. All medicines are assessed in terms of their risk-benefit ratio and it should not be surprising that Chinese herbal medicines may also occasion rare but significant adverse events. The aim of this article is to assist a process of debate and development within the profession as we work to minimise what risks there are.<P>

<H3>KIDNEY DAMAGE FROM SLIMMING TREATMENT IN BELGIUM</H3>
One of the most serious recent occurrences of toxicity involving Chinese herbs came to light between 1991 and 1992 in Belgium, where a series of young women were admitted to hospitals suffering from renal failure1. Investigations initially discovered nine cases and revealed that they had all been taking medication for slimming from the same clinic, which was run by doctors not herbalists. The clinic had been giving slimming treatments for fifteen years without such problems, but in 1990 the composition of the slimming capsules was changed and two Chinese herbs were included.<P>

The slimming clinic claimed that the new formula contained:
<DL><DT> Cascara powder 20-150 mg
<DT> Acetazolamide 25-45 mg
<DT> Belladonna extract 1-2 mg
<DT> Hou Po (Cortex Magnolia officinalis) 100-200 mg
<DT> Han Fang Ji (Radix Stephania tetrandra) 100-200 mg1
</DL>
However, as discussed below, it is now certain that the second Chinese herb was not in fact Han Fang Ji but rather was either Guang Fang Ji (Radix Aristolochia Fangchi) or an unknown adulterant.<P>

In addition to the above formulation, most patients at the clinic were also prescribed a capsule containing the amphetamines fenfluramine and diethylproprion and the tranquilliser meprobamate, and were given intradermal injections of artichoke extract and euphyllin1. Many will consider such a regimen to constitute extremely dubious practice, and indeed the Faculties and Medical Board in Belgium have warned doctors not to prescribe slimming products composed of appetite inhibitors and diuretics2. Also, it will be immediately apparent to practitioners of Chinese herbal medicine that neither Hou Po nor Han Fang Ji are traditionally indicated for weight loss, and it is also obvious that they were not being prescribed on an individualised basis following a diagnosis according to the principles of Chinese medicine.<P>

It is worth noting that these patients were also put on a low calorie diet, which might have enhanced the effect of the medicines they were given.<P>

Since the first published report from Belgium, a total of 53 cases of renal failure have now been reported2. The patients affected require kidney dialysis with a view to eventual transplantation. This is clearly an extremely serious situation and it is important to try to understand what went wrong. The cases of kidney damage did only occur once the Chinese herbs were added to the formula, so the toxic reaction must have involved them in some way.<P>

The first problem concerns the identity of the herbs involved. Chromatographic studies confirmed the presence of Hou Po in the capsules1. However, the same studies showed that the capsules did not contain tetrandrine, which is a major constituent of Han Fang Ji. These studies also isolated an unknown alkaloid which was not present in samples of Han Fang Ji. Finally, microscopic examination showed the presence of calcium oxalate in both the capsules and the importer's sals are not found in Han Fang Ji according to the Pharmacopoeia of the PRC3 but they are present in Guang Fang Ji (Radix Aristolochia Fangchi). The Chinese Medicinal Material Research Centre (CMMRC) in Hong Kong also studied samples of the herb supplied as Han Fang Ji by the exporter in Hong Kong and found aristolochic acid to be present4. The CMMRC later studied samples of the slimming capsules themselves and found them to contain aristolochic acids A and B5.<P>

One very definite possibility therefore is that the herb actually used in these capsules was not Han Fang Ji (Radix Stephania Tetrandra) but was in fact Guang Fang Ji (Radix Aristolochia Fangchi). This herb contains aristolochic acid, and this chemical in isolation can produce nephrotoxic reactions6. However, although the potential toxicity of Guang Fang Ji is known in Chinese medicine2 the whole herb is used in China without producing such toxicity. It has also been pointed out that 185 kg of the supposed Han Fang Ji was distributed to practitioners throughout Belgium, but only in this one slimming clinic did problems occur. We have already mentioned that at this clinic the herbs were not prescribed by properly trained practitioners of Chinese herbal medicine, nor in accordance with Chinese medical theories. Furthermore, instead of being combined with other herbs which may serve to minimise any potential for toxicity, in this case the herbs were instead combined with an extraordinary mixture of pharmaceutical drugs.<P>

It is certain then that the herb supposed to be Han Fang Ji was misidentified by the exporters in Hong Kong, by the importers in Belgium and by the doctors in the slimming clinic. It is very likely that the herb used was in fact Guang Fang Ji and that this herb's potential for toxicity was massively amplified by its use in combination with other drugs, in patients for whom it was not indicated, and by practitioners untrained in its use.<P>

However, there is definitely some confusion here. The initial report of studies done in Belgium clearly states that the slimming capsules did not contain aristolochic acid1, and instead speaks of the presence of an unknown alkaloid. Only in the later report from the CMMRC is it claimed that the capsules did contain aristolochic acid2. There remains therefore a second distinct possibility, that the capsules contained neither Han Fang Ji nor Guang Fang Ji, but some unknown and severely nephrotoxic adulterant.<P>

There are several lessons to be drawn from this tragic series of cases of kidney damage:
<UL><LI> Chinese herbs should only ever be prescribed by fully trained practitioners of Chinese herbal medicine, in accordance with a traditional individualised diagnosis. 
<LI> When herbs with some potential for toxicity are mixed with modern drugs there may be previously unknown consequences, as a result of the potentiation of the toxicity of the herb by the metabolic and physiological effects of the drugs. This is clearly an important issue which requires further discussion and elaboration. Some important work has already been done on producing lists of herbs which are known to have some potential for toxicity7.
<LI> Proper identification and quality control of herbs by suppliers is a key ingredient in the safe practice of Chinese herbal medicine.<P>

<H3>TOXICITY FROM PATENT MEDICINES - JIN BU HUAN & OTHERS</H3>
Traditionally, patent medicines are based on traditional herbal formulas and are prescribed according to a traditional diagnosis. However, modern patents have moved away from the traditional formulations, and we have begun to see problems as a result. Reports from the USA in 1993 and 1994 drew attention to toxicity problems with the patent medicine Jin Bu Huan Anodyne Tablets, made by Kwangsi Pai Se Pharmaceutical/Bose Drug Manufactory, Kwangsi, China8, 9. Seven adults developed symptoms of hepatitis after taking Jin Bu Huan for between 7 and 52 weeks. Symptoms and signs included fever, fatigue, nausea, pruritus, abdominal pain, jaundice and hepatomegaly. Liver function tests and liver biopsy results confirmed acute hepatitis and were consistent with a drug reaction. Two patients later recommenced the use of Jin Bu Huan and both experienced a rapid return of the symptoms of hepatitis. All seven patients made gradual but complete recoveries on ceasing the use of the patent medicine.<P>

The precise mechanism of the hepatitis is not entirely certain. The abrupt reappearance of symptoms in the patients who recommenced taking the tablets suggests a hypersensitivity reaction, and the liver biopsy showed eosinophilia in two cases, which also suggests an allergic mechanism. An immunoallergic mechanism therefore seems most likely9. However, there are also some suggestions of a direct hepatotoxic effect9.<P>

The package insert for these tablets recommended their use for pain relief or insomnia and claimed that the ingredients were 70% starch and 30% levo-alkaloid from Polygala chinensis (presumably this refers to Yuan Zhi - Radix Polygalae Tenuifoliae). However, analysis of the tablets showed that they contained 36% of levo- tetrahydropalmatine. This alkaloid is not found in plants of the genus Polygala, but it is found in the genera Stephania and Corydalis9. Almost certainly, the alkaloid in these tablets was actually extracted from Yan Hu Suo (Rhizoma Corydalis Yanhusuo). This herb is traditionally known to alleviate pain and we know there have been studies on the hypnotic and sedative effects of tetrahydropalmatine extracted from it2 . This herb is also known as Yuan Hu, hence presumably the confusion with Yuan Zhi (although the Chinese characters are different).<P>

Several points are evident here:<BR>

The labelling of this product in English was inaccurate. In addition, the incorrect weight of the active ingredient suggests poor quality control by the manufacturers.  Traditionally, Chinese herbs are always used in combination with other herbs and prescribed in order to treat the underlying disharmony causing the symptoms. This tablet was based on only a single herb and indicated purely for symptomatic relief.
What is more, these tablets did not even contain the whole single herb, but a single chemical extracted from a herb. This is not the practice of traditional medicine, rather it represents a modern pharmaceutical approach. It is debatable whether this product could really be described as "herbal" at all - it is more akin to a novel and unlicensed drug! The chemistry of whole herbs involves complex interactions among their constituents which are poorly understood10, and there is evidence that whole herbs are significantly less toxic than single "active ingredients" isolated from them11,12. Certainly, there are no reports in the literature of any problems with the whole herb Yan Hu Suo. <P>

Also in the USA, in three separate incidents, children aged two and a half years and 13- and 23- months took unintentional overdoses of Jin Bu Huan, amounting to 17, 60 and 7 tablets respectively. Each of these children became seriously ill, with rapid onset of life-threatening bradycardia and central nervous system and respiratory depression13. Fortunately each child made a full recovery. These cases underline the additional dangers from concentrated single chemical extracts from herbs.<P>

There have also been reports from Hong Kong and the USA of patent medicines containing paracetamol, aspirin, antihistamines, theophylline, bromhexine and synthetic corticosteroids, and from Hong Kong, the USA and Australia of other patent medicines containing cadmium, lead and arsenic1. In Malaysia, a woman developed kidney damage after taking a patent medicine which was found to contain phenylbutazone14. In the UK, skin creams for eczema have been found to contain corticosteroids and a potent antibiotic15,16,17.<P>

What is evident in these cases is that most of these problems are not being caused by traditional patent medicines but by modern formulations containing a single chemical only or combining Chinese herbs with Western drugs. The advice given to its members by the Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine (RCHM) in the UK is relevant here:<BR>

<UL><LI> Never prescribe a patent medicine unless you know all its ingredients. 
<LI> Avoid all patents containing Western medicines (it is in any case illegal to prescribe many of these unless you are a registered medical practitioner). Patents with added Western drugs can often be identified by the words Fu Fang or Qiang Li before the name. 
<LI> Avoid all patents containing heavy metals (they are toxic and illegal). 
<LI> Use reputable suppliers. Suppliers must be encouraged to adopt careful quality control measures15.

<H3>TOXIC EFFECTS FROM ADULTERANTS OR ERRONEOUS SUBSTITUTES</H3>
In 1991 a case was reported from Hong Kong of encephalopathy and neuropathy following ingestion of a decoction supposedly prepared from Long Dan Cao (Radix Gentiana longdancao). Investigation showed that the toxicity was in fact due to adulteration of the herb by the supplier in mainland China with the roots of Podophyllum emodi, which contained podophyllotoxin18. Similarly, the Chinese Medicinal Material Research Centre (CMMRC) in Hong Kong investigated a case of serious vomiting and abdominal pain in Kuala Lumpur and a case of serious vomiting and headache from Taipei. Both people had taken decoctions supposedly containing Wei Ling Xian (Radix Clematis). Investigation revealed that the importers in Kuala Lumpur and Taipei had been persuaded to accept a new source of Wei Ling Xian and had not realised that the herb supplied was actually a toxic adulterant, which again proved to be Podophyllum emodi5.<P>

The CMMRC also investigated four cases of drowsiness and confusion affecting four women in Hong Kong, all of whom had obtained their prescriptions from the same herb shop. In each case the prescription included Ling Xiao Hua (Flos Campis grandiflora or C. radicans). In Hong Kong and southern China this herb is commonly replaced with Pao Tung Hua (Flos Paulownia fortunei or P. tomentosa). However, in these cases the retailer at the herb shop had mistakenly used Yang Jin Hua (Datura metel), which contains atropine and scopolamine and is known to cause symptoms such as confusion at the doses used5.<P>

In the USA, a man took a traditional herbal prescription containing 36 ingredients. He become ill with abdominal colic, muscle pain and fatigue, was hospitalised for 3 weeks, and was eventually diagnosed as suffering from acute intermittent porphyria. The cause was traced to lead poisoning due to contamination of the Hai Ge Fen (Concha Cyclinae Sinensis, clam shell) in his prescription19. <P>

Expensive herbs such as Ren Shen (Panax ginseng) may particularly tempt fraudulent substitution. In the 1970s, Ginseng preparations bought in the USA were found to contain Mandragora officinarum (toxic component scopolamine), Rauwolfia serpentia (toxic component reserpine) and Cola species41. There have also been other reports of substitution of Ren Shen20, including a famous case involving Linford Christie at the Seoul Olympics where what was supposed to be Ren Shen was found to contain ephedrine.<P>

All these cases again point to the crucial need for good identification checks and quality control by suppliers. A minimum requirement would probably be the examination by microscopy and chromatography of each batch of herbs by trained pharmacognocists.<P>

<H3>PROBLEMS WITH HERBS OF KNOWN TOXICITY </H3>
A handful of the hundreds of herbs commonly used in Chinese herbal medicine have always been known to be potentially toxic, but they have continued to be used with care because of their therapeutic value. The most important examples are the aconites.
A review of reports of toxicity in Hong Kong21 showed that most of the cases of serious poisoning were due to the use of Cao Wu (Radix Aconitum kusnezoffi) and Chuan Wu (Radix Aconitum carmichaeli - the main root). These herbs contain highly toxic alkaloids, including aconitine, which activate sodium channels and over-stimulate cell membranes. Side effects are neurological, cardiovascular and/or gastro-intestinal and death can occur due to cardiovascular collapse or ventricular arrhythmia.<P>

Both of these herbs are traditionally known to be very toxic, and Chinese herbal pharmacopoeias warn of this. Nonetheless, in some of the Hong Kong cases quite high doses of 7-11 g had been prescribed. This suggests a lack of appropriate caution to say the least and raises concerns over the training and competence of practitioners, particularly since herbal medicine is unregulated in Hong Kong. Even when the indications and dosage are correct, problems can arise. The roots may contain variable amounts of toxic components and patients' sensitivity may also vary22. Furthermore, patients are relied upon to boil these herbs for a long time to reduce their toxicity, and these instructions may not always be followed correctly. More complex is the situation relating to Fu Zi (Radix Lateralis Aconiti Carmichaeli Praeparata - the processed accessory roots). This herb is less toxic than the main root and is pre-processed to further reduce its toxicity (the unprocessed form is called Sheng Fu Zi and is rarely used). Herbalists find this herb extremely useful - it is warming and drying and it tonifies yang. However, there have been some reports of problems with Fu Zi in Hong Kong23.<P>

In the UK, although the legal situation is somewhat ambiguous, it appears that all forms of aconite are effectively banned for internal use. It can certainly be argued that herbs with such clear and established toxicity as Cao Wu and Chuan Wu should only be restricted to use only when patients are under close medical supervision, probably as in-patients. This would permit the rapid detection of adverse reactions, which can then be successfully treated with atropine. In the case of Fu Zi, one could argue for its use being allowed at low doses by qualified and regulated practitioners, and with clear advice to patients about the need to pre-boil Fu Zi to reduce its toxicity even further.<P>

<H3>TOXIC EFFECTS FROM RARE HERBS - HONG KONG </H3>
The herbs Yang Jin Hua (Datura metel) and Nao Yang Hua (Flos Rhododendri mollis) contain scopolamine, hyoscamine and atropine and they have been reported as the cause of cases of anticholinergic poisoning in Hong Kong2l. These herbs are rarely used by practitioners of Chinese herbal medicine in Europe, although the former can be obtained from some suppliers7. The related herb Datura stremonium is used by Western herbalists and in the UK this is allowed by the 1968 Medicines Act within a restricted dosage range. It would seem sensible for Yang Jin Hua (Datura metel) and Nao Yang Hua (Flos Rhododendri mollis) to also be restricted to use at low doses by qualified and regulated practitioners.<P>

<H3>CASES OF LIVER DAMAGE IN SKIN DISEASE PATIENTS </H3>
In the UK there has been a great surge in the popularity of Chinese herbal treatment for skin conditions. This followed considerable media interest, stimulated by two clinical trials which showed the value of Chinese herbs in the treatment of eczema24,25. <P>

There have now been several cases in the UK where patients have become clinically ill with liver problems after taking Chinese herbs for the treatment of skin conditions, and a similar case has been reported from New Zealand. Two of these patients have died.<P>

The details of a number of these cases have now been published separately. It has often proved difficult to obtain much information about the herbs prescribed and details of the Chinese diagnosis have never been obtained, but there are a number of cases where details are now available of the prescriptions given. Unfortunately it is very difficult to identify the species, given a dried specimen of only one part of the plant, and to compound the difficulty the identification of the herbs in some of these cases was done by botanists, not by specialists in Chinese herbs. As a result some of these prescriptions may contain errors in identification. Nonetheless, there is enough information here to allow us to draw some clear conclusions. These are presented in the discussion section after the individual cases.<P>


<H4>Case 1 </H4>
This is the first fatality to have occurred in the UK which was linked to Chinese herbs. A letter from the National Poisons Unit reporting this case was published in the Lancet in 199226.<P>

The patient, a 28 year old woman, developed jaundice after taking Chinese herbs for several months and was admitted to hospital with hepatitis. The symptoms resolved satisfactorily. Six months later the patient began taking Chinese herbs again. Two or three weeks after this she was again admitted with jaundice, and tragically died of acute liver failure. A post-mortem revealed total necrosis of the liver.<P>

The hospital was able to exclude the commoner infectious causes, e.g. hepatitis A and B. There was no history of exposure to hepatotoxic chemicals, and the only Western drugs being taken prior to the jaundice were antacids. There were no traces of hepatotoxic drugs in the urine, nor of heavy metals in the blood or urine. <P>

The Lancet letter also gave details of the herbal prescription which this patient supposedly was taking. However, after further investigations by Dr. David Atherton it has been discovered that the prescription given to the NPU was in fact for a different patient of the same name27! The NPU analysed their sample for aflatoxins (toxins from mould on the herbs) and for pyrrolizidine alkaloids, and found none, but clearly this particular result is meaningless since the wrong sample was tested. The possibility of contamination or adulteration of the herbs therefore remains in this case.
Dr. Atherton has now provided us with details of the prescription which was actually taken by this woman throughout her treatment27:<P>

The above is based on the practitioner's written prescription, which gave the herb names in Chinese.<P>

In response to this fatality, and a number of other early reports of high blood levels of liver enzymes in patients taking herbs for eczema and psoriasis28 29, the RCHM made the following recommendations to its members in 1992 and 1993l5,16:
<UL><LI> that all patients with a history of liver or kidney disease in the last five years should not be treated without regular blood-testing to monitor liver and kidney function. 
<LI> that practitioners should carefully monitor their patients and be vigilant for any early indications of liver damage. 
<LI> that practitioners should take care with dosage in patients with skin diseases. A total prescription weight of 35 g/day (or 0.5 g/kg of body weight) was recommended. 
<LI> that practitioners should consider regular blood-testing of all patients with skin diseases. This last recommendation was only taken up by a handful of practitioners. Many practitioners were reluctant to import such a non-traditional measure into the practice of Chinese medicine, and there were also obstacles of cost and practicality.
</UL>

<H4>Case 2 </H4>
This case came to the attention of the RCHM Council in May 1994, when we were approached by a woman whose sister had been admitted to hospital with jaundice whilst taking a course of Chinese herbs. The hospital had investigated other possible causes for the jaundice and concluded that the herbs were probably responsible. The woman approached the RCHM because the practitioner claimed to be "a registered practitioner". However, the practitioner turned out not to be a member of the RCHM. The practitioner was initially reluctant to give any details of the prescription, but after the patient's sister threatened legal action she divulged the following details. The dosages are not known.<P>

The information available on this case is rather limited, but it is included here to make the information available to practitioners, who may particularly wish to study all the prescriptions which may have been involved in adverse events.<P>


<H4>Case 3</H4> 
This case, reported by Kane et al.30, was of a 31 year old white woman who presented to her general practitioner in September 1991 complaining of loss of appetite, nausea and fatigue. She had had dark urine and yellow sclerae for the previous 24 hours. Examination revealed jaundice and an enlarged liver. Blood tests revealed raised levels of alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin, confirming liver damage.<P>

The patient was not taking regular prescribed drugs, drank hardly any alcohol, and had had no recent injections or blood transfusions. The provisional diagnosis was viral hepatitis, but blood tests for hepatitis A were negative. Three months later she was tested for hepatitis B and C and for auto-antibodies and these tests were also negative.<P>

The patient' s liver function returned to normal over the next eight weeks, but after another six weeks she again complained of malaise, itching and dark urine. She had mild jaundice, and blood levels of alanine transaminase and alkaline phosphatase were again raised.
This time the patient was carefully questioned and she revealed that before the first episode she had taken Chinese herbs for her psoriasis. The herbs were taken daily for two months as a decoction. She had begun taking the herbs again just three days before the second episode of jaundice. She stopped the herbs again and her liver function returned to normal after eight weeks. She remained well during 18 months follow up.<P>

In this case, the recurrence of both symptoms and biochemical evidence of liver damage shortly after resuming the herbs strongly incriminates the herbs as the cause of the liver damage.<P>

The herbs showed no evidence of contamination by heavy metals or fungi. The prescription was examined and analysed at the Dept. of Pharmacognosy in the School of Pharmacy of the University of London. They identified the herbs by their Latin botanical names as:

<H4>Case 4 </H4>
This case was also reported by Kane et al.30 A 61 year old Chinese woman living in the UK presented with nausea, malaise, weight loss, dark urine and jaundice. Blood tests showed raised levels of aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin, confirming liver damage. She had no known history of exposure to hepatitis viruses or other toxins, she drank very little alcohol, and her only prescribed drugs had been a short course of terfenadine. Blood tests for hepatitis A, B and C were negative. She had been taking Chinese herbs for her eczema for 11 months.<P>

In this case it seems extraordinary that this woman had been taking Chinese herbs for 11 months without any apparent problems for most of this time. This raises several important questions:
<UL><LI> was the prescription changed in the last few weeks? We only have information about the prescription she was taking when she became ill. If we knew that a herb had recently been added, then that herb would be strongly suspect. 
<LI> had there recently been a delivery of a new batch of one of the herbs? If so, there may have been problems with the correct identification and preparation of the herbs in the new batch. This would support the suggestion that good quality control is a key issue. 
<LI> had some other factor intervened? We do not know whether there had been changes in the patient's diet, or whether she had been stressed or over-tired etc.
</UL>

<H4>Case 5 </H4>
Another case of severe hepatitis was reported in 1994 in the New Zealand Medical Journal32. A 37 year old woman presented to her doctor with general malaise. Blood tests showed raised levels of alkaline phosphatase, GGT, ALT and AST, all consistent with liver damage. Over the next two weeks her liver function deteriorated and she was admitted to hospital. The blood levels of liver enzymes rose to very high levels before beginning to gradually decline. Her liver function finally returned to normal seven weeks after the initial presentation. Tests for hepatitis A, B and C were all negative. She had antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus showing that she had been exposed to the virus in the past and was now immune. Tests for other infective agents were negative. Liver biopsy revealed features most consistent with toxic or drug induced liver damage.<P>

Thirteen days before presenting to her doctor, this patient had begun treatment with Chinese herbs for her psoriasis. She drank alcohol rarely and had no history of intravenous injection, blood transfusion or recent overseas travel. Interestingly, she had had a routine blood test three months previously and at this time the liver function tests were normal.
The herbs which were prescribed by the herbal practitioner were as follows. With the exception of Jianqu they are given by their Latin pharmaceutical or botanical names in the published report.<P>

<B>a</B> The published report names this herb as Indigo naturalis (actually as Indigo natukalis - see below). It is not entirely clear whether this was Da Qing Ye (Folium Daqingye), i.e. the unprocessed leaf, or Qing Dai, which is woad - a powder made from the leaf.<BR>

<B>b</B> More commonly known as Shen Qu, this is a non-standardised fermented leaven including various herbs such as Qing Hao (Herba Atermisiae Annuae), Xing Ren (Semen Pruni Armeniacae), Cang Er Zi (Fructus Xanthii Sibirici) and Chi Xiao Dao (Semen Phaseoli  Calcarati)22,23.<P>


<H4>Case 6 </H4>
This case is the second fatality to have occurred in the UK. It was reported in a letter to the British Medical Journal in 199533. A 32 year old man was admitted to hospital with fulminant liver failure, otherwise known as massive hepatic necrosis. Within a week of presentation he was deeply jaundiced and went into coma. Liver transplantation was attempted but did not succeed in saving the patient's life.<P>

Tests were unable to identify any viral, immunological or metabolic cause of liver failure. Four weeks before presentation the patient had begun treatment with Chinese herbs for lipomas.
The practitioner's notes reveal that the patient was born in India and had a history of jaundice as a child. Apparently he had also had jaundice in his early twenties. He had been prescribed ten packets of herbs and he had taken one packet of herbs a day as instructed. Throughout these ten days he had felt ill and had diarrhoea but he had persisted with taking the herbs. After three weeks he was still unwell and began to become jaundiced. At this point he went to his doctor and was hospitalised.<P>

One of the tragic features of this case is that had this patient stopped the herbs as soon as the diarrhoea began, he would probably still be alive. His death could almost certainly have been prevented if he had been given written and verbal instructions to stop taking the herbs and contact the practitioner if he should develop any symptoms like those of a cold or flu, or any digestive disturbance such as nausea or diarrhoea.<P>

The following is the herbal prescription as taken from the practitioners notes, with the herbs given by their Chinese names. However, it should be noted that the notes are scanty and not completely clear so we can not be entirely sure of the prescription given.<P>

The School of Pharmacy in the University of London is reported to have consulted a Chinese expert in pharmacognosy about the herbs in this prescription and they concluded that none of the herbs appears to be directly hepatotoxic, which probably points to an immunoallergic mechanism. Further clarification of this report is required.<P>


<H3>Discussion of cases </H3>
In many of these cases all the other obvious possible causes of liver damage can be confidently excluded, and it is clear that something about the herbal treatment is the cause of the adverse reactions. Adulteration or misidentification of herbs seems an unlikely explanation since the cases are spread over several years and involved different practitioners, and the herbs have been examined and identified in several cases. The fact that the majority of these cases occurred in the UK may be due to the large number of patients with skin diseases being treated in this country. If we conclude then that something about the herbal treatment is the cause of the adverse reactions, this raises two important questions:

<UL><LI> are these adverse reactions being caused by a single herb or by several? 
<LI> is the herb or herbs directly toxic to liver cells, or is this an immunoallergic or idiosyncratic reaction? 
</UL><P>


A careful examination of these prescriptions shows that one herb is common to them all, namely Bai Xian Pi (Cortex Dictamni Dasycarpi Radicis), and it has been suggested that this herb may be the cause of the hepatitis33. Since this herb is mostly used to treat skin disease, this would explain why these cases of liver damage have been confined to patients being treated for skin disease.<P>

However, there are no reports in the literature of Bai Xian Pi being directly hepatotoxic, and this includes a recently published Chinese language pharmacopoeia which gives details of animal research and clinical studies on this herb34. So if Bai Xian Pi is involved, the mechanism would appear most likely to be a rare allergic hypersensitivity and not direct toxicity.<P>

We should note that in two of the above cases (Cases 1 and 3), patients experienced a much more rapid adverse reaction when they re-started the herbs a second time. This is also strongly suggestive of an allergic mechanism.<P>

In two controlled clinical trials examining the benefits of Chinese herbs in the treatment of eczema24 25, all participants were given liver function tests and there were no reports of problems. Bai Xian Pi is one of the ten herbs contained in the standardised herbal remedy Zemaphyte which was used in these studies. However, the relatively small numbers involved in these trials make it difficult to draw firm conclusions, and further clinical research is clearly needed.<P>

It has been pointed out by practitioners that probably as many as 70-80% of prescriptions for skin disease contain Bai Xian Pi. It is possible that this is the reason why this herb occurs in each of the above prescriptions, and that the causes of the hypersensitivity reaction are more complex. Certainly, it has been suggested that several herbs can be involved in immunoallergic reactions35, and patients with atopic conditions such as eczema or with a history of liver disease might be particularly vulnerable to such reactions. In case 3 in particular, it is clear that other herbs in the prescription could have been involved in the toxic effect. We should therefore be cautious about attributing all these cases of hepatitis to a single herb when there are so many other variables.<P>

In conclusion, it appears almost certain that the hepatotoxic effect which occurred in these cases was of an immunoallergic type and was not due to a herb which is directly hepatotoxic. This has two major implications: firstly, that the toxic effect is probably not dose-related, and secondly that these sorts of herbal prescriptions are only potentially toxic to certain individuals who have an allergy-like sensitivity to them, and do not do any harm at all to the vast majority of people. The problem is to devise strategies to protect those individuals who do have this immunological sensitivity.
Chinese herbs are widely used in the UK for the treatment of eczema and psoriasis, so it is clear that the incidence of adverse events is quite low, probably affecting one person in tens of thousands. Most individuals definitely appear to tolerate the herbs without apparent harm, and the clinical trial results support this conclusion. The problem is that when the adverse reaction does occur it can clearly be life-threatening. No-one fully understands the mechanisms of such idiosyncratic reactions, which are  also known to occur with some drugs. It is generally suspected that there can be a genetic susceptibility which makes some individuals vulnerable.<P>

It is noteworthy that both of the fatalities involved people of Indian origin. This may indicate a genetic susceptibility, or it may be that both these individuals already had compromised liver function, perhaps as a result of infectious hepatitis earlier in life. In any case, it is clear that people with poor liver function will be particularly at risk. 
However, great caution is undoubtedly needed with all patients. In Case 5 above the woman is known to have had perfectly fine liver function three months previously, but she nonetheless developed severe hepatitis and was hospitalised after taking the herbs for only 13 days.<P>

In the light of the above, the RCHM has taken the view that whatever the precise mechanisms and whether or not a single herb is the cause, the first priority is to protect future patients. The second fatality in particular (Case 6) could almost certainly have been prevented by good practice, and the RCHM has emphasised this by issuing the following updated guidelines36: 

<UL><LI> A detailed case history is essential to determine whether there is any history of jaundice or hepatitis. Where there is such a history, patients must be closely monitored and this must include liver function tests.
<LI> Although hypersensitivity reactions are not directly dose-dependent, continuing caution with dosage is advised for the time being. 
<LI> Patients should be carefully monitored, and in particular practitioners should be alert to any early signs of liver damage37.
<LI> All patients should be given written guidelines warning them to stop taking their herbal medicine and immediately contact their practitioner if they experience symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, flu-like symptoms, and hypochondriac tenderness.
</UL><P>


The practitioners involved in the six cases reported above appear to have been fully trained, but five of the six were not members of the RCHM. In the one case where the practitioner was a member of the RCHM, the Register's guidelines had not been followed. Although the numbers are too small to allow firm conclusions, this may reflect the fact that a good level of training is not enough in itself, but must be complemented with membership of a professional body with Codes of Ethics and Practice, complaints procedures, and channels of regular communication to keep members informed.<P>

A possible addition to the RCHM' s guidelines would be for practitioners to take care to closely monitor patients who consume a lot of alcohol, and this should probably include liver function tests. Practitioners should also be aware that immunoallergic effects are often much worse on re-exposure to the medicine. A patient who has experienced suspicious symptoms and stopped taking their herbs may experience a much more rapid and more severe reaction if they begin to take the herbs again at a later date. Cases 1 and 3 are good examples of this.<P>

It is important to stress to practitioners, most of whom have not experienced any problems with their own patients being adversely affected, that this does not mean that there is not a problem. Since it is probable that only one person in every few thousand is vulnerable to liver damage from the herbs, this would mean that one would have to treat five or ten thousand people before one would expect (statistically) to have one patient become ill with liver damage.<P>

It has been suggested by some agencies that all patients being treated with Chinese herbs should receive routine blood tests for liver damage38. However, most practitioners are resistant to this idea, on grounds of cost and inconvenience to patients and because many patients dislike giving blood samples. It is also true that several prescription drugs carry small risks of liver damage but continue to be used without resort by doctors to liver function testing of all their patients. This illustrates the point that adequate training and good practice are the keys to patient safety.
It is unfortunate that we do not have enough details on these cases to enable us to analyse them in terms of a Chinese medicine approach to the individual's patterns of disharmony. It is possible that factors in patients' diet or lifestyle or constitution may make them more vulnerable to hypersensitivity reactions to some herbs.<P>

It has also been suggested that the overall balance of the prescriptions may be inappropriate in some way, and in particular that they may be focused too much on clearing pathogenic factors and may not do enough to support the Spleen or the Liver. However, many experts on herbal dermatology in China feel that focusing on the pathogenic factors is the correct strategy. Certainly it is true that some of the prescriptions given in these six cases are quite strongly draining, but the prescription used in Case 6 contained a number of herbs to support the Spleen, and the prescription used in Case 2 contained a number of herbs to support blood and yin. Another possible factor is that a high overall dosage of herbs may put additional stress on the Spleen in particular. In addition, it has been suggested that herbs which modern research has shown to have hepato-protective effects should be added to our prescriptions for skin diseases. There is a need for further discussion and debate of all these questions within the profession.<P>

Another question arising from these cases is the absence of reports of liver damage in patients receiving treatment for skin diseases in modern China. It is striking that Case 4 above is of a Chinese woman, so there does not appear to be anything in the way of genetics or diet protecting Chinese patients. The most likely explanation is that hepatitis A and B are endemic in China anyway. It is entirely possible that if there are occasional cases of herb-induced hepatitis in China these are assumed to be infectious in origin and the true cause is missed.<P>

A clear lesson from these tragedies is that the profession must urgently organise national and international reporting mechanisms in order to detect adverse effects from Chinese herbs quickly and effectively. Accurate information is most important. In the UK we are now seeing good levels of co-operation between the profession and bodies such as the National Poisons Unit and Schools of Pharmacy, which will help to improve the flow of information in both directions.<P>

The second lesson is that good patient management is essential. In particular we can identify the following: 
<UL><LI> good communication with patients. Patients must be warned both verbally and in writing of potential adverse effects and of the importance of stopping the herbs and contacting their practitioner should these occur. 
<LI> regular monitoring of patients. Patients should be seen every week or two at first and generally never less than every four weeks. Appointments should last for at least 15 minutes to allow time to fully review each case.
</UL><P>

 
Finally, it is important to remember that Chinese herbal treatment has been shown to be remarkably effective for stubborn and unpleasant skin diseases such as eczema, which cause a great deal of suffering and distress24,25. Our aim must be to continue to offer this beneficial treatment while protecting potentially vulnerable individuals from unnecessary and avoidable harm.

<H3>CONCLUSION </H3>
In conclusion, we can see that the vast majority of adverse events involving Chinese herbs which have been reported in the literature can be avoided by the following measures:

<UL><LI> Chinese herbs should only ever be prescribed by fully trained practitioners of
<LI> Chinese herbal medicine, in accordance with a traditional individualised diagnosis. Training of practitioners should include the ability to monitor for and recognise adverse effects. The RCHM has begun the task of establishing agreed educational standards in the UK and this is clearly a matter of some urgency. Professional bodies will increasingly need to be able to guarantee minimum standards of practice and to enforce codes of ethics and practice, and legal protection of title and self-regulation will be necessary to achieve this.
<LI> Chinese herbs should be prescribed in the traditional manner, according to an individualised diagnosis based on the theory and practice of Oriental medicine. The herbs should be used according to their traditional indications and in established combinations. 
<LI> There should be compulsory Codes of Practice for practitioners which include many of the recommendations made in this paper, including requirements to monitor patients regularly, to arrange regular blood tests before treating patients with a history of liver diseases, to fully inform patients, etc. In the case of the RCHM such a Code already exists, but membership is entirely voluntary and as a result disciplinary procedures are weakened and some practitioners do not join at all. 
<LI> Whenever it is proposed to use herbs in novel ways, for example in the form of chemical extracts, or for symptomatic treatment, then careful and thorough clinical research and monitoring must be undertaken. A similar caution should be applied to the prescribing of obscure or unusual herbs.
<LI> A handful of herbs traditionally known to be seriously toxic, such as Cao Wu and Wu Tao, should probably be restricted to use in hospital settings only. 
<LI> A number of herbs with some potential for toxicity, such as Fu Zi, should probably be restricted to use at specified doses by fully trained practitioners only. Herbs with some potential for toxicity should not be prescribed for patients who are also taking modem drugs. 
<LI> Proper identification and quality control of herbs by manufacturers and suppliers is a key ingredient in enabling the safe practice of Chinese herbal medicine. A minimum requirement would probably be the examination by microscopy and chromatography of each batch of herbs by trained pharmacognocists.  
<LI> Suppliers should not make available patent medicines whose ingredients are not certain, and practitioners should not prescribe them.
<LI> It is interesting to note that these suggestions are similar to the recommendations of the Report of the Working Party on Chinese Medicine appointed by the Secretary for Health and Welfare in the Hong Kong administration. The recommendations include: the registration of herbal practitioners; the creation of a list of "potent herbs" which should only be available with a prescription from a herbal practitioner; licensing of the processing, manufacture, import and distribution of raw herbs and patent medicines; and improvements to the training of both practitioners and dispensers39. 
</UL>

We should remember that adverse effects from Chinese herbs are rare. In Hong Kong, where the use of Chinese herbs is both widespread and unregulated, it has been shown that only 0.2% of the general medical admissions to the Prince of Wales Hospital were due to adverse reactions to Chinese medicine, as compared to 4.4% of admissions caused by Western pharmaceuticals40. As we have seen, improvements in quality control and in the training and regulation of practitioners would substantially reduce the already low incidence of problems involving Chinese medicine. These improvements will assist greatly in establishing Chinese herbal medicine in the West as a safe and effective form of treatment.

Male Infertility and A Discussion of Spermophlebectasia, or Varicosity of the Spermatic Cord Vein


<BR>

</Center>


<HR>


In Traditional Chinese Medicine, most cases of male infertility are related with kidney deficiency; thus, most TCM treatments of infertility concentrate on the kidneys and have good results.  Yet some cases of male infertility have only indirect, or in some cases no relationship to the kidneys, and one such malady is spermophlebectasia, or varicose vein of the spermatic cord.<P>


Spermophlebectasia can cause male infertility for two reasons. First, increased blood in the vein of the spermatic cord can increase testicle temperature, making the testicle a less hospitable environment for sperm production and decreasing or eliminating live sperm count and activity.  Second, prolonged presence of the varicosity can result in poor blood circulation to the area and eventual shrinkage and dysfunction of the testicle, thus making it unable to produce healthy sperm.<P>


Spermophlebectasia can be either a secondary or primary condition.  A secondary type, such as one that might occur in a patient with a tumor in the abdomen, generally requires treatment of the major problem.  In this article, we will focus on primary spermophlebectasia.<P>


Spermophlebectasia most frequently occurs in the left testicle.  In Western medicine, the cause of primary spermophlebectasia is unclear, but there are four main explanations which fall into two theoretical categories:  anatomy and hemodynamics.<P>

<OL>
<LI>The left side vein of the spermatic cord connects to the left kidney vein at a 90 degree angle, while the right side vein of the spermatic cord connects directly to the vena cava.  One suggestion is that the tight angle on the left side increases the pressure on the left side vein, resulting in the varicosity.

<LI>The vein inside the spermatic cord has many valves. Some may have congenital defects which can result in blood flowing backwards from the kidney.  Over time, the conflicting forces may cause other valves to dysfunction, resulting in the varicosity.

<LI>The left kidney vein has to cross the spine to get to the vena cava.  Compared to the right kidney vein, the left has a longer pathway, and it also has to weave through more arteries, which can increase the pressure on the left side.

<LI>When spermophlebectasia occurs in both testicles, the explanation is that since the left and right testicle veins are connected via the veniplex, increased blood pressure in the left can sometimes affect the right side as well.
</OL>

<H3>Symptoms</H3>

Spermophlebectasia is most frequent in males age 20 to 30, because this is usually the age of greatest activity, both sexual and physical.  Usually the chief complaint is pain, but patients with mild cases may only experience pain during a physical exam.  More pronounced cases may have pain including heaviness in the scrotum and generalized pain around the testicles, groin, and lower abdomen.  The pain is aggravated by prolonged standing and walking and unusually frequent sexual activity.  Resting in supine position alleviates pain.<P>


Other symptoms include insomnia, emotional disorder, irritability, anxiety, decreased libido, impotence, premature ejaculation, etc.<P>


<H3>Signs</H3>

Upon physical examination, the scrotum appears very loose and enlarged.  The vein is enlarged, purple, and meandering, and the veniplex is visible.  In some cases varicose veins are also present in the groin and inner thigh.<P>
  

By palpation, the vein feels tangled and spongy.  If you press into the vein, it temporarily shrinks or disappears.  In a supine position the vein will appear smaller and straighter.  <P>


In Western medicine, treatment in mild cases is considered unnecessary.  If the scrotum feels heavy, tight underwear may be recommended to provide support.  But if pain is severe or the condition is causing infertility, then the condition must be treated by surgery.<P>


In traditional Chinese medicine, the condition is first diagnosed as belonging to a particular syndrome, such as liver/kidney deficiency, sinking central qi, stagnation of qi and blood, and dampness and heat accumulation in the lower burner.  A combination of acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine is highly effective in treating spermophlebectasia.<P>

A brief history of Qigong 

<BR>
</FONT>
<A HREF=#Yang>by Yang, Jwing-Ming</A>

</TD></TR> </TABLE>

</Center>

The history of Chinese Qigong can be roughly divided into four periods. We know little about the first period, which is considered to have started when the "Yi Jing" (Book of Changes) was introduced sometime before 1122 B.C., and to have extended until the Han dynasty (206 B.C.) when Buddhism and its meditation methods were imported from India. This infusion brought Qigong practice and meditation into the second period, the religious Qigong era. This period lasted until the Liang dynasty (502-557 A.D.), when it was discovered that Qigong could be used for martial purposes. This was the beginning of the third period, that of martial Qigong. Many different martial Qigong styles were created based on the theories and principles of Buddhist and Daoist Qigong. This period lasted until the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in 1911; from that point Chinese Qigong training was mixed with Qigong practices from India, Japan, and many other countries. <P>

<H3>Before the Han Dynasty (Before 206 B.C.) </H3>
The "Yi Jing" (Book of Changes; 1122 B.C.) was probably the first Chinese book related to Qi. It introduced the concept of the three natural energies or powers (San Cai): Tian (Heaven), Di (Earth), and Ren (Man). Studying the relationship of these three natural powers was the first step in the development of Qigong. <P>

In 1766-1154 B.C. (the Shang dynasty), the Chinese capital was located in today's An Yang in Henan province. An archeological dig there at a late Shang dynasty buIial ground called Yin Xu discovered more than 160,000 pieces of turtle shell and animal bone which were covered with written characters. This writing, called "Jia Gu Wen" (Oracle-Bone Scripture), was the earliest evidence of the Chinese use of the written word. Most of the infonnation recorded was of a religious nature. There was no mention of acupuncture or other medical knowledge, even though it was recorded in the Nei Jing that during the reign of the Yellow emperor (2690-2590 B.C.) Bian Shi (stone probes) were already being used to adjust people's Qi circulation. <P>

During the Zhou dynasty (1122-934 B.C.), Lao Zi (Li Er) mentioned certain breathing techniques in his classic "Dao De Jing" (or Tao Te Ching) (Classic on the Virtue of the Dao). He stressed that the way to obtain health was to "concentrate on Qi and achieve softness" (Zhuan Qi Zhi Rou).(*l) Later, "Shi Ji" (Historical Record) in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States Periods (770-221 B.C.) also described more complete methods of breath training. <P>

About 300 B.C. the Daoist philosopher Zhuang Zi described the relationship between health and the breath in his book "Nan Hua Jing." It states: "The men of old breathed clear down to their heels..." This was not merely a figure of speech, and confirms that a breathing method for Qi circulation was being used by some Daoists at that time. 
During the Qin and Han dynasties (221 B.C.-220 A.D.) there are several medical references to Qigong in the literature, such as the "Nan Jing" (Classic on Disorders) by the famous physician Bian Que, which describes using the breathing to increase Qi circulation. "Jin Kui Yao Lue" (Prescriptions from the Golden Chamber) by Zhang Zhong-Jing discusses the use of breathing and acupuncture to maintain good Qi flow. "Zhou Yi Can Tong Qi" (A Comparative Study of the Zhou (dynasty) Book of Changes) by Wei Bo-Yang explains the relationship of human beings to nature's forces and Qi. It can be seen from this list that up to this time, almost all of the Qigong publications were written by scholars such as Lao Zi and Zhuang Zi, or physicians such as Bian Que and Wei Bo-Yang. <P>

<H3>From the Han Dynasty to the Beginning of the Liang Dynasty (206 B.C.-502 A.D.) </H3>
Because many Han emperors were intelligent and wise, the Han dynasty was a glorious and peaceful period. It was during the Eastern Han dynasty (c. 58 A.D.) that Buddhism was imported to China from India. The Han emperor became a sincere Buddhist; Buddhism soon spread and became very popular. Many Buddhist meditation and Qigong practices, which had been practiced in India for thousands of years, were absorbed into the Chinese culture. The Buddhist temples taught many Qigong practices, especially the still meditation of Chan (Zen), which marked a new era of Chinese Qigong. Much of the deeper Qigong theory and practices which had been developed in India were brought to China. Unfortunately, since the training was directed at attaining Buddhahood, the training practices and theory were recorded in the Buddhist bibles and kept secret. For hundreds of years the religious Qigong training was never taught to laymen. Only in this century has it been available to the general populace. <P>

Not long after Buddhism had been imported into China, a Daoist by the name of Zhang Dao-Ling combined the traditional Daoist principles with Buddhism and created a religion called Dao Jiao. Many of the meditation methods were a combination of the principles and training methods of both sources. 
Since Tibet had developed its own branch of Buddhism with its own training system and methods of attaining Buddhahood, Tibetan Buddhists were also invited to China to preach. In time, their practices were also absorbed. <P>

It was in this period that the traditional Chinese Qigong practitioners finally had a chance to compare their arts with the religious Qigong practices imported mainly from India. While the 
scholarly and medical Qigong had been concerned with maintaining 
and improving health, the newly imported religious Qigong was 
concerned with far more. Contemporary documents and Qigong 
styles show clearly that the religious practitioners trained their Qi to 
a much deeper level, working with many internal functions of the 
body, and strove to obtain control of their bodies, minds, and spirits 
with the goal of escaping from the cycie of reincarnation. <P>

While the Qigong practices and meditations were being passed 
down secretly within the monasteries, traditional scholars and 
physicians continued their Qigong research. During the Jin dynasty 
in the 3rd century A.D., a famous physician named Hua Tuo used 
acupuncture for anesthesia in surgery. The Daoist Jun Qian used 
the movements of animals to create the Wu Qin Xi (Five Animal 
Sports), which taught people how to increase their Qi circulation 
through specific movements. Also, in this period a physician named 
Ge Hong mentioned in his book Bao Pu Zi using the mind to lead 
and increase Qi. Sometime in the period of 420 to 581 A.D. Tao 
Hong-Jing compiled the "Yang Shen Yan Ming Lu" (Records of 
Nourishing the Body and Extending Life), which showed many 
Qigong techniques. <P>

<H3>From the Liang Dynasty to the End of the Qing Dynasty (502-1911 A.D.)</H3>
During the Liang dynasty (502-557 A.D.) the emperor invited a 
Buddhist monk named Da Mo, who was once an Indian prince, to 
preach Buddhism in China. The emperor decided he did not like Da 
Mo's Buddhist theory, so the monk withdrew to the Shaolin Temple. 
When Da Mo arrived, he saw that the priests were weak and sickly, 
so he shut himself away to ponder the problem. He emerged after 
nine years of seclusion and wrote two classics: "Yi Jin Jing" (or Yi 
Gin Ching)(Muscle/Tendon Changing Classic) and "Xi Sui Jing" (or 
Shii Soei Ching)(Marrow/Brain Washing Classic). The 
Muscle/Tendon Changing Classic taught the priests how to gain 
health and change their physical bodies from weak to strong. The 
Marrow/Brain Washing Classic taught the priests how to use Qi to 
clean the bone marrow and strengthen the blood and immune 
system, as well as how to energize the brain and attain 
enlightenment. Because the Marrow/Brain Washing Classic was 
harder to understand and practice, the training methods were 
passed down secretly to only a very few disciples in each generation. <P>

After the priests practiced the Muscle/Tendon Changing 
exercises, they found that not only did they improve their health, but 
they also greatly increased their strength. When this training was 
integrated into the martial arts forms, it increased the effectiveness 
of their techniques. In addition to this martial Qigong training, the 
Shaolin priests also created five animal styles of Gongfu which 
imitated the way different animals fight. The animals imitated were 
the tiger, leopard, dragon, snake, and crane. <P>

Outside of the monastery, the development of Qigong continued during the Sui and Tang dynasties (581-907 A.D.). Chao Yuan-Fang compiled the "Zhu Bing Yuan Hou Lun" (Thesis on the Origins and 
Symptoms of Various Diseases), which is a veritable encyclopedia of 
Qigong methods listing 260 different ways ofincreasing the Qi flow. The 
"Qian Jin Fang" (Thousand Gold Prescriptions) by Sun Si-Mao described the method of leading Qi, and also described the use of the Six Sounds. 
The Buddhists and Daoists had already been using the Six Sounds to regulate Qi in the internal organs for some time. Sun Si-Mao also introduced a massage system called Lao Zi's 49 Massage Techniques. 
"Wai Tai Mi Yao" (The Extra Important Secret) by Wang Tao discussed 
the use of breathing and herbal therapies for disorders of Qi circulation. <P>

During the Song, Jin, and Yuan dynasties (960-1368 A.D.), 
"Yang Shen Jue" (Life Nourishing Secrets) by Zhang An-Dao 
discussed several Qigong practices. "Ru Men Shi Shi" (The 
Confucian Point of View) by Zhang Zi-He describes the use of Qigong 
to cure external injuries such as cuts and sprains. "Lan Shi Mi 
Cang" (Secret Library of the Orchid Room) by Li Guo describes using 
Qigong and herbal remedies for internal disorders. "Ge Zhi Yu Lun" 
(A Further Thesis of Complete Study) by Zhu Dan-Xi provided a 
theoretical explanation for the use of Qigong in curing disease. <P>

During the Song dynasty (960-1279 A.D.), Chang San-Feng is 
believed to have created Taijiquan (or Tai Chi Chuan). Tai;ji followed 
a different approach in its use of Qigong than did Shaolin. While 
Shaolin emphasized Wai Dan (External Elixir) Qigong exercises, 
Taiji emphasized Nei Dan (Internal Elixir) Qigong training. <P>

In 1026 A.D. the famous brass man of acupuncture was 
designed and built by Dr. Wang Wei-Yi. Before that time, the many 
publications which discussed acupuncture theory, principles, and 
treatment techniques disagreed with each other, and left many 
points unclear. When Dr. Wang built his brass man, he also wrote a 
book called "Tong Ren Yu Xue Zhen Jiu Tu" (Illustration of the Brass 
Man Acupuncture and Moxibustion). He explained the relationship 
of the 12 organs and the 12 Qi channels, clarified many of the points 
of confusion, and, for the first time, systematically organized 
acupuncture theory and principles. <P>

In 1034 A.D. Dr. Wang used acupuncture to cure the emperor 
Ren Zong. With the support of the emperor, acupuncture flourished. 
In order to encourage acupuncture medical research, the emperor 
built a temple to Bian Que, who wrote the Nan Jing, and worshiped 
him as the ancestor of acupuncture. Acupuncture technology 
developed so much that even the Jin race in the distant North 
requested the brass man and other acupuncture technology as a 
condition for peace. Between 1102 to 1106 A.D. Dr. Wang dissected 
the bodies of prisoners and added more information to the Nan Jing. 
His work contributed greatly to the advancement of Qigong and 
Chinese medicine by giving a clear and systematic idea of the 
circulation of Qi in the human body. <P>

Later, in the Southern Song dynasty (1127-1279 A.D.), Marshal 
Yue Fei was credited with creating several internal Qigong exercises 
and martial arts. It is said that he created the Eight Pieces of 
Brocade to improve the health of his soldiers. He is also known as 
the creator of the internal martial style Xing Yi. Eagle style martial 
artists also claim that Yue Fei was the creator of their style. <P>

From then until the end of the Qing dynasty (1911 A.D.), many 
other Qigong styles were founded. The well known ones include Hu 
Bu Gong (Tiger Step Gong), Shi Er Zhuang (Twelve Postures) and 
Jiao Hua Gong (Beggar Gong). Also in this period, many documents 
related to Qigong were published, such as "Bao Shen Mi Yao" (The 
Secret Important Document of Body Protection) by Cao Yuan-Bai, 
which described moving and stationary Qigong practices; and "Yang 
Shen Fu Yu" (BriefIntroduction to Nourishing the Body) by Chen Ji
Ru, about the three treasures: Jing (essence), Qi (internal energy), 
and Shen (spirit). Also, "Yi Fan Ji Jie" (The Total Introduction to 
Medical Prescriptions) by Wang Fan-An reviewed and summarized 
the previously published materials; and "Nei Gong Tu Shuo" 
(Illustrated Explanation of Nei Gong) by Wang Zu-Yuan presented 
the Twelve Pieces of Brocade and explained the idea of combining 
both moving and stationary Qigong. <P>

In the late Ming dynasty (around 1640 A.D.), a martial Qigong 
style, Huo Long Gong (Fire Dragon Gong), was created by the Taiyang 
martial stylists. The well known internal martial art style Ba Gua 
Zhang (or Ba Kua Chang)(Eight Trigrams Palm) is believed to have 
been created by Dong Hai-Chuan late in the Qing dynasty (1644-1911 
A.D.). This style is now gaining in popularity throughout the world. 
During the Qing dynasty, Tibetan meditation and martial 
techniques became widespread in China for the first time. This was 
due to the encouragement and interest of the Manchurian Emperors 
in the royal palace, as well as others of high rank in society. <P>

<H3>From the End of Qing Dynasty to the Present </H3>
Before 1911 A.D., Chinese society was very conservative and 
old-fashioned. Even though China had been expanding its contact 
with the outside world for the previous hundred years, the outside 
world had little influence beyond the coastal regions. With the 
overthrow of the Qing dynasty in 1911 and the founding of the 
Chinese Republic, the nation began changing as never before. 
Since this time Qigong practice has entered a new era. Because of 
the ease of communication in the modern world, Western culture 
now has great influence on the Orient. Many Chinese have opened 
their minds and changed their traditional ideas, especially in 
Taiwan and Hong Kong. Various Qigong styles are now being 
taught openly, and many formerly secret documents are being 
published. Modern methods of communication have opened up 
Qigong to a much wider audience than ever before, and people now 
have the opportunity to study and understand many different 
styles. In addition, people are now able to compare Chinese Qigong to similar arts from other countries such as India, Japan, Korea, 
and the Middle East. <P>

I believe that in the near future Qigong will be considered the 
most exciting and challenging field of research. It is an ancient 
science just waiting to be investigated with the help of the new 
technologies now being developed at an almost explosive rate. 
Anything we can do to accelerate this research will greatly help 
humanity to understand and improve itself. <P>

A Chi Kung (Qi Gong) Primer

<HR>

<H3>  Introduction</H3>
<B>Chi Kung (Qi Gong) </B>means literally, "Energy Cultivation," and refers to  exercises which improve health and longevity as well as increase the sense of  harmony within oneself and in the world. There are thousands of such  exercises.  In fact, anything you do with the intention of benefiting your  energy can be considered Chi Kung. All Chi Kung contains common principles -  mind, eyes, movement and breath. Another way to express this is - the mind is  the presence of intention, the eyes are the focus of intention, the movement  is the action of intention, the breath is the flow of intention. These are  the "secrets" of Chi Kung - and they are often taught at the beginning of  training. Of course it takes years of exploring these ideas in practice to  begin to truly grasp their significance.<P>

<B>Kung Fu (Gung Fu) </B> means "Progress Achieved through Discipline." Discipline  means learning through action. The word discipline in English is related to  the word disciple - one who learns. In the West the idea of Kung Fu is  commonly thought of only in terms of martial arts. In fact the term applies  to any activity in which paying attention and practicing to improve are   important - in other words just about any worthwhile aspect of life.<P>

Chi Kung is actually a specific example of a larger catagory of exercises  called <B>Nui Kung (Nei Gong) </B> (literally - "Inner Cultivation").  Nui Kung  encompasses a large variety of practices including standing, seated, moving,  static and even dreaming exercises. "Internal" martial arts such as Tai Chi  Chuan (Tai Ji Quan), Ba Kua (Pa Gua) and Hsing I (Xing Yi) are also included  within this general catagory. In their advanced levels Nui Gong exercises  cultivate access to energies commonly outside of the human experience.  Obviously, if it is possible for humans to access these energies, they cannot  truly be outside of human experience, perhaps only outside of commonly  perceived consensual reality. Advanced sets of Nui Kung exercises focus on  different specific aspects of experience, including altering states of  consciousness, opening to universal energies, and manifesting unusual  abilities and powers. Many of these advanced exercises included within Nui  Kung are considered dangerous if taught to the unprepared and all of them  must be treated with respect to avoid possible difficulties resulting from  their practice.<P>
<P>
<HR>
<H3>Healing with Chi</H3>
Recent articles have emphasized the use of Chi energy for healing others.  This is referred to as "External Chi Healing,"<A HREF="ExtQi.htm"> (External Qi Kung)</a> or Chi Sao.  Chi energy is directed through the hands or eyes towards the patient.  Often, "miraculous" improvements in health are cited as a result of a Chi Kung practitioner working with an ill person.  External Chi healing is historically one of the main applications of Chi energy cultivation. <P>

If you are going to cultivate Chi and apply it in healing work with others there are important precautions to heed.  The most important of these is to remain clear of personal attachment to the process.  Nothing will deplete energy faster than seeking ego gratification with the "power" of your healing work.  Fortunately for most, these tendencies usually get worked out early in the process, particularly if they are working with a teacher who is themself clear.<P>

There are also numerous levels and depths of this healing ability.  Certain healers using externally-directed Chi seem to have better effects with some illnesses than others.  Ultimately it may be that to truly master the art of directing Chi in the healing process you must develop a wide spectrum of abilities and be able to apply them in a variety of types of imbalances in body, emotions, mind, soul and spirit.<P>
<HR>
<H3>The Path of Qi Gong</H3>
The ultimate goal of all Qi Gong is harmonious existence and action in all situations.  This level of achievement approaches Mastery.  The elements that characterize this level of experience include:  curiosity, ease in action, clarity of focus and intention, perseverence, non-attachment, resilience, openness, creativity, responsiveness and fluid balance.   Also, Mastery shows not in someone knowing everything, but rather someone willing to continue learning regardless of their level of achievement.<P>

Finally, although you may find books or teachers professing to teach you the secrets of Chi Kung and the power of it's applications, it always comes down to what you, yourself are willing to practice and experience.  The layers are there for you to explore when you make yourself available for the learning.  At the same time, it doesn't hurt to learn whatever you can from those who have stepped through the doors before you.  In the words of the Zen poet, Basho, "Do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the men of old, seek what they sought."<P>

Introduction to Qigong

<H2>Introduction</H2>


Qigong (pronounced chee goong) is a Chinese system of
physical training, philosophy, and preventive and therapeutic
health care. Qi (or chi) means air, breath of life or vital
essence. Gong means work, self-discipline, achievement or mastery.
This art combines aerobic conditioning, isometrics, isotonics,
meditation, and relaxation. Qigong is a discipline whose practice
allows us to gain control over the life force that courses
throughout our bodies. There are more than 3,000 varieties of
qigong, and five major qigong traditions: the Taoist, Buddhist,
Confucian, martial arts, and medical. Qigong is thus a soft form of
a related set of disciplines that includes Taiji (Tai Chi Quan) and
the hard form of Kung Fu. Here I treat only the medical tradition.<P>

       Like the other forms, medical qigong is "the cultivation and
deliberate control of a higher form of vital energy" (Dong & Esser
1990:xi). It is also, as Yan Xin (1991: i) defines it, "an ancient
philosophical system of harmonious integration of the human body
with the universe." As a radical denial of the human species'
separation from nature, qigong challenges the foundations of modern
Western biomedical thought.<P>

       Medical qigong involves breathing exercises combined with
meditation. The breathing exercises induce help induce the state of
meditation, and vice versa. One is aware of what is going on, but
not too aware, fully relaxed but not in a trance. In a qigong
state, cares and troubles wash away. Replacing them are positive
images, increased confidence, and enhanced spirit. Eventually,
there will be no distractions, depressing thoughts or worries.
Through meditation one gains feelings of happiness. This in turn
stimulates circulation of blood and qi, or life force. If one is
ill, over time the body's functions are thus able to return to
normal. If one is not ill, the existing sense of wellness and
well-being increases. People of all ages can learn to practice
qigong, and so develop and maintain internal vigour and good
health.<P>

       During the Chinese Cultural Revolution (1965-76) the
Communist Party and Red Guards suppressed qigong. In about 1978 it
began to make a comeback. In China in the 1980s there was an
upsurge of interest in qigong. Today, more than 70 million Chinese
practice qigong every day (McGee w/Chow 1994:xiii). Some do this to
treat and cure an existing illness. Others are trying to prevent
the onset of disease. Still others want to feel and perform better,
experience higher levels of energy and stamina, and slow down the
ageing process. Qigong is least effective against acute illness or
medical emergencies. It is better at preventing disease, and
treating chronic conditions or disabilities. Inspired by tales of
the qigong masters' miracle cures (see Eisenberg w/Wright 1985),
many Westerners are travelling to China for treatment.<P>

     Now qigong is rapidly invading North America. In 1988 the
Chinese held in Beijing the first World Conference for exchanging
qigong medical research (MacRitchie 1993: 4). Later world
conferences happened in Tokyo and Berkeley. Another will take place
in the summer of 1996 in New York City. Today, North American
psychological, physiological and medical researchers are studying
qigong with rapidly increasing interest. University students
throughout North America have formed qigong practice groups, and on
the Internet WorldWide Web qigong home pages are blossoming. A very
large movement is underway.<P>

       The Chinese have found qigong an effective way to treat
substance abuse and obesity. This gentle art improves delivery of
oxygen to the body's cells, reduces stress and improves bowel
functioning. Chinese doctors have applied qigong in hospitals and
clinics to treat individuals suffering from a variety of
ailments. These include allergies, arthritis, asthma, bowel
problems, constipation, diabetes, gastritis, gout, headaches, heart
disease and hypertension. The list goes on: chronic kidney disease,
liver disease, lower back pain, Meniere's disease, myopia, obesity,
neurasthenia, paralysis induced by external injury, retinopathy
(deterioration of the back of the eye), rheumatism, sciatic
neuralgia, sleeplessness, stress, torticollis, ulcers, and
peripheral vascular disease. Qigong can successfully
treats cancer and reduce or eliminate side effects from
radiation and chemotherapy. It is helpful in treating aphasia (loss
or impairment of ability to speak), cerebral palsy, multiple
sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and post-stroke syndrome. It is
especially useful in treating any kind of chronic pain, and chronic
disorders of the digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular and nervous
systems.<P>

       Qigong can help one fight virtually any disease. Through
qigong, patients can cure many of the 50% of all diseases that
Western doctors dismiss as untreatably 'psychosomatic.' If you try
qigong to treat an existing illness, do so if possible under the
guidance of a licensed Chinese medical doctor. Don't try it
completely on your own. Beginners need professional supervision.
Here the doctor or qigong practitioner acts as an advisor and
teacher, rather than a Western-style repair technician. The patient
must be an active partner in the health care process.<P>




<H2>Avoiding Disease</H2>


     In addition to providing cures, qigong helps people prevent
the onset of diseases. This can save money and prevent suffering.
Qigong increases strength, improves resistance to infectious
diseases and premature senility, and helps assure a long life.
Practising qigong can greatly reduce the danger of stroke. It can
improve blood sugar levels for diabetics. Because it normalizes the
level of sex hormones, it can correct sexual impotence and
frigidity. Its stress relieving effects improves one's sex life --
both quantity and quality. Practice of qigong can speed recovery
from surgery, and from sports and other injuries by up to 50%
(McGee w/Chow 1994:17-9).<P>

     Qigong offers individuals a way to achieve a relaxed,
harmonious state of dynamic equilibrium. It typically improves
their overall health status, allowing them to maintain a life free
from pain, and full of vigour and grace. Qigong is a proper
therapeutic practice with which to address virtually any chronic
health problem. The various forms of Chinese medical massage
(tuinah) derive directly from qigong. These practices compliment
and supplement orthodox medical interventions.<P>

       Many millions of people have learned and practised qigong
in its many thousand year history. We do not know how old qigong
is, but the further we go back in Chinese history the larger qigong
looms as a cultural force. Some turtle-shell artifacts conclusively
show the art was important at least 7,000 years ago. Archaeological
evidence suggests the practice may go back a million years. About
2,000 years ago The *Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine*
first systematically described qigong practice. Now qigong has
finally reached North America -- through the increasing popularity
of kung fu movies, acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine. Qigong
was a natural discovery of the New Age movement. Its underlying
philosophy and practice both serve that movement's goals: qigong
does 'raise consciousness' in significant respects.<P>





<H2>How does Qigong Work?</H2>


     How does qigong serve this consciousness raising function? Its
practice makes people sensitive to the internal operations of their
bodies, and it helps to reveal the body's place within nature's
oneness. This permits us to build up resistance to imbalances and
blockages affecting our qi. This sensitivity aids the integration
of our opposite yin and yang internal factors within the universal
order -- of which we are a part. The qigong student learns how
false is the separation of body and mind. That distinction
Descartes first postulated in the 1600s. Today most Westerners
still accept it. We may instead understand qi as the force that
integrates the relationship between body (matter, structure) and
mind (process, function). Chinese medicine strongly emphasizes
relationships between people and nature. As Dong and Esser
(1994:66) clearly show, qigong as an integral part of Chinese
medicine:<P>



       <BLOCKQUOTE>Chinese herbology, acupuncture, and chi gong are three
       parts of a single entity, as closely related as water,
       steam, and ice. They can be and often are used
       separately, and may be used together. With dietetics and
       massage they are considered to be the indispensable
       components of traditional Chinese health care.... While
       acupuncture and herbal medicine typically focus on curing
       sickness, chi gong usually focuses on maintaining good
       health (as do massage and balanced -- for yin and yang --
       nutrition).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

       In the philosophy of qigong, a primary aim is to maintain or
restore balance and harmony of mind-body. Through qigong, one can
build up qi and move it to where a disturbance or blockage occurs.
Practitioners gain more than improved health. They learn another
way of looking at and experiencing the dynamic unity of life, one
far removed from the disenchanted and alienated thoughtways common
in Western civilization. Students of qigong learn to fulfil their
potential to self-actualize as highly successful members of our
species.<P>




<H2>What does Qigong Do?</H2>


     Practising qigong lowers blood pressure, pulse rates,
metabolic rates, lactate production, and oxygen demand. It raises
the endocrine system's capabilities. It also has a regulating
effect on the substances cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cyclic
guanosine monophosphate. These substances play basic roles in
respiration and the provision of oxygen to the body's cells. The
sense of serenity qigong produces results partly from a slightly
increased body temperature, and an increased rate of oxygen
absorption. Qigong activates qi, improves blood circulation, and
balances yin yang. It bolsters the immune system, and stimulates
the conductivity of the meridians and channels through which qi
flows (Dong & Esser 1994:94-6).<P>

     In Chinese medical theory, many diseases come from adverse
environmental conditions such as (MacRitchie 1993: 64):<P>



    <BLOCKQUOTE> heat, cold, wind, dryness and humidity; wrong diet; spoiled
     food; worms and microbes; poisoning and pollution; trauma and
     accidents. Internal conditions can arise from excess or
     deficient emotions of anger, joy, sympathy, grief or fear
     [and] inappropriate mental attitudes and beliefs. There are
     also maladies of the spirit which can cause serious problems.
     These factors can cause one's chi [qi] to become excessive,
     deficient, stuck, blocked, congested or stagnant, and thereby
     cause all manner of problems.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

When the immune system is strong, one is emotionally centered
within one's body, and qi and blood are flowing freely, then most
diseases should disappear.<P>

       The goal of practising qigong is to make our qi circulate
strongly in our bodies. This helps us resist or overcome imbalances
or blockages and their resulting disharmonies. That is also the
goal of acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine. Practising qigong
helps us intuit the infinity of the universe. It lets us sense our
place as organized clusters of energy-information within the
immense whole. Qi is an informational message and its carrier, a
complex energy substance basic to life itself. Chinese medicine can
prolong life, vitality and well-being by slowing the ageing
process. This it accomplishes due to the affinities of certain
herbs to qi and the milieu within which qi exists. Qigong therefore
'fits' into the regimen of Chinese medicine. The qigong art thus
plays a fully active role to prevent disease or permit recovery.<P>

       One need not become a qigong master to experience many of
its healing effects. For health purposes, you need to learn only a
few exercises. Conversely, qigong is far from being an instant
cure-all. To benefit one must achieve a state of tranquillity, find
release from tension, build a positive attitude, and develop
strong, committed will power. We can get benefits in one of three
ways. First, one can go to a qigong master for treatment by that
master's external qi. This is only possible in China, or perhaps at
times in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, or
Vancouver. Any one particular master may be unable to cure your
problem (they are specialists!). Second, one can seek get treatment
from a master and practice exercise and meditation. Third, in a
supervised group, one can learn to treat oneself. This last is the
only real option for most North Americans.<P>

       Under the third option, to gain full benefits of qigong
requires time, patience, commitment to its practice, determination
and persistence. This art involves more than simple physical
training. It requires educating one's breathing and thought
processes. This means increasing one's ability to sense one's body,
and to feel and imagine. As with any other aspect of human
endeavour, some people will prove more adept at the art than
others, and so will progress more quickly. However, anyone with
enough motivation can learn adequate qigong skills to make a large
impact upon one's quality of life. This can take from a minimum of
three months up to a year (Dong & Esser 1990:52). There are no
shortcuts. There are also though no obvious limits to how far one
may progress.<P>




<H2>Some Caveats</H2>


     Because qigong thins blood and increases circulation, women
should not practice it during menstruation. If you have internal
bleeding, or bleeding after tooth extraction or trauma, avoid
qigong exercises until the condition disappears. Avoid exercising
if you feel dizzy. Qigong is not for severely disturbed mental
patients, pregnant women or people suffering from acute infectious
diseases. Do not eat or drink within an hour and a half before a
session. Especially avoid alcohol. When exercising, face either
North or South, in line with the earth's magnetic field. Exercise
at the same time(s) of day and the same days through the week,
except do more on holidays.<P>

     Sustenance energy comes into the body, we think, partly from
the sky and air, and only partly from the earth through what we
eat. The lungs take in qi from the air. One can teach the skin at
a few acupuncture points to take in qi energy-information from the
sunlight, moonlight, starlight, and electric lights, etc. Qigong
involves a conscious effort to increase our connectedness with the
universe. That means taking in more sustenance energy from non-food
sources. For novice qigongers, it is exhilarating to take in energy
directly from the universe. There is a consequent temptation to
slight one's food-based nutritional needs. People with a tendency
toward anorexia may find the tendency growing during a period of
intensive qigong practice. If so, they must stop the exercises
until the condition recedes. Fasting (bigu) can have a place in
qigong. However, undertake a genuine fast only under the strict
supervision of a Chinese medical doctor well versed in qigong.<P>

       People often want to try as quickly as possible to emit
external qi like a qigong master through the eyes, fingertips
or palms. This can be dangerous. One should not attempt it except
after long years of practice, and only then under close supervision
of a qigong master or Chinese medical doctor. Do not be in any
hurry to emit your qi. Doing that can dangerously deplete your own
vitality. Avoid sexual intercourse for at least one hour before and
after a qigong session.<P>

     There are limits to what you can learn about qigong from
reading. One really should begin to practice this art by enrolling
in a course or joining an organized group.<P>

Yoga and Oriental Medicine

<BR>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

Yoga has been practiced in the Orient for over 5,000 years.  Patanjali compiled and reformulated the yoga philosophy which was handed down from India's highest age.  In his sutras or threads he expounds on the many practices of yoga - spiritual disciplines, meditation techniques - which enable a person to achieve the highest state of man's evolution  oneness with god and ever-new-joy.  This "special knowledge" spread across the Himalayas especially with the spread of Buddhism to China.
The Chinese were greatly influenced by the knowledge from India.  and they used the Indian knowledge  to enhance their own native practices of Tai Qi and Qi Gong and Taoist Yoga.  Both Yoga and Tai Qi and Qi Gong are exercises formatted to increase longevity, open the meridian system and thereby prevent disease.  <P>

<HR>

<H3>How do yoga and the meridian system work together?</H3>
While acupuncture treats specific diseases and disharmonies by unblocking stagnation in the organs and meridians, yoga is a general exercise form that prevents disease by keeping the meridians open and the qi or energy flowing.  Yoga in this sense is like self-massage.  <P>

The primary step in maintaining health and healing disease is to release musculo-skeletal holding patterns which are intimately related to more internal physical and their accompanying mental symptoms.  This is the basis of healing.  <P>

Specific Yoga postures invigorate certain meridians.  For example, backbends energize the yang aspect of the body, they generate heat and energy, while forward bends emphasize the yin or cooling, and calming aspects.  If you feel sluggish or cold backbends will give you energy by stimulating the Kidneys.  The Kidneys in Oriental medicine are the "root" of yin and yang.  Also in Western scientific medicine it is understood that the Kidneys are the first organs formed in the fetus.  <P>

If you have insomnia or too much energy forward bends are more suitable because they have a soothing and calming effect emphasizing the yin aspects of the body.   Right side bends and all twisting movements augment the liver and gallbladder while left side bends invigorate the spleen and pancreas<P>

The complementary nature of yoga and acupuncture (and massage) is reflected in their common goal of releasing stagnation of energy in the meridian systems and their related organs or in the blood.  While yoga provides the format to release the blockage acupuncture and meridian theory provides a framework to understand which poses are best for a particular condition.   Additionally, herbs can tonify as well as unblock stagnation.  Our overly fast lifestyles, combined with poor eating habits and a polluted environment can create deficiencies that herbs can help to correct.  The Chinese pharmacopia is the largest, most advanced categorization of plants animals and minerals in all the world.  It has withstood the test of time.  <P>

Thus, yoga. acupuncture and herbs help to balance the body and mind and create more consciousness towards the body's internal processes.  <P>

Invariably the poses you dislike to do the most are the best for you.  The areas of weakness or decreased flexibility are usually places of stagnation in the meridian system.  They are the most worthy of your attention and offer the most rewards upon investigation.   For example, a person with poor digestion will almost always have weak abdominal muscles.  Thus, properly performing asanas that emphasize the belly will move the energy of the low belly as well as strengthen the abdominal muscles and thereby help to alleviate the problem.  <P>

Similarly headaches and stagnation in the meridians of the muscles of the neck and shoulders can be alleviated by yoga because the postures circulate energy throughout the meridian system.  <P>

There is a saying in Chinese Medicine that is proven over and over again and the end of every yoga class, "When the mind is calm the qi flows smoothly, and conversely when the qi is made to flow smoothly the mind is calm".  Isn't that why we practice yoga?<P>

Qi Gong is the process of exercising mental intent to direct one's internal energy through the body.  This can be used for a variety of purposes, as a self-healing technique, as a technique for healing others, as a martial art, and as a means by which you can enrich every aspect of your life.  This article comes to Acupuncture.com from a long-time practitioner of Qi Gong who has discovered how to incorporate what Chinese philosophy has to offer directly into one's lifestyle.<BR>
-Acupuncture.com
<HR>

     <b>Intention is everything.  </b>Well, okay, not everything.  But it is a key part of
every experience.  In a certain way, intention can be considered the key when
doing anything in the world.  The tricky part is to remember that every moment
is a moment of intention and that makes every moment a moment of creation. 
For most of us this is happening on a completely unconscious level most of the
time. <P>


     Think about it this way - intention is fueled by thoughts and each thought
carries something like the weight of a piece of paper - by itself one doesn't weigh
much.  All day long we are having thoughts - moment by moment.  As we stack
these thoughts on top of each other (like pieces of paper) after a while they
become quite heavy indeed!  If you only had 500 thoughts each day (most of us
have lots more than this!) you would have a "ream" of thoughts fueling your
intention for that day.  If these thoughts are all aligned and working together,
things get done.  If they work at cross purposes, little or nothing gets done.  This
means that it is useful to notice how this process occurs and, when possible, to
focus our intention to increase our life-force and energy, etc. rather than on old,
habitual thoughts which have not proven effective.<P>


     Nothing demonstrates this more than a little exercise you can easily do. 
Simply intend that you become aware of how intention acts in your life.  Spend a
week, during which time you regularly remind yourself of this intention and see
what happens.  No obsessing or fixating on it, and definitely no "doing" anything
to fix it, just a regular, gentle reminder of what you intend regarding awareness
of intention.  After the week make a note of what you have noticed.  <P>


     If this proves interesting, continue by identifying one area of your life
which you would like to change.  This may be related to work, relationships,
health, money, personal growth, etc.  Just pick one area where you are not
entirely satisfied with your experience.  Identify exactly how you are dissatisfied. 
Now figure out what the very best experience could be for you in that situation -
not a little bit better, not as good as other people you know - the absolute best
you can even imagine.  When you've done that spend some time seeing if you can
imagine it being even better!  When you have it, turn it into a statement - an
example might be, "I intend experiencing resilient, radiant, robust health now
and always."  Notice that in this example we don't say, "I intend getting over this
rotten cold and finally feeling better," or any other limited, "factual" statement. 
We are not going for factual, i.e. what you think may be true or possible, but
rather what it would be if it was as good as you can imagine.  Work on the
statement a bit until it looks/feels/sounds right.  When the statement is right it
will actually be kind of exciting or even inspiring to you to contemplate the
experience as you say the statement.<P>


     With your statement prepared, practice saying it aloud to your self, along
with any imagining you can do about what it would feel like, look like, sound
like, etc.  The best times to do this are right before sleep and just when you wake
up.  If speaking aloud might disturb someone you can go into another room
(bathroom works well) or speak very softly to yourself.  Of course you can
remind yourself about it at other times during the day - just make sure you do it
at least one regular time each day.<P>


     Be as elaborate and detailed as you want, but not so much that it becomes
an onerous task just to make the statement.  It should always be interesting and
even exciting.  If you find it is becoming too routine or boring it's time to change
the statement.  After a week or two you may want to add other statements to the
process.<P>


     One additional note:  Tension implies fear and fear generates it's own
intention - usually the opposite of what you think you're intending.  Intentional
work is therefore best done from "the eye of the hurricane."  In other words, no
matter what is going on around you, be relaxed, confident and playful when
making intentional statements.  Intentional work has the property of EASE in its
application.  If you are forcing, imposing or otherwise struggling to make
something happen, you're generating tension and increasing the likelihood that
opposition to your intention will occur.<P>

     <FONT SIZE=7>N</FONT>o species or idea survives for long unless it is fundamentally sound
and able to adapt to its ever-changing environment.  The 5,000 year-old
concepts of the Chinese Five Elemental Phases (Wu Xing) continue their
usefulness to this day.   The Five Phases of Personal Evolution is a model for
human evolution based the structure and processes of the ancient Five
Elemental Phases.  It combines with these concepts aspects of the Native
American Warrior's Path, NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) and Qi Gong
energy cultivation movements.  This synthesis, originally refined during a
three-year period through an advanced Taoist Nei Gong exercise called the
Five Dragons, represents a further evolution of the classical Five Phases.<P>
     Below is a skeletal representation of the Five-Phase Personal Evolution
Model.  Each phase as well as each interaction in this model matches major
aspects of the traditional Five Phases.<P>

<HR>

<H2>PHASE CORRESPONDENCES</H2>
     Each phase correspondence can be understood in positive, process-
oriented terms reflecting the "ideal" attributes of each.  These ideal states are
guidelines or objectives for balanced and integrated functioning.  They also
reflect the relationships and interactions between phases.<P>


    <H3> FIRE:  </H3>Representing the heart as well as the Shen (Spirit), Fire
corresponds with Opening - unconditional giving, responding to events with
spontaneous resiliency and adaptability.  Our ability to show compassion,
experience joy, and share with others resides here, as does the aliveness in our
eyes.  Fire pathology shows as being too open-hearted (to the point of self-
detriment), little or no sense of limits or boundaries in interpersonal relations,
inability to give emotionally or to be spontaneous.  <P>
       
     <H3>EARTH: </H3> Corresponding with the spleen and Yi (Mind), Earth is
associated with Connecting - patience, being in the moment, focusing
thoughtful attention and making useful mental associations.  It is also the
ability to be clearly in the moment.  Patience, stability, home, service and
tasting Life belong here. Earth pathology manifests as obsessiveness, inability
to be in the moment, acting in a scattered or distracted way (not present), lack
of awareness of surroundings, or difficulty moving (stuckness).       <P>

    <H3> METAL:</H3>  Metal (Gold), lungs and P'o (Corporeal Soul), reflects Releasing
- stepping back from an experience to evaluate and sort it out, refining goals
and directions and the ability to let go of excessive emotional attachments to
people and events.  Inspiration, acknowledging self and others and refining
one's character all show up here.  Metal pathology is characterized by,
chronic grieving & saddness, aloofness, obsessiveness, living in the past or
extreme attachments.<P>

     <H3>WATER:</H3>  Kidneys and Zhi (Will).  Water relates to Aligning -  setting
foundations, maintaining integrity & balance, gathering energies, and storing
reserves.  It is the ability to keep rooted even in the face of chaos.  It may be
thought of as a rudder in the flow of life.  There are times where we enter the
Unknown and must allow Life to guide us without preconceptions,
judgements or panic - Aligning is our optimal response.  Water pathology
might show up as lack of direction, not completing things, extremism, fear, or
fixation on only one way of doing things.         <P>

     <H3>WOOD:</H3>  Wood, liver and Hun (Heavenly Soul), is expressed in the idea
of Trusting.  Specifically this means trusting in God/Universal Flow/Great
Spirit.  Focusing intent, doing your best and transcending limitations, both
inwardly and outwardly, all correspond to this phase.  This is where we reach
out into new territory, express creativity and focus our intention.  Wood
pathology might show up as timidness, depression, being overly cautious,
lack of focus, "running on empty," impulsiveness, etc.<P>


<HR>

<H2>THE PROCESS INTERACTIONS</H2>

     The Phase interactions can be simply expressed thus:

<H3>Opening:</H3>         <BLOCKQUOTE> is supported by Trusting
                          is controlled by Aligning (prevents excess)
                          controls Releasing (limits detachment)
                          supports Connecting</BLOCKQUOTE><P>


<H3>Connecting:</H3>     <BLOCKQUOTE>is supported by Opening
                         is controlled by Trusting (reaching beyond limits)
                         controls Aligning (prevents stagnation)
                         supports Releasing (being present to release past)</BLOCKQUOTE><P>


<H3>Releasing:</H3>        <BLOCKQUOTE>is supported by Connecting (releasing the past)
                         is controlled by Opening
                         controls Trusting (tempers impulsiveness)
                         supports Aligning (with Will)</BLOCKQUOTE><P>


<H3>Aligning:</H3>         <BLOCKQUOTE> is supported by Releasing
                          is controlled by Connecting (keeps it current)
                          controls Opening (keeps balance)
                         supports Trusting (foundation for further growth)</BLOCKQUOTE><P>


<H3>Trusting: </H3>        <BLOCKQUOTE> is supported by Aligning (foundation)
                         is controlled by Releasing (allows for focus)
                         controls Connecting (allows for going beyond limits)
                         supports Opening</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<HR>



<H2>APPLICATIONS OF THE FIVE PHASES</H2>
    Any comprehensive, self-contained, homeostatic system has so many
possible permutations that it is difficult to fully describe them.  Here are a
number of illustrative examples of these ideas:

<H3>Example 1:</H3>  An aspect of Releasing is the quality of detachment.  Healthy
            detachment is prevented from becoming excessive by keeping
            a sense of openness and adaptability (Releasing controlled by
            Opening).  Similarly, since attachments are typically a
            function of past/future associations, a healthy releasing of
            such attachments is supported by being in the present
            (Connecting).         <P>


<H3>Example 2:</H3>  Aligning is also to a large extent the act of balancing and
            harmonizing all aspects of a situation.  Since life is a flow of
            energy, a static balance is not healthy.  Therefore balance
            must be an on-going process and is prevented from stagnating
            by:  1)  Providing the basis for new expansion (Aligning
            supports Trusting); and 2)  Staying in the ever-changing flow
            of the present moment (Aligning controlled by Connecting).    <P>
     

<H3>Example 3:</H3>  Just as each Phase is healthiest when supporting the following
            Phase in the nourishing cycle, it is also healthiest when applying
            limits to the following Phase on the controlling cycle. 
            Trusting, as aspect of which is going beyond limitations,
            functions best when it can temper the tendency of Connecting
            to stay exclusively in the moment.  When done appropriately,
            planning (another aspect of Trusting, i.e., going beyond the
            limited perception of the immediate here and now) tempers
            any tendency for imbalanced indulgence by Connecting to be
            only in the here & now, and stimulates the energy to move-on
            to Releasing where it can evaluate what is most important in
            the experience.<P>

<HR>

<H2>EFFECTIVE USE</H2>
    The most important question regarding this or any model is, "How can this
information be put to effective use?"  Most essentially it is a tool for self-
examination and personal evolution.  The concepts are exceptional as a basis
for meditation or incorporation into other yogic, meditative and/or affirmation
practices.  The Qi Gong exercises accompanying these concepts integrate them
at a deep cellular / energy level, aiding in fuller understanding.<P>

    Working with others the Five Phases may be used as a basis for evaluating
personality traits and tendencies and, in the context of a complete holistic
treatment, appropriate counterbalancing and supporting affirmations might be
assigned, or suggestions given to the patient to enhance, at the level of the
patient's beliefs, the idea of total balance, thus contributing to the overall
effectiveness of treatment.<P>

    In the world at large these concepts have historically been used for everything
from planting crops and family interactions to running governments and
businesses.  Embodying the Five Phases as a tool for personal evolution is
limited only by your imagination.<P>

<H2>Introduction</H2>


     Qigong is Chinese medical meditation, and Dr. Yan Xin is
the leader of its most popular form. Of the estimated
160,000,000 people worldwide now doing qigong, perhaps a third
are following Dr. Yan's basic nine-step method. Yan Xin qigong
is one of the least physically active and most mentally active
of the some 150 approaches that exist. For a basic primer on
qigong, see my article in Tone Magazine (July/August 1995).<P>

     As qigong diffuses from China to the West, we are
witnessing a now familiar turn of events. In the 1970s the
Chinese began to 'export' acupuncture to North America in a
big way. At first, Western scientists claimed that acupuncture
did not work, that stories of people undergoing surgery with
only acupuncture anaesthesia were impossible and false. Before
long they began to admit that acupuncture did work, but they
labelled it a 'placebo effect.' Gradually, some came to
understand that, instead, acupuncture does have scientifically
observable effects. For example, it enhances production of
naturally occurring morphine-like substances called endorphins
and enkephalins that moderate pain. Now qigong is invading the
West in a big way, and the cycle is repeating itself.<P>

     Looked at from a purely Western perspective, qigong is a
form of positive thinking. It combines meditation, breath
control and gymnastics (Porkert w/Ullmann 1982: 106). There
are breathing exercises, muscular exercises involving both
tension and relaxation, and meditation. Qigong induces a
whole-body relaxation response (see Benson w/Proctor 1984:
100-01). One clinical research fellow at the Harvard Medical
School has written: "A one-hour session of Qi Gong combines
aerobic, isometric, and isotonic exercise with the relaxation
response, meditation, guided imagery, and probably several
unrecognized behavioral techniques. It evokes simultaneously
almost every behavioral intervention known to Western
medicine" (Eisenberg w/Wright 1985: 227-8).<P>




<H2>The Qigong Tradition</H2>


     The practice dates back beyond the earliest recorded
history. We still have pictorial writing on artifacts
referring to qigong from seven thousand years ago (Wozniak, Wu
& Wang 1991: ii). There is archaeological evidence suggesting
that qigong may date back as far as a million years. Qigong
predates the martial arts, and all of what we now know as
religion as well. It blossomed fully during the period of the
Warring states. The very early Yellow Emperor's Classic of
Internal Medicine (1972) treats it at length. Chinese Taoists
were early advocates of qigong, but Indian Buddhists have
influenced its later practice.<P>

      Secular qigong is firmly in the Chinese tradition.
Probably all of China's most important ancient scholars,
philosophers and religious leaders practiced qigong, including
Confucius, Lao Ze and Mencius (Eisenberg w/Wright 1985:
208-11). Despite claims in Tone Magazine (Leung 1995: 6), the
qigong approach now sweeping the West, Yan Xin qigong, is not
primarily a "Buddhist path." One may of course pursue qigong
as a Buddhist path, as the Ottawa [Canada] Qigong Association
is doing with excellent results. The International Yan Xin
Qigong Association, however, is intentionally secular, as are
most of its local chapters. Dr. Yan Xin often tells audiences
that practicing qigong should be a regular part of everyday
secular life, "just like brushing your teeth."<P>

     In addition to being a health-promoting practice, qigong
is an ancient philosophical system. According to Dr. Yan, its
basic purpose is to promote the harmonious integration of
human beings with the universe (Wozniak, Wu & Wang 1991: i).
The medical premise is that people's lives and bodies can come
to be at odds with the cosmic forces that surround us, and of
which we are apart. In doing qigong, we therefore align
ourselves with the earth's magnetic field (and we should sleep
in beds so aligned as well).<P>

     Qigong helps restore the harmony of ourselves, of our
beings, in nature and with nature. This cures an enormous
range of the illnesses and diseases that plague our species.
One student finds his arthritis suddenly disappear, another
notices that her visual acuity has improved, a third finds a
chronic pain has vanished. A fourth is surprised to find himself
driving more curteously (UAQA). all sense what it means to be
happier, more alive, more at home on the planet. We all have
latent potential abilities that qigong can help us realize.
Qigong is a consciousness-raising activity par excellence.<P>




<H2>Doing Yan Xin Qigong</H2>


     A person practicing Yan Xin qigong may appear to be
sitting quietly and perhaps thinking of nothing. This is both
true and untrue. The person is listening but not really
listening, thinking but not thinking in the normal sense,
imagining but not imagining, aware of the surroundings but not
too aware. Such is the qigong meditative state. Smiling and
good wishes are important qigong techniques. Although sitting
quietly, a beginner is trying to breathe deeply, slowly and
regularly -- and counting each breath. At first it takes a lot
of effort to exert harmonious control over the diaphragm,
chest walls, throat, tongue and nasal passages. The beginner
is also pushing virtually to the breaking point the human
capacity to imagine.<P>

     At first the imagination is not up to this task. One must
simultaneously imagine a flow of energy, information, light,
colors, sounds and even fragrances entering the body through
the top of the head. This infusion of qi, one imagines, all
rushes out and down from the forehead. It passes through the
nose down to one's open palms opposite the navel. It then
passes in to the seat of qi, a point deep within the pelvis
some two inches below the navel. Students gradually learn to
focus upon this vital center or 'dan tian' point, and to sense
the qi as localized warmth or heat. It takes much longer,
months or years in fact, to learn to activate the channels and
move qi around the body through will power alone.<P>

     In step one, the novice qigong meditator has a lot to
imagine. Try to visualize a fire or bright light in the dan
tian area, above which is water, on top of which is a
blossoming red lotus flower. The flower opens and closes with
one's breathing. As one inhales, the pores of the skin also
open to take in energy/information from the universe. This all
travels to the flower. Gradually the internal light
intensifies and lights up the internal organs, especially the
heart. The heart contracts as one inhales and relaxes as one
exhales. The meditator eventually changes hand positions to
hold a large imaginary fruit that glows and spins and changes
size as one breathes.<P>




<H2>How Qigong Works</H2>


A basic purpose of these activities is to impose a disciplined
and rhythmic pattern on one's body. We impose willed control
over breathing, normally an involuntary function of the
parasympathetic nervous system. Doing so helps bring the body
into phase with the larger rhythms of daily life, the cycles
of the days and the seasons. Most diseases are irregularities
and dysfunctions. Put the body into phase and flow with the
universe, and the qi will flow more freely. Freely flowing qi
can eliminate irregularities and dysfunctions. Qigong permits
a person to gain some control over autonomic functions. The
exercises produce 'autonomic learning' that modulates and
rectifies the flow of the life force (Porkert w/Ullmann 1982:
106- 7). This form of biofeedback does not require machines.<P>

     We have lost the ancient way of living in quiescence and
tranquillity. Qigong helps to bring this back. Beyond the
basic imagination exercises, when we have a fever we think of
the sea, bamboo leaves, or the cool forest floor. If we are
restless we think of the blue sky, cool and serene moonlight,
etc. (Yan 1994b: 6) Being in phase with the cosmic environment
greatly strengthens the body, and it strongly helps to produce
an optimistic and happy attitude toward life. Central to the
philosophy of qigong is the understanding that we must
cultivate moral and physical strength together to prolong
life, develop human potential and help others. A cardinal rule
of Yan Xin qigong is to treat others with compassion. When one
family member practices qigong, the others benefit.<P>

     The regulation of thoughts, breathing and posture all
help to reduce the mind/body's neural activity. Qigong
practice strengthens the body's electrical and biochemical
signals, and the structure and sensitivity of the receptor
cells. This quieting of the body permits physiological and
biochemical functions to regain their healthy flows. This
cures specific ailments, but it also strengthens one's overall
biological field or bioenergy, drastically cuts down the
number of free radicals and minimizes their damage at the
cellular level. That prolongs life.<P>

      Qigong meditation works best by far in the company of a
group. While one must regularly practice alone at home, this
is not enough. When people come together to practice qigong,
they put their biological fields in proximity. These fields
begin to resonate with one another, and so to multiply the
benefits of practice for each person. For this to happen
requires two things. First, ill people must truly want to get
rid of their diseases. Second, they must cultivate the
positive, open and optimistic attitude necessary for
resonating in harmony with the field.<P>

     Sceptical Westerners sometimes mistake this openness to
change for a 'placebo effect.' In a placebo-effect situation,
the subject is fooled into thinking a therapeutic treatment is
happening when it is not. The open optimism necessary for
success in qigong is much different. In the case of the
placebo effect, belief produces a consequence, a
self-fulfilling prophecy or at least the mistaken perception
of improvement. When people doing qigong agree to resonate in
harmony, this is a prerequisite to success. Good, real and
lasting effects follow. Dr. Yan Xin calls this necessary
precondition for success "synchronous resonance" (Wozniak, Wu
& Wang 1991: 81).<P>

     It does help to play a trick with one's mind when doing
qigong to treat some specific problem. So long as one's mind
is focused on a specific problem of ill health it is not
possible to enter fully into the deep qigong state in which
lasting healing can occur. One must therefore learn to forget
about the problem and look only for general benefits. If the
cosmic forces of the universe are to do their healing task, we
must be fully open to receive them.<P>




<H2>Advancing More Deeply into the Process</H2>


     As one advances more deeply into qigong practice, and
into the qigong state, significant physiological changes
occur. Consumption of oxygen decreases. The lung's capacity to
absorb oxygen greatly increases. So does the lung tissue's
oxygen storage capacity. The white blood cell count goes up
dramatically. Dr. Yan Xin writes that doing qigong "improves
micro-circulation of the cerebrum and this cannot be obtained
through any other kind of practice. The brain's deeply layered
cerebral cells are enriched with sufficient blood by doing
qigong" (Wozniak, Wu & Wang 1991: 43). This oxygen enrichment
of the brain is an important key to many qigong effects.<P>

     After practicing for several months, one who does qigong
faithfully will begin to experience spontaneous physical
movements. As the Chinese doctors like to say, "life has to
move." Paradoxically, only when the mind becomes calm and
serene does one's bioenergy becomes strong enough to produce
spontaneous movements. The first appearance of spontaneous
movements represents significant progress along the qigong
learning curve. One cannot seek them out. They must come along
spontaneously, in their own good time.<P>

     Advancement in qigong follows a natural course. One
should strive to stay relaxed, calm and in good spirits. It is
especially important to be and remain on good terms with
family members. Some bad feelings, pains or excessive
spontaneous movements are likely to occur. These may represent
mental discord, pessimism or a lack of family support.
Everyone will at times feel uncomfortable, upset, angry or
depressed. Everyone will experience sorrow, unfair treatment
or a guilty conscience. When these happen, try to overcome
them with good works, internal resolve and a positive attitude
(Wozniak, Wu & Wang 1991: 86).<P>

     Strong spontaneous movements may at first feel
frightening, but those who have strong movements without
internal discord have a great advantage. They will be able to
achieve a stronger state of qi after guidance and instruction.
Dr. Yan says: "... after one reaches a certain level in
qigong, one depends heavily on virtue and good deeds to get
more Qi and energy" (ibid.:79).<P>

     After a lot of practice, one will begin to sense the
activation of a small qi channel. This channel runs from the
top of the head down the front of one's chest, between the
legs, up the spine back to the top of the head. Activating
one's qi will make a person feel "sore, numb, hurt, cold,
cool, warm, hot, floating, sinking, big, small, dizzy, etc.
(Wozniak, Wu & Wang 1991: 39). This is another major advance
along the qigong learning curve. With sufficient practice, one
may eventually become able to move one's qi at will anywhere
inside the body. A person's own willpower can then effect
miraculous cures. Once the flow of qi can reach the site of
disease or illness, the cure can be astonishingly rapid.<P>




<H2>Conclusion</H2>


     Western science leaves off its study of life's energy at
the inanimate level of chemicals. But life has another entire
level of organization above that of the cells, tissues and
organs. What is it that controls cell replacement, tissue
regeneration and metabolic energy? The Chinese call it qi. We
can train this vital life force itself to keep regenerating
our good health for many, many years (Dong & Esser 1990:18).
Every great ethical system upholds virtue for highly practical
reasons. What goes around comes around.<P>

     Wrongdoing against others may result in some immediate
gain, but our minds will indelibly record our guilt, while our
bodies will record such behavior by becoming twisted. If we
harm others, this act will block the free flow of qi within
our own bodies. It is very dangerous to continue immoral
activities once one has begun to practice qigong. Dr. Yan says
that crimes, sins and simple wrongdoing record themselves as
signals in the body. These signals interfere with qigong
progress (Yan 1994a: 8). Yan Xin writes: "Within the higher
realm of qigong there is a rule: do not try to harm others or
you will harm yourself. Virtue is very important. Without it,
one's qi will decrease or be totally lost" (Wozniak, Wu & Wang
1991: 75).<P>

      If one wants to advance one's qigong practice, it will
become necessary to admit the wrongs we have done against
others and to take action to correct these wrongs. Ultimately,
good health requires peace of mind. Let me repeat that Yan Xin
qigong does not require any particular religious commitment.
Whatever religion you practice or do not practice, qigong can
work to improve the length, well being and quality of your
life.<P>

The Qualities of Qi in Meridian diagnosis

<BR>

<HR>

One of the earliest known methods of diagnosis in Chinese medicine was reading the flow of Qi through the meridians and organs.  This was done be sensing the energy flow with the hands, fingers, and eyes.<P>

This is still a major technique, and can be accomplished by holding a meridian end point at a given subject's finger or toe, and passing the free hand over the path of the meridian and the corresponding organ.  Any changes in the Qi flow indicate an imbalance in relation to the anatomic position where the change occurred, or in the organ.  Some practitioners hold the right finger or toe of a female and the left hand or toe of the male.  There are also practitioners who treat using methods similar to diagnosis with <A HREF="ExtQi.htm">External Qi Gong.</A><P>

The following qualities of Qi can be felt by the hands only with a little practice.  The "feel" can then be translated into a communicable system which describes the condition of the individual areas.<P>

The following represents some of the information presented in an excellent class on Tui Na taught by Sifu Carl Totten at the Taoist Institute in North Hollywood, California.  Many of these qualities of Qi listed below include the associated pathology to which they correspond.  Many do not.  For those that do not, we'll let you decide what they mean.  <P>
<I>-Al</I>

<HR>
<H3>Heat:</H3>
From warm to hot, the knowledge of heat measures yang.<P>

<H3>Cold:</H3>
From cool to cold, the knowledge of cold measures yin.<P>
<HR>
<H3>Attracting-Magnetic-Pulling:</H3>
When one senses that the energy is being drawn from one's hand into the subject's body, the following possibilities are indicated:
<UL>
<LI>
The attracting field is the result of an energy deficiency which is draining energy from its surroundings in order to maintain balance.
<LI>
The attracting field is overly strong, and it is draining energy from its surroundings.
<LI>
The examiner's personal energy is not centered or in balance, and, as a result, their energy is being drawn off.  The examiner should then center their own energy.<P>
</UL>

<H3>Repulsing-Pushing Away:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>
The subject's aura (external yang field) has been emotionally triggered by the presence of the examiner, and is pushing away.  This could be indicative of a psychological disturbance, so as to suggest that the patient's body or mind does not want the examiner's hand or person close by.
<LI>
Internal energy from internal disturbance is affecting the external aura.<P>
</UL>
<H3>Recoiling:</H3>
<UL><LI>Injured, or alarmed, sensitive.  The energy withdraws and tightens, then relaxes and approaches.<P></UL>
<HR>
<H3>Tingling, electric:</H3>
This indicates the intensity of both yin and yang.
<UL>
<LI>
Hot:
<UL>
<LI>
With widely dispersed tingles indicates irritation.
<LI>
With tingles close together indicates pain.  This energy should be approached carefully from a distance in that it could prove painful for the examiner to feel it in the hands.  If the energy should flare into the hands, the examiner should relax their muscles and breath the energy into the ground.  They should make no resistance to the passage of the energy.  This is the energy of excess.</UL>
<LI>
Cold:
<UL>
<LI>
This indicates what is lacking, and its pain is the sharpest.<P>
</UL></UL>
<HR>
<H3>Smooth:</H3>
Its flow is smooth on the surface, and on the interior.<P>

<H3>Rough:</H3>
Its flow is rough, irregular.  It is rough on the surface and on the interior.  Rough is insufficient, breaking up, diminishing.<P>

Having the external appearance without the internal substance.<P>
<HR>
<H3>Slow:</H3>
A diminished energy unless it is normal for the subject.<P>

<H3>Fast:</H3>
Usually indicating that which is excited, unstable, or out of control.  To be fast is to burn up quickly.

The Twenty-Four Rules for Chi Kung Practice

</TD></TR> </TABLE>

</Center>
When I began studying Qi Kung, one of my classmates, who had been at it for a while, said that when it comes to feeling your Qi moving within your body, it will take two years to feel anything, and five years to believe it.<P>

While taking two years to feel the Qi wasn't exactly right, the essence of his comments are still very true.  Qi Kung is a path, not a destination, and along that path are many signposts that you will pass.  Feeling the Qi, believeing you feel the Qi, learning to direct it with physical movements, learning to direct it with just your mind's intent, etc...  are all steps along a never ending path.<P>

The article found on this page is designed to prepare you for a life of discipline, not instant gratification.  The only true gratification that comes from doing Qi Kung is to enjoy the activity while your doing it, no matter what your level.  Gratification that is dependent on obtaining any sort of power will only get in the way of the the most sacred of all side-effects of Qi Kung, and that is enlightenment itself.<P>

<HR>
<H2>The Twenty-Four Rules for Chi Kung Practice </H2>
In this section we will list the twenty-four rules which have been passed 
down by generations of Chi Kung masters. These rules are based on much 
study and experience, and you should observe them carefully. <P>

<OL>
<LI><H3>Don't be Stubborn about Plans and Ideas</H3>

This is one of the easiest mistakes for beginners to make. When we 
take up Chi Kung we are enthusiastic and eager. However, sometimes 
we don't learn as fast as we would like to, and we become impatient and 
try to force things. Sometimes we set up a schedule for ourselves: today 
I want to make my Dan Tien warm, tomorrow I want to get through the 
tailbone cavity, by such and such a day I want to complete the small 
circulation. This is the wrong way to go about it. Chi Kung is not like 
any ordinal-v job or task you set for yourself -- YOU CANNOT MAKE A 
PROGRESS SCHEDULE FOR CHI KUNG. This will only make 
your thinking rigid and stagnate your progress. EVERYTHING 
HAPPENS WHEN IT IS TIME FOR IT TO HAPPEN. IF YOU 
FORCE IT, IT WILL NOT HAPPEN NATURALLY. <P>

<LI><H3>Don't Place your Attention in Discrimination </H3>
 
When you practice, do not place your attention on the various 
phenomena or sensations which are occurring. Be aware of what is 
happening, but keep your mind centered on wherever it is supposed to 
be for the exercise you are doing. If you let your mind go to wherever 
you feel something "interesting" happening, the Chi will follow your 
mind and interfere with your body's natural tendency to rebalance 
itself Do not expect anything to happen, and don't let your mind 
wander around looking for the various phenomena. Furthermore, 
don't start evaluating or judging the phenomena, such as asking "Is my 
Dan Tien warmer today than it was yesterday?" Don't ask yourself 
"Just where is my Chi now?" When your mind is on your Chi, your Yi 
is there also, and this stagnant Yi will not lead the Chi BE AWARE 
OF WHAT IS HAPPENING, BUT DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO 
IT When you drive a car, you don't watch yourself steer and work the 
pedals and shift gears. If you did, you'd drive off the road. You simply 
put your mind on where you want to go and let your body 
automatically drive the car. This is called regulating without 
regulating. <P>

<LI><H3>Avoid Miscellaneous Thought Remaining on Origins </H3>

This is a problem of regulating the mind. The emotional mind is 
strong, and every idea is still strongly connected to its origin. If you 
cannot cut the ideas off at their source, your mind is not regulated, and 
your should not try to regulate your Chi. You will also often find that 
even though you have stopped the flow of random thoughts going 
through your mind, new ideas are generated dung practice. For 
example, when you discover your Dan Tien is warm, your mind 
immediately recalls where this is mentioned in a book, or how the 
master described it, and you start to compare your experience with 
this. Or you may start wondering what the next step is. All of these 
thoughts will lead you away from peace and calm, and your mind will 
end up in the "Domain of the Devil." Then your mind will be confused, 
scattered, and very often scared, and you will tire quickly. <P>


<LI><H3>Hsin (Shen) Should not Follows the External Scenery</H3>  
This is also a problem of regulating the mind (Hsin). When your 
emotional mind is not controlled, any external distraction will lead it 
away from your body and to the distraction. You must train yourself so 
that noises, smells, conversations and such will not disturb your 
concentration. It is all right to be aware of what is happening, but 
your mind must remain calmly, peacefully and steadily on your 
cultivation.<P>
 
<LI><H3>Regulate your Sexual Activity</H3> 
You should not have sexual relations at least 24 hours before or 
after practicing Chi Kung, especially martial or religious Chi Kung. 
The Essence-Chi conversion training is a very critical part of these 
practices, and if you practice Chi Kung soon after sex, you will harm your body significantly. Sex depletes your Chi and sperm, and the Chi 
level in the lower portion of your body is lower than normal. When you 
practice Chi Kung under these conditions, it is like doing heavy 
exercise right after sex. Furthermore, when your Chi level is 
abnormal, your feeling and sensing are also not accurate. Under these 
conditions, your Yi can be misled and its accuracy affected. You should 
wait until the Chi level regains it normal balance before your resume 
Chi Kung. Only then will the Essence-Chi conversion proceed 
normally and efficiently. <P>
One of the major purposes of Chi Kung is to increase the Essence
Chi conversion and use this Chi to nourish your body. Once a man has 
built up a supply of Chi, having sex will only pass this Chi on to his 
partner. As a matter of fact, many Chi Kung masters insist that you 
should not have sex three days before and four days after practice. 
During sexual relations the female usually gains Chi while the male 
loses Chi during ejaculation. The woman should not practice Chi Kung 
after sex until her body has digested the Chi she has obtained from the 
man. There are certain Taoist Chi Kung techniques which teach men 
how not to lose Chi during sexual activity, and teach women how to 
receive Chi from the man and digest it. We will leave the discussion of 
this subject to Chi Kung masters who are qualified and experienced in 
it. <P>

<LI><H3>Don't be Too Warm or Too Cold </H3>
The temperature of the room in which you are training should not 
be too hot or too cold. You should practice in the most comfortable 
environment which will not disturb your mind and cultivation. <P>

<LI><H3>Be Careful of the Five Weaknesses and Internal Injuries</H3>
Five weaknesses means the weaknesses of five Yin organs: the 
heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, and spleen. When you realize that any of 
these five organs is weak, you should proceed very gradually and 
gently with your Chi Kung practice. Chi Kung practice is an internal 
exercise which is directly related to these five organs. If you do not 
move gradually and gently, it is Like forcing a weak person to run 10 
miles right away. This will not build up his strength, instead it will. 
injure him more seriously. <P>
For the same reason, when you have an internal injury your 
internal Chi distribution and circulation is already disturbed. If you 
practice Chi Kung your feelings may be misled, and your practice may 
worsen your problem and interfere with the natural healing process. 
There are certain Chi Kung exercises which are designed to cure 
internal injuries, but to use them properly you need to have a very 
good understanding of the Chi situation of your body. <P>

<LI><H3>Avoid Facing the Wind when Sweating</H3>
Don't practice in the wind, especially  facing the wind. When you 
practice Chi Kung you are exercising either internally, or both 
internally and externally. It is normal to sweat, and since you are 
relaxed, your pores are wide open, If you expose your body to cold 
wind, you will catch cold. <P>

<LI><H3>Don't Wear Tight Clothes and Belt </H3>
Always wear loose clothes during practice because this will help you 
to feel comfortable. Keep your belt loose, too. The abdomen is the key 
area in Chi Kung practice, and you must be careful not to limit the 
movement of this area because it will interfere with your practice. <P>

<LI><H3>Don't Eat too Much Greasy and Sweet Food</H3>
You should regulate your eating habit while you are practicing: Chi 
Kung. Greasy or sweet food will increase your Fire Chi, making your 
mind scattered, and your Shen will stray away from its residence. You 
should eat more fruit and vegetables, and keep away from alcohol and 
tobacco. <P>

<LI><H3>Don't Hang your Feet off the Bed</H3>
In ancient times the most common place in Chi Kung practice was 
sitting on your bed. Since most beds were high, if you sat on the edge 
of the bed your feet would hang off the side of the bed above the floor. 
When you practice Chi Kung your feet should touch the floor. If they 
do not, all of the weight of your body will press down on the lower part 
of your thighs and reduce the Chi and blood circulation. Furthermore, 
when you practice you should nor put your feet up on the table, 
because this position will also stagnate the Chi and blood circulation. <P>

<LI><H3>Don't Practice with a Full Bladder</H3>
You should go to the toilet before you start your practice. If you 
need to go during practice, stop your practice and do so. Holding it in 
disturbs your concentration. <P>

<LI><H3>Don't Scratch an Itch</H3> 
If you itch because of some external reason, such as an insect 
walking on you or biting you, do not be alarmed and keep your mind 
calm. Use your Yi to lead the Chi back to its residence, the Dan Tien. 
Breathe a couple of times and gradually bring your consciousness back 
to your surroundings. Then you may scratch or think of how to stop 
the itching. However, if the itching is caused by Chi redistribution in 
the Chi Kung practice, remain calm and do not move your mind there. 
Simply ignore it and let it happen. Once it has reached a new balance, 
the itching will stop. If you scratch this kind of itch it means that your 
mind has been disturbed, and also that you are using your hands to 
interfere with the natural rebalancing of your body's Chi. <P>

<LI><H3>Avoid Being Suddenly Disturbed or Startled </H3>
You should avoid being suddenly disturbed or startled. However, 
if it does happen, calm down your mind. You must absolutely 
prevent yourself from losing your temper. What has happened has 
happened, and getting mad cannot change anything. What you 
should do is prevent it from happening again. Most important of all, 
though is learning how to regulate your mind when you are 
disturbed. <P>

<LI><H3>Don't Take Delight in the Scenery</H3> 
It is very common during practice to suddenly notice something 
that is going on inside of you. Perhaps you feel Chi moving more 
clearly than ever before, or you start to sense your bone marrow, and 
you feel elated and excited. You have just fallen into a very common 
trap. Your concentration is broken, and your mind is divided. This 
is dangerous and harmful. You have to learn how to be aware of 
what is going on inside you without getting excited. <P>

<LI><H3>Don't Wear Sweaty Clothes</H3>
This happens mostly in moving Chi Kung practice, especially in 
martial Chi Kung training. When your clothes are wet from sweat 
you will feel uncomfortable, and your concentration will be affected. 
It is better to change into dry clothes and then resume practice. <P>

<LI><H3>Don't Sit When Hungry or Full</H3> 
You should not practice Chi Kung when you are hungry or when 
your stomach is full. When you are hungry it is hard to concentrate, 
and when you are full your practice will affect your digestion. <P>

<LI><H3>Heaven and Earth Strange Disaster</H3>

It is believed that your body's Chi is directly affected by changes in 
the weather. It is therefore not advisable to practice Chi Kung when 
there is a sudden weather change, because your practice will interfere 
with your body's natural readjustment to the new environment. You 
will also be unable to feel and sense your Chi flow as you do normally. 
You must always try to remain emotionally neutral whenever you do 
Chi Kung; even if you are disturbed by a natural disaster like an 
earthquake, you must remain calm so that your Chi stays under 
control. <P>

<LI><H3>Listen Sometimes to True Words</H3>
You need to have confidence when you practice Chi Kung. You 
should not listen to advice from people who do not have experience in 
Chi Kung and who are not familiar with the condition of your body. 
Some people listen to their classmates explain how they reached a 
certain level or how they cured a certain problem, and then blindly try 
to use the same method themselves. You need to understand that 
everyone has a different body, everyone's health is slightly different, 
and everyone learns differently. When the time comes for you to learn 
something new, you will understand what you need. Play it cool and 
easy, and always have confidence in your training. <P>

<LI><H3>Don't Lean and Fall Asleep</H3>
You should not continue your Chi Kung training when you are 
sleepy. Using an unclear mind to lead Chi is dangerous. Also, when 
you are sleepy your body will not be regulated and will tend to lean or 
droop, and your bad posture may interfere with the proper Chi 
circulation. When you are sleepy it is best to take a rest until you are 
able to regain your spirit. <P>

<LI><H3>Don't Meditate When You Have Lost Your Temper or are Too 
Excited</H3>
You should not meditate when you are too excited due to anger or 
happiness. Since your mind is scattered, meditation will bring you 
more harm than peace. <P>

<LI><H3>Don't Keep Spitting </H3>
It is normal to generate a lot of saliva while practicing Chi Kung. 
The saliva should be swallowed to moisten your throat. Don't spit out 
the saliva because this is a waste, and it will also disturb your 
concentration. <P>

<LI><H3>Don't Doubt and Become Lazy</H3> 
When you first start Chi Kung, you must have confidence in what 
you are doing, and not start doubting its validity, or questioning 
whether you are doing it right. If you start doubting right at the 
beginning you will become lazy, and you will start questioning whether 
you really want to continue. In this case, you will not have any success 
and your practice will never last. <P>

<LI><H3>Do not Ask for the Speedy Success</H3>
This is to remind you that Chi Kung practice is time consuming 
and progress is slow. You must have patience, a strong will, and confidence to reach your goal. Taking it easy and being natural are the 
most important rules.<P>

External Qi Gong

<BR>

</TD></TR> </TABLE>

</Center>



<HR>

External Qi Gong is traditional Chinese therapeutic method employed by some practitioners of TCM to treat their patients.  The doctor performs some exercises to amplify his or her own Qi and then "expresses" it into the patient.  There is an uncanny resemblance in this practice to the Christian practice of "laying on of hands."  Energetically, they may be more similar than most would admit.  However, practitioners of External Qi Gong also go through a certain amount of training in Traditional Chinese Medicine so they know exactly where to put their hands, and why.<p>
There are a thousand different ways to express Qi into another individual.  There are a thousand ways to teach, learn or practice external Qi Gong.  The experience that I've had represents the practice of Taoist Master Share Lew of San Diego, California, and Carl Totton of the Taoist Institute of Los Angeles.  (Located in North Hollywood.)
<HR>
Expressing Qi into another is a little like turning your arms into hoses and your fingers into nozzles.  You can point a finger at an acupoint, or hold your palm over the afflicted area, touch, massage, or just think your Qi into the body of another.<P>
In Chinese medicine we tend to either sedate excess, or tonify deficiency.  However, the experience I have with external Qi Gong suggests that when you're in
doubt, expressing Qi into a patient has more of a regulatory effect than a
tonification effect.  In other words, I simply express the Qi into the
patient's meridian and let their body decide where and how it is used.  I
tend to enter the meridian by holding the most distal point on the channel.
On women, you'll grab onto the finger or toe on their right side.  For men, you'll take a hold of their left finger or toe.<P>

In my experience, the best way to treat the Qi within a channel is to hold
the distal end of the channel with one hand and then pass the other hand over
the length of the channel feeling for anything that <A HREF="QiQual.htm">doesn't feel like a good even flow.</A><P>

In the case of the Spleen Channel, you grab hold of the big toe with one
hand, then slowly run your other hand over the length of the meridian.
 Distance from the body doesn't really matter once you get good at it, but
when I learned we passed the hand over the body at a height of about 5
inches.<P>

Healthy Qi flow will feel either slightly warm or slightly cool.  Deficiency
will feel cold, or perhaps you'll lose the sensation altogether even though
you know you're still over the channel.  At that point, it would be wise to
express Qi into the area, probably it is at an acupoint.  <P>

So if you feel cold, you warm it.  If you feel heat, you can pull off the
excess.  This can be done by energetically scooping the sensation of heat
away from the point.<P>

You may feel, at one point, an energy pushing your hand away.  This could be
due to the patient's discomfort with your hand passing over that point.  It
might be sensitive to touch due to trauma.  Or it might indicate a point of
stagnation of Qi, or a point of excess.  You treat it like you would any
pathology in Chinese medicine.  You sedate excess, and tonify deficiency.
 Cool off heat and warm cold.  <P>

Qi Gong masters are a dime a dozen in Southern California.  Everybody claims
to know what they're talking about.  I claim to have had enough experience
with external Qi Gong to share with you what I've learned.  I haven't brought
the dead back to life, nor have I cured AIDS.  But the question was asked, and so I answered.<P>

ENERGY WORK FOR CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY PATIENTS


<BR>

</Center>

<HR>

In the spring of 1994 I met with Dr. Mehmet Oz of the
Cardiothoracic Surgery Department at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center
in New York City to discuss the possibility of applying certain aspects of
complementary medicine to cardiothoracic surgery patients. I had been a
"hands-on" healer for the past seven years, and a student of many aspects
of non-traditional healing. My career as a medical journalist had also
focused largely in this area.<P>

        I had  to come to Columbia to get a Master of Public Health degree
with an eye towards divining a way to bring complementary medicine more
into the mainstream of American health care. Dr. Oz's interest in this
field and in its possible benefits for his patients seemed an ideal
opportunity to do this.<P>

        We decided to start with a clinical trial of preoperative hypnosis
to improve post-operative recovery for coronary by-pass patients. I had
recently written an article about this for REMEDY magazine, and had
collected a fair amount of data about its success. When the trial is
finished, sixty patients will have participated either as subjects or
controls.<P>

        We also decided that I would do some pilot work with other cardiac
patients, who were not participating in the hypnosis trial, using
techniques which I had studied and developed in the areas of energy
medicine and cellular consciousness.<P>

        Energy medicine, which is part of almost every non-Western medical
system (most notably Chinese medicine and ayurveda) addresses the energy
field of the human body. Physicists and engineers who study this call it
"subtle energy." It is called "qi" (pronounced "chee" ) in Chinese
medicine, where it is acted upon through acupuncture and massage, and "ky"
in Japan,  where acupuncture and a form of deep-tissue massage called
shiatsu are used. In ayurveda, the traditional medicine of  India, it is
called "prana." Yoga originated as an ayurvedic healing practice designed
to energize seven centers which lie along the spine, in which the prana is
concentrated.<P>

        Many western therapists who work with energy, like myself, combine
these two major systems, believing that energy is gathered into the body
through the seven centers along the spine (called "chakras"), and
distributed from these centers to organs and tissue through the acupuncture
meridians.<P>

        In my work with patients at Columbia, I usually begin by taking
readings of the energy along the spine by suspending a pendulum over each
chakra. The direction in which it spins, and the size and shape of the
ellipse, give me information about the strength and quality of the energy
in that area. My work has been mostly with heart transplant and LVAD  {Left
Ventricle Assist Device) patients, and there are characteristic energy
patterns most of them share, which also alter characteristically after my
work with them. (Note: the LVAD is only implanted in patients in need of
transplants, in whom mortality is judged to be immanent. It is a bridging
device, designed to take over the work of the left side of the heart until
a transplant organ becomes avaiable and the patient is strong enough to
survive the operation.)<P>

        After taking these readings, I do an energy meditation with the
patient, which is a way of relaxing him, and allowing him to feel the
energy in and around the body. What I do next varies, depending upon my
sense of the patient's needs. Sometimes I do what is called energy
chelation, in which I guide the energy flow up each leg to the lowest
chakra, which is at the perineum, and then up into each of the other six
chakras. Sometimes in the course of the energy meditation I sense an energy
block somewhere in the patient's body. I may put my hand directly on this
spot and ask the patient to bring his awareness there. Together we try to
sense what is causing the block, and how to remove it. Very often powerful
emotions and memories are released.<P>

        The other part of my work with patients, which involves what I call
cellular consciousness, is derived from the Body-Mind Centering  work of
Bonnie Bainbridge Cohen. Cohen believes that each cell of the body acts
like a brain, and can be consciously addressed. In this work, I ask
patients to sense various tissues and liquids in the body, like the blood,
the bone, or the muscle. Sometimes these tissues carry the energy of
specific emotions, which have not been consciously processed and can
interfere with their activity. For example, when I ask heart transplant
patients to go inside their bodies and "be their blood," a feeling of
sadness often comes to me in my own blood, which I believe picks up a
sympathetic vibration from theirs. When I ask these patients to allow their
blood to thank their old heart for all it has done for them, and to
lovingly say goodbye to it, the sadness gradually eases.<P>

        Most patients report feeling extremely relaxed after my work with
them, and one, who had been quite depressed, reported being in a state of
euphoria for several hours. Another said that she felt the best she had in
two days, and a third that she felt as if she had slept for eight hours. I
have also been able to help a patient heal a troublesome bed sore, reduce
the edema in his legs, bring back kidney function, bring up falling blood
pressure and stop heavy wound drainage, by his own report. Another patient
was able to come off dialysis in the intensive care unit directly after my
work with him. Reducing blood pressure and heart rate where needed is
almost routine.<P>

        In November, at the request of the patients, I began working with
them in the operating room during transplant operations. In this work,
before the patient is given anaesthesia, I stand at the feet, sending
energy into the liver and kidney meridians to support the function of these
organs during the operation. Once the patient is under anesthesia, but
before the sterile field has been created, I work to bring the energy
field, which tends to leave  the body and collect  around the head under
anesthesia, back down  to the feet. I do this by placing my hands on the
ankles, knees, and hip joints.<P>

        During the operation, I stand at the patient's head, with hands
resting on the temples or supporting the head from underneath. I frequently
talk to the patient to explain to the brain exactly what is happening, and
to prepare it for shocks and surprises, like going on the heart-lung bypass
machine.  I also help the patient deal with memories of trauma which the
body appears to re-experience when the chest is opened. When the new heart
is brought into the operating room, I send energy into it  - an idea
inspired by the work being done at Mt. Sinai Medical School, in which Qi
Gong masters have been energetically affecting enzyme solutions. I usually
get some vibrational sense from the new heart of how it feels about the
death of the donor, and I tell the patient how I think the body needs to
treat the new heart to compensate for the trauma it has gone through.<P>

        As soon after the operation as possible, once the patient is
conscious, I work with him to harmonize the energy of the new heart and the body. The five transplant patients with whom I have been able to work in this way have had the lowest  possible  rejection rates on their first biopsies and lower
than normal post-operative pulse rates.<P>

         I have also worked on patients during three LVAD implant
operations and one quadruple coronary by-pass operation. None of the nine
patients with whom I have worked in the operating room has had any
post-operative depression.<P>

        As yet this work is still highly experimental. I am learning from
the patients what their needs are, and how energy work and focusing of
consciousness in the body might help them. I have also done sessions with
some of the transplant coordinators, one of the cardiologists, one of the
psychiatrists and one of the social workers involved with the transplant
patients.<P>

        Once a month I meet with a group of healers to exchange information
and try out new techniques. We have been meeting like this for two years,
and have all been struck with how powerful working in a group can be. Based
on this experience, I  organized a group energy workshop for the LVAD
patients, which  meets once a week. In the group, patients do energy
meditations and healing work on each other. This has been particularly
effective in relieving pain.<P>

        I have recently formalized an energy healing protocol for coronary
bypass operations, and plan to design similar protocols for heart
transplant and LVAD implant procedures. Based on a number of of my cases, I
belive that the ritual of surgery can be used for significant emotional
release, and that doing this can substantially reduce post-operative pain.
It appears that the patient has different levels of consciousness under
anesthesia, and can actually select how "present"he or she wants to. The
more present, the more consciously experiencing both memories and current
events, the less pain, which, I believe, is why surgery performed under
acupuncture or hypnosis involves relatively little post-operative pain.<P>
<HR>

 <H2>ENERGY PROTOCOL FOR CORONARY BYPASS PATIENTS
</H2>

<H3>PREOPERATIVE</H3>
<OL>
<LI>Treat kidney and bladder points on feet.<BR>
        While doing this, describe the operation in detail to the patient.<P>


<LI>Do energy chelation.<BR>
        While working ankle-to-knee, ask patient to bring awareness to the
veins, and allow the veins to experience the excitement of becoming
arteries. Allow other veins in the leg to experience challenge of taking
over for the veins which will be removed.<P>

        While on heart chakra, ask patient to experience grafting locations
accepting veins, and teaching them their new job.<P>

        While on brow chakra, tell patient to allow the brain to accept the
miracle of the operation, and entertain the possibility that all things can
be transmuted and changed, as he/she desires.<P>


<LI>Tell patient that old traumas, and especially old angers may come up
during the surgery, once the chest is opened. Tell him/her that you will
work to help release these out through the chest.<P>

</OL>

<H3>INTRAOPERATIVE</H3>
<OL>
<LI>If anesthesiologist is not ready to begin, send energy from kidney and
liver points on the feet up to these organs.<P>



<LI>When anesthesiologist begins to put in i.v.s, hold patient's hand,
talk, sing, improvise anything that will bring comfort.<P>

        Explain purpose of each thing being done, and encourage the patient
to allow the body to accept it. Emphasize the sensuality of the needle
entering the blood vessel, and the Swan making its way to the heart.<P>

         Let  the patient feel the heart's signals being projected out into
the room, where every one can see it and be in touch with it.<P>

        Let the patient experience the heart as the main actor in a great
drama, with the rest of the body the supporting cast, and the health care
givers as director, stage hands and audience.<P>


<LI>When patient is anesthetized, before the sterile field is created,
return to the feet. Work on feet, knees and groin to bring the energy field
back down into the body.<P>


<LI>Once sterile field is created, stand at the head of the patient with
hands on or close to the temples, or underneath, supporting the head. These
are the two positions you will maintain, alternating them at your
discretion, throughout the operation. If you are familiar with craniosacral
massage, you may do some of this from this position.<P>

<LI>If there are problems with the heart during the operation, you may
want to raise one hand above the head with the palm facing the heart and
send energy directly into it.<P>

<LI>If a helper who can scrub is available, he/she should stand at the
feet, sending energy into the kidney, liver and gall bladder meridians, at
his/her discretion, and pulling the energy field down to the feet. After
the vein(s) is removed and the leg is sutured, she can treat that wound
directly.<P>


<LI>As the incision is made, the torch is used to burn through
tissue, and the saw is used to cut through bone, tell the patient, either
telepathically or by whispering into his/her ear, to allow the tissue to
part easily, inviting the loving hands of the surgeon to come into the
chest.<P>


<LI>Once the chest is open, you may feel anger coming into your
body from the patient. Tell the patient to stay present, and to send the
anger roaring out through the front of the chest. Tell the patient that
this time his/her anger is not in vain, and that the battle will be won and
the goal accomplished.<P>

<LI>Alternatively, you may start to feel drowsy, indicating that the
patient is withdrawing further into unconsciousness under the anesthesia,
in order to avoid the memory of an old trauma. If you have a partner
working at the feet, tell her, through addressing the remark to the
surgeon, to send energy into the kidney points to focus the patient. Then
tell the patient to come back and be present. Give him/her the supportive
remarks about anger in step 5.<P>


<LI>If you feel a pain or a cringing in your genitals or your
second chakra, this probably indicated that the patient is having a memory
of sexual abuse. Tell the patient that his/her sexual energy exists only
for his/her own pleasure and healing.<P>


<LI>Before the patient goes on bypass, tell him/her to prepare the
blood for the adventure of leaving and returning to the body. Suggest that
once the blood is outside the body, it will act like cerebrospinal fluid,
with that kind of excitement-perception energy. It will act like blood
again when it comes back into the body. Have the patient tell the brain to
regard the chemicalized blood with curiosity, not alarm, and simply to
observe and record the experience.<P>


<LI>When the patient comes off bypass, tell him/her to feel the
heart as if it were beating for the very first time, at six weeks after
conception, and to experience the excitement of the blood connecting the
heart with the rest of the body, informing them about each other.<P>

        If there is a helper at the feet, have him/her send energy into the
liver meridian to facilitate clotting.<P>


        Throughout the operation, stay tuned in to the patient's changing
emotional states, which may indicate memories coming to the surface.
Support the patient energetically and sympathetically with whatever her/she
is feeling. Experiment with different levels of the auric field to see
where a memory may be stuck.<P>

</OL>

<H3>POSTOPERATIVE</H3>
<OL>
<LI>If there is an opportunity to see the patient in the I.C.U.,
work directly on the sutures and send energy through the kidney points on
the bottom of the feet. If a friend or family member is available and
willing, show him/her how to do the kidney points.

<LI> Check chakras and work directly on those which seem weak.

<LI>As soon as possible after the patient has returned to his/her
room, do an energy chelation. Ask if there is any pain or discomfort and
address that directly.

<LI>Discuss your experience of the operation with the patient, if
he/she is interested in knowing about it.

<LI>Ask the patient what anxieties about the future he/she may
have. Help him/her to locate the places in the body and the energy field
where these are resonating, and to transform them into positive visions.
</OL>

<EM>NOTE:</EM> This is only a model. I welcome input from other healers and
physicians in changing and developing this further. I would particularly
welcome input from cardiac surgeons, anesthesiologists and perfusionists
about difficult points in the operation where additonal energy techniques
might  be applied.<P>

Chinese nutrition is the tasty counterpart to Chinese herbology.  The only significant difference between the two is that the nutrition tends to be more appetizing than the herbal tea formulas.<P>

The basis for therapeutic qualities is exactly the same.  On a <A HREF=ChiNut.htm>related page,</A> we take a look at energetics and therapeutic qualties catagorized by the kind of food.<P>

On this page we go the opposite direction.  We begin with the desired results and then list the foods that are known to have the appropriate effect.

		I would like to preface this article by stating that I am not a vegetarian. Yet not long ago, I experimented with an ovo-lacto vegetarianism discipline for over a year.  After observing that I became mentally and physically weak, timid, susceptible to disease,  and depressed, I decided to return to eating meat.  Thereafter, I soon felt much better.
Somehow, however, I have continued to feel drawn to adopting a vegetarian diet.  My reasons for this are for ecological, health, and spiritual concerns.<P>

	Like so many of my colleagues, I  began my journey as a practitioner of Oriental Medicine out of a deep interest in holistic medicine and improving my own health, as well as that of others.  Now, after nearly four years of immersion in the intricacies of Traditional Oriental Medicine (TOM),  I am realizing my goals.  The prevailing view among most of my instructors during this time seems to be that a vegetarian lifestyle will ultimately lead to a deficiency condition;  that as people it is necessary to eat meat.  My own experience with vegetarianism, led me to unquestionably agree with this view.  My dealings with many vegetarian patients, most of whom have had deficiencies, lent further confirmation.  At the same time, there has been a growing realization of how little I really know about vegetarianism. I found myself advising patients to eat some meat based on my ignorance of their lifestyle, and my unclear understanding of TOM's stance on vegetarianism.<P>

	I have come to realize that vegetarianism is more than avoiding eating meat. It entails careful meal planning, and a good understanding of nutrition. Also, I feel it requires a good understanding of personal body energetics from an Oriental Medical standpoint.  None of these things did I have when I, cold turkey,  decided to become a vegetarian.  I began to think that perhaps this is exactly what many of our patients are doing; choosing lifestyles they know little of.  At the very least, I decided I should know as much about vegetarianism as possible, and where the bias against it in TOM came from.	<P>

	Thus,  this article is not an attempt to proove or disprove the validity of a vegetarian lifestyle.  It has been my intention to explore the TOM viewpoint on vegetarianism, and to provide a general background for special concerns of vegetarianism that I feel as practitioners we should know.  It is my intent to provide practitioners with information they need to know in order to obtain these goals.  First, to have an appreciation  for reasoning against a vegetarian diet from a traditional  perspective.  Secondly, to provide a framework for practitioners to resolve where they stand themselves on the subject.   And finally,  to be knowledgeable enough to evaluate a patients understanding of how to be a healthy vegetarian, as can be best determined.  I have consulted various Eastern and Western holistic nutritional authors, practicing vegetarians, and non vegetarians in obtaining information for this article. There are both Eastern and Western nutritional concerns discussed , as I feel any complete discussion on this subject would lack for the other.  It is my hope that the information provided will be a service to you and your patients.  <P>

	In closing I would like to thank my Chinese friends  J. Min Fan, L. Ac. and Mei-fang Wei, L. Ac., MD.. for their willingness to share their experience and insights, A. Gregory Bantick, L.Ac. for his wisdom and inspiration in writing this article, and Richard Warren, L.Ac., M.T.O.M. , who is an all but deficient vegetarian, for his guidance.<P>



<A NAME="3"><H3>Introduction</H3></A>


	I doubt that I am the only practitioner who has advised a vegetarian patient to eat meat only to be met by raised eyebrows and wide eyes.  Here is a person who considers themselves to be spiritual, holistically minded and generally healthy being told by their acupuncturist that they need to eat meat. Often times, horror of horrors,  red meat.<P>

I have until recently been one of these practitioners.  We are indoctrinated into the fold of Traditional Oriental Medicine, which upholds the view that people should be eating meat.  It occurs to me, however, that before we try to influence our patients to eat meat , we really should have a clear understanding of why this is so.  We also need to have a sensitivity for why people have chosen a vegetarian lifestyle, and whether or not our patients are even practicing it wisely.  There are some people who are simply not going to eat meat no matter what  you tell them.  Religious groups such as Buddhism, Brahmanism, Hinduism, Jainism, The Seventh Day Adventists and The Trappist Monks of the Roman Catholic Church all promote a vegetarian diet. Is it our place to try to change peoples religious or social beliefs?  Can we not help people without insisting they eat meat.?  Many of our patients and many of us come from the fold of holistically minded people who uphold vegetarianism as a healthy lifestyle.  When so many of our patients eat poorly by anyone's standards, and  seem to have attitudes that absolve themselves of any personal responsibility for their health,  we should be embracing and supporting vegetarians, not chasing them away.  In order to be of service to these people we need to know just as much about vegetarianism as they do.  We need to have other strategies than just telling people to eat meat.  If we really feel people need meat for any reason, we must be prepared to defend this position.<P>

	This article, therefore, is not intended to be an argument for or against vegetarianism. It is an exploration of reasons against abstaining from meat from a TOM perspective, to enable the practitioner to analyze this and find their own ground on this issue.  Also it is an exploration of special dietary and lifestyle concerns that vegetarians and those treating them should be aware of.  This information will provide a framework from which a practitioner can evaluate the role of vegetarianism in a patients health, and what adjustments can be made according to contemporary vegetarian living.<P>
 


<A NAME="4"><H3>Vegetarianism and Oriental Medicine</H3></A>



	In my experience the overwhelming majority of practitioners of Traditional Oriental Medicine, especially those from a Chinese background, hold that a strict vegetarian diet is unhealthy and will eventually lead to deficiency.  This is certainly not true of all practitioners; I know several vegetarian practitioners of Oriental Medicine personally.  It is perhaps simplistic to condense  the entirety of  this field into a single viewpoint on this subject.  Yet, my own educational experience in Oriental Medicine has left me with the idea that vegetarianism is not a great idea.  An  opinion enforced by the numerous clinical cases I have seen of strict vegetarians with  underlying deficiencies, in particular, blood deficiency.  The Chinese practitioners I have been exposed to are emphatically against it. But the arguments, like so many concepts and methods we are exposed to in the holistic health field,  to me were largely hearsay and opinion with little substance to back them up.  I have heard such arguments as people have been eating meat for centuries to think that we can revert  back to a vegetarian diet in one lifetime is foolhardy. This of course assuming the human race was ever completely vegetarian.  Another practitioner explained  that people in the city need more meat than those in the country, due to the stress of modern society. Still another said that being a vegetarian, based on his experience with patients, was simply "crazy."  The prevailing view throughout has been that  people on vegetarian diets just do not seem to do that well.<P>

	Though the clinical experience of others is always valuable, it seems awkward to me to walk around telling people to eat meat based solely on thinking like this.  That, and who can deny the cultural background settings of which we are dealing.  I do not want to diverge at great length into a cultural debate, but the attitude toward animal life seems to be greatly different in Oriental cultures than for the "New Age" American.  One can not overlook the cultural biases that exist.  The book Chinese foods for Longevity; The Art of Long Life discloses the health benefits of everything from pork brain,  to frogs and eels.   In looking for a more complete view on the subject of vegetarianism, contemporary Taoist writers and nutritionists seemed a logical place to seek more detailed information.<P>

	The prevailing view among Taoist sources is that one should eat meat.  The most common reasoning being the high demands of living in a competitive industrialized society are too taxing on the body to subsist healthfully on a vegetarian diet.  In his The Great Tao, Stephen Chan emphatically states in large bold letters "DO EAT MEAT", stating that only animal products can supply the high energy levels that we need,  unless living in an isolated retreat.  Ming-Dao Deng,  in his book on a Taoist lifestyle, shares this view writing:<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
		"It is unnecessary to become a complete vegetarian. Vegetarianism 
	arouse out of economic necessity or for specific high meditations.  Meat is 
	too active for the quiescent activities of a meditator.  Temple living a very
	 specific activity in a protected environment.  The scholar warrior considers
	 pure vegetarianism to be impractical in a competitive society. " 1
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

	Master Hua Ching Ni, a popular Taoist spiritual teacher and practitioner of Traditional Oriental Medicine in Los Angeles also cautions against a strict vegetarian diet, upholding that the nature of ones life should determine the amount of meat one eats.<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

		"Vegetarianism is okay if you live in a religious institution, without 
	doing extremely hard work, but in this high pressure society where most
	 of you work hard, I do not recommend it, especially in the winter." 2
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>


	Hua Ching Ni wisely comments , however, that perhaps monastery living is idealized  too much and is not as simple as one might presume.   Western holistic nutritionists, also share the idea that meat is necessary to modern living.  Bernard Jensen, Ph.D. claims that  a competitive occupation  uses up lots of adrenaline which will not be accommodated by an exclusively vegetable diet.  He also reasons  that the level of consciousness required to subsist as a strict vegetarian has not been attained by most people.  According to his calculations the amino acids would be burned up so rapidly that most people in the United States would starve to death.  This idea of varied diets is reflected in ancient  Indian culture in which meat as an article of diet was traditionally prescribed for the rajpats caste of warriors and rulers. Brahmins, who did not engage in battle, but focused on study and spiritual development, were forbidden use of meat. 	 	This brings up the next  point on meat eating, and how it effects us spiritually.  This view is both disturbing and confusing.  For, what these authors seem to be saying is that for ideal spiritual development one should eat as a vegetarian , but for most of us with little hope anyway, this is not appropriate. Perhaps this is a bit facetious, but in examining the energetic qualities in meat, it is not held in high regard by Taoists, and it would seem something of a necessary evil for those of us living in modern culture.<P>

	There is the psychological energetic aspect to this subject which follows that eating meat creates many disturbing desires. Those who consume meat are filling themselves with low energy foods producing a gross spirit producing animalistic tendencies and belligerent mentalities. On the other hand those who eat more vegetables will supposedly have a more harmonious spirit.   As Hua Ching Ni recommends:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

		"The highest beings absorb pure energy...People trying to spiritualize
	 their life eat only light subtle foods such as herbs and vegetables." 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
	 <P>

Pitchford notes that just as certain animals have certain attributes which may be beneficial to health, they also have negative attributes which are transmitted to the eater. The shyness of the rabbit or the desires of the pig are examples of this.  He further argues that perhaps much of the stress that is attributed to a modern lifestyle may be the result of eating too much meat and its toxic by-products, obstructing the body's physical and therefore mental well being<P>

	Jensen has an interesting  and contrasting view with regard to the different energetic aspects of meat and vegetables.  He maintains that humans need the higher vibratory rates provided by animal products.  The medulla portion of the brain, what he calls "the chest brain", regulates respiration and must be built with  the highest evolved  (meaning highest vibratory rate) phosphorus from animal products. This same phosphorus is required for well developed thought processing.  For similar reasons he insists that only fresh vegetables can provide adequate vibratory rates necessary for good health.<P>

	Nonetheless, it should be noted that there have been Taoists who subsisted on strict vegetarian regimes.  Though most caution against the practice of a strict vegetarian lifestyle, the practice of including meat in the diet is approached with caution among modern Taoist authors.   Meat should represent only a fraction of the total diet. Eating too much meat in the diet creates a condition of Yin blood, or an acidic imbalance leading a person to become prone to illness.  On the other hand a strict vegetarian diet may cause one to become too alkaline.  A harmonious balance should be sought for.  Maoshing Ni  in  The Tao of Nutrition  recommends gradually moving to a mostly vegetarian diet, including meat as no more than 1/10 of all food consumed.  So, on one hand we have the more spiritually minded side of our tradition which advocates a vegetarian practice, and on the other we have a more practically minded health perspective which cautions against it.<P>





<A NAME="5"> <H3>Special Concerns for Vegetarians</H3></A>



	Before going on to the next section  dealing the special nutritional concerns of 
vegetarians the comments of Dr. Stephen Chan In The Great Tao  are worth looking at.<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

		"It is said that we should have nutritionally  "balanced" meals, 
	such and such an amount each day of proteins, vitamins, minerals, and 
	other "foods."  If you ask me whether or not you need these, my answer
	 would be "What are vitamins?  What are minerals?  What are proteins?"	
	 And "How much do we really know about them?" 4
 </BLOCKQUOTE><P>


	This is significant because it gets into the whole question of supplementation in general.  As Chang further explains,  most scientists believe there are probably  2000 unknown components in an apple.  If it were stated that herbal medicine and western pharmacology were one in the same,  many practitioners would scoff at this notion.   Most practitioners would support the notion that some synthesized active ingredient found in some herb are far removed  from the actual organic equivalent.  Why , then should we feel any different with regard to vitamins and minerals?   On the other hand,  completely disregarding  known information about required nutrients in the body would be equally as ridiculous.  For this reason exploration of nutritional aspects of vegetarianism in both Traditional Eastern and Western terms is valuable and at the same time incomplete.  Perhaps at some point it will be discovered that some component of  meat actually is required for proper body function.   Where possible natural organic sources for common nutritional deficiencies will be included.  It is important to consider, however, that many so called natural products are grown in soil that has been severely depleted of essential nutrients.  Therefore a vegetarian must be very discriminating when it comes to food sources,  as well as deciding whether or not to use supplementation. For example, given the present understanding of these complex issues those on a vegetarian diet Vitamins  A and D, Calcium, and Riboflavin are frequently found in levels for what is considered safe. These substance are often found in many whole vegetable sources.  Proper eating habits, involving balancing of foods and well rounded dietary choices should eliminate these problems.  <P>




  
<A NAME="6"><H3>Protein</H3></A>



	It is a commonly held belief that vegetarians have trouble getting enough protein.  A quick walk through any health food store will reveal numerous protein supplement products for those on vegetarian diets and otherwise.  The fact of the matter is that most people in the United States far exceed the amount of protein necessary in terms of quantity.  Protein is highly present in many vegetable as well as animal products.  In fact, dietitians who prepare meatless diets find it difficult not to exceed protein allowances when caloric needs are met.  According to international health groups .8g per kilograms of body weight is required daily by the average man, which is about 48g per day. The USRDA it is 70g daily for men and 60g for women.  Infants may require up to 3 times as much.  Yet in one experiment done at The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 100 men on regulated diets showed 30 g per day was sufficient.5   At any rate,  protein from vegetable sources is in no short supply.   2 cups of dried uncooked peas or beans and 40 ounces of uncooked rice has the same protein amounts as a 7 ounce steak.  1/2 cup of cooked protein is equal to a 20 ounce steak, and 1 cup of hulled sunflower seeds is the same as an unbelievable 40 ounce steak. 6  Consider also  these figures for a moment.  One cup of broccoli has 40 calories and 4 grams of protein.  Eating only broccoli for a day providing 2000 calories would be the equivalent of over 200 grams of protein, more than double the daily recommended amount.7   It should not be hard for any vegetarian to obtain enough protein.<P>

	What is very important for the vegetarian is the proper balance of biologically available protein.  Vegetable sources of protein are less complete and therefore less efficiently utilized by the body than animal sources. There are 24 identifiable amino acids used in the body.  Of these 8-10 are considered essential amino acids because they can not be synthesized by the body on it's own; they must be obtained from food.  The essential amino acids are phenylaline, leusine, isoleusine, methionine, valine,  lysine, threonine, and tyrptophane.  Though controversial, histadine and argenine may also be essential, especially during times of injury and disease.  In addition, all the essential amino acids must be eaten at the same time in order to insure the proper absorption of a complete protein requirement.  The other 14 amino acids can then be produced by the body.  Therefore,  various food products are discussed in terms of their limiting amino acids, or those which they are low in.  The body can only absorb proteins at the level of the lowest essential amino acid at any given meal.  The extent to which an essential amino acid is low, is the extent to which the body can effectively absorb the proper protein requirements.<P>

	In order to account for this problem, the proper combining of foods provides a solution to the vegetarian.  In fact, when the proper foods are 
combined, vegetable sources of protein can actually exceed meat in terms of protein values.  In terms of biologically available proteins eggs are by far the most complete, followed by milk, cheese, fish, whole rice, red meat, and poultry. There is a greater difference between eggs and meat than between meat and vegetables in terms of limiting amino acids. It is also interesting to note that  whole rice ranks higher than red meat.  Nevertheless, only some seeds and nuts, very few grains, and even fewer vegetables fulfill complete protein requirements.  Micro-algaes such as spirulina, chorella, and wild blue green algae are considered to be among the world's richest supplies of protein.  Some varieties are thought to contain every nutrient required for the human body.  When compared to beef, for example, the digestive absorption of spirulina and chorella is four times greater.  Any strict vegetarian would do well to include these foods in their diet.  <P>

	There are numerous books that provide guidelines and complete recipes for well balanced protein diets.  Generally,  plants tend to be deficient in  lysine, tryptophan, and methionine.  Grains and cereals are often lacking in lysine.  Corn and rice are often found with low amounts of tryptophan and threonine. The following guidelines should be followed. Always combine grains with legumes, seeds and nuts with legumes, or for those who eat them eggs and dairy with any vegetable protein.  According to Maoshing Ni, a balanced vegetarian diet should consist of 2/5 grains, 2/5 vegetables and fruit, and 1/5 nuts and legumes.   Carbohydrates should always be eaten with proteins, and it is important to provide the body with a good protein carbohydrate ratio.  Certain important organs such as the brain require carbohydrates to function. If no carbohydrates are eaten, protein will be converted by the body into carbohydrates.  In this regard, vegetables are preferable to meat as they often contain both protein and carbohydrates.  Meat is composed of protein and fat, and fat can not be converted into carbohydrates.   Eating a well rounded diet should provide the vegetarian with more than enough available protein.<P>

	Another important aspect to protein is the maintenance of the calorie protein ratio.  On one hand if a person does not eat enough calories, protein will be absorbed to maintain body weight. On the other it is also important not to consume an excess of calories.  The average daily calorie intake should be around 1900-2700 and protein 46-70g.  This comes out to about 1 gram for every 40 calories eaten.  Thus vegetarians must be careful not to eat to many sugars, starches fats and oils.  It is impossible to be a healthy junk food vegetarian.  Fudge,  for example,  has 150 calories to 1 gram of protein.  When something like this is eaten an immediate protein debt is incurred and requires eating protein dense foods like eggs cheese and meat.  Strict vegetarianism when combine with sugar or even honey is considered very damaging as it will incur an immediate protein deficiency.  Also sugar and honey contribute to de-mineralizing the body.   A diet consisting of a veggie burger and a soda will not cut it.  In order to maintain their health as a vegetarian people must be very disciplined not to eat too many sweets.<P>

	Finally the popular notion that vegetarians are somehow weak should be dispelled.  This is an idea that seems to be held by Master Ni as well when he refers to the type of work one does when considering vegetarianism.  Muscles require carbohydrates and fats for fuel, not protein.  Even those who are trying to stimulate muscle growth should do fine on a normal diet which typically supplies more than enough proteins for the average American.  In one study in 1904 students were compared to vegetarian students to see how many times they could squeeze a grip meter in quick succession.  The vegetarian average was 69 as compared to 38.9 for non-vegetarians.  Swedish athletes tested for endurance on a bicycle lasted three times longer after a three day diet consisting of grains and proteins than three days eating high meat content.8  There is no reason to assume that vegetarians, eating a well balanced diet,  will somehow become reduced in strength or stamina.  We can look to the awesome power of a Clydesdale horse which eats largely hay and oats.<P>

	


<A NAME="7"><H3>Vitamins and Minerals</H3></A>


	There are a number of vitamins and minerals which, although they are found in vegetables seem to be lacking in many vegetarian diets, or are issues of common concern. These are Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Calcium, Zinc, Riboflavin, Iron and lastly Vitamin B-12  which is an extensive topic and deserves it's own discussion.  Before exploring each of these it is important to understand the effect a well balanced vegetarian on the uptake of certain nutrients.  A well planed vegetarian diet should consist of  ample amounts of beans, legumes and grains. These products , however are rich in phyates which become biochemically bound up with zinc calcium and other elements. The phyates therefore reduce amounts of uptake of these nutrients, and can even leach them out of the body.  Sprouted beans, and grain seeds are not similarly effected and should therefore also be included.  Fermented products help offset the effect of phyates as well.  Foods such as leaven bread and adding yeast to bread can help.  One method to reduce the effect of phyates in beans is to soak them overnight. For the greatest effect it is necessary to soak the beans at least 12 hours changing the water at least once.  Grains, beans, and legumes are of course very important and should not be avoided for fear of phyates. <P>

	Vitamin A also known as Beta Carotene is well known for it's benefit to the eyes, but it is used in a whole range of body  functions.  It is needed for maintenance  and repair of epithelial tissue. It aids in fat storage and is involved in the immune system protecting against external attacks and infections. It is an antioxidant, thought to slow the aging process, and is considered to be useful against cancer and pollution.  Most importantly for the vegetarian,  protein can not be used  by the body without Vitamin A.  From a TOM perspective a lack of Vitamin A in the diet seems to be related to wei qi and liver deficiency.  Symptoms of Vitamin A deficiency can include skin diseases, dandruff loss of smell, allergies, night blindness, eye inflammation,  and dryness of the mucous membranes,  respiratory system, and reproductive systems. It is interesting to note that Liver meat is considered to be an excellent source of Vitamin A and that green leafy vegetables are associated with the wood element in five phase energetics.  My experience has shown that vegetarians often do present with liver deficiencies.   Generally vitamin A can be found especially in dark green and deep yellow vegetables.  Dunaliella, spirulina, wild blue green algae, wheat and barley grass, chorella, carrot, sweet potato, kale, parsley, and spinach are excellent sources of Vitamin A, listed in order of highest content.<P>

	Vitamin D is required for the assimilation of calcium and phosphorus in the body.  It is essential for development of  bones and teeth and is considered helpful for the prevention of such disorders as osteoporosis and rickets. Perhaps interesting a correlation can be made between the TOM idea of the Kidney influence on bone development.  Vitamin D is converted first by the liver and then the kidney. 3315.9  Despite the fact that we hear much about how too much fat is unhealthy, it is required for the assimilation of vitamin D by the body.  This is important for those on strict vegetarian diets which can be low in fats.  Many of the food sources of vitamin D are oily and damp in nature; milk, cod liver oil and butter. Fortunately, the body is able to convert exposure to sunlight into vitamin D.  This is somewhat difficult in colder climates and for those who working indoors. The amount of sunshine required for adequate Vitamin D absorption is at least 20% of the skin on the body for 30 minutes a day at sea level.  Vegetarian sources of  vitamin D include alfalfa, oatmeal, sweet potatoes, and vegetable oils.<P>

	Calcium is of course strongly involved with the growth of bones, but also muscle and nerve health.  Symptoms of Calcium deficiency can result in muscle cramps, brittle nails and aching joints, and numbness of the arms and legs.   If we consider many of the calcium rich substances in the Oriental materia medica such as Concha Ostrea (Mu Li),  Os Draconis (Long Gu),  or  Fluoritum (Zi Shi Ying), we can see that it has an energetic property of anchoring the yin and is useful in symptoms of nervousness and insomnia.  A calcium supplement taken before bedtime is useful for a sound nights sleep.  For the vegetarian who chooses not to eat dairy products there are a wide variety of vegetable sources of this mineral, especially the green leafy vegetables.  These would include; collards, dandelion greens, Kale, mustard greens, turnip greens, broccoli, bok choy, okra rutabaga, soybeans, black strap molasses, dried fruit, almonds.   
	Unfortunately for the vegetarian meat is an excellent source of zinc. The availability of zinc in vegetable products is questionable due to soil exhaustion, and use of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer's.   Due to it's involvement in the reproductive organs, especially the prostrate and protein synthesis,  it has been suggested by some practitioners that it  is related to the Jing.  Symptoms of zinc deficiency can cause light headedness and a feeling of disattachment that can be found in some vegetarians.  Good sources of Zinc would include; lima beans, whole grains, mushrooms, pecans, soybeans, and pumpkin and squash seeds are reported to be excellent sources of this mineral. <P>

	Riboflavin, or Vitamin B2 is necessary for the formation of red blood cells, production of antibodies , and cell growth and respiration.  Lack of this vitamin is important to a pregnant woman as it can cause damage to the fetus, even without obvious symptoms to the mother.  It is also interesting to note that inclusion of Vitamin B2 and B6 together are helpful in the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome.   The seaweed Hijiki is a rich source of riboflavin.  Other sources include mostly green leafy vegetables, asparagus, broccoli, brussle sprouts, okra, and winter squash.
	Iron is the single largest mineral found in the blood.  It is essential to the production of hemoglobin and the oxygenation of red blood cells.  Low levels of Iron correspond largely with some of what would be blood deficiency in Oriental Medicine.  These symptoms include, brittle nails, hair loss, pallor, dizziness and fatigue.   If too much iron , as in a supplement is taken, with a protein deficient diet there can be a system overload which may damage the muscles of the heart and liver.   Good sources of Iron for the vegetarian are largely in whole grain foods. Also, beets, avocados, dates,  raisins  peaches, pears, and pumpkins are good sources.    Micro-algaes such as spirulina, seaweed,  are also an excellent source. <P>

	

  	
<A NAME="8">	<H3>Vitamin B-12</H3></A>


	It is a widely held view that vegetarians must be cautious to obtain enough Vitamin B-12 in the diet.  The B-12 vitamin is especially influential in the reproduction of new cells, and though the exact relationship is unclear it interacts with folic acid. It is involved with development, growth and repair of tissues.  This becomes especially important for tissues which are constantly reproducing such as red blood cells of which ten thousand need to be replaced every second.   As important as this may seem,  B-12 is required by the body in only the tiniest amounts. The Recommended Dietary Allowance for B-12 is only 2 mcg. daily.  This figure is higher for pregnant women and children.  The reason this poses a risk for the vegetarian is that b-12 can only be found in animal products including meat, milk, eggs and certain fermented products.  Especially for a vegan this may pose a problem.<P>

	The signs and symptoms of Vitamin B-12 deficiency are insidious, and may take years to develop.  It is important for vegetarians to note that green vegetables contain folic acid which may mask the symptoms of blood deficiency which may go unnoticed until irreparable nerve damage has occurred.   Of course this implies blood deficiency in the western sense, however it is probable that the practitioner of TOM would be able to help the patient  with earlier diagnosis utilizing energetic diagnostics.  According to Pitchford the tongue of a vitamin B-12 patient will commonly present as red, shiny, smooth and occasionally ulcerated.  B-12 deficiency has also been attributed to mental disorders and  it is common for mental problems ranging all the way up the scale to acute psychosis to be among the first symptoms.  Insanity, nervousness, and chronic fatigue have been attributed to borderline levels of B-12 deficiency. 
	The view that Vitamin B-12 can only be obtained from meat is a debatable one.
B-12 can be found in trace amounts in air, water, mushrooms, fermented products and even the herb Radix Angelica Sinensis (Dang Gui), a blood tonic coincidentally9  Some point to the successful primarily vegetarian diets of traditional cultures, or contend that  there is enough natural bacteria in our digestive tract to provide B-12 as a byproduct.  Still others claim that there is enough b-12 in a diet based primarily on whole grains and beans.   Seaweed and micro-algaes have also been proclaimed to be significant sources of this essential vitamin.  Yet, there are problems with all these alternative sources that deserve discussion.<P>

	In traditional cultures organically grown vegetables would have been eaten. There would have been less sanitation, chemicals and pesticides used in the production of crops.  Also modern topsoils have been depleted from many nutrients essential to good nutrition.  Bacteria and insects would have provided  enough B-12 in these instances. 548.185 Other factors in our Modern culture also limit the uptake of vitamin B-12 are the widespread use of antibiotics and birth control pills.  Stress from emotional factors or physical injury adversely affects B-12 absorption, as well as liver disease and chronic illnesses. A perception from a health perspective that traditional cultures were better off however is perhaps idealistic and simplistic.<P>

	In less industrialized cultures of the world it is more likely that fermented products provide an adequate supply of B-12.  However,  many of these products made for mass production are made in highly sanitized environments where bacteria have little chance to form cultures in quantities for significant amounts of B-12.  For similar reasons it is unlikely that there is enough B-12  from flora in the digestive tract for human needs, and it has even yet to be proven that this is even being assimilated.  Obviously antibiotics would be a  significant factor here.  It is helpful to include fermented products in a strictly vegetarian diet, however , as these seem to be beneficial in uptake of the vitamin.<P>

	By far the majority of sources I found on the subject insisted that B-12 must come from animal products.  For the vegan , abstaining from even eggs or milk, it is therefore essential to be finding some supplementation.  One plausible explanation for this overwhelming view is that B-12 is found only in the animal cell is that it helps to synthesize it's DNAC nucleic acid of which thymine is a base.  Vegetable products are primarily sources of RNA structures which have no thymine as a base.  In the case of red blood cell production folic acid will enable the cells to go through intermediate stages of growth, but can not bring them to their full growth. And this is why folic acid may mask symptoms of true blood deficiency for so long. <P>

	Seaweed's and micro-algaes have until recently been praised as being rich sources of vitamin B-12.  Testing has shown however that much of the actual quantities of this vitamin  are not available to by the human body as they are analogs.  The analogs mimic B-12 but can not be utilized by the body, and furthermore may actually be blocking the uptake of usable b-12 by the body.  It is probably not wise to rely on these sources given this information. <P>

	Pitchford recommends the use of a B-12 supplement  for a healthy vegetarian diet. It is perhaps significant to note that this is the only vitamin supplement which he feels is absolutely necessary. B-12 supplements made from nutritional yeast gown in a B-12 solution preferably on molasses or sugar beets.  The uptake of such supplements can be assisted by eating enzyme rich foods such as pickles, sauerkraut, or sprouts.  It is not advisable to take a multivitamin version of B-12 as analogs similar to the case of sea vegetables are often present to block uptake.   This method is probably not the best choice however, for those with problems involving yeast infections. <P>

	Regardless of the various ideas about B-12 absorption presented here.  It is a simple and inexpensive procedure for a clinic to run a vitamin B-12 test.  Perhaps this is an excellent idea to try first ,  before making radical alterations in a patients diet.  <P>



<A NAME="9"><H3>Body Energetics</H3></A>


	An area where many vegetarians seem to get in trouble is the nature of the foods they are eating.  With no regard or understanding to their own  state of body tendencies, many uphold a cold raw foods diet as the healthy way to go.  Many women decide to try to loose weight by eating only cold salads, and thereby destroy the digestive fire, and the spleen's strength in the process.  Another example is vegetarians who only eat  fish, which by nature is a cooling food and depletes the internal warmth. This ,it seems is an area where the practitioner of Oriental Medicine can be particularly useful to the vegetarian. With our understanding of body energetics, as well as that of the climatic environment, it should be easy for us to assess the eating habits of vegetarians and make suggestions based on that.   In order to get the right amount of nutrients, we would say qi, from the foods, it is important for the strict vegetarian to be eating based on foods in season that grow in the local environment, which are fresh and in season.  This idea is also upheld by western nutritionists.   Another important consideration is the racial or ethnic background of a person.  For example many Native Americans do not fare very well on the rich modern  American Diet.  By returning back to a more traditional diet they become healthier and stronger.   Finally, the methods in which foods are cooked should be consistent with these same parameters.  In general however, it is recommended by Taoist nutritionists that most food should be cooked a little bit in order to keep the digestive fire in good health.   Cooking food, even just a little maintains the digestive fire, and allows better digestion of needed nutrients.  According to the Western view on this subject, uncooked and raw foods enzymes and vitamins are destroyed by cooking.  The amount of nutrients measured however is before digestion and not after. This it seems reflects one of the fundamental differences between Western and Eastern.  In the West the focus has been largely on the breakdown of systems into their fundamental parts.  Eastern thinking provides a more macro view in which important things, such as taste and temperature of foods,  is also important to good dietary balance.  One need not be a nutritionist , but be firmly established in the basic diagnostic methods and sensitivity to climatic factors to help a patient make wise decisions in this regard.  It is my experience that this simple information is largely overlooked by many vegetarians, who know nothing of the subject.<P>




	<A NAME="10"><H3>Becoming Vegetarian</H3></A>


	It seems to be a sort of trendy cultural thing these days to say at the coffee shop that  we have made the decision to become vegetarian.  As  mentioned earlier, many people seem to be just switching to vegetarianism without the slightest idea about what this means for their health and how to do it nutritionally.  I myself, have been guilty of this.  For those making the decision to become a vegetarian all the sources agree that this should be a slow process, not overnight.  Pitchford's whole book is geared toward a gradual transition from the typical American diet.  Even Taoist author's who do not advocate a total vegetarian regime, recommend moving slowly to a mostly vegetarian diet. <P>

Vegetarians who return to eating meat experience the same digestive difficulties, so it makes sense that it would work in the reverse.  Perhaps the best thing we can do for the vegetarian patient is point this fact out to them, and get an understanding of what level of maturity the decision to become a vegetarian is at. Getting the patient involved in understanding their nutrition is essential to their being a healthy vegetarian. It can not be done on a whim.<P>


		
<A NAME="11"><H3>	A Final Word</H3></A>


	It should be clear at this point that being a vegetarian is not merely a diet choice, but a way of life.  A vegetarian lifestyle requires discipline, planning, and a conscious effort  to maintain a well rounded diet.  It requires becoming actively involved, and personal responsibility.  One must mature beyond eating things simply because they taste good and develop an attitude of eating for health preservation and personal cultivation.  In addition to merely changing the way one eats, it is necessary to work towards a more harmonious existence in all facets of one's life.  For these reasons, it could be argued that for the majority of Americans,  living healthfully as a vegetarian is a monumental task.  On the other hand, it does not mean it is impossible.  Given the state of disharmony in our modern culture, the devastation of the environment,  and the degree to which untampered meat and animal products is hard to come by, vegetarianism is a lifestyle worthy of considering and encouraging.<P>

	As practitioners of Oriental Medicine it behooves us to remember that we are instruments of influencing body, mind and spirit.  In our Western materialistic society it is often easy for us to focus on ailments of the body, ignoring the rest.  We need to be sensitive and understanding of others who are seeking a more spiritual existence, and be prepared to work with them within the parameters of the lifestyle choices of others.  In our own tradition there are precedents for including at least a little meat in the diet.  There is also a tradition for forgoing this for spiritual purposes. If a patient who has chosen a vegetarian lifestyle is having health difficulties, assessment of their particular regime, and alterations to the diet can be made.  This should be attempted and encourage first, before insisting that meat should be eaten.  According to our own tradition meat should only be  a very small part of the diet anyway.  If it appears that meat is, in our opinion, absolutely necessary, we must be prepared to counsel patients and provide them with a very clear understanding of their health and allow them to make an informed decision.  This strategy should be approached with knowledge and compassion for our vegetarian patients.<P>

Chinese nutrition is the tasty counterpart to Chinese herbology.  The only significant difference between the two is that the nutrition tends to be more appetizing than the herbal tea formulas.<P>

The basis for therapeutic qualities is exactly the same.  On a<A HREF=FoodAct.htm> related page,</A> we take a look at a list of desired results of food remedies, followed by the foods that will provide these therapeutics.<P>

Medicinal porridges are some of the healthiest meals a person can eat. 
They are designed to support both the prenatal root of qi and blood, the kidneys, and the post natal production of qi and blood by supplementing the spleen and stomach. According to the writings of many Chinese doctors, this is the basis for prevention of disease and promotion of good health. 
In fact, the health of the spleen and stomach are so important in human physiology that volumes have been written on this subject. In the words of Tin Zi-jiu, a great doctor of the 19th century, <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The hundreds of diseases of the four seasons all originate in the stomach. As the stomach gets grain, improvement comes. 
Therefore, if the diet is improved one inch, the disease pathogen is forced back one inch. </BLOCKQUOTE><P>


From this statement, we can see the preeminent importance of proper diet both for the purposes of treatment and prevention of disease according to Traditional Chinese Medicine. <P>

The formulas in this article have been compiled from a number of Chinese language sources. These include Zhong Hua Shi Wu Liao Fa Da Quan (A Great Collection of Foodstuff Treatments in China) published by the Tiangsu Science & Technology Press, Yin Shi Liao Fa (Food & Drink Therapy) published by the Guandong Technical Press, Da Zhong Yao Shan (Medicinal Meals of the Masses) published by the Sichuan Science & Technology Press, Qian Jin Shi Zhi (Food Treafments [from the Prescriptions Worth a] Thousand [Pieces of] Gold) and Shi Liao Fang (Food Treatment Formulas) both published by Commercial Press of China, Pian Fang Da Quan (A Great Collection of Folk Formulas) published by the Beijing Science & Technology Press, and Zhong Guo Yao Shan (Medicinal Meals of China) published by the Shanghai College of TCM Press. <P>

Tui Na - Chinese Bodywork Therapy

<BR>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

Tuina is an Oriental Bodywork Therapy that has been used in China for 2,000 years.  Tuina uses the traditional Chinese medical theory of the flow of Qi through the meridians as its basic therapeutic orientation.  Through the application of massage and manipulation techniques Tuina seeks to establish  a more harmonious flow of Qi through the system of channels and collaterals, allowing the body the naturally heal itself.  <P>


Tuina methods include the use of hand techniques to massage the soft tissue  (muscles and tendons) of the body, acupressure techniques to directly affect the flow of Qi , and manipulation techniques to realign the musculoskeletal and ligamentous relationships (bone-setting).  External herbal poultices, compresses, liniments, and salves are also used to enhance the other therapeutic methods.  <P>


Tuina has a variety of different systems that emphasize particular aspects of these therapeutic principles.  The main schools in China include the rolling method school which emphasizes soft tissue techniques and specializes in joint injuries and muscle sprains, the one finger pushing method school which emphasizes techniques for acupressure and the treatment of internal diseases, and Nei Gung method school which emphasizes the use of Nei Gong Qi energy generation exercises and specific massage methods for revitalizing depleted energy systems, and the bone setting method school which emphasizes manipulation methods to realign the musculoskeletal and ligamentous relationships and specializes in joint injuries and nerve pain. <P>



In a typical session, the client, wearing loose clothing and no shoes, lies on a table or floor mat.  The practitioner examines the specific problems of the client and begins to apply a specific treatment protocol.  The major focus of application is upon specific pain sites, acupressure points, energy meridians, and muscles and joints.  Advanced Tuina practitioners may also use Chinese herbs to facilitate quicker healing.  Sessions last from 30 minutes to 1 hour.  Depending on the specific problems of the client, they may return for additional treatments.  The client usually feels relaxed but energized by the treatment.  <P>


Tuina is now being popularized in this country as a powerful therapeutic extension of traditional western massage methods.  Tuina's simplicity and focus on specific problems, rather than a more generalized treatment, make it both an excellent alternative and/or extension of the Swedish-style massage.  By utilizing treatments of shorter duration, it can be used in a variety of settings, including home, office, clinic or hospital.  It is well suited for both the professional massage therapist or the active, health conscious individual.<P>


Tuina practitioners can be found by calling Acupuncture Colleges of the American Oriental Bodywork Therapy Association.<P>






<H2>History</H2>

Tuina dates back to the Shang Dynasty of China, 1700 B.C.E.  Oracle bones show that tuina massage was used to treat children's diseases and digestive complaints in adults.  By 600 C.E. Tuina was included in the Imperial Medical College as a separate department.  Tuina flourished throughout China until the Qing Dynasty where it was suppressed along with other Chinese cultural arts.  Following the Communist revolution, Tuina was restored along with other traditional medical arts and was included in the creation of the current system of Traditional Medicine Colleges.<P>


Currently, Tuina is taught as a separate but equal field of study in the major traditional Chinese medical colleges. Tuina doctors receive the same demanding training as acupuncturists and herbalists and enjoy the same level of professional respect.  <P>


<H2>Benefits, Limitations, Contraindications
</H2>
Tuina is well suited for the treatment of specific musculoskeletal disorders and chronic stress-related disorders of the digestive, respiratory and reproductive systems.  Effective treatment protocols have been tested in a practical setting.  Tuina is not especially useful for those seeking a mild, sedating and relaxing massage since it tends to be more task focused than other types of bodywork.  Contraindications include conditions involving fractures, phlebitis, infectious conditions, open wounds, and lesions.  <P>

Nuad Bo'Rarn:  The Traditional Healing Massage of Thailand

<HR>

The traditional medicine of Thailand is the result of a long historical and cultural development dating back at least 2500 years. As with many indigenous peoples that were capable of establishing a specific cultural expression, the Thai people created their own unique synthesis of traditions and techniques. The Thai people were able to reach a level of societal stability which included the ability to competently treat disease and disharmony of physical, emotional, and spiritual origins. The medicine developed in Thailand evolved into four major branches. These are:<P>
<NL>
<LI>Herbal medicine
<LI>Nutritional Medicine and Food Cures
<LI>Spiritual Practices (essentially from the Theravada Buddhist tradition)
<LI>Physical Medicine: Nuad Bo'Rarn (Traditional Medical Massage)
</NL><P>
Thai medicine represents a coherent traditional medicine that has developed and been refined over the past 25 centuries. Thai medicine has been strongly influenced by both the Ayurvedic tradition of India and the traditional medicine of China. Within this synthesis, there are important components that are purely Thai. Many of the primary techniques to treat the wide range of disorders that afflict people are contained within the practice of Nuad Bo'Rarn, the physical medicine of Thailand. Although Nuad Bo'Rarn is often considered to be a form of massage, it contains elements and techniques that are quite different from the common notions of massage and would more correctly be categorized as a form of peripheral stimulation. Contained within these techniques are the direct and clear intentions of the practitioner to effect the physiology and energetics of the body and mind of the recipient.<P>


Nuad Bo'Rarn, the traditional physical medicine of Thailand, is practiced very slowly, with an emphasis on both the practitioner and client being in a heightened or meditative state of consciousness. Nuad Bo'Rarn is recognized to be a practical application of the Buddhist concept of 'Metta,' or loving kindness. Nuad Bo'Rarn demonstrates the 'Four Divine States' of mind that are discussed in Buddhism: compassion, loving kindness, vicarious joy and equanimity. This form of healing work allows for the fulfillment of the Buddhist teaching of bringing higher ideals into everyday life and activities. Furthermore, this style of healing work has always placed an emphasis on the mind/body connection and has been utilized as a tool in the treatment of emotional and spiritual disorders.<P>


Stretching and extending the range of motion of the client's body are an important part of Thai massage. The stretching often takes the form of double or assisted Yoga. Once the client has relaxed deeply, the practitioner, with a heightened sensitivity, stretches the client to his or her comfortable limit.<P>


A vital aspect of the theory underlying Thai Medicine is the importance placed on the abdominal region. According to Thai Medicine, all the major energy pathways of the body have their origin in the abdominal region in the vicinity of the navel. Therefore, the abdominal massage is a crucial component of the healing benefit of this medicine.<P>

Obstetrics and Acupressure

<HR>



<H1>Introduction</H1> 
I have been a registered nurse for 21 years and have been involved in women's health and worked in labor and delivery for the past 18. I studied Chinese medicine at the Midwest Center for the Study of Oriental Medicine in Chicago because I was interested in bridging western medicine and the ancient knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine in labor and delivery work. I offer the following cases as illustrative of what I have done using simple Chinese medicine techniques even, at times, in the less than welcoming environment of a hospital where only acupressure can be used. 
I hope these experiences will encourage other practitioners to use whatever techniques are feasible despite the limitations under which we may have to work. <P><HR>

</OL>


<HR>

<A NAME=1> <H2>Case #1--Labor Dystocia</H2></A> 
A 32-year-old woman primapara presents with labor dystocia. Her vaginal exam revealed her to be at 7 cm., 80 % effaced and -2 station for 2 hours. 
She was on pitocin and not making progress in labor. The doctors were contemplating Caesarean section. They were concerned that the baby's head was still not engaged at such advanced dilation which might indicate that the baby could not fit into the pelvis. It seemed that the baby's head should have descended by now. 

<H3>Treatment Principle</H3>

To activate blood circulation, correct stasis, regulate qi and induce labor by 
strengthening and stimulating the uterus. <P>

I performed acupressure on St 36 (su san li ), Sp 6 (san yin jiao) and LI 4 (he gu). I alternated the combination first combining LI 4 with St 36 then with 
Sp 6.  I used mild to moderate pressure for approximately 15-20 minutes. I 
instructed her husband to press GB 21 (jian jing). 


<H3>Discussion of Points</H3>
 
LI 4, the yuan source point of the Large Intestine channel and Sp 6, the 
intersecting point of the yin channels of the foot, are important points for 
inducing labor as they regulate and circulate qi and blood and induce downward movernent. St 36, the he-sea point of the Stomach channel combined with Sp 6 invigorates the Spleen and Stomach, produces qi and blood and induces labor. GB 21 was chosen for its downbearing action to facilitate the movement of the baby's head. 

<H3>Results</H3>

Within 20 minutes the contractions became more efficient and stronger in 
intensity. I was able to lower her pitosin dose as her own contractions kicked 
in. The patient's mental outlook became much more positive, because she 
began to feel the baby's head moving downward (increased rectal pressure.) Within 1 hour the patient was completely dialated and ready to push. 
We pushed for 1 hour going from a -2 station (head not engaged) to a +3 
station where she delivered spontaneously. We all felt elated that by looking at the body in a different way and moving the energy we could help her 
deliver this baby and avoid a C-section. 
<P>
<HR>
<A NAME=2> <H2>Case #2--Malposition of Fetus </H2></A>
A 28-year-old woman presented with her first pregnancy, breech presentation at 38 weeks gestation. Malposition of the fetus does not produce any 
sign or subjective symptoms. Diagnosis was established by gynecological 
and obstetrical examination. 

<H3>Treatment Principle</H3>

The principle of treatment was to correct the position of the fetus and 
regulate the Kidney qi. Moxibustion was applied to UB 67 (zhi yin) on each 
toe. 
<H3>Discussion of Points</H3>
 
UB 67 was chosen as the jing-well point of the Urinary Bladder channel which has an internal external relationship with the Kidney channel. By stimulating this point the qi of the Kidney channel is thus regulated. Also experimental research has shown that secretion of the adrenal cortical hormone is promoted by moxibustion to this point which activates uterine contraction and may be responsible for causing this fetal movement. Her husband applied moxibustion to UB 67 on each toe for approximately 20 minutes daily with the hips slightly elevated. The patient was instructed to visualize the baby turning in a healthy way. Moxibustion can be applied in this manner as soon as the patient discovers the fetus is breech, which will be around 32-36 weeks gestation. <P>


Treatment should be discontinued once the baby has turned which can be determined by examination by the physician, midwife. The mother herself will probably know by where the baby is kicking. If the baby is breech kicking is usually felt in the lower portion of the abdomen whereas if the baby is vertex, kicking is felt at the upper portion near her abdomen or ribs. This may also be confirmed by ultrasound or the Leopold maneuver.
 
<H3>Results</H3>
 
Within five days the patient came to labor and delivery completely dilated with a normal presentation and delivered a healthy 81b. 12 oz. baby whom she named Max the Moxa Baby. 

<H3>Notes</H3>

Babies also respond to light and sound. A pair of headphones can be placed on the mother's lower abdomen with music playing and the baby will often respond by moving in the direction of the sound. A flashlight can also be shown at the lower abdomen which may cause the baby to move toward the light. If none of these techniques work it may be that the baby is meant to deliver breech. Cephalopelvic disproportion or malformation of the uterus may be the cause. It may be important to check with the obstetrician or midwife to make sure that the patient is having an uncomplicated pregnancy. 
<P>
<HR>
<A NAME=3><H2>Neonatal Resuscitation </H2></A>

We all like to hear the healthy cry of a newborn once delivered. To hear the baby brings a sigh of relief, but on occasion this does not happen. This may be caused by trauma of delivery, stress of labor or use of narcotics during labor; major biomedical resuscitation techniques may be required. I have had success reviving infants using Chinese medicine, the techniques for 
which are reviewed below. 

<H3>Treatment Principle</H3>

Invigorate the yang, resuscitate and revive.  I perform acupressure on GV 26 (ren zhong), CV 17 (shan zhong), Lu 1 (zhong fu) and UB 13 (fei shut). 

<H3>Discussion of Points</H3>
 
It is interesting that in the text "Graspig the Wind", GV 26 (ren zhong) is likened to humankind standing in the center between heaven and earth because its resuscitation capabilities certainly have the effect of pulling the baby from its heavenly origin to its earthbound destination. <P>


On a newborn, GV 26 is an extremely small area. I use my thumb and aim right below the nose a little above the midpoint of the philtrum and apply moderate pressure in an upward motion for a few seconds. If the baby is grunting or retracting (where the baby's chest is pulling in), I apply gentle massage in a downward motion to CV 17 to regulate the qi, clear the Lung, transform phlegm, loosen the chest and disinhibit the diaphragm. Lu l courses the Lung qi. I use gentle massage in a circular motion. UB 13 is the back shu point of the Lung channel which regulates the Lung qi. 

<H3>Results</H3>

These points have a very good result for reviving the newborn and stimulating respiration. Within seconds the baby is screaming. (The doctors look at me to see what voodoo I have done now.) 

<H3>Notes</H3>

Sometimes the baby will begin to urinate soon after these resuscitation techniques. This is a good sign and reinforces the conception that the Kidneys have grasped the qi.<P>
 

This success does not alter the fact that some infants will need major resuscitation if heavy narcotics were used during labor, there was meconium aspiration or with other emergency situations like abruptio placenta or placenta previa in which the oxygen flow has been cut off to the fetus.<P>

 
I am not allowed to practice acupuncture in the hospital because of the legal prohibitions in Illinois, but with the consent of the midwives and openminded physicians I am able to make a difference using the wisdom of Oriental medicine. <P>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
	There is a story about a man who lived about 8,000 years ago in China.  One day, as he was walking merrily along, he bumped his leg.  Without thinking, he began to rub his wound, and the pain went away.  He found that when you bump your leg, it doesn't hurt as much if you rub it.  In this moment, what we now call Traditional Chinese Medicine was born out of an instinctive response to pain.  <P>

	Meanwhile, Taoist adepts were making it a habit to give in to their most natural responses as well.  They became aware of the constant interplay between nature outside the individual and the nature within.  They were able to blur the boundaries between the individual and his environment. <P>

	As such, they began to witness the wonders of naked perception unfettered by reason.  They saw light radiating from children's eyes and became sensitive to these less tangible visual experiences. <P>

	In time, their sensitivity grew to the point where internal organs and channels were illuminated to those with a developed sense of sight and the body of knowledge that became TCM grew and grew.<P>

	Today, we must memorize point locations and syndrome differentiation to pass a test.  Rather than spend our time learning to trust our instincts, letting go of left brain perceptual limitations, or intuiting the appropriate series of points to needle, we are taught to memorize what others have already discovered for us.  Ancient Taoist masters of healing would probably view this memorization much like teaching a sighted person to read Braille.  <P>

	The body of knowledge that we are taught in our diagnosis and Zang fu classes are nothing more than the notes left behind by all those before us who have banged their knees and rubbed away the pain.  Even though we must feverishly study for finals and State board examinations we will discover, in the end, that TCM is not memorized, it is remembered.<P>

	In this paper, I hope to describe some of the more important steps necessary to rediscover the Traditional Chinese art of diagnosis within us all.  There are three that I address in this paper.<P>
<OL>

<LI>  The Now.
<LI>  Vision minus comparison
<LI>  Cessation of personal ego.
</OL><P>

In one form or another, every major religion in the world today strives to reach one of these above mentioned goals.  Usually in the form of #3, though 1 and 2 often come up as bi-products, or steps toward the third.  They are religious pinnacles that holy men from all walks of life have achieved and from the unique perspective of these levels of personal development, these spiritual adepts have all realized the same truths.  It is from this same perspective that TCM is elevated from a medical science of memorizing signs and symptoms to a career that actually mimics the priesthood.  TCM can become a spiritual path of self-realization utilizing the same internal disciplines that are expected of any monk in a Tibetan lamasery, a Franciscan parish, or a Taoist monastery.<P>

<HR>

<H3>Intuitive diagnosis can only be achieved 
in The Now.</H3>

	The human body exists in three dimensions.  It reacts to the fourth, that of time and space, but it is the fifth dimension that has been set aside for mankind's next step in evolution.  Or perhaps it is a return to the intelligence of our primal nature.  Either way, it can be described as "The Now,"  and it is from this unique vantage point that Taoist adepts realized the diagnostic genius of TCM.  <P>

	Meeting a patient for the very first time can be a blinding experience from a diagnostic standpoint.  Our human defenses and subconscious memories get in the way from seeing anybody for the very first time unimpeded by these unconscious reactions. <P>

	To diagnose, it is essential to see things As They Are, and this can only happen in The Now.  When we step out of The Now, we begin to compare what we see to what we've seen in the past, or our expectations of the future.  It is a subtle shift in focus but once done, we become conscious not of What Is, but of What Isn't.  We cease to see things or people As They Are in and of themselves and instead, see everyone in relation to others.  <P>

	One key to transcending even the most unconscious of judgments is to remain in The Now.  In my experience, once this goal is achieved, one will find that The Now isn't a static level of consciousness, but a starting point from which more and more subtle experiences eventually begin to manifest.  There are realms of perception that can be explored wherein you are so present to the moment that you loosen your attachment to the five senses and begin to perceive people on a level that is all feeling, or colors and sounds or any mixture of senses that may or may not be consistent with commonly accepted applications of these senses.  Appearances take on sounds, sounds have taste, tastes have shape and weight, and feelings have tone.  Suddenly, Yin deficiency is no longer the signs and symptoms we memorize in class, but a sense of lacking attachment to the earth, or the feeling that the patient could be shoved over easily.  In The Now, we find a symphony of new sensations swimming all around.  Sensations we've known before, but didn't realize were present all the time until we could step out of time.  <P>

	In The Now, signs and symptoms can be read into any expression of the patient.  Clothes are no longer what the patient happened to wear that day, but costumes wherein each accessory says volumes about the one who wears it.  It is as if there is a Hollywood costume designer just outside your office creating these dimensional "looks" for everybody's unique personality.  There is no more such a thing as wearing "nothing special."  <P>

	For diagnostic purposes clothing tells a great deal about one's lifestyle both externally and emotionally.  It is just like a costume worn that the Shen picks out everyday.  It is as much a reflection of the person's health as are the colors on their tongue.  When approaching the patient and seeing them "As They Are," everything speaks to the doctor.  	<P>

	Unfortunately, blue jeans doesn't mean anything in particular unless connected to a person.  We couldn't sit in class and learn, under signs and symptoms, that wearing blue jeans always denotes an imbalance in the fire element.  Jeans ripped in horizontal bands at the knees worn by a high school student from Beverly Hills says more about that student's need to fit in with her peers, than the jeans ripped in the same manner worn by a longshoreman from Los Angeles Harbor.  The signs have to be kept in context, and not removed from The Now, nor the patient.  
	Some clothing designers take their inspiration from military fashion.  Depending on the person, gravitating toward militaristic fashions can denote a deficiency of earth yang energy.  Liver is known as the general, but it is the spleen and stomach that I associate with the military mentality.  Earth is what gives you the strength to hold your ground, wood is where we find the propulsion to move.   One who tends toward the built up shoulders and square lines of military based fashion may feel deficient in personal power.  The broad shoulders and square lines, along with the decidedly masculine texture of the clothing suggests a need for stability and discipline which can include a deficiency in spleen yang.  The person who feels the need to dress with a military attitude may be doing so for the added energetics of earth energy.  On a constitutional level, you'll find these people to be thin and lacking in muscle tone.  They are, among men, the so-called "99 pound weakling."  They grow mustaches to make themselves look more "manly," but they don't exercise much,  they don't have the drive, nor the energy.  If they do work out, it doesn't show well on their bodies, because their spleen yang is deficient and the muscles simply don't grow and develop definition.   They make up for it the best they can through their fashion, and the energetics of that fashion.<P>

	The above scenario is just an example, not a hard and fast rule.  Again, I stress, one's clothing must be kept in context.  If the clothing doesn't agree with any other signs and symptoms or one's internal sense, it may be that they've run out of clean clothes and are wearing what they've got on only because they don't smell as bad as the dirty ones they would have rather worn.  Keep in mind that on this level of diagnosis, signs and symptoms are not separate from the patient, they all roll together into a highly unified package, like a well constructed paragraph wherein every word supports the underlying message.<P>

	Pulse diagnosis had to have been discovered in The Now.  It is another blending of senses, like listening with your fingertips.  For the West to perceive pulse as slippery, or choppy is quite a leap in faith, and yet we've all come to know the difference.  In The Now, we can discover numerous other signs and symptoms above and beyond those described in class as we reach back and connect with the Taoist Ancients whose energies of diagnostic brilliance still exist in The Now.<P>

	Staying in The Now with your patient, or anybody for that matter, is the same as viewing someone without any comparison to past memories or future expectations.  There is another way of looking at this experience, and that is viewing things by themselves, with no relationship.<P>

<HR>

<H3>Seeing it As It Is-<BR>

Vision minus comparison.</H3>

	The subtle prejudgement of viewing someone solely as a "sick patient" is the first of many limiting perceptions that get in the way of a clear and accurate diagnostic response.  To view someone as a child sees, with no judgment, conscious of nothing upon which one could base any comparisons, with total acceptance and lack of expectation is truly an eye opening experience.  It is this ability to see without interpreting that is another way of describing the foundation of TCM diagnosis on the intuitive level.<P>

	Many, if not all traditional paths, (and even numerous alternative traditions) describe a perceptual shift that accompanies the cessation of all judgment.  Some approach this point with disciplines that retain one in The Now.  Others approach this point as the cessation of all judgments, comparisons, and expectations.  It always has the same effect, you can still see things As They Are and diagnose on a whole new level because of cessation of judgment, this removal of illusion.<P>

	To describe anybody in terms other than what they are nearly always assumes a judgment of some sort.  When I say that you are tall, smart, well dressed, or funny, I am not seeing you As Your Are, but solely in comparison to some other arbitrarily set standard.  To whom or what am I comparing your height, intelligence, fashion sense, or sense of humor?  With any comparison we lose the essence of our perceptions and with it, a great deal of diagnostic insight.<P>

	Interestingly, the Hindu tradition spends a great deal of time teaching it's adherents to transcend "Maya" which translates to "illusion."  The word "Maya" made it's way from the Indian Sanskrit to the European Latin where it became the word "Mensura" which evolved further to eventually be known in modern English as "measure."  This supports again, the fact that illusion comes from measurements, or comparisons.
	Unfortunately, to this day, man has yet to devise a fool-proof method by which to judge one another.  When we compare someone to the way we feel they should be, or fear that they might be, we are already creating an arbitrary measuring stick which doesn't take into account What Is.  We blind ourselves in this need to compare what we see to what we were expecting.  We lose the simple powers of observation for diagnostic purposes when this occurs, and it happens all the time.<P>

	I was looking at the feet of a friend recently.  They caught my eye because of their unique shape.  They are rather wide at the toes and narrow at the heel.  When I stopped comparing her feet to the way I felt feet should look I began to realize that her feet resembled the talons of an eagle.  They have their own unique beauty and an energetic quite different from my own long flat feet.  Until I could look at her feet As They Are, I couldn't see their energetics.  <P>

	I asked her if she had good balance, assuming that with feet with the energetics like eagle's talons, she would have a predisposition to activities that could energetically grip the earth.  She said she did, and proved it to me with some gymnastic moves she'd learned on the balance beam as a child.<P>

	Seeing without comparing is something our minds do all the time.  When we notice what we are perceiving, unconsciously, we find energetic information coming to us in volumes at a time.  <P>

 I was downstairs in a Chinese herb pharmacy.  I started going through the drawers of herbs just to explore what new materials I could find.  I wasn't thinking about what I was doing, I was just waiting for someone.  I dipped my hand into one of the herbs and let it run through my fingers.  It felt good, a little like when you sift sand through your fingers at the beach.  It had a similar consistency, and yet it wasn't dry like sand.  There was a sense of moisture in the little seeds.  Without thinking, my hands had discovered the energetics of this herb which was lubricating and descending.  Learning the herbs with the conscious mind doesn't allow for the personal discovery of their energetics, we are too focused with their attributes in comparison to the other herbs to notice.  We do not establish a direct relationship with the herbs, instead we become acquainted with their data.  In the end, memorizing the qualities of the herbs in class, and discovering them for one's self provides us with the same information, but when you discover the energetics for yourself, there's no need to memorize, you already know.<P>

	Seeing without interpreting is the state in which the ancient Taoist adepts remained 24 hours per day.  This made them sensitive to the totality of the patient.  Their client's essence was never fractured by comparisons to arbitrary standards, past memories or future expectations.  To the TCM master, the patient was the very first person they ever saw in their entire life.  Every nuance of movement, every slight color or odor, sound or texture was a symphony that stood out in all of it's resonant simplicity.  Signs and symptoms were multi-dimensional experiences that the master could not ignore.  For the Taoists, seeing without interpretation became a way of perceiving the world outside one's self.  These visionaries gained the ability to See, but as yin and yang would have it, they lost something in the process.  They lost themselves...<P>
<HR>

	
<H3>The sage does nothing, and yet everything gets done.<BR>

Cessation of personal ego in TCM</H3>

	Watching T.V. for a few hours slows down your mind.  Afterwards, when you turn off the television, you are only conscious of the room.  There are no thoughts in your head.  Sometimes, there is no me, and no non-me, there is just the state of silent awareness of one's immediate environment.  This is a little like the cessation of the personal ego.  It begins with silence in the mind.  The famous Yaqui Indian sorcerer, Don Juan, used to tell his student, Carlos Castaneda, to "turn off his internal dialog."  Yogi's sit for years in silence.  Catholic monks contemplate God in silence.  My dad used to always tell me to "Sit down and shut-up."  My dad's way didn't work very well, but the rest of them do.<P>

	Different paths approach these steps differently.  In the East, meditation or yoga may be employed so as to still the mind and transcend it into a more pure and universal consciousness.  The Masters of the East talk about blending into the "Nothing," or becoming nothing.  In the West the same result of transcending the personal ego is achieved through a relationship with God.  Adepts of the Western paths give up to God, any and all personal needs, or as Jesus put it, "Not my will, but thine will be done."  This is something that can only be said by someone with no other purpose in life but to serve God.  Again, their personal ego is put aside and their essential nature is realized.<P>

	Transcendence of the personal ego is not an issue of overcoming pride or arrogance, even though these are bi-products.  Rather, it is the sense of self as a separate entity that is the personal ego one can overcome.  There is some activity in which everyone can partake in which the enjoyment is so deep and complete that they lose all awareness of themselves in the activity.  It brings out our unbridled divinity.  This is another way of describing the transcendence of the personal ego.<P>

	Meditation is famous for taking you to this point as well.  At one point, no matter what your focus is, a sound, posture, martial art, or the flame of a candle, this so called "nothingness" can be achieved, and it is this acting without self-consciousness that is the other half of the diagnostic skills set forth in this paper.<P>

	I've written about the clarity that comes from The Now, or seeing things without any comparisons to anything other than itself.  With the transcendence of the personal ego, one can also act on what one perceives with the same precision and inspiration.  In Zen Buddhism, the words "intimate" and "spontaneous relationship" come up frequently.  It is this same automatic response to what one's unconscious perceives that brought out the genius of the TCM masters who came before us.<P>

	When acting from a place of non-being, where you don't matter anymore, your Hun (soul of the Liver) acts in perfect accordance the needs of the moment.  With the monarch's (Heart in five element theory) approval, with the stepping aside of the bureaucracy of the twelve officials, the general (Liver) can respond to it's environment with wisdom,  clarity and spontaneity.  In this state, one finds the distinctions blurred between doctor and patient.  You don't think about it.  You witness your patient, and without thinking, you act.  There is, however one draw back to practicing medicine in this spontaneous manner.  In many doctor/patient relationships, the doctor needs to stop and ask permission, or provide explanation before treating the patient, especially with points such as Du 1,  Ren 1, or the channels of the chest on a woman.  For the TCM masters of yesterday, this presumably wasn't an issue.<P>

	Acting without ego boundaries makes it difficult to stop, turn around, look into the past and remember what you did in a treatment, since the part of you that memorized information and became a licensed acupuncturist didn't do anything.  In fact, this level of Traditional Diagnosis completely skips the step between the diagnosis, and the treatment.  There is no need for treatment principle.  There is no need for diagnosis either.  It is, as some martial arts teach, a block and a punch at the same time.  It is responding to the diagnosis with the treatment before the disharmony ever even becomes conscious.<P>

Given a list of signs and symptoms, pulse qualities and tongue appearances ancient masters of TCM would likely be at a loss to provide a medical examiner a specific pattern of disharmony.  They might ask to see the patient themselves to remember what they did, because a list of signs and symptoms is what comes after the patient is diagnosed, not before.  Signs and symptoms are the verifications for those who watched the master point out the disharmony long before anyone else could see what was wrong.  The students of the master might ask how he knew to do what he or she did, and the master might ask himself the very same question.  Chances are, the master would not be able to provide a very good answer until he looked again at the patient and broke down the patient's totality into individual expressions of what the master saw.  Signs and symptoms, as we are taught, are the afterthoughts of the earliest TCM masters in an attempt to give their students clues to get them to the bigger picture.  Signs and symptoms then, are pieces of a puzzle that mean nothing until all of the pieces are put together, and the picture becomes clear again.<P>
<HR>


<H3>Summary: "What Is"</H3> 

	It is written that the Great Tao is invisible, yet everywhere.  To become conscious of the Tao is to truly see What Is.   The great TCM masters understood how to see the Great Tao.  I used to believe that to see The Great Tao was to somehow be able to read between the lines of life to discover something hidden from mortal man.  However, in my experience with Taoism and TCM, I've found the opposite to be true.  The hidden that becomes clear is not something that has to be searched for, rather it is our internally generated illusions that must be removed unveiling the reality of the obvious.  The TCM masters of ancient times removed the veils of perceptual habit to discover vast volumes of knowledge unfolding constantly before their eyes.  They did it in The Now; they did it by seeing things As They Are without any interpretation, comparisons or judgment, and they blended diagnosis with treatment through the cessation of their personal ego.  <P>

	Any career path can lead one to self-realization, but only TCM can elevate even it's first year interns to witness a little glimpse of eternity.  Someday, I want to master the stilling of my conscious mind and the realize the much larger chunk of divine consciousness that silently awaits my discovery.  Until then, I'll search for TCM  in my heart, I'll seek to understand what is taught in class, and when it's absolutely positively without a doubt-no way out- necessary, I'll memorize.  For my goal is not to know TCM, not to practice it, but to be it, just like the ancient masters.<P>

Everything in the Universe vibrates - matter, electromagnetic waveforms
and spirit. One essential difference between levels is frequency of vibration. 
Human beings have the potential to perceive a vast range of frequencies, far
more than is commonly acknowledged.  From daily experience we can see that
different people have different experiences when it comes to frequency - some
are able to "pick up vibes" better than others, just as each person generally has
favorite, or at least habitual, parts of experience where they normally pay the
most attention.  How then do we know what we know?  In one experiment,
researchers in San Antonio determined that people were not consciously aware
of being stared at, but galvanic skin responses were significantly higher during
the staring periods with odds against chance of better than 100 to 1.  Our bodies
know, if we only let ourselves listen.<P>


     In a different set of experiments, objective science (behavioral psychology),
was unable to prove the existence of consciousness, mostly because they were
unable to clarify an objective way to test for it.  An interesting side effect of this
is that they were also unable to prove the existence of unconsciousness.  This
means that it is scientifically unsound (i.e. unproven superstition) to say that 
mountains, trees, rivers, etc. are not conscious.  This also means that science
cannot disprove the correctness of American Indian and other "primitive" tribal
cultures in saying that we can communicate with the rocks, flowers, Earth, Sun
and stars.  By using our innate, generally untapped abilities we can develop the
ability to perceive clear resonant responses and effectively receive information
from Life in all it's diverse richness.<P>


     With training and practice it becomes possible to access a vastly expanded
range of energetic frequencies, even by those who feel they are not naturally
talented in this way.  This skill is extremely flexible and, when used creatively
allows connection with multi-dimensional levels.  There are two essentials for
developing this skill:  1) A way to get feedback, and 2) Appropriate, clear,
effective question-asking.<P>


     Feedback in Resonant Energetics is gathered through the mechanism of
Resonance - the ability to tune perception to specific levels of experience using
Intention.  Any technique such as dowsing, use of a pendulum, applied
kinesiology (muscle-testing), and various forms of ideo-motor signaling can be
used to read the resonance.  This is relatively easy as long as you practice open
skepticism, in other words, the willingness to get whatever answer you get and to
double-check your work from different angles.<P>


     Once ability is developed with a feedback technique, the degree of success
is entirely determined by effective question-asking - "Seek and ye shall find,
knock and it shall be opened unto you."  As with everything, the context of any
specific situation has enormous bearing on question-asking protocols - if you
want to measure lightning, don't use a rain gauge.  For example, in the healing
arts you might ask questions relating to assessment of the patient's condition or
the appropriate healing modalities which may be effective.  On the other hand,
you would want to ask very different questions if faced with a difficult work
situation.<P>


     It is important to know, and to remember, that all of your actions will
generate additional feedback.  This means that as you open your levels of
awareness to more and higher levels, you must continue to pay attention and be
willing to adapt.  It doesn't pay to get caught in reflexive habit patterns when you
are moving through the complex variables that make up life.<P>

<hr>

Mediante la aguja o el calor, el acupuntor estimula los mecanismos sanadores
del paciente, obteniendo resultados concretos y autenticos. Hay tanto de
enfermedad en la salud, y tanto de salud en la enfermedad. Encontrar el
equilibrio entre estos dos contrarios es la forma en la que la acupuntura
actua, por medio de la energia vital o "qui".
La cantidad de enfermedades a tratar es multiple. No hay que dejar que la
enfermedad degenere.

I have practiced acupuncture since 1988. I treat people who have a full variety of concerns (such as pain, stress, chronic conditions, fatigue, menstrual difficulties, menopause). My special interests are helping people with emotional difficulties (such as depression, recovery from abuse) and assisting people to maintain the health of their body, mind and spirit. I am a full faculty member of the Traditional Acupuncture Institute and a senior teacher in The School of T'ai Chi Chuan. I love being an acupuncturist!<P><HR>

[Mo.B.301] ALTERNATIVE THERAPY USE IN HIV POSITIVE WOMEN<P>

<B>Objective:</B> To characterize the use of alternative therapies in a group of HIV positive women.

<B>Methods: </B> Forty-two percent (26/62) of female patients attending an ambulatory HIV clinic were identified as using alternative therapies. Using a structured telephone interview, the use of alternative therapies in this population was characterized.<P>

<B>Results: </B> Sixteen patients consented to a telephone interview. Demographics: 98% caucasian; mean age 35years(range 21 to 47);years since diagnosis 69% 1-4years, 25% 5-10 years;mean CD4 count 413 (range 50-1020);education-62% had post-secondary education. Fifty-five different alternative therapies were reported in current use (mean 8.5 per patient, range 2-20).Treatments were categorized as Herbal remedies (38%), Vitamins and minerals (29%), Relaxation techniques and massage (9%),Folk remedies(2%), Acupuncture(2%),and Other, such as acidophilus,DNCB,nacetylcysteine (20%). Seventeen different therapies were reported as discontinued(mean 1.9 per patient,range 1-7). Reasons for discontinuing therapy included: no benefit(31%),too expensive(19%),side effects(12.5%),detrimental to HIV (25%). The most common source of information on therapies was friends (50%), with only 19% of patients getting information from health care workers. Almost 50% said the information they received on these treatments was inadequate. Seventy-five percent of respondents spent over $100 per month on alternative treatments. The average yearly income for the group was $10,000 to 20,000 per year.In comparison to previous studies in homosexual men with similar demographics women with HIV are more likely to use a wide variety of herbal remedies and less likely to use acupuncture.<P>

<B>Conclusions: </B> Many HIV positive women use a wide variety of alternative therapies. The economic burden of paying for these treatments is significant, and patients lack sources of reliable information regarding their use. HIV positive women appear to have a different pattern of alternative therapy use compared to men.<P>

[LB.A.6014] ANTI-HIV PROPERTIES OF CHINESE MEDICINAL HERB-H.C.X<P>

Zhuo, Huan C1, Hudson JB2, Lee W1. 1Zhuollen Technology Ltd., New Westminster; 2University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada<P>

<B>Objective: </B> To evaluate Chinese Herbal Complex X for anti-HIV activity.<P>

<B>Materials: </B> Lonicera japonica; Taraxacum monoglicum; Phellodendron Chinese; Coix lacryma-jobi; Astragalus membranaceus; Boswellia carterii etc.<P>

<B>Methods: </B>The plaque-assays of evaluation of HCX had carried out in virology laboratory, Division of Medical Microbiology, VGH. Results: 25-50% HCX was non-toxic and displayed significant anti-Sindbis virus activity; 20-40% HCX had anti-mouse cytomegalovirus activity effects, but less than the former. The tests for anti-HIV activity were carried out in the B.C. Provincial AIDS Lab. (B.C. Centre for Disease Control) in conformity with regulations for HIV culture work. The extract, derived by steam extraction of HCX powder, is considered the starting material (100%) after making isotonic with concentrated saline solution. The extract was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 minutes in the Sorvall centrifuge to pellet particula material. The clear supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of double-strength medium and filtered. The extract was then diluted with different volumes of medium and mixed (in duplicate) with an equal volume of HIV (103 TCD50) in the wells of tissue culture trays. Final concentrations of the extract (1001+1001virus) were 50, 30, 20, 10, 5 and 0%. The mixtures were incubated at 37c for 60 minutes and 4x105 CEM cells, in 2.0 ml complete medium (10% serum) were added to each culture well. At 5 days culture supernat. were removed for p24 antigen assays.<P>

<B>Conclusions: </B> 1) HCX had significant anti-HIV activity. At concentration 50%, there were no viral CPE, i.e. the virus had been completely destroyed. 2) There was no difference between the extracts derived from 4 different sources.<P>

[Tu.B.170] WORLDS APART?: CHINESE AND AMERICAN INTERNISTS ADHERE TO SIMILAR ETHICAL STANDARDS FOR PERSONS WITH HIV/AIDS.<P>

MD Feldman, J Zhang, H. Tabor, SR Cummings, T. Coates. Center for AIDS Prevention Studies (CAPS), University of California, San Francisco, Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, USA and the State Science and Technology Commission, Beijing, Peoples Republic of China.<P>

<B>Objective: </B> There has been speculation, but little data, about cross-cultural differences in approaches to clinical ethical dilemmas such as truth telling, the role of family's wishes, and assisted suicide, that arise in the care of HIV infected persons. In particular, there have been no direct comparisons of bioethical practices between the US and China in the care of persons with HIV/AIDS. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that Chinese and US internists have different ethical standards with HIV/AIDS patients about informing them of terminal diagnoses (truth telling), the role of family versus patients wishes, and assisted suicide, as compared with patients with other medical problems.<P>

<B>Methods: </B>We developed 15 clinical vignettes followed by a series of multiple choice questions. The vignettes and questions were translated and back translated into Chinese and English and pre-tested in each country. We surveyed 40 randomly selected internists on staff at both university and community hospitals in San Francisco and Beijing.<P>

<B>Results: </B> 95% of the US internists but none of the Chinese internists surveyed would inform a patient with cancer of her diagnosis (p<.001). However, when the terminally ill patient had AIDS instead of cancer, 100% of US and 90% of Chinese internists would tell the patient the diagnosis. Similarly, while only 15% of Chinese internists, but 30% of the Americans, were willing to assist a terminally ill cancer patient obtain enough narcotics to end her life (p<.05), 45% of the Chinese internists were willing to withhold life sustaining treatment from a terminally ill patient with AIDS. Both Chinese and American internists were in strong agreement that physicians should inform patients of the results of their HIV tests, and both agreed that partners have an obligation to inform each other of a positive test. When family members wishes conflicted with patient's preferences regarding treatment of life threatening conditions, Chinese internists were more likely to follow the family's instead of the patient's preferences (65%) than were US internists (5%; P<.001), irregardless of the patient' diagnosis.<P>

<B>Conclusions: </B> Clinical ethical practices between US and Chinese internists were more similar with patients with HIV/AIDS than with patients with other serious medical problems. US internists virtually always and Chinese doctors almost never tell cancer patient's their diagnosis, but both groups would generally inform patients of an AIDS diagnosis. US physicians are much more willing to assist in ending the life of terminally ill patients with cancer, but only somewhat more willing to withhold life sustaining treatment from a terminally ill person with AIDS. However, Chinese physicians give greater weight to family than to patient preferences irregardless of the underlying illness. We conclude that differences in clinical ethical practices between internists in the US and China are less extreme in the care of persons with HIV/AIDS.<P>

 [Mo.D.1858] DESIGN OF BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS FOR INJECTION DRUG USERS PROMOTING NEEDLE EXCHANGE USING COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THEORY<P>

Titus, Stephen P*, Marmor M*, Harrison C*, Des Jarlais D**. *NYU Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; **Beth Israel Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.<P>

<B>Objective: </B>Recent research evaluating the impact of needle exchange programs (NEPs) has found an overall beneficial impact on HIV-related risk behavior and on HIV-seroincidence. This study examines the framework of the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) to guide future behavioral interventions aimed at increasing use of NEPs among New York City injection drug users (IDUs).<P>

<B>Methods: </B>An open-ended questionnaire based on the TRA was interviewer administered to 436 injection drug users (67.4% male, 32.6% female; 22% Caucasian, 32% African American, 46% Hispanic; median age=40 years, range 23 to 67; median years of education=12, range 3 to 18) between November 1994 and May 1995. The responses were coded and checked for reliability of the coding procedure. Perceptions were compared between NEP users and non-users who reported IDU in the prior 3 months.<P>

<B>Results: </B> IDUs who use NEPs had different perceptions of the program than persons who are injecting and have not used NEPs. Non-users of NEPs were more likely to report that structural barriers, e.g., hours/location and having a more convenient source for needles, deterred their NEP use (88.1% vs. 35.8%). Non-users of NEPs were less likely to report: (1) perceived advantages of NEPs (3.4% vs. 25.8%, e.g., availability of clean/free needles, condoms, bleach, acupuncture, counseling or referrals at the NEP), (2) perceived social approval for NEP use (62.7% vs. 78.3%), and (3) an intention to utilize NEPs in the future (47.6% vs. 88.5%). Eighteen percent of non-users had never heard of NEPs and were subsequently provided with NEP information during risk reduction counseling.<P>

<B>Conclusions: </B> In order to optimize the utility of NEPs in preventing HIV infection, health educators will need to foster positive community norms and perceptions of NEPs. Policy makers will need to address structural barriers that hinder the efficiency of NEPs in the community. Tailored interventions using the TRA framework may facilitate use of NEPs by changing inappropriate beliefs, perceived negative norms and structural barriers.<P>

[We.A.3009] EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH ON TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINAL HERBS-ZY-I RECIPE FOR AIDS TREATMENT<P>

Guan Chong Fen,* Wu Xiaoxian**, Lu Yaozeng**, Xu Shuling*. * China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine ** Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.<P>

<B>Objective: </B>Traditional Chinese medicine-ZY-1 Recipe revealed some effects in 104 AIDS patients treated in Tazania. Experimental study was made in animal model monkey, the antivitral, immunomodulatory and pathological effect of ZY-1 Recipe was observed.<P>

<B>Methods: </B>The ZY-1 Recipe was used for experimental treatment on model monkey infected with SIVmac and set up AZT and control group. We carried out the detection of indexes of virology (virus isolation, PCR, SIV and HIV inhibited tests), Immunology (antibody determination IFA, neutralization test; lymphocytic proliferation MTT; CD4, CD3, CD4/CD3 cell count: interferon and reverse transcriptase test) and pathology.<P>

<B>Results: </B> The experimental results showed that as compared to AZT and control group, the ZY-1 Recipe could not only reduce the viral titer 1-2 log of plasma and monocytes in peripheral blood and inhibit the activation of HIV reverse and transcriptase in vitro, but also increse CD4 cells, enhence the ratio of CD4/CD3, promote the proliferation of lymphocytes and induce the r interferon. Particularly in the pathological examination, we discovered that the ZY-1 Recipe could activate and proliferate cells in lymph follicles, geminal centre, paracortical zone and medullary cord of lymph nodes.<P>


<B>Conclusion: </B>The ZY-1 Recipe could inhibit SIV and HIV and increase the immunity of organism. The experimental result in ZY-1 Recipe group was superior to those in AZT and control group. At present, the result of toxicological indicated that te ZY-1 Recipe has no toxic and side effect. It is a safe and effective Chinese herbal medicine in treating AIDS.<P>

[Th.D.5116] HOLISTIC APPROACH WITH SPIRITUAL SUPPORT ENHANCE PEOPLE WITH HIV/AIDS


<B>Issue: </B>People with HIV/AIDS can have their quality of life enhanced with acupuncture therapy, Chinese herbal remedies and spiritual support.<P>

<B>Project: </B> An HIV/AIDS health support program targeting the specific use of acupuncture treatment, Chinese herbal remedies and holistic health consultation was initiated in Vancouver in August 1993. The program was an extension and modification in the use of Traditional Chinese Medicine for people with HIV/AIDS who had the experience of using such a therapy before. Strategies include one-to-one pulse diagnosis, tongue coating monitoring, individual health query and counselling, acupuncture treatment, (insertion of acupuncture needles and a brief energy massage) Chinese herbal remedies, and information giving specific diets and exercises, all in a group setting. Members were given discount fees due to their limitation of income.<P>

<B>Results: </B>The HIV/AIDS life-quality support program has been very well accepted by the participants and the different HIV/AIDS support groups in Vancouver. In addition to the complementary medicine treatment, the gathering of a routine group of 10 - 12 people at a time and the opportunity for an individual to express his concerns and expectations built up a strong spiritual and hopeful support within the group.<P>

<B>Lesson Learned: </B> A friendly and open treatment atmosphere is especially beneficial in encouraging a person to live on with hope.<P>

</CENTER> <HR>

[We.D.3834] HOLISTIC EARLY INTERVENTION IN N.Y. CITY: A LOW-COST MODEL FOR EMPOWERMENT<P>

<B>Issue: </B> How to reach individuals as soon as possible after an HIV + test with basic information on how they can care for their immune system and where they can access natural therapies and substances at low-cost.<P>

<B>Program: </B> Production of an intensively designed pamphlet (see attached) which combines an outline of what constitutes a truly holistic protocol and resource lists, which are updated periodically. Free workshops (as well as phone consults) are given based on the 4-pronged approach and extensive packets of fact sheets are made available. Referrals are made particularly to low-cost acupuncture clinics; the Whole Foods Project, which serves and teaches about organic vegan food and to DAAIR, a buyers' club for nutrients, herbs, etc, which gives a packet of scientifically-based literature to members and gives free talks and consults where they can learn how to monitor their blood work, among other things. In our talks, siting of studies on the benefits (and risks) of various natural therapies is presented in the simplest lay language possible, balanced with anecdotes of individuals who have successfully combined various approaches to staying healthy or managing minor conditions commonly associated with HIV (e.g. candida, skin itching).<P>

Ample time is given to answer specific concerns of the participants, whether they be affected individuals or counselors at A.S.O.s. The empowerment which is derived from activism to changed public policies regarding natural therapies, is emphasized. Ways people can get involved are presented.<P>

<B>Results: </B> Though this work goes on a very low-tech level with only minimal funding, the benefits individuals experience are profound. Repeatedly people say that this the first time they have realistic hope that they don't have to live with HIV as victims and they intend to busy themselves learning about HIV, their immune system, and making life changes such as diet, exercise, quitting smoking etc. Many report back months or years later how much better they feel or recount how they've passed through a medical crisis without succumbing.<P>

<B>Lessons learned: </B> Even without substantial public or private funds there is a crying need which can be met by enthusiastic, well-informed and committed grassroots activists to provide practical information. about low-toxicity, low-cost approaches. With ample resources much more could be learned about natural therapies and many more individuals could be reached and helped to live healthier and probably longer lives.<P>

[Mo.B.303] META-SURVEY OF PLANT AND HERB MATERIAL AS A TREATMENT FOR HIV<P>

Chang, Raymond Y*, Kong XB**. *Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA;**New York University, New York, NY USA<P>

<B>Objective: </B>To identify the current scope and nature of plant and herbal compounds and extracts potentially useful in anti-HIV treatment, and their state of research and development.<P>

<B>Methods:</B> A comprehensive search of the published literature since 1982 on all plant and herbal compounds or extracts screened for anti-HIV activity and applied to AIDS therapy, with particular attention to 1) chemical class of bioactive compounds identified,
2) ethnomedicine background, 3) mechanisms of anti-HIV actions, and 4) state of research of the compounds or extracts.<P>

<B>Results:</B> Tens of thousands of crude natural extracts have been screened for anti-HIV activity. Of plants and herbs screened, 70 compounds and 76 crude extracts from 123 species ranging from common food and drink (e.g. soy) to tropical rainforest specimens (e.g. Callophylum lanigerum) reportedly exhibited HIV inhibitory activity in vitro. Amongst the bioactive materials, there were 29 terpenes (15 diterpenes, 14 triterpenes), 29 flavonoids, 15 polysaccharides, 8 coumarins, 6 tannins, 4 lectins, 4 quinolones, 2 peptides, and 7 other alkaloids. Mechanisms of action elucidated included competitive and non-competitive reverse transcriptase inhibition, protease inhibition, and interference of infection at the viral cell entry level. Of bioactive species, 63 are found in the Chinese materia medica and at least another 8 are derived from other ethnomedicines. However, only a handful of such active extracts* and compounds (e.g. ganoderma*, momordica*, viscum ablbum*, curcumin, acemannan, glycyrrhizin, Lentinan, hypericin, GLQ233, PCK-4,) have been formally assessed in clinical studies of HIV patients, and most trials were observational and uncontrolled.<P>

<B>Conclusion:</B> Many compounds and extracts have been demonstrated to harbor HIV inhibitory activity and their elucidated mechanisms may provide valuable leads for further investigations. Only HIV inhibitory compounds or plant materials are reported here, although many more natural materials inhibit HIV and other plants or herbs may attenuate the course of HIV infection via immune enhancement, cytokine or other pathways, or act synergistically in herbal formulas and not as single species or pure componds. In all, plants and herbs offer excellent prospects in the search for potential treatment for HIV.<P>

Luo Shide, Fan Duoqing. Kunming Institute of Botany, Academia Sinica, Kunming 650204, China<P>

Of the approximately 5000 Chinese Herbs, over 700 species are frequently used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Since 1987, we have studied the Anti- HIV activities of the various solvent extracts of these herbs, and have found 90 of them (about 13 percents) showed some activities. Their names, IC50 and EC50 are shown in the following Table.<P>

(Sorry, Table I unavailable.)<P>

Our result suggests that the activities of most herbs are relatively week while the toxicities are strong, which hinder the direct clinical use of them in AIDS treatments. Usually isolation and purification are needed to gain pure active compounds so as to reduce the toxicities and enhance the activities. Many of our works have been done in this field and some results have applied Chinese Patent (CN 1107152A). on the other hand, according to the Monarch, Minister, Assiant and Guide principle of TCM theory, the side effects can be reduced through proper composition. Some complex prescription composed of these 90 herbs used in AIDS treatment are list in the following Table.<P>

[Th.B.4109] PROPOSED MODEL OF A TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE TREATMENT AND RESEARCH PROGRAM FOR HIV/AIDS<P>



<B>Issue: </B> Increasingly Americans are seeking alternative /complimentary forms of healthcare. This trend has been especially prevalent in the HIV/AIDS community. One of the most commonly used therapies is Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), yet to date few clinical trials have been conducted on the use of TCM in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. The high cost of conducting research often precludes such therapies from studies. We designed a treatment program that offered both treatment and an opportunity to collect data.<P>

<B>Project: </B> Persons with HIV infection were recruited into a 12 week program that utilized acupuncture as well as a standardized TCM formula. Patients were surveyed prior to TCM treatment and at conclusion of study. Two funding sources were developed, Federal Ryan White CARE Title 1 and an established fee schedule. Patients were given a questionnaire at weeks 1 and 12, surveying symptomatic areas, western medical diagnoses, weight, current pharmaceuticals and supplements, and quality of life.<P>

<B>Results: </B> Of 391 patients 286 completed the study. There was a total of 172 HIV+, 39 AIDS related complex, and 75 AIDS patients. Concurrent nucleoside use was noted in a subgroup of 135. According to Chi square tests and t-tests there were statistically significant decreases in the average number of symptoms in the groups between week 1 compared with week 12. Average weight gain was 1.5 pounds per person. Statistically significant improvements were found with infectious processes, gastrointestinal symptoms and psychological factors.<P>

<B>Lessons Learned: </B> We have developed a public healthcare model of TCM that has gained a wide acceptance in the local HIV/AIDS community. Patients pursuing TCM create an alliance with their practitioner working towards reducing their symptoms and maintaining health. Further studies are needed to investigate the role TCM plays in disease prevention and progression. TCM is beneficial for reducing the intensity and severity of infections as well as improving digestive function.<P>

[Th.D.5120] USE OF COMPLEMENTARY/ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES (C/A RX) BY HIV+ WOMEN (WM): THE WOMEN'S INTERAGENCY HIV STUDY (WIHS)<P>

Berrier, Jayne, Young M, Barkan S, Melnick S, Greenblatt R, Currier J, Weber K, Wilson T, FitzGerald G. for the WIHS Collaborative Study Group.<P>

<B>Objective: </B> To determine the use of C/A Rx among HIV+ and HIV- WM.<P>

<B>Method: </B>This is the initial analysis of data from 1285 (1049 HIV+ and 236 HIV-) WM enrolled as of 5/1/95 in WIHS, a multi-site, longitudinal study of the natural history of HIV in WM. The WM were categorized 3 ways: 'Users' answered Yes to at least one of 25 C/A Rx (e.g., herbals, spiritual practices, acupuncture, massage, etc.) within the previous 2 or 6 months; 'Transitionals', Yes only to at least one of: 'regular exercise', 'special diet', 'visited nutritionist', 'visited chiropractor'; all others are 'Non-Users'.<P>

<B>Results: </B>C/A Rx use was similar in HIV+ and HIV- WM; combined data are reported. 52% of the WM are C/A Rx Users, 26% Transitionals, and 22% Non-Users. Users are older than Non-Users (mean age, 36.5 vs. 35.7; p=.02) and have higher household incomes (mean $18,371 vs. $14,005; p<.001). More are born in USA (88% vs 81%; X2=6.89, p=.03) and are high school graduates (74% vs 53%; X2=47.05, p<.0001). 66% of Whites are Users, 51% of Blacks, and 41% of Hispanics (X2=42.51, p<.0001). The two most frequently reported C/A Rx were regular exercise and spiritual practices (including yoga, meditation, and prayer). 52% of all women and 59% of Users reported regular exercise, while 37% of all women and 73% of Users reported spiritual practices. The third most frequently reported C/A Rx was Chinese or other herbs, reported by 19% of all women and 38% of Users. 70% of Users reported not discussing this with their healthcare providers.<P>

<B>Conclusions:</B> More than half of WIHS WM reported C/A Rx use and 70% did not discuss this with their healthcare providers. Reports of C/A Rx by other HIV+ groups (mostly gay men) have ranged from 22% to 40%. Such a variety of self-help strategies used by persons with HIV, if not acknowledged, may confound clinical symptoms and research outcomes, thus affecting clinical care and quality of life.<P>

[Th.D.5119] USE OF "NON-TRADITIONAL" TREATMENTS BY PERSONS WITH HIV-INFECTION WHO ALSO RECEIVE "TRADITIONAL" CARE FROM PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS<P>

Lubeck, D., O'Driscoll PT*, Morfeld DH*, Williams CA*. Stanford University; **Technology Assessment Group, San Francisco, CA, USA.<P>

<B>Issue: </B> Previous studies have described the use of "non-traditional" treatments cross-sectionally in small samples of HIV-positive (HIV+) persons. This study describes the frequency of use of various "non-traditional" treatments reported over a five year period by a cohort of HIV+ participants in ATHOS (AIDS Time-Oriented Health Outcome Study) at Stanford University.<P>

<B>Methods: </B> HIV+ ATHOS participants, recruited through their physicians located in several California clinics and private practices, complete AIDS-Health Assessment Questionnaires wherein they report on the frequency and type of "non-traditional" treatments at three-month intervals. Mean follow up for the patients is 20.6 months and ranges from a minimum of three months to a maximum of 60 months.<P>

<B>Results: </B>From October 1989 through March 1995, 530 (36.1%) of the 1,467 HIV+ ATHOS participants ever reported using "non-traditional" treatments. Usage included: herbs, 43.8%; acupuncture, 40.8%; chiropractic, 40.2%; non-sanctioned drugs (e.g. NAC, DNCB, etc.), 19.1%; and other types of treatments (e.g. vitamins, bodywork, etc.), 38.7%. 41.7% used multiple types of treatments. Average months of use were: herbs, 8.3 (SE=0.54); acupuncture, 10.0 (SE=0.66); chiropractic, 8.3 (SE=0.65); non-sanctioned drugs, 7.7 (SE=0.67); and other treatments, 6.1 (SE=0.43). User (and ATHOS) demographics: 97.9% male; 86.0% White; 77.3% gay/bisexual; 51.9% have finished college; and mean age=40.2 years (SE=0.17).<P>

<B>Discussion: </B> Because "traditional" medicine offers no cure for HIV and many HIV+ persons learn of their antibody status years before the terminal stages of AIDS, there are strong incentives for patients to experiment with alternative treatments. The costs, effectiveness, toxicities, and outcomes associated with their use must be studied in all HIV+ populations.<P>

<H2>Acupuncture for Malignant Pain Problems.</H2>
J. Filshie, D. Redman (Dept. of Anesthetics, Royal Marsden Hospital, London,
England).  <i>International Medical Acupuncture Conference</i>, London,
England, May 4-8, 1986.<p>

	The effect of acupuncture was assessed in 183 patients attending the Pain
Clinic in a cancer hospital.  Early results were promising with 82% of patients
obtaining benefit for hours or days.  However, only 52% of patients obtained
significant help and multiple treatments were often necessary.  Acupuncture was
most helpful for vascular problems, muscle spasm and dyaesthetic problems.
Acupuncture was significantly helpful for a number of patients with malignant
pain problems.<p>

<H2>Electroacupuncture Treatment Method for Arm Oedema, Following Surgery for Breast Cancer.</H2>
C. Moldovan, et al. (Institute of Oncology, Bucharest, Romania).
<i>International Medical Acupuncture Conference</i>, London, England, May 4-8,
1986<p>

	Upper limb oedema (bloating from retention of water) occurs following surgery for breast cancer in approximately 8-30% of the cases.  Existing means have
relatively limited efficiency.  This study presents a treatment method with
electroacupuncture (acupuncture in which weak electrical currents are sent through the needles) on a group of 21 patients with upper limb oedema.  Treatment response was based on objective criteria including
clinical and thermoelectric measurements.  Complete recovery from oedemas was
obtained in 33% of the cases, while partial recovery was seen in 43% of the
cases.  No response was seen in 24%.<p>

<H2>Immunity Reflex State in Cancer patients Treated by Acupuncture</H2>
Xia Yuqin, et al.  <i>Chinese Acupuncture & Moxibustion</i>, Vol. 6, No. 2,
April 1986, pp. 17-19. (In Chinese)<p>

	Fifty-nine cases with cancer (diagnosed through tissue biopsy) were observed in this
group.  It was found that the potentiality of cell immunity was lower than in
normal persons.  Radiation treatment had certain inhibitory functions on body
immunity.  It was seen at the same time that acupuncture not only raised body
immunity and regulated ERFC close to the normal level, but it could also control
the falling of body immunity caused by radiation treatments.<p>

<H2>Curative Effects Seen in 44 Cases of Radioactive Rectitis After Treating
Cervical Cancer</H2>
Zhang Zhaohua. <i>Chinese  Acupuncture &amp; Moxibustion</i>, Vol. 6, No. 3,
June 1986, pp. 18-19. (In Chinese)<p>

	Forty-four cases of rectitis (inflammation, pain and bleeding of the rectum) caused by radiation therapy for cancer were
treated by acupuncture.  Results: 72.3% cases were cured, 9% cases were
markedly effective, and 18% cases were improved.  Through this patient group it
was also observed that acupuncture produces the effects of analgesia and
antipyresis, and the reduction of inflammation.<p>

Chinese herbs served to improve symptoms of chemotherapy and prolong life.
Characteristics include reduction of side effects caused by chemotherapeutic
drugs and radiation therapy (i.e., increases in leukocytes, erythrocytes and
thrombocytes), improvement of digestive functions (i.e. improvement of hepatic function) improvement of renal
function, reduction of pain, enhancement of immunofunctions, and especially,
decreased pain in the terminal stage.<p>

Treatment of advanced gastric cancer with combined chemotherapy and
anticancer herbs which "support the righteous Qi" (righteous Qi is often translated to Immune System in Western medicine) resulted in a 41.2% survival
rate at 3 years and 30.4% at 5 years.  The curative effect was significantly
higher than for those patients receiving only chemotherapy (26.1% and 15.0%,
respectively).  <p>

Abstract: </strong>The beneficial effects of transcutaneous electrical stimulation of 
the P6 antiemetic point (Neiguan) as an adjuvant to standard antiemetics 
was studied in over 100 patients in whom chemotherapy-induced sickness was 
not adequately controlled by antiemetics alone. <P>

Although the results were 
not quite as good as with invasive acupuncture, more than 75% patients 
achieved considerable benefit from what was a non-toxic procedure. The use 
of large diffuse low impedence electrodes simplifies the technique. The 2 
hourly application of Sea Bands prolongs the antiemetic action. Best 
results were obtained from the 2 hourly self-administration of 5 min of 
transcutaneous electrical stimulation of P6 using a simple battery-operated 
TENS machine (15 Hz) to activate a large, easy-to-place surface electrode 
and increasing current until Qi is elicited.

(Requested library location(s) not linked. Try F PE <journal title>.) <HR><strong>Abstract: </strong>The effects of acupuncture and moxibustion on 376 cases of 
chemotherapy-induced leukocytopenia was ohserved in patients with malignant 
tumors in the intermediary and advanced stages.<P>

 Findings revealed that the 
total effect in 121 cases (88.4%) occurred in the group treated with 
acupuncture and moxibustion with warming needle; while the total effect in 
221 cases (90.9%) was in the group treated with moxibustion with ignited 
moxa cone. A comparison made between the 2 groups showed no significant 
difference (P greater than 0.05). The total effective rate was 38.2% when 
compared with the control group using batylalcohol and pentoxyl and so the 
difference was significant (P less than 0.01).<P>

Analysis found that with 
patients having higher basic WBC value, the effect would be higher. 
Conversely, those who had lower basic value in their WBCs, the expected 
effect would be lower. <P>

These findings suggest that acupuncture and 
moxibustion in raising the effect on the white cells were influenced by the 
extent to which the bone marrow was inhibited, having no relevance to the 
kind of disease, the chemotherapy regime, and the treatment course which 
the patient was in.

<strong>
Abstract: </strong>This paper deals with the observation of acupuncture therapy 
affecting interleukin-2(IL-2 level and natural killer (NK) cell 
immunoactivity in the peripheral blood of patients with malignant tumors. 
In this clinical-laboratory test research, randomized double blind method 
was used. The patients were divided into an acupuncture treated group (n =
25) and a control group (n = 20). The former group was treated using 
points, ST36, LI11, RN6 and locations of symptomatic points bilterally. They 
received one treatment of 30 minutes daily for 10 days. <P>

The results showed 
that the IL-2 level and NK cell activity were lower than nonnal in patients 
with malignant tumor, but there was an increase in the acupuncture group 
after 10 days of treatment. Significance was found to be remarkable (P < 
0.01). The difference between the two groups was also significant (P < 
0.01). This increase might be related to the mechanism of acupuncture of 
adjusting the body's immune function. Thus, acupuncture therapy could 
enhance the cellular immune function of patients with malignant tumors and 
providing a beneficial effect in anti-cancer treatment. <P>

<strong>
Abstract: </strong>Effect of acupuncture on the T-lymphocyte and its subsets from the 
peripheral blood of patients with malignant neoplasm has been researched in 
this study. 51 patients were divided into two groups: one in acupuncture 
treatment and the other without any treatment. 48 healthy adults were also 
studied as normal control group. <P>

The results showed that the percentages of 
OKT3+, OKT4+, OKT8+ cells in the peripheral blood of the 51 patients were 
lower than those of the normal adults respectively. After the acupuncture 
treatment, the percentages of OKT3+, OKT4+, OKT8+ cells were obviously 
higher than those before acupuncture; the control group of patients showed 
no significant variation. This result revealed that acupuncture seemed to 
have more affect on OKT4+ cells than on OKT8+ cells. From our study we 
believe that acupuncture can be used as one of the many treatments for 
patients with cancer. <P>

Pub type: Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial. <BR>

(PE title: Journal of internal medicine.)<hr> 
<P><strong>Abstract:</strong> To overcome the methodological problems of blinding the patients and 
the acupuncturist in acupuncture trials, 33 patients with stable angina- 
pectoris, who were randomized to either genuine or sham acupuncture, 
received electroacupuncture by another acupuncturist, and the change in 
skin temperature was recorded. It was found that the change in skin 
temperature correlated significantly with the degree of improvement 
following both genuine and sham acupuncture. Fourteen patients with no 
decrease in skin temperature exhibited a significantly better response to 
acupuncture than 19 patients who showed a decrease in skin temperature (G 
II). In the former group, there was a 15% median improvement in exercise 
tolerance (G II 0%), a 678 improvement in anginal attack rate (G II 38), 
and an 84% improvement in nitroglycerine consumption (G Ir 50%). A 
significant correlation was found between the duration of disease and the 
effect of acupuncture. It is concluded that both genuine and sham 
acupuncture have a specific effect on some angina pectoris patients in 
addition to the effect of pharmacological therapy. <P>

<P><strong>
Abstract: </strong>Twenty-one patients with stable effort angina pectoris were 
randomized in a crossover study to 4 weeks traditional Chinese acupuncture 
or placebo tablet treatment. The patients had at least five anginal attacks 
per week in spite of intensive treatment. Acupuncture was given three times
per week at main points Neiguan (Pericardium 6), Tongli (Heart 5), Xinshu 
(Urinary Bladder 15), Pishu (Urinary Bladder 20) and Zusanli (Stomach 36). 
Previous antianginal treatment remained unchanged during the whole study. 
During the acupuncture period, the number of anginal attacks per week was 
reduced from 10.6 to 6.1 compared with placebo (p less than 0.01). 
Accordingly, the performance before onset of pain during exercise test 
increased from 82 W to 94 W (P less than 0.05). However, maximal 
performance did not increase after acupuncture. Intensity of pain at 
maximal workload decreased from 1.4 to 0.8 (scale 0-4, P less than 0.01). 
Further, ST-segment depressions at maximal comparable load decreased from 
1.03 to 0.71 mm after acupuncture (P less than 0.01). A life quality 
questionnaire confirmed improved feeling of well-being. Thus, acupuncture 
showed an additional beneficial effect in patients with severe, intensively 
treated angina pectoris. <P>

Abstract: </strong>Acupuncture (Acupoints: Neiguan P6, Shenmen H7, Shaohai H3 or 
auriculo-points: Heart, Shenmen) was administrated once or 7 times in a 
week on 40 patients with stable type of angina pectoris. The effect was 
assessed quantitatively or semi-quantitatively according to the extent, 
area, frequency, duration of attack, the time of attack during exercise, 
and the vanishing of suffering after exercise. Just after one performance 
of acupuncture, 15 patients' angina pectoris were significantly alleviated 
(P < 0.001) both in degree and area. After 7 times of acupuncture 10 
patients' angina pectoris were not only significantly alleviated both in 
extent and area, but also in frequency and duration of attack. 15 patients 
were randomized to an acupuncture, non-acupuncture or acupuncture at 
non-acupoints (ANA) in a single blind design. The time from the beginning 
of exercise to the anginal attack in active acupuncture group was longer 
than that in non-acupuncture or ANA group (P < 0.01), but they were similar 
(P > 0.05) in both non-acupuncture group and ANA group. The time from the 
end of exercise to the disappearance of angina pectoris in acupuncture 
group was shorter than that in the other two groups (P < 0.05). <P>

Abstract: </strong>The researchers made some improvement of the measure method of head 
total blood flow capacity. Excitations of propagated sensation were induced 
in 55 cases of cervical vertebra disease [acupoints: Shousanli (LI 10), 
Dazhu(UB 11), Shenzhu (Du 12), Houxi (SI 3)3, and 66 cases of cerebral 
ischemia disease caused by insufficiency of vertebra artery blood supply 
[acupoints: Hegu (LI 14), Quchi (LI 11), Jugu (LI 16), Tianliao (SJ 15)3 by 
acupuncture. <P>The result showed that obvious effect (p less than 0.05-0.01) 
was found in the group in which propagated sensation reached the affected 
area, some effect in the propagated sensation group, and little effect in 
the local sensation group. <P>The result indicated that the method of 
acupuncture excitation of propagated sensation could relieve vascular and 
muscle convulsion and ease the degree of vascular tension and obstruction. 
It could increase the blood flow capacity of cervical and vertebra artery 
significantly, so that it could play the role of promoting blood 
circulation to remove blood stasis and improving tissue nutrition and 
autonomic nerve function. <P>This study showed further that to let acupuncture 
excited propagated sensation reach the affected area was an important 
method of promoting clinical effect.

 Results showed that CO, CI, ANF, EDLS, ALD were 
decreased in test group (e < 0.05), which indicated that 
auriculo-acupuncture plus needle-embedding in Heart acupoint could improve 
the left cardiac function in patients with dilating cardiomyopathy 
complicated heart failure and that the function of acupoints is distinctly 
different from that of non-point.

Abstract: </strong>Discontinuation of chemotherapy substituted for a course of 
acupuncture and electroacupuncture in 124 patients with coronary heart 
disease, essential hypertension and neurocirculatory dystonia resulted in a 
positive response of cerebral and peripheral hemodynamics, myocardial 
contractility and diastolic function. Myocardial hypertrophy regressed, 
exercise tolerance enhanced. Reflex activation of stress-limiting systems 
arresting excess adrenergic action on circulation is probably responsible 
for these phenomena.

Pub type: Journal Article; Review; Review, Tutorial. <BR>
(Requested library location(s) not linked. Try F PE <journal title>.) <HR><strong>Abstract: </strong>Experimental studies in animals and clinical studies in humans have 
demonstrated that acupuncture can exert significant effects on the 
cardiovascular system and provide effective therapy for a variety of 
cardiovascular ailments.<P>

 In veterinary practice, acupuncture should be 
considered as adjunctive therapy in cases of shock and cardiac arrest. 
Acupuncture may also be beneficial as adjunctive or sole therapy in the 
management of congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, and systemic 
hypertension.

<strong>
Abstract: </strong>Course acupuncture with silver needles in auricular and corporal 
zones with additional effects of acupuncture zones in microneedle pressing 
produced a hypotensive action in 360 patients with initial essential 
hypertension. This effect registered in 82.1 of the patients exposed was 
not the only positive response as there was also a decline in hyperkinetic 
syndrome with a significant fall in energy consumption, reduction in 
circadian excretion of adrenaline, inhibition in the activity of plasma 
renin, normalization of lipid metabolism.<P>

 The hypotensive effect in the 
majority of the patients persisted for 12 months. Hyperactivity of plasma 
renin, hypokinetic and extremely hyperkinetic hemodynamic types set 
limitations for the method efficacy.

Effect of acupuncture-point stimulation on diastolic blood pressure in 
hypertensive subjects: a preliminary study.<BR> 
Physical Therapy, 1991 Jul, 71(7):523-9. <BR> 
(UI: 91271437) <BR>

(PE title: Physical therapy.) <HR><p>
<strong> 
Abstract:</strong> Electrical stimulation of four specific acupuncture points (Liver 3, 
Stomach 36, Large Intestine 11, and the Groove behind the ear for Lowering Blood Pressure) 
was examined in order to determine the effect of this stimulation on 
diastolic blood pressure in 10 subjects with diastolic hypertension. 


Subjects were randomly divided into two groups: (1) an Acu-ES group, which 
received electrical stimulation applied to the four antihypertensive 
acupuncture points, and (2) a Sham-ES group, which received electrical 
stimulation applied to non-acupuncture-point areas. 

<P>A repeated-measures 
analysis of variance revealed a significant, immediate poststimulation 
reduction of diastolic blood pressure for the Acu-Es group versus the 
Sham-ES group. <P>Further studies are needed to determine whether there are 
other acupuncture points, stimulation characteristics, or modalities that 
can enhance this treatment effect and whether the treatment effect can last 
for a clinically significant period of time. <P>

Abstract: </strong>32 cases of ischemic apoplexy were treated by acupuncture using the 
principle of replenishing Qi and promoting blood circulation. The clinical 
efficacy and the change of nail-fold microcirculation and hemorheology 
before and after the treatment were observed. <P>

Result: The total effective 
was 93.75%. Before the treatment, the microcirculation of nail-fold was 
markedly abnormal, and the criteria of hemorheology was abnormally 
elevated. But after the treatment, together with the recovery of nail-fold 
microcirculation and hemorheology, the clinical symptom and sign of the 
patients also improved. Thus it showed that acupuncture method had the 
function of changing the microcirculation and the hypercoagulability of the 
patients' blood, further promote the recovery of the function of affected cerebral tissue.

<strong>
Abstract: </strong>In order to understand the prophylactic-therapeutic effects of 
acupuncture and moxibustion in simple obesity complicated by cardiovascular 
diseases, we have observed in 102 cases the changes of pathogenetic and 
hazardous factors and the regulating function of vegetative nerves on 
cardiovascular activities. <P>

The results showed that the therapeutic effect 
of acupuncture and moxibustion was good with a total effective rate of 
88.24%. At the same time, acupuncture and moxibustion were found to have a 
benign conversion effect on the loin hip ratio (the pathogenetic factor), 
the arteriosclerotic index (the hazardous factor), and the vegetative nerve 
function of regulating the heart and blood vessels (the equilibrium indices 
of the vegetative nervous system). <P>

All this suggests that acupuncture is a 
treatment of choice for obesity and an important method of preventing and 
treating complicating cardiovascular diseases.

"The Chinese Medicinal Treatment of 21 Cases of (Female) Genital Sores" by Hong Jian-nan & Wang Ru, Zhong Yi Za Zhi (The Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine), #2, 1994, p. 98.<P>


According to the authors, the modern Western medical conditions of Bartholin's cyst, vulval abscesses, postpartum infection of an episiotomy wound, and other such bacterial infections are types of acute pyogenic, inflammatory conditions which TCM simply refers to as yin chuang, (female) genital sores. From 1986-1991, the authors treated 21 cases using Chinese medicinals which clear heat and quicken the blood with entirely satisfactory results.<P>


Of the 21 women treated, there were 15 cases of Bartholin's cysts, 4 cases of postpartum infection of episiotomy wounds, and 2 cases of vulval or external genital abscesses. The youngest patient was 20 years old and the oldest was 65. Two women were unmarried and 19 were married. The shortest course of disease was 4 days and the longest was more than 1 year. In most of the patients, on examination, there was either open wounds or obvious redness, swelling, heat, and pain in the local region. In those women with postpartum infections of episiotomy wounds, the largest lesion was 10cm x 4cm x 3cm and the smallest was 4cm x 2cm x 2cm.<P>


The formula used consisted of: Cortex Phellodendri (Huang Bai), 30g, Radix Sophorae Flavescentis (Ku Shen), 30g, Rhizoma Coptidis Chinensis (Huang Lian), 6g, Fructus Forsythiae Suspensae (Lian Qiao), 15g, Radix Rubrus Paeoniae Lactiflorae (Chi Shao), 30g, Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae (Dan Shen), 30g, and Lignum Sappanis (Su Mu), 30g. <P>


These Chinese medicinals were soaked in water for 30 minutes. Then more water was added in order to cover these medicinals to a depth of 3cm. They were next decocted down to 20ml. Each ji was decocted 3 times and the decocted fluid added together. This fluid was then allowed to cool to 35-37_C. Each evening before sleep, the patients took a sitz bath in this medicinal fluid. If there was an open wound, each day, after the doctors made their rounds (i.e., in the morning), the wound was rinsed with Coptis and Phellodendron water. Afterwards, Hong Fen Gao (Mercuric Oxide Paste) was applied to transform putrefaction and generate (new) flesh. Ten days equaled one course of treatment.<P>


All 21 cases were cured with this treatment and all their symptoms disappeared. Four cases were cured in one course of treatment, 15 cases in two courses of treatment, and two cases in two courses of treatment.<P>


Case history: Zhang X, female, 26 years old. The patient had had a postpartum infection of an episiotomy wound for nine days before being admitted to the hospital. The affected area was red, swollen, hot, and painful. The wound was approximately 4cm x 2cm x 2cm in size. It exuded a copious amount of pus. Treatment was given as described above. Three days later, the superficial skin was beginning to heal. Yu Hong Gao (Jade Red Paste) was applied to generate flesh and close the wound. Five days later, there was no further bacterial growth. After two courses of treatment, the disease was cured and the patient was discharged from the hospital.<P>

<A NAME = "2"></A><H3>Pediatric Eczema</H3>

"The Treatment of Pediatric Eczema with Shu Feng Qu Shi Tang (Course Wind, Eliminate Dampness Decoction)" by Zhan Nai-jun, Zhe Jiang Zhong Yi Za Zhi (Zhejiang Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine), #6, 1994, p. 262.<P>


The author of this article has used Shu Feng Qu Shi Tang in the treatment of 36 cases of pediatric eczema (shi zhen) with entirely good results. Of the 36 cases, 22 were boys and 14 were girls. The course of disease had lasted from as long as one month to as short as one week with an average duration of 10 days. Eleven cases also had cough and panting (i.e., asthma), diarrhea, and other such diseases.<P>


Shu Feng Qu Shi Tang consisted of: Caulis Lonicerae Japonicae (Ren Dong Teng), 9g, stir-fried Radix Scutellariae Baicalensis (Dan Qin), Periostracum Cicadae (Chan Yi), stir-fried Fructus Citri Seu Ponciri (Zhi Ke), and Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae (Chen Pi), 2g @, processed Bambyx Batryticatus (Jiang Can) and Cortex Radicis Dictamni (Bai Xian Pi), 6g @, stir-fried Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae (Bai Zhu), stir-fried Rhizoma Atractylodis (Cang Zhu), and Herba Agastachis Seu Pogostemmi (Huo Xiang), 5g @. If heat was heavy, Cortex Gardeniae Jasminodis (Zhi Zi Pi) and Rhizoma Imperatae Cylindricae (Bai Mao Gen) were added. If wind was severe, Radix Ledebouriellae Sesloidis (Fang Feng) and Folium Mori Albi (Sang Ye) were added. If dampness was severe, Semen Coicis Lachryma-jobi (Mi Ren) was added. And if the bowel movements were rough or coarse with foul smelling flatulence, carbonized Fructus Crataegi (Shan Zha Tan) was added.<P>


Of the 36 cases, 34 were completely cured after taking the above medicinals internally for one week. The other two patients were cured after taking it for half a month.<P>


Case history: Girl, 5.5 months old. Eczema had broke out half a month previously. Originally it had been on the head and face but had spread to the four limbs. Her spirit was vexed and her sleep was restless. When the lesions were scratched, a fatty water flowed. Her appetite was good, her stools were dry, there was smelly flatulence, yellowish urine, a white, slimy tongue coating, and her fingernails were pale purplish. In order to course wind and eliminate dampness aided by leveling the liver, she was given the basic formula minus Rhizoma Atractylodis (Cang Zhu) and Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae (Chen Pi) but with Flos Chrysanthemi Morifolii (Gan Ju), 6g, Fructus Tribuli Terrestris (Bai Ji Li), 9g, Folium Lophatheri Gracilis (Dan Zhu Ye), 5g, and Medulla Junci Effusi (Chen Deng Xin), 2 bundles. The child was given 3 ji. <P>


On the return examination after taking the above medicinals, the lesions on the head and face were still apparent but the itching sensation was markedly diminished. At night, her sleep was more restful, her appetite was good, and her stools were loosish one to two times per day. At this time, her tongue coating was thin and slimy. Therefore, Rhizoma Atractylodis, Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae, and Pericostracum Cicadae were removed from the basic formula and stir-fried Semen Coicis Lachryma-jobi (Mi Ren), stir-fried Fructus Germinatus Oryzae Sativae (Gu Ya), Sclerotium Poriae Cocos (Fu Ling), and stir-fried Semen Dolichos Lablabis (Bian Dou), 9g @, and Fructus Kochiae Scopariae (Di Fu Zi), 6g, were added in order to strengthen the fortifying of the spleen and transforming of the dampness. After 4 ji of the above formula, the eczema was cured. <P>


According to the author, this disease is known as milk tinea (nai xuan) in TCM. Usually it is due to fetal fire and damp heat. Internally, it is caused by damp heat internally smoldering, while externally it is due to wind evils externally invading. Thus wind and dampness become depressed in the flesh and exterior causing the onset of this disease. Because children's spleens are normally insufficient, it is not appropriate to use too many bitter, cold ingredients. Rather one should mainly use sweet, cold ones. In this formula, Caulis Lonicerae and a small amount of Scutellaria are the main medicinals for clearing wind, damp, and heat evils. Folium Mori and Periostracum Cicadae course the wind and clear heat. Bombyx Batryticatus and Dictamnus eliminate wind dampness and stop itching. Orange Peel and Agastaches aromatically and fragrantly arouse the stomach and eliminate dampness. While the two Atractylodes and Citrus Seu Poncirus transport the spleen, rectify the qi, and eliminate dampness at its root. When wind evils are coursed and damp heat eliminated, there are the results.<P>

<A NAME = "3"></A><H3>Baldness</H3>

"The Treatment of 30 Cases of Baldness with Shen Ying Yang Zhen Tang (Divinely Responding Nourishing the True Decoction)" by Chen Dan-feng, Hu Bei Zhong Yi Za Zhi (Hubei Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine), #1, 1994, p. 49.<P>


From 1982-1991, the author treated 30 cases of baldness with Shen Ying Yang Zhen Tang with good results. Of the 30 cases, 19 were men and 11 were women. Their ages ranged from 10 to 58 years old. The course of their disease had lasted from 20 days to half a year. The area of baldness ranged from as large as the whole head to as small as 2cm x 2.5cm.<P>


Shen Ying Yang Zhen Tang was composed of: Rhizoma Gastrodiae Elatae (Tian Ma), Radix Albus Paeoniae Lactiflorae (Bai Shao), Radix Angelicae Sinensis (Dang Gui), Semen Cuscutae (Tu Si Zi), Fructus Chaenomelis Lagenariae (Mu Gua), prepared Radix Rehmanniae (Shu Di), 10g @, Radix Ligustici Wallichii (Chuan Xiong), Radix Et Rhizoma Notopetrygii (Qiang Huo), 7g .<P>


If there was blood heat, prepared Rehmannia was changed to raw Radix Rehmanniae (Sheng Di) and Flos Chrysanthemi Morifolii (Ju Hua) was added. If there was blood vacuity, Radix Polygoni Multiflori (Shou Wu), 15g, was added and the amounts of Dang Gui and prepared Rehmannia were doubled. These were decocted in water and administered, 1 ji per day divided into two doses.<P>


Of the 30 cases, 25 were cured. This meant that the hair on their entire heads grew back in, long and full. Three cases experienced marked improvement. This meant that the falling out of new hair stopped, the hair that they had grew long, but that no new hair grew back in the areas that had balded. Two cases got no results. <P>

<A NAME = "4"></A><H3>Blepharitis (Sty)</H3>

"The Treatment of 36 Cases of Sty with Xian Fang Hou Ming Yin Jia Jian (Immortal Formula, Quicken Destiny Drink with Additions & Subtractions)" by Bo Yu-min, Hu Bei Zhong Yi Za Zhi (Hubei Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine), #3, 1994, p. 57.<P>


Xian Fang Huo Ming Yin is a formula used in the external medicine department for yong and ju which are red, swollen, and painful or, in other words, yang in nature. The author has used this formula with additions and subtractions for the past five years to treat blepharitis with completely good results. Among the 36 patients so treated, 20 were men and 16 were women. Their ages ranged from 9 to 58 years old. Fourteen cases presented with sties on their right upper eyelids, six on their right lower lids, 13 on their left upper lids, and three on their left lower lids. The course of their disease ranged from two to four days. All the sties were red, swollen, hot, and painful without the discharge of pus.<P>


The formula used consisted of: Flos Lonicerae Japonicae (Er Hua), 30g, Herba Cum Radice Taraxaci Mongolici (Pu Gong), Fructus Forsythiae Suspensae (Lian Qiao), 20g @, Radix Angelicae Sinensis (Dang Gui), Herba Violae Yedoensis (Di Ding), 15g @, Radix Ledebouriellae Sesloidis (Fang Feng), Rhizoma Coptidis Chinensis (Huang Lian), 10g @, processed Resina Myrrhae (Zhi Mo Yao), Radix Rubrus Paeoniae Lactiflorae (Chi Shao), Squama Manitis Pentadactylis (Chuan Shan Jia), Radix Et Rhizoma Rhei (Da Huang), 6g @. These dosages were reduced for children. One ji was administered per day, decocted in water and given in divided doses morning and evening. After being decocted twice, the herbs were wrapped in cloth and applied while still damp and hot to the affected eyelid for 15 minutes each time, two times per day.<P>


All 36 cases were cured using this treatment. Twelve were cured in two days, 17 were cured in three days, five were cured in four days, and two were cured in five days.<P>


According to the author, blepharitis is a commonly seen disease in the opthamology department. It is mostly due to overeating acrid, hot, thick-flavored foods. This causes smoldering heat in the spleen and stomach. If this become depressed for some time, it will transform into fire and attack the lids of the eyes above. It is also possible for externally invading wind evils settling in the eyelids. This results in loss of regularity between the constructive and defensive with qi and blood stagnation and stasis. The vessels and network vessels become obstructed and stagnant and the transformative heat may also give rise to this disease. <P>


In this formula, Lonicera, Forsythia, Dandelion, and Viola clear heat and resolve toxins. Coptis and Rhubarb clear heat and drain fire. Ledebouriella scatters wind and conducts the other medicinals to move upward. Dang Gui, Red Peony, and Myrrh transform stasis, disperse swelling, and tranquilize pain. Squama Manitis opens the channels, quickens the network vessels, and breaks hardness. While Licorice resolves toxins and harmonizes the other medicinals. Therefore, taken as a whole, this formula's functions are to clear heat and resolve toxins, quicken the blood and dispel wind.<P>

<strong>
Abstract: </strong>We treated 61 cases of psoriasis with acupuncture, including 25 
patients with complications of joint involvement and two cases with 
scleroderma additionally. All of the patients had failed to respond to 
their prior conventional western medical management. 25 patients were males 
and 36 were females. Their ages ranged from 22 to 84 years, with an average 
of about 52 years. There was no significant difference of the average ages 
between the sexes. Most of them (about 61%) had quite extensive involvement 
of the body. The average of duration of their illness was over 16 years, 
ranging from two to 65 years. <P>

They received an average of about nine 
sessions of acupuncture treatment, ranging from one to 15. Almost one third 
(19) of them had eleven to thirteen sessions. <P>

With the acupuncture 
treatment, about one-half (30) of the 61 patients had complete or almost 
complete clearance of the skin lesions. About a quarter (14 patients) of 
them had a clearance of about two thirds of the skin lesions. Eight of them 
had a clearance of one third of the skin lesions. Nine patients had minimal 
or no improvement. <P>

Our experience indicates that acupuncture is an 
effective therapeutic modality for psoriasis, particularly when the western 
medical management is unsuccessful. We speculated about the possible 
involvement of the cutaneous reticuloendothelial system in the clearance of 
the skin lesions. <P>

<strong> 
Abstract: </strong>The treatment of Herpes zoster by acupuncture is described. These 
were four patients with acute zoster and four with post-herpetic neuralgia. 
in a majority of the cases electro-acupuncture was found to be effective, 
and this treatment should be instigated as early as possible. Since the 
treatment of Herpes zoster by drugs is not routinely successful and can 
prove expensive, acupuncture, whose side effects are minimal, merits a 
trial. <P>

<strong>
Abstract: </strong>Herpes simplex is a common skin disorder. There is no effective cure. 
The recent introduction of drugs, such as acyclovir, is indeed a great 
advance in its therapeutics. However, these drugs may only modestly reduce 
the length of an attack, but do not lengthen the remission nor prevent 
recurrences. Our very limited experience in two cases of herpes 
oral-labialis and three cases of herpes genitalis with acupuncture 
treatment seemed to indicate the possibility of a marked reduction of an 
episode, a lengthening of the remission, and a prevention of recurrences. 
<P>

We hope our report would encourage our colleagues to try acupuncture in the 
clinical management of herpes cases and to study its immunologic effects.

Clinical uses of P6 acupuncture antiemesis. <BR>
Acupuncture and Electro-Therapeutics Research,  1990, 15(3-4):211-5. <BR>
(UI: 91188941) Pub type: Journal Article; Review; Review, Tutorial. <BR>
AT: UCLA siomed W1 AC999T <BR>
(PE title: Acupuncture & electro-therapeutics research.) <HR>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> Having seen pregnant women pressing the P6 point as a preventative 
for morning sickness, stimulation of this point for 5-10 minutes by 
invasive (manual or electrical acupuncture) or non-invasive (transcutaneous 
electrical stimulation or acupressure) means was studied as an antiemetic. 
<P>
In well controlled studies it was shown that acupuncture administered 
before the opioid premedication significantly reduced postoperative 
sickness for 6-8 hours. Non-invasive methods were effective for a shorter 
period of time, with nausea and/or vomiting often occurring after 2 hours. 
<P>To be effective the treatment has to be given before the opioid. rts effect 
can be abolished by local anesthesia. Stimulation of a dummy point near the 
elbow is ineffective. <P>

While acupressure reduces morning sickness, the 
pressure has to be applied for 5 minutes every 2 hours. There is probably a 
large psychological element in this. The most rewarding results are 
obtained when P6 stimulation is used in conjunction with standard 
antiemetics before cancer chemotherapy. Here again the invasive approach is 
more effective than non-invasive. Recent studies have involved 
self-stimulation using a portable battery-operated square wave stimulator 
fixed at 10 Hz, and a large EKG surface electrode on the P6 point. 
Stimulation is applied for 5 minutes every two hours. 

<P>While modern 
antiemetics can control vomiting, they are relatively ineffective against 
nausea, but this can be controlled by regular use of the stimulator. The 
results are most promising.

Abstract: </strong>It is well known that acupuncture is effective for treatmet of 
gastric disease in human. We have observed the effect of acupuncturing 
"Zhongwan" "Neiguan" "Zusanli" on fluorohistochemical changes of G cells of 
antral mucosa in 42 patients with gastric disease. The results show that 
after acupuncture treatment the amount of fluorescent 6 cells and the 
fluorescent intensity of gastrin in the G cells were obviously decreasd in 
patients with duodenal ulcer, as compared with that before acupuncture 
treatment. However, the amount of G cells was increased by acupuncture 
treatment in patients with chronic atrophic gastritis. These data idicate 
the acupuncture may regulate c cell from abnormal to normal condition in 
gastric mucosa of gastric disease. <P>

Abstract: </strong>Patients with peptic ulcer demonstrate diverse psychovegetative 
disorders that complicate the course of the somatic disease. Depending on 
the intensity of psychovegetative disorders the following syndromes were 
distinguished: astheno-neurotic, astheno-hypochondriac, astheno-depressive 
and psycho-vegetative with organic microsymptomatology. The use of laser 
puncture in multimodality therapy of peptic ulcer patients favours 
correction of vegetative disorders and normalization of regenerative 
processes occurring in the gastroduodenal system.

Abstract:</STRONG> At a comparison among 5 therapy methods the small psychotherapy with 
a success-rate of 74% is high-significantly more prosperous than the other 
examined methods. The acupuncture with 31% long-term success is 
significantly superior to the pseudoacupuncture (17.2%). The papaverine 
therapy results in a long-lasting status free of symptoms in 17.2% of the 
patients and is significantly different from the results of the 
papaverine-placebo-therapy (08). Distinct differences in the success-rates 
of the small psychotherapy with different therapists prove the role of the 
personality and the perfection in mastering the methods with 
psychotherapeutic procedures. Comparable differences between the examiners 
were not found among the effects of a spasmolytic therapy. <P>

<strong>
Abstract: </strong>The authors study on abdominal surgical patients (39 cases) who were 
randomly divided into the acupuncture and control group. In the acupuncture 
group, the needle inserted into Zusanli (St.36) and Sanyinjiao (Sp. 6) 
points at 12-24 h after operation and observed the time of the first 
excretion through anus. Sero-enzyme activity of GPT, GOT and gamma-GT 
determined before operation and at 1, 3, 5, 7 days after operation. <P>

The 
results showed that the time of excretion in the acupuncture group (57.78 
+/- 23.94 h) was obviously faster than the control one (86.14 +/- 20.43 h), 
P less than 0.001). It suggested that acupuncture has the effect of 
promoting intestinal motion.<P>

 After operation sero-enzyme activity was 
raised 2-3 times than before. It showed that the surgical trauma directly 
or indirectly impair cells to release enzyme into blood, but the time of 
reversing to normal level of sero-enzyme activity in the acupuncture group 
was obviously faster. There is possibility that acupuncture has the effect 
of regulating reactivity of organism on trauma and promoting the repair of 
damaged cell. <P>

Abstract: </strong>The incidence of postoperative illness was monitored for 6 hours in 
74 women premedicated with nalbuphine, 10 mg, and undergoing short 
gynecologic operations of similar duration under methohexitalnitrous 
oxide-oxygen anesthesia.<P>

 Each patient received P6 acupuncture for 5 minutes 
at the time of administration of premedication. In random order the site of 
the acupuncture had been previously infiltrated with normal saline solution 
in half of the patients and 1% lidocaine in the remaining patients. 
<P>

Postoperative emetic sequelae occurred significantly more often in those 
who received lidocaine compared with the group that received saline 
solution. <P>

This demonstrates the ability of a local anesthetic administered 
at the point of stimulation to block the antiemetic action of P6 
acupuncture in a manner similar to that shown by others for analgesia.

<strong>
Abstract: </strong>One hundred and ten patients, 23 males and 87 females, participated 
in a comparative study of the effect of acupuncture and occlusal splint 
therapy. All the patients exhibited signs and symptoms of craniomandibular 
disorders (CMD) and had had pain for more than six months. The participants 
were randomly assigned to three groups; acupuncture treatment, occlusal 
splint therapy or control. The patients were evaluated before and 
immediately after treatment/control time. Ten different subjective and/or 
clinical assessment variables were used in the evaluation of the treatment 
effects. <P>

Both acupuncture and occlusal splint therapy reduced the symptoms 
as compared with the control group in which the symptoms remained 
essentially unchanged. In this short-term study, acupuncture gave better 
subjective results (p < 0.001) than the occlusal splint therapy. <P>

</CENTER> <HR>

A psychophysical analysis of acupuncture analgesia was carried out in
     which low back pain patients made visual analogue scale (VAS) responses
     both to their chronic pain and to different levels of experimental heat
     pain (5 sec exposures to 43-51 degrees C) before and after
     electroacupuncture. VAS (sensory) responses to chronic pain, direct
     temperature matches to chronic pain, and VAS (sensory) responses to
     experimental pain were reduced in an internally consistent manner 1-2 h
     after treatment. The magnitude of this analgesic response was similar
     for dermatomes within the region of chronic pain and acupuncture needle
     placement (lower back) as well as for dermatomes remote from needle
     placement and chronic pain (forearm). Individual patients manifested
     either (1) a central-inhibitory pattern of analgesia wherein
     experimental and chronic pain in back regions and experimental pain in
     forearm regions were reduced, or (2) an origin-specific pattern wherein
     only the chronic low back pain was reduced. Patients tested several
     days after treatment all manifested the latter pattern of analgesia.
     VAS sensory and VAS affective analgesic responses to electroacupuncture
     treatment showed a delayed onset (1-24 h) to maximum effect and a
     duration of 10-14 days. Cumulative sensory and affective analgesic
     effects were observed at the end of 4 months of biweekly acupuncture
     treatments. The results of this analysis reveal the unique spatial and
     temporal properties of electroacupuncture analgesia and the extent to
     which it is mediated by at least two different mechanisms.

</CENTER> <HR>

A 5-year trial of acupuncture therapy in the Finnish NHS is surveyed.
     In total 348 patients attending Halikko Health Centre in SW Finland
     were treated with needle-stimulation for a wide variety of chronic pain
     syndromes. The mean number of acupuncture sessions was 5 in the primary
     series and 41% of patients received more than one series. An analysis
     of results showed significant relief of pain (more than 40% reduction
     on the visual analogue scale) in myofascial syndromes affecting the
     head, neck, shoulder and arm. Osteoarthrosis of major joints, and
     backache, responded less favourably. In total 65% of those patients who
     had taken analgesics before acupuncture therapy, either stopped totally
     or reduced their dose considerably. Those with headache could
     significantly more often reduce their drug intake than those with
     arthritis or osteoarthrosis. More results and discussion will be
     published in part II later in this Journal.

From the data presented it appears that acupuncture helped in more than
     50% of the patients by either completely or partially controlling pain
     from certain disorders. Patients helped by acupuncture received 8.55
     treatments on the average, while patients not helped by acupuncture
     only received 4.75 treatments. There is difference between the male and
     female patients as to the response to acupuncture. However, we noticed
     that the younger the patient and the shorter the duration of their of
     problems, the better the response. Patients who had not had surgery to
     treat the pain syndrome responded better than those who had had
     previous surgery. Patients with backache who had previously had
     laminectomy showed better response to acupuncture than patients who had
     had spinal fusion. It appears that good general health plays an
     important role in favorable response to acupuncture treatment.
     Acupuncture may be a valuable extension of a conventional pain clinic
     and an alternative in patients who are desperate to obtain relief from
     pain which they failed to obtain from other methods.<P>

<strong>
Abstract: </strong>The immediate analgesic effect of a single non-segmental acupuncture
stimulation treatment on chronic tennis elbow pain was studied with 
placebo-controlled single-blind trial completed by 48 patients. Before and 
after treatment, all patients were examined physically by an unbiased 
independent examiner. Eleven-point box scales were used [13] for pain 
measurement. Patients in the verum group were treated at non-segmental 
distal points (homolateral leg) for elbow pain following Chinese 
acupuncture rules, whereas patients in the placebo group were treated with 
placebo acupuncture avoiding penetration of the skin with an acupuncture 
needle. <P>

Overall reduction in the pain score was 55.8% (S = 2.95) in the 
verum group and 15% (S = 2.77) in the placebo group. After one treatment 19 
out of 24 patients in the verum group (79.2%) reported pain relief of at 
least 50% (placebo group: six patients out of 24). The average duration of 
analgesia after one treatment was 20.2 h in the verum group (S = 21.54) and 
1.4 h (S = 3.50) in the placebo group. The results are statistically 
significant (P < 0.01); they show that non-segmental verum acupuncture has 
an intrisic analgesic effect in the clinical treatment of tennis elbow 
pain which exceeds that of placebo acupuncture.

<strong>
Abstract: </strong>A controlled study of different modes of acupuncture stimulation was 
conducted on patients fulfilling clinical criteria for chronic low back 
pain of nociceptive origin. Forty patients were randomly entered into the 
study. Thirty had three trial treatments with manual stimulation of needles 
(MS), electrical low frequency stimulation at 2 Hz (LF), and high-frequency 
stimulation at 80 Hz (HF), and then continued treatment with the mode they 
felt most benefitted them. Ten patients were put on the waiting list for 
treatment but served as the untreated control group. The results were 
evaluated after 6 weeks and at 6 months for: activity related to pain; 
mobility; verbal descriptors of pain and the patient's subjective 
assessment of his condition. <P>

After 6 weeks, patients receiving treatment 
showed significant improvement (P < 0.05 to P < 0.001) on three of the four 
measures compared to the untreated controls. After 6 months a similar measure of significant improvement was seen in patients continuing with 
low-frequency (LF) acupuncture, but not in those groups continuing with 
manual stimulation (MS) or high-frequency (HF) acupuncture. The results 
suggest that 2 Hz electrical stimulation is the mode of choice when using acupuncture in the treatment of chronic nociceptive low back pain. <P>

Abstract: </strong>The effects of antidepressants amitriptyline and pyrazidol on the

The combined use of 
acupuncture with antidepressants was shown to enhance the effectiveness of 
the treatment, to increase on the average by 5-6 hours the duration of 
analgesia within 24 hours after each procedure, to reduce the duration of 
the treatment on the average by 4-5 days, that indicates the expediency of 
clinical use of the proposed combination. <P>

<strong>
Abstract: </strong><P>

PURPOSE: Acupuncture treatment of patients waiting for arthroplasty 
surgery.<P>

 METHODS: 29 patients with a total of 42 osteoarthritic knees were 
randomized to two groups. Group A was treated while Group B served as a 
no-treatment control group. After 9 weeks Group B was treated too. 
Analgesic consumption, pain and objective measurements were registered. All 
objective measures were done by investigators who were "blinded" as to 
Group A & B. In the second part of the study 17 patients (26 knees) 
continued with treatments once a month. Registration of analgesic 
consumption, pain and objective measurements continued. Total study period 
49 weeks. 

<P>RESULTS: Comparing Group A to B there was a significant reduction 
in pain, analgesic consumption and in most objective measures. In Group A + 
B combined there was an 80% subjective improvement, and a significantly 
increased knee range movement - an increase mainly in the worst knees. 
Results were significantly better in those who had not been ill for a long 
time. In the second part of the study, it was shown that it was possible to 
maintain the improvements. 

<P>CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture can ease the discomfort 
while waiting for an operation and perhaps even serve as an alternative to surgery. Seven patients have responded so well that at present they do not 
want an operation. (USD 9000 saved per operation).

Abstract:</strong> The present work is dedicated to the study of the acupuncture 
analgesia efficiency in ambulatory practice in treatment of chronic 
post-traumatic pain syndrome as well as the comparative characteristics of 
the acupuncture analgesia and electric analgesia in treatment of this 
pathology. <P>

There have been analyzed the results of treatment of the pain 
syndrome after the traumata of the lower limbs by the IRT method (106 
patients), compared the terms and the results of the treatment by the above 
mentioned methods as well as by the separate acupuncture analgesia and 
electro-analgesia methods. <P>

As a result, it should be noted that the IRT 
method is more effective in treatment of the chronic pain syndrome as 
compared with the common traditional methods. The electroanalgesia method, 
in turn, contributes to more rapid pain soothing and restoration of the 
vegetative and trophic functions than acupuncture.

<strong>
Abstract: </strong>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is referred to the category of Bi syndromes 
in traditional Chinese medicine. It is regarded as an autoimmune disease, 
but the pathogenic mechanism is still to be clarified. In order to observe 
the effects of the treatment of RA with acupuncture and moxibustion on 
IL-2, 41 patients were divided into warming needle and point injection 
groups at random, and 19 healthy subjects as control group. <P>

The results 
showed that the IL-2 levels in two RA groups before treatment were 
obviously lower than that in control group (P 0.05). After treatment the 
IL-2 level in control group was unchanged, but increased considerably in 
two RA groups (P 0.01). Generally, IL-2 is considered as a very important 
signal for regulating immune response. <P>

Our results have shown that the 
decrease of IL-2 in patients with RA should be one of main causes of 
internal environment disorder, acupuncture and moxibustion as a stress 
stimulation exerts an influence on the immunity system through 
neuroendocrine system to improve the IL-2 production.

Abstract: </strong>The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of traditional 
Chinese acupuncture in the treatment of scapulohumeral pain during the 
early stage following heart surgery, by puncture of points not related 
anatomically or metamerically with the scapulohumeral joint and without any 
needle stimulation. <P>

Reduction of pain and angular gain were almost 
immediate, durable, measurable and reproducible, which could be explained 
by possible effects of acupuncture on articular sympathetic 
mechanoreceptors, then suppressing reflex muscular contractions due to 
intraoperative postural constraints.

Abstract: </strong>Acupuncture is one of the oldest healing methods which is used in 
traditional medicine. In the modern medicine, we are witnessing a 
renaissance of this ancient treatment applied mainly in the management of 
chronic pain. A number of modern technological changes are being applied to 
replace, or modify, the classical needle treatment. <P>Among many modalities 
used today is the novel addition in Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve 
Stimulation (TENS) called CODETRON which delivers acupuncture-like 
stimulation in a random order. CODETRON was developed by a Canadian 
Scientist and had been evaluated in a clinical trial in a multidisciplinary 
pain clinic on patients who came for acupuncture therapy over a period of 
two years. <P>

Indications, effectiveness and experiences with this form of 
treatment are presented. In addition, results obtained from a six week 
double-blind randomized placebo controlled pilot trial of osteoarthritis of 
the hip/knee with CODETRON which was conducted later.<P>

 The results were

A 29-yr-old man with several years of back pain was referred for a bone
     scan. High-resolution regional spot images of the skeleton were
     obtained following intravenous injection of 20 mCi 99mTc-methylene
     diphosphonate. Posterior and lateral images of the skull showed focal
     increased uptake in several regions of the skull. Upon questioning, the
     patient stated that he had received acupuncture treatment for his back
     pain several times in the same regions as the increased uptake. The
     needle placement was confirmed by the patient's acupuncturist.
     Acupuncture can cause enhanced bone metabolism demonstrated by
     increased activity on bone scans.<P>

A course of 10 daily acupuncture treatments was given to 200 patients
     who suffered from chronic pain syndromes of at least one year duration
     and the result assessed at the end of the course of treatment and after
     an interval of at least 2 months. Treatments were individualized using
     needling of body loci distally and near the site of pain, and ear
     acupuncture. In 38 patients suffering from chronic headaches, including
     13 cases of migraine-type headache, 81% reported an improvement in
     their condition, but only one patient was pain free for the 2-month
     observation period. In 162 patients with other chronic pain problems,
     99 or 61% were improved or pain free at the end of treatment; in 69 of
     these a worthwhile degree of improvement persisted over the observation
     period of 2 months. Thirteen percent of all patients did not respond to
     acupuncture and in 26% the response was considered as transient only.
     Daily treatments are not more effective than weekly or biweekly
     treatments. Pain in the neck and shoulder region, in the knee and low
     back pain responded to acupuncture with prolonged improvement in over
     50% of the patients treated. Facial pain syndromes and pain in the
     region of the trunk were least responsive and only 3 of 11 patients
     with post-herpetic neuralgia reported still having less pain after 2
     months. Needling of effective loci and particularly ear needling often
     causes an instantaneous reduction or disappearance of pain; the speed
     of this response can only be explained by a mechanism within the
     nervous system. Based on our experience acupuncture represents a useful
     therapeutic modality in the management of pain.<P>

Fifty-four patients treated in a 3-week inpatient rehabilitation
     program were randomly assigned to and accepted treatment with
     electroacupuncture (n = 17), TENS (low intensity transcutaneous nerve
     stimulation, n = 18), and TENS dead-battery (placebo, n = 18). Outcome
     measures included estimates of pain (on a Visual Analogue Scale) and
     disability by both physician and patient, physical measures of trunk
     strength and spine range of motion, as well as the patient's
     perceptions of the relative contribution of the education, exercise
     training, and the electrical stimulation. Analyses of variance were
     utilized to determine effects of treatment (electroacupuncture, TENS,
     placebo) across time (admission, discharge, and return) for the outcome
     measures. There were no significant differences between treatment
     groups with respect to their overall rehabilitation. All 3 treatment
     groups ranked the contribution of the education as being greater than
     the electrical stimulation. However, the electroacupuncture group
     consistently demonstrated greater improvement on the outcome measures
     than the other treatment groups. For the visual analogue scale measure
     of average pain, there was a statistical trend at the return visit
     suggesting that the acupuncture group was experiencing less pain.

</CENTER> <HR>

Application of electroacupuncture (EAP) of the segmental points to
     patients with vertebrogenic algesic syndromes decreased amplitude of
     N150 and P240 waves recorded from vertex to painful electrocutaneous
     stimulation in the region innervated by an affected root. As distinct
     from EAP of segmental point auricular EAP not only decreased the
     amplitude of late components of evoked potentials (EP), but also
     increased it, direction of EP changes depending on the character of
     sensitivity disorders. It is suggested that effect of EAP-evoked EP
     changes in patients with hypalgesia is determined by two oppositively
     acting factors: by a decrease of nociceptive afferent impulsation
     intensity as a result of the antinociceptive system activation and by
     an increase of the afferent impulsation intensity due to recovery of
     function of central terminals in primary sensory neurons.<P>

Transcutaneous electrical stimulation and acupuncture: comparison of

Twelve patients suffering chronic low-back pain were treated with both
     acupuncture and transcutaneous electrical stimulation. The order of
     treatments was balanced, and changes in the intensity and quality of
     pain were measured with the McGill Pain Questionnaire. The results,
     based on a measure of overall pain intensity, show that pain relief
     greater than 33% was produced in 75% of the patients by acupuncture and
     in 66% by electrical stimulation. The mean duration of pain relief was
     40 h after acupuncture and 23 h after electrical stimulation. Although
     the mean scores are larger for acupuncture than for transcutaneous
     stimulation, statistical analyses of the data failed to reveal
     significant differences between the two treatments on any of the
     measures. Both methods, therefore, appear to be equally effective, and
     probably have the same underlying mechanism of action. Consideration of
     the advantages and disadvantages of the two methods suggests that that
     transcutaneous electrical stimulation is potentially the more
     practical, since it can be administered under supervision by
     paramedical personnel.

Musculoskeletal clinic in general practice: study of one year's
     referrals.

</CENTER> <HR>

BACKGROUND. A musculoskeletal clinic, staffed by a general practitioner
     trained in osteopathy, medical acupuncture and intralesional
     injections, was set up in an inner London general practice in 1987.
     AIM. A retrospective study was undertaken of one year's referrals to
     the clinic in 1989-90 to determine how general practitioners were using
     the clinic in terms of problems referred; consultation patterns of
     patients attending the clinic and 12 months after initially being seen;
     and how access to the clinic influenced referrals to relevant hospital
     departments. METHOD. Day sheets were studied which recorded information
     on demographic characteristics of patients referred to the clinic and
     their problems, diagnoses made, duration of symptoms, number and range
     of treatments given, and recurrence of problems. Use of secondary
     referral sources was also examined. RESULTS. During the study year 154
     of 3264 practice patients were referred to the musculoskeletal clinic,
     and attended a mean of 3.5 times each. Of all the attenders 64% were
     women and 52% were 30-54 years old. Eighty one patients (53%) presented
     with neck, back or sciatic pain. A specific traumatic, inflammatory or
     other pathological process could be ascribed to only 19% of patients.
     Regarding treatment, 88% of patients received osteopathic manual
     treatment or acupuncture, or a combination of these treatments and 4%
     received intralesional injections. Nine patients from the clinic (6%)
     were referred to an orthopaedic specialist during the year, two with
     acute back pain. Referrals to orthopaedic specialists by the practice
     as a whole were not significantly lower than the national average,
     although the practice made fewer referrals to physiotherapy and
     rheumatology departments than national figures would have predicted.
     Seventeen patients (11%) returned to the clinic with a recurrence of
     their main complaint within a year of their initial appointment; second
     courses of treatment were usually brief. CONCLUSION. The clinic
     encouraged a relatively low referral rate to musculoskeletal
     specialists outside the practice. However, a need was identified for
     better communication about the potential of the approaches used in
     order that referrals to secondary specialists, particularly orthopaedic
     specialists, could be further reduced.

Twenty patients with low back pain were selected for treatment with
     acupuncture. Four standard acupuncture loci and a standard regime were
     used. The results were analyzed after a follow-up of 12 months.
     Initially, 16 patients responded favorably to the treatment while 4 did
     not respond at all. The degree of cure was not uniform. Instead they
     varied from complete cure in 4 to varying degrees of alleviation of
     pain in the rest. Recurrence or acute exacerbation of symptoms occurred
     in 13 of the 20 patients. Acupuncture was given to 11 of these patients
     and the results of treatment similated the initial course of
     acupuncture.

The acupuncture treatment situation was beneficial to the majority of
     people with low back pain. This was shown by the use of short-term
     controls and long-term controls, although the latter were not intended
     in the study design. After acupuncture, there was a 51% pain reduction
     in the average pain score in the Immediate Treatment Group. The
     short-term controls, the Delayed Treatment Group, had no reduction
     whatsoever in their pain scores at the comparable followup period.
     Later, the Delayed Treatment Group bere also treated by acupuncturists,
     and reported 62% less pain. When these two treatment groups were
     compared at 40 weeks with long-term controls (Inadequate Treatment
     Group), the Inadequate Treatment Group still had the same pain scores,
     on the average, as when they enrolled in the study. Both treatment
     groups, on the average, had 30% lower pain scores. Furthermore, 58% of
     the treatment groups felt that they were definitely improved at 40
     weeks, while only 11% of the Inadequate Treatment Group felt definitely
     improved at 40 weeks.

In this series, the patients with disturbance of small articulations of
     the lumbar vertebrae were treated by puncturing the effective points
     and reduction by manual traction with satisfactory results, the cure
     rate being 39.3%, the markedly effective rate 28.6%, with a total
     effective rate 98.3%. This method is simple and easy to master, and
     highly effective. Therefore it is very acceptable to the patients. It
     is a very excellent therapeutic method for disturbance of small
     articulations of the lumbar vertebrae, sometimes complicated by acute
     lumbar sprain and chronic lumbar strain.

Recordings were made from neurons in subnucleus reticularis dorsalis of
     the rat. Two populations of neurons could be distinguished: those with
     total nociceptive convergence which were driven by activating A delta-
     and C-fibers from any part of the body and those with partial
     nociceptive convergence which were driven by activating A delta-fibers
     from any part of the body or C-fibers from some, mainly contralateral,
     regions. The effects on subnucleus reticularis dorsalis neurons of
     manual acupuncture, performed by a traditional Chinese acupuncturist at
     the "Renzhong", "Sousanli", "Changqiang", and "Zusanli" acupoints and
     at a non-acupoint next to "Zusanli", were studied. Acupuncture
     stimulation for 30 s at the acupoints or the non-acupoint strongly
     excited all the total nociceptive convergence neurons tested; these
     neurons responded with a discharge of rapid onset which was often
     followed by after-discharges lasting for approximately 30-60 s. The
     majority but not all of the partial nociceptive convergence neurons
     responded to 30 s of acupuncture stimulation at the acupoints or the
     non-acupoint. This was especially the case when the stimulus was
     applied to contralateral or midline parts of the body. The potency of
     acupuncture as a means of activating subnucleus reticularis dorsalis
     neurons varied significantly with the area of the body being stimulated
     such that: contralateral greater than midline greater than ipsilateral
     areas. The levels of induced activity were of similar magnitude to
     those evoked by noxious mechanical stimuli applied under identical
     experimental conditions. No differences were found between the
     capacities to activate subnucleus reticularis dorsalis neurons of the
     "Zusanli" point and the adjacent non-acupoint, no matter whether these
     were stimulated ipsi- or contralaterally; this suggests a lack of
     topographical specificity in the activation of these neurons. Since
     subnucleus reticularis dorsalis neurons are activated exclusively or
     preferentially by noxious inputs, it is concluded that the signals
     elicited by manual acupuncture travel through pathways responsible for
     the transmission of nociceptive information. Since acupuncture, a
     manoeuvre which is known to elicit widespread extrasegmental
     antinociceptive effects, activates subnucleus reticularis dorsalis
     neurons which, anatomically, send dense projections to the dorsal horn
     at all levels of the spinal cord, we would suggest that this structure
     may be involved not only in signalling pain but also in modulating pain
     by means of spino-reticulo-spinal feed-back mechanisms.

Acupuncture was offered to patients with lesions affecting the
     locomotor system. These patients had received conventional
     physiotherapy treatment with limited success. The lesions treated by
     acupuncture were hemiplegia, low back pain, frozen shoulder, dropped
     foot, Sciatica, and arthritis of the knee and hip. Response to
     acupuncture was excellent in the more acute conditions of low back pain
     and frozen shoulder, where six treatment sessions were required for
     complete recovery. The more chronic conditions required many more
     treatment sessions and the improvement recorded was significant, though
     not complete. It was concluded that acupuncture has a valuable role to
     play in a physiotherapy department.

The results in 971 outpatients who have been treated with acupuncture
     for different diseases are reported. The outcome of treatments and
     number of sessions are discussed in relation to the different diseases.
     Acupuncture treatment was regarded as successful when 1. the patients
     had no pain at all without medication and 2. there was a significant
     improvement (no long-term medication, only mild pain under unusual
     strain, minimal medication under such circumstances). We obtained
     positive results in cephalalgias , sinusitis, cervical spine syndrome,
     shoulder-arm syndrome, ischialgias , back pain, constipation, herpes
     zoster, allergic rhinitis and disturbances of peripheral blood flow.
     For the following ailments, in order to reduce the medication, we
     recommend acupuncture despite a high rate of recurrence: Trigeminal
     neuralgia, colitis ulcerosa, bronchial asthma and cancer pain. Results
     in the treatment of mental disturbances were unsatisfactory, and in
     cases of tinnitus results were negative.

Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and
     electroacupuncture are effective agents in the management of spine
     pain. Ultrasound and shortwave therapy are often used, but the
     demonstrated effectiveness of these physical agents in the treatment of
     spine pain is questionable. Pain relief is the major reason for the use
     of physical agents. As the pain is controlled, the patient is better
     able to carry out a home program, tolerate traction, or relax
     sufficiently to allow mobilization of the spine. Physical agents alone
     have no long-range value.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of brief, intense
     transcutaneous electrical stimulations at trigger points or acupuncture
     points on severe clinical pain. The McGill Pain Questionnaire was used
     to measure the change in pain quality and intensity produced by
     stimulation. The data indicate that the procedure provides a powerful
     method for the control of some forms of severe pathological pain. The
     average pain decrease during stimulation sessions was 75% for pain due
     to peripheral nerve injury, 66% for phantom limb pain, 62% for
     shoulder-arm pain, and 60% for low-back pain. The duration of relief
     frequently outlasted the period of stimulation by several hours,
     occasionally for days or weeks. Different patterns of the amount and
     duration of pain relief were observed. Daily stimulation carried out at
     home by the patient sometimes provided gradually increasing relief over
     periods of weeks or months. Control experiments, which included two
     forms of placebo stimulation, showed that brief, intense electrical
     stimulation is significantly more effective than placebo contributions.
     Possible neural mechanisms that underlie these patterns of pain relief
     by brief, intense stimulation are discussed.

A comparison was made between 50 patients treated with acupuncture and
     50 patients treated with transcutaneous electric stimulation. All
     patients suffered from chronic sacrolumbalgia or ischialgia of more
     than six months' duration. Two to 10 treatments were given at weekly
     sessions, the mean being 5 in both groups. Stimulation points were
     selected by the same principle in both groups: one point along the
     course of the nerve trunk affected, and one point at a dermatome
     proximal to the affected segment. The stimulation was given
     bilaterally. Needles were inserted as deep as the muscular layer and
     twirled at 5 min intervals. In the electric stimulation square-wave
     impulses of 1.0 msec duration and 50 Hz frequency were used. The
     electrodes were 0.9 cm in diameter. Each acupuncture and electric
     stimulation was of 20 min duration. Pain relief was complete or
     moderate in the acupuncture group in 58% of the cases, and in 46% in
     the electric stimulation group. After 2 months 30 patients in the
     acupuncture group and 23 patients in the electric stimulation group
     still reported satisfactory relief of pain. After 6 months 15 patients
     in the acupuncture group and 10 patients in the electric stimulation
     group still reported satisfactory relief of pain.

360 observations were made on 120 cases of soft tissue injury divided
     into groups. 1. Among the 100 patients in the acupuncture treatment
     group, 300 observations were made; among the 20 controls there were 60
     observations. The effective rate in the acupuncture treatment group was
     85.00%; in the control group it was 41.67%, a very significant
     difference (P less than 0.01). 2. Relationship between therapeutic
     course and effect. The effective rate for the first course was 74.00%;
     it was 90.50% when more than two courses were given, a very significant
     difference (P less than 0.01) indicating the marked effect of
     acupuncture treatment. 3. Based on the therapeutic theory of TCM
     syndrome differentiation and reinforcement method in the asthenia
     state, and reducing method in asthenia state, different manipulations
     were used for asthenia-heat and asthenia-cold types with good clinical
     results. There was no significant difference (P greater than 0.05)
     between the effective rate in these two types, pointing up the
     significance of the TCM syndrome differentiation theory in clinical
     acupuncture. 4. There was very significant difference (P less than
     0.01) in the degree of pressed pain on the patient's tender spot before
     and after acupuncture treatment, also (P less than 0.01 and P less than
     0.001 respectively) in the EMG amplitude on the affected side of the
     lumbar area before and after acupuncture treatment during light and
     heavy force in extension action of back muscles. Acupuncture treatment
     on soft tissue disease based on TCM syndrome differentiation theory is
     thus shown to be effective.

The efficacy of trigger-point injection therapy in treatment of
     low-back strain was evaluated in a prospective, randomized,
     double-blind study. The patient population consisted of 63 individuals
     with low-back strain. Patients with this diagnosis had nonradiating
     low-back pain, normal neurologic examination, absence of tension signs,
     and lumbosacral roentgenograms interpreted as being within normal
     limits. They were treated conservatively for 4 weeks before entering
     the study. Injection therapy was of four different types: lidocaine,
     lidocaine combined with a steroid, acupuncture, and vapocoolant spray
     with acupressure. Results indicated that therapy without injected
     medication (63% improvement rate) was at least as effective as therapy
     with drug injection (42% improvement rate), at a P value of 0.09.
     Trigger-point therapy seems to be a useful adjunct in treatment of
     low-back strain. The injected substance apparently is not the critical
     factor, since direct mechanical stimulus to the trigger-point seems to
     give symptomatic relief equal to that of treatment with various types
     of injected medication.

</CENTER> <HR>

 The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of electrostimulation of auricular accumpuncture points in the treatment of confirmed post-polio syndrome patients.  Short and Long term responses in 12 study subjects were measured.  Good or excellent results were obtained in all patients; 66.7% reported a return to their pre-existing levels of health.  Our experience has shown that this modality can be effective as a permanent, relatively simple and inexpensive form of therapy for this condition.  To our knowledge, this is the first effective therapy available for the over 75,000 post-polio syndrome patients in the United States alone.<P>

<strong>
Abstract:</strong> In search of an anesthetic technique which would inhibit response to 
surgery stress, we tried to obtain a new method by a combination of a 
commonly used neuroleptanalgesia (NLA) and a traditional Chinese 
acupuncture, in which by increasing the level of endogenic opioid peptides 
we would decrease the need for exogenic opiates and thus influence the body 
response to surgery. The effect of this combined use of NLA and acupuncture 
was evaluated on the hyperglykemia, cortisol and aldosterone response 
during pre, intra and postoperative period, fentanyl and dehydrobenzperidol 
(DHBP) requirements, and its postoperative analgetic and antiemetic 
efficacy.  The patient population comprised 40 metabolically healthy 
patients randomly divided into experimental and control group. <P>

Using the 
analysis with t-test we have demonstrated that acupuncture, as and adjuvant 
to NLA, significantly suppresses the hyperglykemia and cortisol response to 
surgery stress, while it does not influence the aldosterone mechanism and, 
it significantly reduces fentanyl and DHBP requirements. With chi 2-test we 
have shown a significant decrease in postoperative vomiting and pain, and 
as a result of this, a reduction of analgesic requirements. In summary, a 
combination of neuroleptanalgesia and acupuncture can be recommended as a 
technique which significantly supresses the response to surgery stress 
(intraoperative hyperglykemia and hypercortisolism) and can be easily 
applied in the majority of surgical procedures.

<strong>
Abstract: </strong>The analgesic effects of acupuncture are well-documented. Aqueous 
acupuncture, or point injection, is a conveniently modified modern 
acupuncture method. This matched controlled trial was carried out to 
evaluate the effects of aqueous acupuncture in postoperative pain control. 
A total of 12 patients were selected as age-, sex- and 
operative-style-matched controls. In treating group, 2 to 5 ml of 20% 
glucose solution was injected into Ho-Ku (LI 4) and Yang-Ling-Chuan (GB 34) 
when patients had regained conciousness from operation anesthesia. The pain 
intensity were recorded as score system included verbal, sleep disturbance 
and use of narcotics. 
<P>
In comparisons with the control group, the intensity 
of postoperative pain, and the amounts and frequency of narcotics used were 
significantly lower in the study group, especially for the first 12 
postoperative hours. Aqueous acupuncture is a convenient and effective 
procedure in postoperative pain control.

<strong>
Abstract: </strong>Acupuncture has played an important part in pain research. Bischko 
was the first in the Western hemisphere to undertake surgery using 
acupuncture analgesia. This tonsillectomy was performed in 1972. Decisive 
research work has been carried out at the Ludwig Boltzmann Acupuncture 
Institute in Vienna. <P>

We now have far more knowledge about the importance of 
the basic system. Furthermore, we know that the theories on chaos research, 
and, especially the fractals play an important role. Various ways of 
treating pain by means of acupuncture will be discussed: e.g. body 
acupuncture (with or without supportive transcutaneous electrical nerve 
stimulation); treatment via the so-called somatotopies (ear, oral mucous 
membrane, scalp acupuncture according to Yamamoto etc.). The Ludwig 
Boltzmann Acupuncture Institute, in close collaboration with the II. Dept. of Internal Medicine at the Kaiserin-Elisabeth Hospital, Vienna, has been able to demonstrate on inpatients with a variety of conditions, that acupuncture could significantly reduce the quantity of analgesics required. <P>

<strong>
Abstract: </strong>Infantile cerebral palsy is a nonprogressive central motor 
disturbance of varied etiology. The spasmodic type is its main form, 
accounting for 50-60% of the infants afflicted with the disease. The causal 
factors include multifarious conditions arising during parturition and in 
the pre- and postnatal periods. As yet there is no specific treatment for 
the disease. <P>

We have used a method of applying prompt pressure to peculiar 
points in treating it and received satisfactory results. The present group 
comprised 318 patients treated for the disease by the method of prompt 
pressure applied to peculiar points combined with appropriate orthopedic 
manipulations, resulting in a 73.27% rate of good to excellent therapeutic 
effect. Follow-up exam was done in 52 cases, among which the efficacy was 
assessed as stable in 21 cases, and the remaining 31 cases as being in an 
improved condition.<P>

 Infantile peculiar points are points peculiar to 
infants, mostly located in the head and extremities, and constitute an 
important component part of the treasure-house of traditional Chinese 
medicine. The method recommended here is simple and convenient, causing 
little pain in the invalid yet showing a marked therapeutic effect, and 
therefore can be regarded as a new way for treating infantile cerebral 
palsy.

<strong>
Abstract: </strong>Sixty-Three cases with facial paralysis were treated mainly by 
acupuncture combining with point injection. The main points selected were ; Yangbai (GB14), Wai Jingming (BL1), Sibai (ST2), Yingxiang (LI20), Dicang 
(ST4), Jiache (ST6), Quanliao (ST18) and Qianzheng. The points were used 
alternatively. Auxiliary points: for type of deficiency of both qi and 
blood, Zusanli (ST36), and Sanyinjiao (SJ6) were added: for type of 
disharmony between Ying and Wei, Fengchi (GB20) and Hegu (LT4) were added; 
for type of stagnancy of qi and blood, Weiguan (TES) and Taichong (LR3) 
were added; for type of wind-heat stagnating collaterals, Yifeng (TH17) and 
Yanglingquan (GB34) were added. 

<P>
10 out of 60 cases, which showed no 
remarkable effectiveness after two courses, injection of vitamin B1 and 
vitamin B12 to facial points combined with Hegu (LI4) point on opposite 
side was performed. Therapeutic results: 31 cases (49.2%) were cured, 15 
cases (23.8%) markedly effective, 16 cases (25.4%) effective and 1 case 
(1.68) ineffective.

<strong>
Abstract: </strong>With the acupuncture treatment skill of pause and regress in six 
parts, we have treated facial paralysis of 260 cases. The other 50 cases 
were treated with the uniform reinforcing-reducing method as control. The 
result shows that the effectiveness of the former is better than the latter 
(P < 0.01).<P>

 The acupuncture treatment skill of pause and regress in six 
parts is a new way developed from the reducing method of the traditional 
reinforcing-reducing method of lifting and thrusting the needle and 
nine-six reinforcing-reducing method. In addition, the acupuncture points 
were chosen in the area of the main distribution of the facial nerves. 
Through the clinical practice, the acupuncture treatment skill is an
effective way for treating old facial paralysis.

and the third group served as controls. <P>

Both acupuncture and occlusal 
splint therapy significantly reduced subjective symptoms and clinical signs 
from the stomatognathic system. No differences between these two groups 
were found with regard to treatment effects. It is concluded that 
acupuncture is an alternative method to conventional stomatognathic 
treatment for individuals with craniomandibular disorders of muscular 
origin.

Clinical observations on acupuncture treatment of peripheral facial 
paralysis aided by infra-red thermography--a preliminary report.

<strong>
Abstract: </strong>We have carried out clinical observations on 34 patients with 
peripheral facial paralysis treated by acupuncture therapy prescribed according to selection of treatment regimen on the basis of facial 
thermogram and temperature. A comparison was made with a control group of 97 patients who received conventional acupuncture therapy only. It was 
found that <P>

1) The cure rate in the group of selecting acupoints by 
thermogram (hereinafter referred to as the thermography--aided treatment 
group) was 67.65%, with a marked improvement rate of 26.40%; while the cure 
rate of the conventional acupuncture treatment group (hereinafter called 
the conventional treatment group) was 46.39%, the marked improvement rate 
being 29.90%, indicating a significant difference in therapeutic efficacy 
between the two groups (P less than 0.02). <P>

2)

The average duration of 
acupuncture therapy for the thermography aided treatment group was 6.02 
weeks, whereas that for the conventional treatment group, 24 weeks. There 
was also a significant difference between the two groups (p less than 
0.01). <P>

And 3) During the entire therapeutic course, 25.2 sessions of 
treatment were given on the average in the thermography--aided treatment 
group, and 78.8 sessions in the conventional treatment group, showing a 
very significant difference (P less than 0.001). The present 
thermography--aided method exhibits advantages over the conventional one in 
enhancing the cure rate and shortening the duration of treatment, which is 
worthy to be popularized in clinical practice. And it is also of certain 
significance in standardization and scientification of acupuncture therapy. <P>

<strong>
Abstract: </strong>This report evaluates the effect of meridian acupuncture treatment on 
trigeminal neuralgia. Ten patients aged 26 to 67 years (mean 55.4 years) 
who visited the outpatient Dental Anesthesiology Clinic at Tsurumi 
University Dental Hospital from 1985 to 1990 were studied. Five of the 
patients suffered from idiopathic and five from symptomatic trigeminal 
neuralgia. The patients underwent meridian treatment by acupuncture alone 
or acupuncture combined with moxibustion. The acupuncture method used was 
primarily basic treatment employing only needles without electrical 
stimulation. Meridian acupuncture treatments were repeated from two to four 
times a month. <P>

Five patients were restored to a pain-free state. The other 
five patients noted a decrease in pain, but with some level of pain 
remaining (significant pain in one patient). It is concluded that meridian 
acupuncture treatment is useful and can be one therapeutic approach in the 
management of trigeminal neuralgia. <P>

<strong>
Abstract: </strong>Headache is a common symptom of complicated etiology; treatment is 
often ineffective when the intrinsic cause of the manifestation is not 
identified. The author found that tonic headache was very common in 
Germany, where few patients were helped in spite of various modalities of 
treatment. Since acupuncture proved useful to many cases it is the author's 
wish to add this ancient practice to the armory of the medical profession.

In retrospective analysis of the clinical data, we 
found some inter-linking relationships. In general, early treatment (first 
3 weeks) with acupuncture produces better result (improvement in 90.9 of 
the patients treated) than the treatment initiated three weeks after stroke 
(improvement in 71.4 of the patients treated). <P>

<strong>
Abstract:</strong> During the period from March to September 1989, 40 children suffering 
from primary nocturnal enuresis, aged between 5 and 14 years, were included 
in a study to assess the comparative therapeutical efficacy of DDAVP and 
acupuncture. Children were divided into four groups of 10: group A was 
treated with DDAVP, group B was treated with acupuncture, group C was 
treated with DDAVP and acupuncture and group D was treated with placebo 
(control). The trial design included 3 periods: observation (2 weeks), 
treatment (8 weeks) and follow-up (4 weeks). Nineteen children completed 
the study. The efficacy of treatment, which was expressed as a percentage 
of dry nights, was high in both the DDAVP and acupuncture groups, when used 
separately.<P>

 The combined treatment of DDAVP and acupuncture appeared to be 
the most efficacious both in terms of the percentage of dry nights at the 
end of treatment and in relation to the stability of results, even after 
the end of the study. The paper gives a detailed analysis of correlations 
between type of treatment and urinary osmolarity.

Abstract: </strong>The etiology of enuresis is not completely explained. It is assumed

urological predispositions combined with unfavorable environmental factors. <P>

Thirty-seven patients of both sexes (mean age 8 years) were included in the 
acupuncture treatment. They had not shown any improvement after 
psychotherapy. During the observation period of 6 months (180 days) after 
the acupuncture treatment, the statistical decrease of enuresis was evident 
(2.9), thus confirming that acupuncture represents a new possibility of 
treatment of patients with enuresis. <P>

<strong>
Abstract: </strong>Fifty-six patients with continuous and severe tinnitus as their major 
complaint were treated with traditional Chinese acupuncture. After a 
pre-treatment period with baseline evaluation of tinnitus, 10 treatments 
were given during a period of 20 days, followed by a post-treatment period 
in order to obtain indications of prolonged treatment effects. Assessments 
were made using visual analogue scales (VAS) and a verbal retrospective 
rating scale.<P>

 Three patients reported improvement which lasted for at least 
10 days after the last treatment, indicating a possible long-term effect in 
some cases. Twenty-one percent of the patients reported transient intensity 
reductions lasting for hours/days. Estimated 'substantial' improvement rate 
by VAS, consistent for all three parameters involved (intensity, annoyance,

Statistical analysis of the whole group did not show any significant

Effects of auricular acupuncture-like transcutaneous electric nerve 
stimulation on pain levels following wound care in patients with burns: a 
pilot study. <BR>
Journal of Burn Care and Rehabilitation, 1990 Jul-Aug, 11(4):322-9. <BR>
(UI: 90383219) <BR>
Pub type: Journal Article; Review; Review, Tutorial. <BR>
AT: UCLA Biomed W1 J05489 <BR>
(PE title: The Journal of burn care & rehabilitation.) <HR><strong>
Abstract: </strong>This study was designed to test the hypothesis that auricular 
acupuncture-like transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation would 
significantly reduce the pain experienced by patients with burns 
immediately after wound debridement, other wound care, and dressing 
changes. <P>

Subjects were 11 inpatients at the University of Alabama Hospital 
Burn Unit. A two-period crossover design was used, and each patient 
received one experimental treatment consisting of bilateral 
acupuncture-like transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation to six ear 
points and one control treatment consisting of a placebo pill. The Visual 
Analogue Scale was used as a measure of pain and was completed immediately 
before and after treatments and at 15, 30, and 60 minutes after treatment. <P>

A two-factor repeated measures ANOVA indicated significant effects of 
measurement time (p less than 0.001) and treatment by time (p = 0.002). 
Post hoc analysis revealed significant differences (p less than 0.05) 
between experimental and control conditions at all times after treatment 
but not at pretreatment baseline. These results indicate that auricular 
acupuncture-like transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation may be an 
effective pain management technique in patients with burns.

<strong>
Abstract:</strong> Successful sexual functioning is a complex process involving psychological and social responses as well as neurological, biochemical and vascular processes. Today it is believed that more than 50 of the sexual 
dysfunction cases have an organic etiology. Reflecting the controversy over 
the management of psychogenic impotence, there are several different 
methods which are currently in clinical use. <P>

In this prospective study we 
aimed to evaluate the curative effects of acupuncture therapy in men with 
purely psychogenic impotence. Of the 29 patients treated with this 
procedure 20 patients demonstrated successful erections following a varying 
number of acupuncture sessions. In the light of our findings we may 
conclude that acupuncture may be an effective alternative in the management 
of purely psychogenic impotence. <P>

<strong> 
Abstract: </strong>60 schizophrenia patients were treated with electro-acupuncture and 
chlorpromazine therapy in comparison with chlorpromazine therapy alone, 30 
patients for each group, and their curative effects evaluated according to 
the brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS). <P>

The result showed the total 
curative effects of the two groups were similar. However, the marked 
effects appeared earlier in combined therapy than that of using 
chlorpromazine alone, less chlorpromazine was needed, hence displayed fewer 
side-effects.

Auricular acupuncture in the treatment of female infertility. 
Gynecological Endocrinology, 1992 Sep, 6(3):171-81. <BR>
(UI: 93071204) <BR>
(Requested library location(s) not linked. Try F PE <journal title>.) <HR><P>
<strong>
Abstract: </strong>Following a complete gynecologic--endocrinologic workup, 45 infertile 
women suffering from oligoamenorrhea (n = 27) or luteal insufficiency (n = 
18) were treated with auricular acupuncture. Results were compared to those 
of 45 women who received hormone treatment. Both groups were matched for 
age, duration of infertility, body mass index, previous pregnancies, 
menstrual cycle and tubal patency. <P>

Women treated with acupuncture had 22 
pregnancies, 11 after acupuncture, four spontaneously, and seven after 
appropriate medication. Women treated with hormones had 20 pregnancies, 
five spontaneously, and 15 in response to therapy. Four women of each group 
had abortions. Endometriosis (normal menstrual cycles) was seen in 35% 
(38) of the women of each group who failed to respond to therapy with 
pregnancy. Only 4 of the women who responded to acupuncture or hormone 
treatment with a pregnancy had endometriosis, and 7% had normal cycles. In 
addition, women who continued to be infertile after hormone therapy had 
higher body mass indices and testosterone values than the therapy 
responders from this group. 

<P>Women who became pregnant after acupuncture 
suffered more often from menstrual abnormalities and luteal insufficiency 
with lower estrogen, thyrotropin (TSH) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate 
(DHEAS) concentrations than the women who achieved pregnancy after hormone 
treatment. Although the pregnancy rate was similar for both groups, 
eumenorrheic women treated with acupuncture had adnexitis, endometriosis, 
out-of-phase endometria and reduced postcoital tests more often than those 
receiving hormones. 

<P>Twelve of the 27 women (44%) with menstrual 
irregularities remained infertile after therapy with acupuncture compared 
to 15 of the 27 (56%) controls treated with hormones, even though hormone 
disorders were more pronounced in the acupuncture group. Side-effects were 
observed only during hormone treatment. Various disorders of the autonomic 
nervous system normalized during acupuncture. Based on our data, auricular 
acupuncture seems to offer a valuable alternative therapy for female 
infertility due to hormone disorders. <P>

Abstract: Hysteromyoma is a very common disease among women and there is no 
specific therapy except for surgical operation. we have taken acupuncture 
to treat it and at the same time we used Chinese and western medicine 
treatments as a control. As a result, we find that acupuncture treatment is 
better than medicine treatment. The total effective rate is 98% and cure 
rate is 73%.

[Acupuncture against climacteric disorders? Lower number of symptoms 
after menopause]. <BR>
Lakartidningen, 1994 Jun 8, 91(23):2318-22. <BR>
Language: Swedish. <BR>
(uI: 94335364) <BR>
Pub type: Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial. <HR><P>
<strong>
Abstract: </strong>Vasomotor symptoms are very common among perimenopausal women, but 
also among orchidectomized men. The cause of the symptoms is not the low 
steroid concentrations per se, but probably changes in central neuropeptide 
activity. <P>

Twenty-four healthy women with natural menopause, suffering from 
hot flushes, were included in the study and radomly assigned to either of 
two groups, one group received treatment with electrostimulated acupuncture 
(EA), the other with superficial needle position (SNP) acupuncture. 
Treatment was given for a total of eight weeks, twice a week during the 
first two weeks, and then once a week for the remaining six weeks. 

<P>As 
recorded in logbooks kept by the participants, the frequency of flashes 
decreased significantly by more than 50 per cent in both groups, and 
remained decreased in the EA group, whereas in the SNP group it increased 
slightly again over the three months after treatment. Values for the 
Kupperman Index decreased in both groups during treatment, changes ctill 
evident at three-month follow-up, whereas the self-rated general 
climacteric symptoms (vAS) decreased significantly in te EA group oly. 
The PGWB (Psychological General Well-Being) index did not change 
significantly in either group during treatment.

An article in the American Medical Association Newspaper 3/6/95 from the Associated Press reported that the FDA is weighing acupuncture's effectiveness in the treatment of asthma.  Kim Jobst, M.D. of Oxford University wrote in an article for the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine that the use of Acupuncture as an aid in respiratory ailments might be safer than the prolonged use of drugs.  The article reports that at the request of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Jobst collected all the research on chronic lung diseases treated by acupuncture.  From 16 studies, many of which were flawed, he says that acupuncture showed signs of being effective in 62% of cases.  This means fewer attacks and fewer doses of drugs.<P>

Acupuncture was used in a control against "Sham" acupuncture which means needling points which are not classical acupuncture points.  There is disagreement if this is really non-effectual.  When Dr. Jobst re-evaluated the "Sham" treatment he says 80% of the research shows acupuncture may work.  The NIH has reportedly began funding $2.5 Million in acupuncture research.  The FDA has Dr. Jobst's research and was used in the forum on needle approval this summer.<P>

Abstract: </strong>By now, there is adequate clinical experience of treating bronchial 
asthma with acupuncture. It has a limited role in treating acute attacks 
since it is a weak bronchodilator, but it has an excellent prophylactic 
effect in the long run.<P> Controlled trials have shown that acupuncture 
causes modest improvement in objective parameters, with significant 
subjective improvement. However, in all these trials there is a large 
degree of variation in the technique and methodology used.<P>
 It is expected 
that with standardization of the technique as per the guidelines given, 
future trials will be able to quantify the efficacy of acupuncture in 
bronchial asthma. In addition, investigation of the mechanism by which 
acupuncture works may lead to better understanding of the pathophysiology 
of asthma.

Abstract: </strong>Erythron membrane impairment was investigated using membrane active 
drugs (obsidan, delagil, morphium, ethanol) to specify indications to acupuncture in bronchial asthma (BA).<P>

 The patients were studied during the treatment and followed up for a year. It was found that both immediate and long-term results of acupuncture were related to patterns of the membrane - impairment. BA patients with a sharp, greater than 1.5 fold diminution of 
microcyte count upon delagil test should be assigned to repeated courses of 
acupuncture during a year. <P>

To monitor the treatment effect, it is 
recommended to define osmotic resistance of the red blood cells in obsidan 
test in addition to clinicofunctional indices.

(PE title: Journal of traditional Chinese medicine = Chung i tsa 
chih / sponsored by A11-China Association of Traditional Chinese 
Medicine, Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine.) <HR><strong>
Abstract: </strong>192 cases of bronchial asthma were treated by acupuncture on Kongzui 
(Lu 6) and Yuji (Lu 10) with an immediate total effective rate of 98.9P,
and the rate of clinical remission plus marked improvement was 76.5%.<P>
 The 
efficacy for patients of varying ages and varying duration of the disease 
was not significantly different. Effects for asthma of the cold type 
according to TCM and of the allergic type according to western medicine 
were the most remarkable; and cases that responded to the treatment the 
most promptly would have better long-term curative efficacy, which was also 
associated with the length of needle retention. <P>The author deemed that 40 
minutes of needle retention after the treatment took effect was desirable. 
This modality for treatment of bronchial asthma was very satisfactory, 
particularly useful for cases with history of drug allergy.

<strong>
Abstract: </strong>Clinical pattern of the disease, systolic pressure in the pulmonary 
artery, external respiration, central hemodynamics were assessed in 111 
patients (50 with chronic obstructive bronchitis and 61 with bronchial 
asthma) to study the effect of laser puncture. The treatment course 
consisted of 10 sessions performed with application of Uzor apparatus in 
pulse regimen with 890 nm wave length, 1500 Hz frequency and 2 mw mean 
radiation rate. <P>

The results indicate a positive response to infra-red laser 
acupuncture evident from improved bronchial patency, enhanced bronchial 
sensitivity to sympathomimetics, reduced systolic pressure in the pulmonary 
artery. The promise of the laser puncture is attributed to its separate 
broncholytic effect and the ability to lower pulmonary vascular resistance.

Solutions: An Evaluation of an Acupuncture Program for 
Drug Treatment in San Diego County
</FONT>
</TD></TR>

</CENTER>
<HR>


A pilot study was recently conducted by the City of San Diego to determine whether or not acupuncture was helpful in curbing the drug addictions of patients with treatment and/or motivated these parolees to search for a higher quality of life without drugs. The hope was to find if acupuncture will ease the patients through the initial stages of Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome (the emotional, psychological, and physical symptoms of ridding the body of the substance) and to keep them in treatment longer. The Solutions program began acupuncture treatments on September 1, 1993 and the results are as follows:<P>


The focus of this research was to examine the use of acupuncture in an outpatient program for parolees with drug problems. The outpatient program, funded by the San Diego County Alcohol and Drug Services and operated by the Community Connection Resource Center receives referrals from the Parolee Partnership Program (PPP). The Pacific College of Oriental Medicine supplies a licensed acupuncturist and required supplies through an agreement with Community Connection. The goal of Community Connection's acupuncture program is to retain outpatient parolee clients in treatment longer than drug-addicted parolees who do not receive acupuncture. The research procedures included the case tracking of 52 acupuncture clients and a comparison group of 64 individuals in treatment without acupuncture. Information was compiled on the socio-demographic features of the two groups: type, level, and history of drug use, and arrests, charges filed, and dispositions during the time in the program. Study results indicate that acupuncture may have an influence on the length of time in treatment and reduce or eliminate drug use. This research may be helpful to treatment providers and policymakers in determining how best to allocate resources toward populations in treatment and what results can be reasonably expected by using acupuncture. The research suggests area for future study, such as drug abuse, including criminal behavior pre- and post- treatment, and cost of treatment compared to the benefits of treatment.<P>
<HR>


<H2>The Test Groups: 
</H2>
Two groups were observed: one group received acupuncture treatment and the other group did not, serving as a comparison group.<P>


All clients were adult parolees and more than 80 percent were male. Both test groups were primarily comprised of Caucasians and African-Americans.<P>


Nearly half (46 percent) of both groups were between the ages of 31 and 40 years, and roughly a quarter were in the age category of 26 and 30.<P>


2 percent of each group had a college degree while 56 percent of the acupuncture clients had graduated high school, compared to 47 percent of the comparison group. Over one quarter (27 percent) of the acupuncture clients did not graduate high school compared to 41 percent of the comparison group.<P>


Heroin was cited most frequently as the primary drug problem by clients in both groups. Over a third (36 percent) of the comparison group reported cocaine compared to less than a quarter (23 percent) of the acupuncture group. Fifty-six percent (56 percent) of the acupuncture clients and 45 percent of the comparison group stated that their primary route of drug administration was injection.<P>


Over sixty percent (69 percent for the acupuncture clients and 61 percent for the comparison group) reported no use of their primary drug in the 30 days prior to treatment admission.<P>
<HR>


<H2>Findings:</H2>

Arrests during the program were few for both groups. Only four acupuncture clients were rearrested during their time in treatment; the comparison group had five people rearrested.<P>


Acupuncture clients stayed in treatment nearly twice as long as the comparison group (an average of 93 days for the acupuncture clients compared to an average of 48 days for the comparison group.) In addition, the acupuncture clients received more individual counseling, group counseling, ancillary services, and employment referrals than the comparison clients.<P>


The average number of acupuncture treatments received per client was ten.<P>


The average time spent in the program for successful acupuncture clients was almost double the average time for successful comparison clients (113 days versus 70 days, respectively).<P>


90 percent of the acupuncture clients, compared to 69 percent of the comparison group, reported no drug use since the beginning of the treatment program.<P>


33 percent of the acupuncture clients were employed in the beginning of treatment, and by the end of treatment, 65 percent were employed. While the comparison group also show an increase in employment upon program completion, the total number of comparison clients employed upon exit was less (43 percent).<P>
<HR>


<H2>Interpretations:</H2>

The entire outpatient program lasts 180 days, but, in the past, most people only attended between 30 and 60 days. Acupuncture clients stayed in treatment nearly twice the amount of the comparison group (an average of 93 days for the acupuncture clients and average of 48 days for the comparison group). Therefore, acupuncture clients had greater opportunity to receive additional individual counseling, group counseling, and ancillary services. <P>


The average number of acupuncture treatments that each clients received was ten. Based on an average of three months in treatment, each participant received almost one acupuncture treatment per week. The goal of the acupuncture component of Solutions/Soluciones program was to keep parolees in treatment longer so they could benefit from the services provided. As noted above, the acupuncture clients did spend more time in treatment and, although self-reported, 90 percent claim they did not use drugs during their treatment.<P>


Some of the factors that impede treatment efforts were that many of the parolees who entered the Solutions/Soluciones program either did not volunteer to receive acupuncture treatment or did not complete the treatment program. According to the Solutions/Soluciones staff, the reactions to treatment and the reservations toward participating included fear of needles, fear of a new dependence on the acupuncture, headaches or fatigue resulting from treatment, or no positive experiences as a result of acupuncture (i.e., relaxed, attentive at group therapy, less stressed, etc.).<P>


It is important to note that the majority of individuals in either group did not stay in treatment for the recommended (180 days) which is an issue that the service provider may wish to address along with the fact that Solutions/Soluciones' clients did not receive as many acupuncture treatments as specified in the program scope of work.<P>

<HR>
<H2>For further information:</H2>

The results of this pilot study have been so well received by the San Diego substance abuse treatment community that plans are currently underway for inclusion of acupuncture treatment at San Diego's Las Colinas Women's Detention Facility and the Otay Mesa Jail. Acupuncturists interested in working in these facilities should send their resume to Pacific College, attention <A HREF="mailto:76330.3225@compuserve.com">Jack Miller.</A>

The results obtained from a one year acupuncture detoxification program study in Portland, Oregon and a blind study of acupuncture treatment with chronic alcoholics in Hennepin County, Minnesota are:
<UL>
<LI>
People who received acupuncture detoxification treatment were two times more likely to continue in rehabilitation therapy than people who did not receive acupuncture treatment.
<LI>
More than 70% of people treated with acupuncture successfully completed detoxification, compared with only 50% of hose who did not receive the treatment.  For those detoxifying from alcohol, the success rate was 90%.
<LI>
Recidivism (tendency to relapse) of alcohol and drug addicts decreased from 20-25% to 5% for patients receiving acupuncture detoxification treatments.
<LI>
In a blind study of chronic alcoholics in Hennepin County, 37% of the treatment group receiving acupuncture completed the program.  Only 7.4% of the control group had a successful completion of the program.

153 patients suffering from pain, edematous conditions, and impaired
     movement following traumas sustained in accidents were treated or
     after-treated with acupuncture. Acupuncture was applied in adherence to
     a standardized program according to the individual types of injury. The
     stimulus was applied by means of steel needles inserted into body as
     well as ear acupuncture points. In all 9 groups, improvement of the
     painful condition was significant to highly significant as it was
     regarding improvement of the movement impairment, the latter not having
     been emphasized in the other 3 groups. Remaining complaints of long
     standing following accident traumas could also be positively
     influenced. Acupuncture proved itself to be an effective form of
     therapy for after-treatment of accident patients, presenting a valuable
     supplement to the field of rehabilitation, especially when combined
     with other physical therapeutic measures.

<strong>
Abstract: </strong>A prospective randomized study was performed to compare the effect of 
acupuncture and intramuscular Avafortan injection in the treatment of renal 
colic. Our results showed that acupuncture is as effective in relieving 
renal colic as Avafortan but it had a more rapid analgesic onset (3.14 +/
2.88 minutes versus 15.44 +/- 7.55 minutes, p less than 0.05). Of the 
patients in the Avafortan group 7 (43.8%) had side effects, including skin 
rash in 3, tachycardia in 2, drowsiness in 1 and facial flush in 1. No side 
effects were noted in the acupuncture group. During 2 hours of observation 
acupuncture and Avafortan seemed to be ineffective in promoting stone 
passage. However, patients receiving Avafortan treatment were more likely 
to have paralytic ileus. <P>

In summary, acupuncture can be a good alternative 
for the treatment of renal colic.

<strong>
Abstract: </strong>In the treatment of pyelonephritis which continues to cause problems 
in practical uronephrology, the main efforts of the clinicians are now 
directed at enhancement of the patients resistance, improvement of renal 
blood flow and urodynamics. Acupuncture (AP) is thought capable to meet the 
above requirements. <P>

It was used in combined treatment of 102 pyelonephritis 
cases (51 with acute and 51 with chronic manifestations) showing intact 
renal function. According to radionuclide renography, a positive trend in 
the secretion and urodynamics of the upper urinary tract was demonstrable 
in 50% of the patients. Dynamic nephroscintigraphy reported a positive 
response in 60% of cases versus 25% in those treated without AP. AP 
promotion of earlier recovery or remission, reduction of the scope of 
chemotherapy, good short- and long-term response permit this modality to be 
recommended for application in urological and nephrological practice.

Lung Cancer and Five Elements

<HR>

This page both explains the connection between mind, body and spirit, as well as illustrates it with an article found in the L.A. Times.  If you already understand five element theory, you can skip forward to <A HREF=#1> The L.A. Times Article.</A>  Otherwise, just keep reading and by the time you get to the article, it will make more sense.<P>

Chinese medicine is a holistic medicine.  This means that there is an awareness that what effects the body, will also effect the mind and what effects the mind will also effect the spirit.  Going in the opposite direction, an emotional disorder can manifest in the body as a disease or other disharmony.<P>


Chinese medicine goes much further than simply admitting to the connection between mind and body, it goes so far as to actually map out the relationships.  There are a wide variety of diagnostic perspectives available to the practitioner of Chinese (or Oriental) medicine.  One is called "Five Element Theory."  It is within this perspective that we find the most popular system of psycho/spiritual connections to physical healthcare.<P>


The best way to understand Five Element theory is to understand that organs in the human body are associated with one of the five elemental building blocks of the universe, according to Chinese cosmological theory.<P>


But these elements are not necessarily physical, they are concepts which have a manifestations on physical and other dimensions.<P>


<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="Po2.gif " ALIGN=middle ALT="Five Element Diagram" HSPACE=5>These five elements are known as: 
<UL><LI> Wood (the green phase)
<LI> Fire (the red phase)
<LI> Earth (the yellow phase)
<LI> Metal (the white phase)
<LI> Water (the black phase)
</UL><P>

But as concepts, they have significance to both our internal organs and our mental, emotional and spiritual landscape.<P>


<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="Po3.gif " ALIGN=middle ALT="Another five element graphic" HSPACE=5>All the elements manifest on all levels.  For instance, the wood phase of energy shows up in the following manifestations:

<UL><LI> Yin organ: Liver
<LI> Yang organ: Gall Bladder
<LI> Season: Spring
<LI> Emotion: Anger
<LI> Direction: East
<LI> Color: Green (or Blue-Green)
<LI> Sensory Organ: Eyes
</UL>

On an emotional level, wood is traditionally associated with the emotion of anger.  Wood energy likes to expand and grow upwards.  People like to "get ahead" because of their wood energy.  When there comes an obstacle to our movement, we become angry.  This is the response that wood energy has to something in its way of growth and expansion.  When our wood is supple and well-lubricated, the anger is short-lived and is replaced with flexibility in much the same way that a young sapling can travel around obstacles to find a better place to grow.<P>


Spiritually, it is said that the wood energy of the body is associated with the "Hun" or ethereal spirit.  The Hun, I believe, is the so-called "higher mind."  It is said that the Liver opens to the eyes, and so eye problems are often treated with points on the Liver Channel in acupuncture.  However, I believe that it is this connection to the eyes that proves the Wood element's association with the Hun, or "host" consciousness that Taoism speaks of.  The "host" mind is simply consciousness, it sees things As It Is with no additional interpretation.  It is the Zen experience.  It is this part of us that provides the impetus for our return to heaven, oneness with the universe, reuniting with God, Samahdi, Oneness, Nirvana, Grace, Feeling Groovy.<P>


So, we have to remember that with any disharmony of an organ system or element on one level, there will be fall-out at the other levels.<P>


If we have a problem with the Lungs, we'll see pathology consistent with problems of respiration.  We'll see asthma, coughing, perhaps even Lung cancer.  However, on other levels, we'll see sadness.  This is the emotion associated with the Metal element, the Lung element. Some of the associations with the metal element are as follows:


<UL><LI> Yin organ: Lungs
<LI> Yang organ: Large Intestine
<LI> Season: Autumn
<LI> Emotion: Sadness
<LI> Direction: West
<LI> Color: White
<LI> Sensory Organ: Nose
</UL>

The soul associated with the Lungs is called the Po.  The Po is called the animal spirit.  This is the part of us that is instinctive and animalistic.  The Po is not eternal, it dies along with our body.  I believe that it is the Po that harbors the fear of death, because for the Po, death is real.  To the Hun, the spirit of the Liver, death is liberation, to the Po death is final.  That is why we grieve for the passing of loved ones.  It is the Po's recognition of the end of life.  The Po is quick to recognize the loss of anything important in our lives, and so "sadness" is the emotion associated with the Metal element.<P>


On another level, Metal energy not only regulates the breathing in and out of air in our lungs but the bonding and releasing of attachments in our lives.  The woman in the following article started smoking at the age of 16.  Likely to appear more grown-up, as is so often the case, however it is interesting to note that this age is the beginning of a period in our emotional development in which the group bonding experience is most crucial.  Later on in life we chose to bond with just one partner, and that is called marriage, however, as teens we bond with our peer group. <P>


It might be interesting to see what happens if we were to offer teens an alternative to smoking in the form of yogic practices that incorporate breathing such as Kriya or Pranayana Yoga.  Being an ex-smoker myself, I know well of the response of relaxation associated with smoking, however having waded through a variety of yogic disciplines as well, I recall that the true therapy of smoking lies not in the ingestion of the smoke, but in the deep, mindful breathing that takes place while one is smoking.<P>


So what's this all mean?  It means that when we read an article such as the following, which appeared in the Los Angeles Times in the Spring of 1996, we can better understand the connections between this patient's physical pathology and emotional make-up.  She is a textbook case of Metal pathology, which includes both sadness and Lung pathology.<P>

<H2>Relentless Assaults Erode Cancer patient's Resolve</H2>

<B>Profile:</B>  Illness and chemotherapy leave Claire Chasles weak and depressed.  But she vows to keep fighting.<P>


By Marlene Cimons<BR>
Times Staff Writer<P>

WASHINGTON-All Claire Chasles wants to do is have a good cry. But the unforgiving nature of her disease has denied her even this. <P>


"I start to cry, and I can't stop," she says, her voice breaking. "And then I can't catch my breath. I can't breathe. So what good does it do?" <P>


Claire, 42, a smoker since age 16, has advanced lung cancer. Since the disease recurred last fall, she has been fighting it with all the defiance she can muster. But her resolve has started to crumble in the presence of an overwhelming feeling of sadness. <P>


Some might say she has good reason to weep. After two cycles of powerful, toxic chemotherapy, she is extremely weak and gaunt, and she has lost almost all of her hair. The physical assaults have their toll, and she is depressed. <P>


"When I was 16 and lighting up, I felt very, very glamorous," she said. "Now I'm crying all the time and losing weight, and my hair's failing out piece by piece in huge clumps. You think that's glamorous?"<P>


Her physicians had been hoping the chemotherapy would delay her advancing tumor and give her some quality time. Claire has been counting on this, but the treatment has been as ravaging as the illness. <P>


In February, she appeared robust and healthy. But despite a remarkably positive attitude, she then began a precipitous slide. And now her spirits have followed. <P>


"It's not unusual for very sick patients to get depressed when they finally start to see evidence of the disease in their lives," said Dr. Paul Lanken, a bioethicist and medical director of the intensive care unit at the University of Pennsylvania. <P>


"It's hard for people to accept a bad prognosis when they're feeling fine," Lanken added. "But then the disease catches up to them, and it becomes real." <P>


<CENTER><H4>Doctor Concerned</H4></CENTER>

Claire met Thursday with her oncologist, Dr. Naiyer Rizvi of Georgetown University Medical Center's Lombardi Cancer Center, and Katy Swanson, a registered nurse who is the case manager for lung cancer patients. They are concerned about Claire's emotional outlook and her deteriorating physical condition. <P>


"I'm sorry this has been happening," Rizvi says. <P>


"I just want to get it (the chemotherapy) over with, and be on my merry way," Claire replies. <P>


Rizvi takes a deep breath. <P>


"I think the odds are stacked against you, frankly, at this point," he responds, not unkindly. "I think the fact that you are weaker and losing weight is concerning. <P>


"I would be deceiving you if I thought the chances were excellent for you to make a recovery and get back to where you were before. It's the reality." <P>


"OK," Claire says very slowly. <P>


Rizvi leaves for a few minutes, and Swanson sits down, pulling her chair next to Claire's wheelchair. <P>


"This is the most down I've seen you," Swanson says. "I think you're now realizing how sick you are, and you're thinking about the future and whether you're getting better. And we can't make any guarantees. <P>


"It's tough to know what to do. <br>
That's what affects everybody with lung cancer. They start to think: 'Is it worth it?'<P>
 

"This is something we know we can't cure, but maybe we can give you some quality time. Some beat it, but most don't. And I think that's starting to hit you. <P>


"Start thinking of short-term goals," Swanson says gently. "Not six months or a year in the future."<P>


"I'm not," Claire insists. "I just 
want today." <P>


"You should be thinking today or tomorrow and the next day," Swanson says. <P>


Swanson pauses. <P>


"Do you want to give up the chemo?" she asks. "That's what you need to be thinking about."<P>
 

"No," Claire says. "I'm going to finish it." <P>


Rizvi decides. however, to postpone by one week the third chemo session, which would have marked the halfway point in the treatment. 
In the meantime, he hopes Claire will regain some strength, and he will do a series of tests to see what's happening with the tumor. <P>


"Are you somebody who has thoughts of God? Are you religious? Is there anything that keeps you going?" Swanson asks. <P>


"Just my friends and my family," Claire says.<P>

 
Swanson and Rizvi leave the room. <P>


"I don't know what they were trying to say," Claire says. "But I know they're not saying: 'Give up.' "<P>
 

<CENTER><H4>Bout of Depression</H4></CENTER>

Claire's depression had begun in earnest several weeks earlier. <P>


She began crying over little things and complained that she didn't know why she was feeling so sad. Maybe it was her appearance and the crushing fatigue that had made minor tasks nearly impossible, she said. She had started to use a walker because her legs buckle when she gets up. <P>


"I can't do anything. I feel so helpless and lifeless," she said. "I have no energy to do anything. I don't take pride in myself the way I used to. The pride's there somewhere. But I just can't get to it." <P>


Joe Kelly, her live-in fianc, wants to get married. And a grandchild is due this fall. Claire wants to plan for these happy events. But, understandably, it is difficult now. <P>


"I want to be able to run around. 
Play with my grandchild. Be a wife to my husband," she said. "But I've got to get better. Maybe I'm scared that I won't, that it will get worse." <P>


That's the closest she comes to acknowledging fear. If she is frightened about where her illness is heading, she doesn't talk about it. 
She repeatedly insists, even through the tears: "I'm not licked yet." <P>


She talks about getting married and having a delayed honeymoon. 
"I've always wanted to go to Switzerland," she said. <P>


Claire's 2l-year-old daughter, Christine-five months' pregnant and herself unable to quit smoking-has been trying to stay upbeat. But both women feel the strain: Claire because she hates being stuck in an armchair, unable to do anything but watch television, and Christine because she has had to assume so much of her mother's care. <P>


"I should be doing things for her, spoiling her. taking her shopping," Claire said. <P>


Christine works part time as a waitress in 12-hour shifts. She also fetches whatever Claire needs, fixes her meals and coaxes her to eat. Claire has lost more than 60 pounds since last fall, most of it during the last three months. <P>


"It's stressful, but it's not Mom's fault," Christine said. "She can't do anything for herself. She took care of me. Now it's my turn to help her." <P>


She teases her mother gently. "I think you look so cute, just like a baby." she says of the fine wisps of hair still on Claire's head. <P>


And, as Claire gets up and slowly makes her way across the room, Christine jokes about her mother's skinny legs. "She looks like a stork," she says, as Claire chuckles. 
Despite the humor, it is clear Claire is frustrated. <P>


"I've been so sick since Valentine's Day, I've been in bed constantly," she said. "Now I just want to feel halfway decent. I'd just like to have one week where I feel good, then maybe I can handle the next dose of chemo. I want to get my strength back so I can play with that baby when it comes." <P>


<CENTER><H4>Reasons to Not Smoke</H4></CENTER> 

She wants something positive to come from her ordeal. <P>


Indeed, she wishes that every young person preparing to light that next cigarette could see her sunken cheeks and balding head. <P>


"I don't want kids to ever start," she said as she coughed. "I don't want them to ever go through the torture and the pain and the scariness and everything that's associated with this disease. Believe me there's a lot of it." <P>


New statistics about teenage smoking, however, show a sharp jump in recent years. And the news has been especially ominous for women. Lung cancer now kills more women than any other kind of cancer. <P>


The Clinton administration has proposed regulations to keep teens from buying cigarettes and to shield them from tobacco ads. But the industry has filed legal challenges. <P>


Claire doesn't understand why the proposed regulations are so controversial. She wishes something, anything, had kept her from starting to smoke. She doesn't smoke anymore. <P>


"Is this what the kids want--what's happening to me?" she asked. "I'm sitting here and crying and taking all of these medications and watching my hair fall out." <P>


Christine watches, and not without mixed emotions. Her pregnancy is progressing well--she has gained 25 pounds-and she is delighting in thoughts of her impending motherhood, hoping for a girl. <P>


But she smokes. When Christine first learned she was pregnant, she swore she would stop. She felt she had to for the sake of the baby. <P>


Christine also started smoking as a teenager, seeing her parents and grandparents all smoke. Today, the best she can do is try to cut down. 
On some days, she smokes only a handful of cigarettes. On other days, she goes through a pack. Her fianc, Brady, and Claire's fianc, Joe, also smoke. <P>


"I keep telling Brady we have to do this (stop smoking) together." Christine said. "But he says he doesn't think I can stay with it."<P>
 

They are all witnessing Claire's life-and-death struggle. And still they smoke. <P>


"It's so damn hard," Christine said. "I want to stop. I have to stop. 
But just try to tell that to my mind and my body when it wants that nicotine." <P>


She looks at her mother in the next room. <P>


"Now that you can really tell she's sick. I do think about it, more now than I did before," she said. "When I didn't see it, it didn't bother me. If only I could've seen this before I started smoking." <P>


<CENTER><H4>Seeking Counseling </H4></CENTER>

Last month while undergoing her chemotherapy, Claire met with Dr. George Uy, a Georgetown staff psychiatrist. She was hoping that some counseling would help. <P>


With two intravenous lines hooked to her left wrist, she answers his questions. <P>


"What do you think is one of the reasons you feel down?" Uy asks. 
Claire blames a still-unhealed wound in her side, where surgery to reinflate her lung was performed several months ago, the site of a subsequent serious infection. <P>


He takes notes. <BR>
"Any hopelessness?"  <BR>
She nods her head.  <BR>
"How's your concentration?" <P>


Her answer is peculiar: "I used to love to read the obituaries. I can't read them anymore. They upset me."<P>
 

"Any thoughts about wanting to end your life?"<P>
 

"No, I haven't come to that." Uy asks about her family, and she tells him about the coming grandchild--"That's another reason I want to live-I want to spoil that baby"--and her plans to get married, possibly this summer. <P>


"Do you know what your prognosis is?" he asks. <P>


"It's probably not good, but I'm going to fight it. You never know. I talk to friends who say: 'I know someone with only one lung and he's gone on for five, six, seven years.' So you never know." <P>


Christine and other family members are worried about Claire's attitude, and they persist in urging her to fight on. <P>


"If she can keep her spirits up and kick ass, she'll be OK," Christine said. "She's not gonna live forever. But she's not gonna die tomorrow either."<P>

 
Of herself, Christine says: "I don't have time to feel sad. I don't like seeing her like this. But I've got to make sure she stays happy, so she doesn't give up." <P>

There are numerous methods by which a practitioner of TCM will obtain diagnostic information by viewing the face.  The system represented on this page is one of many.  This one most closely represents the system presented in the classic Chinese text: "Simple Questions."  It was further modified by <A HREF=../Referrals/Yang.htm>Dr. Tian De Yang</A>.<P>

Any colors inappropriate to the normal color of the area would suggest a pathology.  Most often we look for the five colors in the face.  For instance, if we were to see the color green in the forehead region we might look for further confirmations of pathology associated with "wood overacting on earth."  Or the Liver's function causing problems in the digestive system.<P>

It is interesting to note that even with the wide varieties of colors represented by different races, there is still a superficial color that can arise atop the "host" color which, would then be useful for diagnostic purposes.<P>

I saw a sumo wrestling competition on television recently that featured wrestlers from all over the world.  The American athlete made it to the "final four" of the competition, so he was interviewed by the Japanese sports commentator.  This athlete, of African origin, had a medium brown color on his body, but his face was appreciably darker than the rest of his body.  The black color wasn't limited to a single portion of his face, but the entire face.  This suggested to me a problem in his lower Jiao, probably the Kidneys with a possible Liver involvement as well.<P>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

Pulse diagnosis has always been an enigmatic as well as complex field. 
Not surprisingly, acupuncture colleges offer little formal education 
in this area even though Li Shi Zhen's Pulse Diagnosis (1) and various editions of the Huang Di Nei Jing have been available for many years. 
Even when some of the classical literature on pulses is part of the curiculum, many students complain they receive obscure and conflicting advice 
when trying to sense the pulse movement and accurately interpret the information it can provide. Two new books, a translation of the Li Shi Zhen 
from Blue Poppy Press and Dr. Leon Hammer's work from Eastland Press, 
are promised shortly and should help to amend and renew serious study in 
this field. <P>

According to Li Shi Zhen there are 27 basic pulse states (2). Most basic 
movements can be observed in any of nine fundamental positions (3) on 
each wrist. The division of each wrist into three depths forms a grid in which 
"the area and nature of the disease can be determined from the wrist pulse."(4) In this nine-sector grid, the cun position indicates diaphragm to crown, the guan position indicates navel to diaphragm, and the chi position navel to feet. The superficial comprises emotional, exterior, and meridian activity, the middle shows organic or metabolic activity, and the deep level shows the bone-level or innermost activity. Together, these sectors create a hologram of the entire body, similar in nature to the mapping of the ear, feet, or eyes. <P>

Mathematically, this nine-sector grid forms 486 simple combinations. Because each state is never seen alone but combined with one or more types of energy--what Li Shi Zhen calls a "composite pulse" (5)-- the possibilities quickly expand (6). In developing a model of this sophistication, we can create a diagnosis system as rich and as varied as there are conditions or patients. By adopting the criteria of Li Shi Zhen we can anticipate a method of diagnosis and treatment that is truly as unique as the patient. Ultimately, we can have a far richer description than 5-elements; we could calculate 5 elements of 5-elements of 5-elements. A model this detailed gives us a much clearer picture of cancer, AIDS, and other forms of chronic illness. <P>

Unfortunately, no current American text exploits this level of sophistication and complexity. Typically contemporary texts divide the pulse levels into the yang and yin organs, then specify a diagnosis method using Eight Confirmations in the cun, guan, or chi positions. Many different types of problems are reduced to the same, simple rubrics- -"stagnated liver energy," "dampness in the spleen," etc. As a result, complicated and chronic problems can easily be misunderstood, misdiagnosed, and inappropriately treated. Compounding this problem is the difficulty of the subject matter itself, differentiating and interpreting subtle activity inherent in pulses especially for chronic and catastrophic illnesses which present highly complex pulse patterns. It is unrealistic to work with models like the Li Shi Zhen without comprehensive classroom study and extensive clinical practice with supervision. This problem is further compounded by confusing and conflicting information in the Li Shi Zhen itself. <P>

Thankfully, Li Shi Zhen provides us with an important tool, asserting that all this can be made less complicated: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The theory of the pulse is very complicated but it is based 
upon the four principles--floating, sinking, slow, and rapid. 
Once they are understood, by elaborating on them, the entire subject can be clarified.(7)</BLOCKQUOTE> <P>

Li Shi Zhen asks us to divide the pulse into yang and yin vectors along vertical and horizontal lines of symmetry, a type of fourfold analysis. For him, pulse diagnosis is an art of deconstruction, a geometry of meaning. <P>

The model that best includes both these dimensions is the Tai Chi diagram, a broad and familiar abstraction that can also be used to decipher the particulars of its applications. It is the classic emblem of complementary opposites, cyclic continuity in time, and harmonious interrelationship--all essential parameters of health in the human body. Yang rises vertically and accelerates horizontally; yin sinks vertically and decelerates horizontally. Using the Tai Chi symbol as our paradigm, we can analyze how yang and 
yin should ideally communicate, exchange, and balance. <P>

The circle itself is a traditional symbol of unity. The sine wave through the diameter of the circle is the ideal and basic pulse wave. It is the result of balance, interaction, and harmony. Any deviation from it provides information on how yin and yang have changed from that balance and what are the consequences for health. All 27 pathological pulse states discussed by Li Shi Zhen can be derived from it. <P>

Tai Chi is process-orientated, coherent, evolving, and interactive in contrast to the typical emphasis on substance or "solid" components. In it, yang and yin are more than their sum; they create and dynamically balance each other. As a complex system, the Tai Chi diagram can be seen in a wide range of natural scales and applications--the double-helix of the DNA molecule, the change of day and night, the spiral nature of galaxies. Because this symbol is found at the heart of Taoist philosophy, the Chinese 60-year calendar, feng shui, martial arts, and a variety of other systems, it can be used as a basis for analysis and comparison of those systems. <P>

We can simplify the work of Li Shi Zhen one step further by creating a list of the most fundamental pulses. As a basic group, they illustrate a view of the essential dimensions and types of energies found in all pulses. It is important to note that they are derived from a balanced pulse state and fulfill Li Shi Shen's fourfold criteria: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Healthy or Balanced 
<LI>Floating &amp; Sinking 
<LI>Rapid &amp; Slow 
<LI>Big/Small, Long/Short 
<LI>Slippery &amp; Choppy
<LI>Knotted 
</UL>

<H2>The Healthy or Balanced Pulse </H2>
When Li Shi Zhen speaks of the different qualities of a normal pulse in section 3.2 (8), the descriptions he uses are not "normal" nor "healthy" in either a theoretical or clinical sense. This data entirely contradicts the pathological indications described later in the book by the terms scattered, choppy, blocked, wiry, tight, slippery, soft, etc. Only the description of the middle 
pulse of the spleen and stomach feeling "regular, neither fast nor slow" comes 
close to accurately portraying the energetic balance, coordination, and harmony expected in a healthy person. Clearly, these descriptions are typical 
of critical problems associated with those organs. <P>

Inherent to this system is the communication and symmetry of yin and 
yang. The sine wave is formed from the synergy and coordination between 
yin and yang. Their dynamic is nonlinear, not simply the sum of isolated or 
independent elements. This relationship is as important as the constituents 
and becomes their context as well as genesis. The Tai Chi movement represents the ability of living systems to continuously regulate and renew themselves and to regulate this process in such a way that their integrity and 
structure is maintained--what is today sometimes called autopoiesis. <P>

We would expect other systems to be derived from this one, and in fact 
we see it at the heart of many illustrations in Chinese philosophical and 
medical literature. Whereas a machine is geared to output a specific product, a living organism is primarily concerned with renewing itself. We should 
expect to see this sine wave in all healthy relationships and in the pulse 
positions of a healthy person. Therefore, any deviation from this wave movement provides us with important information about what is happening to 
the energy of the patient or the body's response to disease and the environment. It is the way systems cycle or energetically perpetuate themselves.<P>

<H3>Pulse Wave Energy Segments </H3>
<UL>
<LI>AB qi Yang/yang function 
<LI>BC qi Yin/yang function 
<LI>CD xue Yin/yin capacity 
<LI>DE xue Yang/yin capacity  
</UL>



 
The Normal pulse is often identified with the stomach energy because it is the organ which supplies nourishment and support for all others. Together with the spleen, the earth Phase absorbs, coordinates, and transforms; five elementally, it is at the center of the sine wave movement. The dampness or substantial quality sometimes attributed to its pulse character is indicative of that nurturing and supportive role. That central importance is emphasized in the seasonal 5-Phase scheme: each Phase communicates with the spleen before cycling to the next Phase in the shen cycle (9). <P>

In a perfectly healthy person, all the pulses would present this smooth, balanced sine wave movement connected at all positions and depths- -and 
it should be present during the entire year, not only in late summer. While 
the seasonal energy will have some influence in the pulses, emotions have a much stronger and immediate influence. The energy movements of the four seasons add their wave shapes to the patient's energetic movement. 
The interactions of those two wave forms uniquely describe the patient's reaction to the seasonal change. <P>

The basic wave can be further analyzed by dividing it into its yang and yin components. The normal pulse begins with an ascending or yang movement. The convex portion indicates the yang energy or qi of the movement 
[ABC], while the concave portion describes the state of yin energy or blood of each organ [CDE]. To determine the balance within this movement, check the size, angles, and texture of the yang portion and compare it to the yin portion. Ideally, the yin and yang portions of each pulse should be symmetrical, hold the same capacity, and display the same textures. A sharper 
angle of ascent indicates that the pulse contains more yang energy or heat; 
a smoother angle indicates that yin is more prevalent. If the ascending movement is more prominent, the pulse will have a tendency to float; when the 
descending movement is more prominent it will have a tendency to sink 
(10). When the rising movement is dominant it can also have a tendency to 
be more superficial or express an acute syndrome. If it is a chronic condition 
the syndrome expressed will be light, superficial, or immediate. <P>

If the pulse begins with a descending motion (the sine wave is reversed), 
the organ energy is reversing and, if more than one pulse position presents 
this reversal, the mother-son rule of the 5-Phase theory is breaking down 
and the condition is more critical. <P>

Symptoms are created by contrasts in function, energy, or movement. The 
capacity of a pulse movement to create symptoms can be measured by the 
area of the yang [ABC] or yin [CDE] portion of the pulse. For example, if the 
yin portion of the pulse is larger, then the yin energy has the greater capacity to express a symptom. The pulse is not necessarily obliged to express this capacity, but we can see the potential for expression. And our diagnosis 
does not have to rely solely on the patient's report of their symptoms; we can observe problems before the patient can be aware of them. This capability of pulse reading is essential in discriminating the root of the problem 
from the branch; as well as in cases where the patient has forgotten, is unaware, or is hiding aspects of the condition. <P>

These elementary rules can be applied repeatedly as tools to analyze any 
pulse shape or energy. Taking the first half or yang portion as our focus, the 
movement going up is yang of yang while the second movement of the 
first half of the basic wave is yin of yang. In the yin portion of the basic 
wave, the movement descending is yin of yin; the movement ascending to 
the horizontal axis is yang of yin. The yang of yin portion connects to the 
next pulse position, feeding its yang of yang movement. <P>

The clinical implications of this fourfold analysis are far-reaching (11). Let's 
consider several examples of a Flooding (hong) pulse, which can, in general, 
indicate heat or bacterial inflammation. First, we need to keep in mind that 
when the upbeat is yang, it indicates the qi and when the downbeat is yin,
it indicates blood. The ascending movement of a Flooding pulse can be 
smaller than the descending motion, or the rising motion can be larger than 
the descending motion. These two pulses offer us different information even 
though both are Flooding. <P>

Both present bacterial inflammation with a certain range of fever or temperature. Where the downbeat is larger it indicates that the yin energy or 
blood is more influenced by the heat than the qi therefore we should expect more pus formation and lymphatic blockage. In the other example, 
heat affects the qi more, and we should expect a higher fever but less pus 
formation. <P>

If we want to see if the heat expressed in the Flooding pulse is affecting 
the upper or the lower body, we can observe it the chi, guan, cun divisions. If 
the Flooding pulse is moving towards the cun it indicates that it is affecting 
the upper part of the body and if it is moving towards the chi it indicates 
that it is affecting the lower part of the body.<P>
 
Consider the wave movement in the chi position of the right wrist, the large intestine. A pulse that rises in a normal sine curve but becomes wiry in 
the yin portion before it returns to the horizontal axis indicates that qi is not a problem but there is some problem in the yin or blood movement related to that organ. It may indicate that some heavier materials are stagnating and the organ itself is now being affected because that heavy material has not been eliminated. The organ does not have enough energy so elimination is impaired, building toward a toxic condition. <P>

If the situation was reversed and the upbeat was wiry and the downbeat was normal, it would indicate that the large intestine itself is affected energetically and not able to handle routine material. The organ itself is the problem rather than the material that the organ is managing. The difference between these two conditions can be illustrated by a person trying to lift a box who cannot do it. There are two possible reasons: either the person is too weak or the box is too heavy. If the downbeat is the problem, it indicates that the box is too heavy; if the upbeat is the problem, it indicates that the person trying to lift it is too weak. 

<H3>Floating (fu) &amp; Sinking (chen)</H3>

Floating and Sinking refer to the movement on the vertical axis of symmetry independent of the horizontal. The Floating pulse is found at the superficial level and the sinking pulse in the deep level. Generally, the Floating pulse indicates yang excessiveness due to wind or heat, and the Sinking pulse indicates yin excessiveness due to cold energy. Floating and Sinking refer primarily to the depth at which the pulse is found. Floating and Sinking can also refer to the direction the energy is moving along the vertical axis, even when found at different pulse depths or sectors. We may sense degrees of a Floating or Sinking state as a stronger yang of yang movement or yin of yin movement. 

<H3>Rapid (shuo) &amp; Slow (chi) </H3>
Rapid and Slow refer to movement alone the horizontal axis of symmetry 
and the speed of the pulse movement when compared to the patient's breathing. The normal or balanced pulse is four beats per breath. A Rapid pulse is more than 4 beats per breath. A Slow pulse is less than 2 beats per breath. A pulse can become Rapid due to a "deficiency of yin and an excess of yang" energy. The Slow pulse results from "a deficiency of yang and an excess of yin"(22). In general, the Slow pulse indicates cold energy and Rapid pulse indicates hot energy. If the pulse moves faster than 6 beats or slower than 2 it is an extremely critical sign, usually indicative of death; yang and yin no longer communicate with each other and are about to be cut. <P>

When the pulse is excessively fast, the energy will be cut at the chi position, move towards the cun, and finally dissappear. When the pulse is excessively slow, the energy will cut off at the cun position and move towards the chi and finally disappear. For these two examples simply compare the energy of someone who just came out of a sauna and is about to faint from the heat to someone who was exposed to freezing weather and is about to pass out. <P>

When the pulses are slow in comparison to the rate of breathing,we can say that the patient does not have sufficient yang energy or that his interior can be cold or damp. The Rapid pulse indicates that there is too much heat, that the condition is affecting the upper warmer, or that it is taking place at the surface. It could be excessiveness or it could be a condition caused by an attack of perverse energy, etc. Heat in the interior, for example near the bone, will be found in the deep level but will present a rapid movement. A slow movement at the superficial level indicates cold energy invading at the surface of the body. <P>

<H3>Big &amp; Small, Long (chang) &amp; Short (duan)</H3> 

Big and Small refer to the vertical dimension of the wave form, its amplitude. In general they indicate the amount of active qi available at a given moment. Long and Short refer to the horizontal dimension of the wave, its frequency. These pulses indicate the capacity of the related organs, and are often related to the hot and cold energy balance. Big and Long pulses indicate that the qi flow is greater than the blood flow, while the Small and Short pulses indicate that the blood flow is greater than the qi flow. <P>

The horizontal dimension of the pulse wave indicates what the capacity the wave form holds. Compare the vertical movement to voltage and the horizontal to wattage. So if it is Big and Long it means that the output is strong, but if it is Small and Short it means that the output is diminished but the movement can still last for an extended period of time. When the pulse is Small it means that it will not last because it does not have enough energy support to continue. Endurance or the capacity of a particular stress, that is how long it will last, depends on the horizontal movement. <P>

<H3>Slippery (hua) &amp; Choppy (se) </H3>

These two states describe specific textures of the pulse wave and not necessarily the shape itself. The previous pulse states show a yang/yin scale in specific dimensions, these two pulse states are a comparison between the qi and blood and illustrate the relationship of qi within the blood and the blood within the qi--similar to the portion of the Tai Chi symbol which shows yang within yin, and yin within yang. <P>

The Slippery pulse feels "round and smooth and flows evenly"(13). The sensation is like touching oil or wet and hard beads, it curves evenly up and then back down. In general it indicates dampness or that qi is deficient in comparison to blood. Li Shi Zhen comments (14) that a Slippery pulse can be created when yuan qi fails "and is unable to hold liver and kidney fire." Typically you can expect mucus secretion or, if it is the dominant character, a blockage to the blood flow with very low qi movement. You will commonly verify a mucus problem by looking at the spleen's relationship to the other involved organs. It can be found in women during pregnancy; and, if over forty, it will be evident in the menopause pattern. <P>

The Choppy pulse feels "thin, minute, and short and has an uneven flow, beating three and five times with an irregular rhythm." It is often described as feeling like touching very fine sandpaper or a "knife scraping bamboo"(15). 
In terms of our Tai Chi model, the horizontal movement of the qi is not supported by the yin energy. Like the knife, the momentum pushes forward but is carried in a jerky motion. In general, it feels very thin and irregular, making it sometimes difficult to flow. It indicates a dry condition, where qi is more abundant then blood. It can often be observed in anemic patients and in those recovering from surgery because of blood loss. <P>

<H3>Knotted (jie) </H3>
A Knotted pulse is an indication of excessive yin- -"whenever excessive perverse yin qi coagulates"(l6). A Knotting pulse does not always occur every pulsation and can appear irregularly. It indicates energy blockages, mucus blocks, moving clots, cysts, tumors, and even cancer. This pulse tends to hold the peak for a prolonged period of time and then drop, or hold the bottom and go up without a pronounced peak. <P>

As a general rule, we know that a deficiency of yin will lead to an excess of yang. If yin energy becomes deficient, the pulse will not be able to connect to the deep level. This will be compensated by the further growth of Yang energy or further strengthening of the upbeat. But since the yang movement cannot go beyond the top level, which is superficial, it will compensate by a build up intensity at that level. As the yin energy becomes more and more deficient, the strength of the yang upbeat will bud correspondingly, manifesting in a Knotted pulse with a pronounced peak. If the energy is Knotting in every pulsation, it is more serious and might indicate cancer. In this last case, it shows a severe loss of stability of the Tai Chi equilibrium. <P>

If this pulse shows up between two pulse waves as an independent movement, then it could be an early sign of cancer, even though it is not clearly Knotting in the organic wave. In some cancer movements, the pulse can be felt to rise and actually knot or vibrate in situ: without a descending movement. This Knotted state-- as well as others which we will look at later--is usually picked up in the top or bottom of each pulsation but they can occur in other levels of each wave as well. <P>

<LI> In clinic, the basic pulse should also be compared to different body types but we are limited in space and cannot do so here. Briefly, when looking at the basic wave analyze the ratio of qi and blood. You should expect the yang 
portion to be larger in thin and skinny people because a skinny person has a 
greater ratio of qi to body weight. If a very skinny person has the same size 
upbeat as downbeat, the downbeat is either too big or his qi is insufficient. In 
either case, there is an disparity in the energy balance their body should hold.

We are a group of health care practitioners and friends of women with cancer who have joined together to make complementary fonns of care available to women who ordinarily couldn't afford to pay for them and might not know about them. 
Complementary therapies such as acupuncture, herbs, homeopathy, visualization, hypnotherapy, massage and others MAY help: 

<UL><LI> Lessen your pain 
<LI> Improve your appetite 
<LI> Increase your energy 
<LI> Improve your sleep 
<LI> Help you decrease the side 
<LI> effects of chemo and radiation therapy 
<LI> Improve your general sense of wellbeing 
</UL>

<CENTER><H2>We treat people not diseases</H2></CENTER> 

The Charlotte Maxwell 
Complementary Clinic (CMCC) is named in memory of 
Charlotte Maxwell who died of ovarian cancer in 1988. Charlotte was committed to the idea of making complementary medicine available to people who would not normally have access to it. In the Bay Area alone there are over 40,000 women living with cancer. 
Cancer can be emotionally, physically, and financially devastating. Even if someone has health insurance, often it does not cover alternative care. 
We are a group of women volunteers who have diverse skills and experiences. We are community organizers; we are health care workers and health care advocates; we are lesbians and straight women. We are unified in our goal of offering complementary health care to women with cancer who are underserved. <P>


We do not believe women cause their own cancer. <P>


We do not know the cause of cancer but believe there are many factors involved, such as poverty, racism, and environmental poisons. <P>


We will do everything we can to prevent a woman from blaming herself for her cancer. <P>

 
We believe our function is to support women in their own treatment choices. <P>


We are committed to being open, non-judgmental and caring. <P>

We are respectful of differences, especially in regard to class, race, culture, body size, sexual preference and spiritual beliefs. <P>



We provide services for low 
income and poor women. Our services are designed to work along side those of a primary care physician. <P>


<H2>Overview of Services</H2>

<B>ACUPUNCTURE</B> is the insertion of very fine sterile needles at specific points of the body; we will be using disposable, pre-sterilized, stainless steel needles. Acupuncture should be fairly'P painless; most people relax or fall asleep during treatments. Acupuncture work: by balancing the body's own energy. If there are blockages in the body's flow of energy, this can cause pain. <P>


Acupuncture can help the energy more smoothly and therefore help relieve pain. If there is notenough energy somewhere, acupuncture can help increase the flow of energy to that area which helps the organ system work better. Often people using acupuncture will also take Chinese herbs, although both acupuncture and herbs may be used separately. <P>


<B>HOMEOPATHY</B> has been used since the 1800's. Homeopathic medicine stimulates a person's own healing processes. we take a detailed history looking for symptoms that are specific to you - Physical, emotional and mental.  We will then give you a homeopathic remedy that helps your body eliminate these symptoms and be stronger. <P>


The <B>MASSAGE</B> we offer is light touch massage, acupressure and reflexology.  All are done very lightly and gently.  Massage can help you relax and improve your energy level. By increasing blood circulation, massage enables the body to receive more nourishment and improve its functioning. <P>


<B>VISUALIZATION</B> is another powerful healing tool. A person has incredible abilities to help heal themselves. We will lead you through a total body relaxation and help you picture your immune system improving so that you can more effectively fight cancer. <P>

Studies have shown that one of the things visualization can do is increase a person's white blood cell count, which helps your body fight diseases. <P>


<B>HYPNOTHERAPY</B> uses deep relaxation techniques. The process is client controlled, non-threatening and assists one to be able to release stress and emotional trauma, control pain, change attitudes, reprogram old patterns and experience behavior change.  If you are coming for acupuncture, you will have a 1 hour appointment weekly. <P>

After every 12 week course of treatment, we will reevaluate whether to continue treatments. If you can't come you need to let us know in advance. If you miss 2 appointments we may stop treating you unless the appointments were missed because you were too sick to come. You will work with a team of 4 acupuncturists. Some may prescribe herbs which we will provide at low or no cost. Massage will be offered weekly and Pisualiration and hypnotherapy will be offered twice a month. If you are doing homeopathy you need only come monthly. <P>


<B>Can I bring other people with me?</B> Yes. <BR>

There is often so much information that it is hard to remember everything. Some people like to bring a friend to take notes or to remember to ask questions. If you are getting a massage or acupuncture you'll want quiet to relax into the treatment. Our goal is to teach you techniques that you can use at home to help you feel better and help ease the stress of having cancer. We will try to always provide childcare. Please let us know in advance if you will need it. <P>


We are open to your comments, your praise and your criticism. We hope this will be a healing space for all of us. We have a part-time paid coordinator. The rest of us are volunteers. Please come use our services and feel free to call. If you call during clinic time on Saturdays from 10am to 2 pm, someone can talk with you directly. <P>

The Five Wheels

<BR>
</FONT>

<HR>


One of the ancient doctrines on ophthalmology divided the eye into five portions in accordance with the five solid (Yin) organs.<P>
<Center>
These portions are the five wheels.<P>
The wheel of flesh=Spleen<br>
The wheel of blood=Heart<br>
The wheel of Qi=Lung <br>
The wheel of wind=Liver<br>
The wheel of water=Kidney<P>


<IMG SRC="Eyes.gif" ALT="This is the image of the eyes, explaining where to look for diagnostic purposes.  This image is essential to understand this page." ALIGN=MIDDLE>
</center><P>

Any colors inappropriate to the normal color of the area would suggest a pathology.  I believe that the iris is associated with the Liver organ because it is generally associated with the color green.  Obviously, the fact that our African model's iris is brown does not suggest any pathology.<P>

It is interesting to note that even with the wide varieties of colors represented by different races, there is still a superficial color that can arise atop the "host" color which, would then be useful for diagnostic purposes.<P>

Although photographs are often imperfect in their representation, this one may suggest that there is a slight condition of heat in this model's lungs due to the red color appearing in the whites of her eyes.<P>

In fact, this model is a teen aged girl from rural Africa.  It may follow then, that she is suffering from a wind-heat condition associated with her environment.<P>

Had there been bags beneath her eyes, we might look to the Spleen for a pattern of disharmony.  If the bags were dark blue, the origin of the Spleen problem might be found in the Kidneys, for the color associated with the Kidneys in five-element theory is blue and black.  If the bags were blue-green we would likely find that the Spleen disharmony has its root in both the Kidneys and Liver whose color is green.<P>

There are some ethnic considerations that need to be made.  Actually, I've noticed only one.  There are some patients of Italian origin, those with a dark olive complexion, who tend to have dark rings below their eyes even though there is no disharmony associated with the Spleen or Kidney.<P>

<H1>Color in Diagnosis</H1>


People's complexions are different because their physical constitutions are different. Even for the same person, the complexion constantly changes according to the fluctuation of the emotions and the difference in the state of health. The complexion turns bluish when extremely angry, reddish when happy, blackish when fearful, whitish when worrying and yellowish when overthinking. The proverbs that say, "The face is turning like black ink" and "The face is becoming black and blue" imply sudden emotional changes such as fear, shock or rage. The face of a teenager coming out after being interrogated for charges of theft is whitish and the face of a student coming out of an examination hall is yellowish. Also, a person who thinks too much usually has digestive problems and a person with digestive problems has a yellowish complexion. A person who laughs a lot has vigorous activity of the Heart and a reddish complexion and a person who worries a lot sighs constantly and has a whitish complexion. Accordingly, the conditions of the internal organs can be observed with the colors that show on the surface of the body. These colors are not just manifested on the face, but there are also differences in the pigment of feces, urine, menstrual blood, vaginal discharge, tongue coating, lips, eyes, phlegm, etc. <P>



<H3>Color and its related organ</H3>
	Red is related to the Heart, white to the Lungs, yellow to the Spleen, blue/green to the Liver and black to the Kidneys.<P>




<OL TYPE=A>
<LI><H4>Red and the Heart</H4>
	Red is the color of the Fire Element, so red light is a light that is related to the Heart. A face turns reddish when the activity of the Heart is exuberant, thus joyful emotion, fever or even drinking alcoholic beverages turns the face reddish. All of them definitely arise from the exuberant activity of the Heart. However, the health of the Heart should not be inferred from the appearance of the color red. There are both healthy and unhealthy shades of red. Red is the color with the longest wavelength so it is a Yang color. In bull fighting, shaking a red object in front of the bull's eyes makes him even more fierce. In cardiac edema, the face color becomes reddish purple or brownish. <P>


<LI><H4>White and the Lungs</H4>
	White is a color related to the Lungs. A person who worries a lot constantly sighs and has a whitish complexion. Also, a person with constitutionally weak Lungs generally has a whitish complexion. This person can maintain his or her health as long as he or she does not get a reddish glow. However, if he or she does get a reddish glow, like the color of a peach blossom, it is an indication that a lung disease is in progress. A person who has a white complexion with luster is magnanimous with profound thoughts, so there are many who have the character of a big time politician - the so-called noble type - with this complexion. <P>


<LI><H4>Yellow and the Spleen</H4>
	Yellow is the color of the Earth Element, so the Spleen and the Stomach are like the Earth. The Spleen produces Blood and the Stomach ingests nutrients in order to produce the flesh, similar to the Earth nurturing all things in nature. A person with strong digestive organs has a yellowish complexion with luster and a person with a disease of the digestive organs has a sallow complexion and is emaciated, fatigued or has a diseased color that is hard to describe with words.<P>


<LI><H4>Blue and the Liver</H4>
	A red color is due to the congestion of arterial blood. As the result of strong heart activity, a large amount of arterial blood flows too quickly and the duration in which the blood is in contact with the tissues is too short. Accordingly, a fresh red color shows up because there are large quantities of oxygen within the blood since a small amount of oxygen is transferred to the tissues. A blue color occurs as a result of the stagnation of venous blood in the tissues (or dark purplish or blackish color). The stagnation of venous blood is a phenomenon that appears when the activity of the heart is weak. The organ that regulates the activity of the Heart is the Liver. Perhaps the liver secretes a blue colored substance. <P>

	Blue is a color with a short wavelength so it settles and calms. One gets excited when looking at the color red, but settles down when looking at the color blue. Having transcendental or sentimental feelings without particular reasons when looking at blue/green mountains or going into the forest is largely due to receiving the influence of that color. It is said that shaking a blue cloth in front of fierce cattle and in front of a horse calms them down. <P>

	What is the necessity of the Liver to manifest the color blue? It can be explained by the following reasons. The color blue is a light that settles and calms, thus impeding activities. Recall that the Liver is an organ in charge of combat and a motive for combat is anger. As such, the emotion of anger belongs to the Liver and in times of anger the color blue appears. The color blue has two functions that are needed in combat. One is to internally curtail the activity of the Heart. In other words, it saves and accumulates energy then lets it out forcefully all at once in order to fight fiercely. Another is to show the color blue externally toward an opponent to settle and suppress his activity and at the same time to give him feelings of fear. This is why a person who normally has a bluish complexion becomes highly sensitive, angers easily and often has indigestion. This indigestion arises from the opposing relationship between Liver and Spleen, that is Wood and Earth. <P>


<LI><H4>Black and the Kidneys</H4>
	Black is the color of Water and Yin-Coldness. Also, nighttime is dark. The com-plexion becomes dark when one is cold and also when one is feeling great fear. A person who normally has a black complexion, like a frightened person, is very weak sexually and has little courage. A healthy person with a black complexion is said in a proverb to have "Iron black color," so he is extremely strong sexually and has boundless energy. The color of the skin changes as a sign of pregnancy and there is a black color like freckles and blotches on the forehead, on the bridge of the nose, around the eyes, around the mouth, etc. In the center line of the abdominal wall, namely the "Conception channel,"13 a colored pigment settles in which is black and a dark brown color settles in the external genital region and vagina.<P>

	In general, the black color can be seen in Basedow's disease, which is seen as the result of hyperthyroidism or in acromegaly (a disease with the enlargement of nose, mandible, ends of extremities and the whole body), which is seen as the result of the hyperfunction of the frontal lobe of the pituitary gland. The relationship of black to the Kidneys can be recognized if a certain amount of attention is paid. Edema due to a kidney disease can be distinguished by the complexion being a dark white color, as opposed to a reddish purple color of edema due to heart disease. The color white belongs to the Lungs and dark color belongs to the Kidneys, so the Lungs and Kidneys are: "Metal and Water Zang organs of mutual generation."<P>
</OL>


<H3>Healthy color and unhealthy color (techniques of observing color)</H3>

	It is extremely difficult to explain this healthy and unhealthy color in words. There is no other way than to train the power of observation by paying attention to the color of the complexion of as many people as possible. It is the same as the teller of a bank being able to easily discern counterfeit notes but not being able to explain their method of discovery to anyone else. There will be no other words than merely, "somehow it feels different." The colors of the complexions of people are difficult to explain, but there is something on which to judge whether it is healthy or unhealthy by observation. This judgement of health and sickness on the basis of color has great importance in Oriental medicine: "Observing the shape and watching the color"14 reflects this. In reality, "Observing the shape and watching the color" is not only necessary in Oriental medicine, but also in Western medicine and in observing the emotions of other people in our daily lives. It is hard to avoid getting blamed for being ambiguous regarding this observation of color, but I am going to state a few essential points.<P>

<H3>Method of observing color</H3>

<OL TYPE=A>
<LI><H4>Presence of Qi; Absence of Qi; Presence of Spirit; Absence of Spirit</H4>
	When observing the complexion of a person, one must be careful about the existence or absence of Qi and Spirit. In everyday conversation, terms such as "Color of Qi looks bad" or "Color of the Spirit is good" are frequently used. "Qi" and "Spirit" are abstract expressions of the movement of life which we can sense. When they are further differen-tiated, Qi is an abstract expression of the emotion and Spirit is an abstract expression of the life force or the state of health. The "color of Qi not being so good" means that there is emotional trouble and the "color of Spirit not being so good" implies that it looks as though there is a disease. <P>

	Complexion, regardless of the type of its color, must have vitality. As long as there is vitality, the color of Spirit will be good even if one is emaciated and as long as there is no vitality, the color of Spirit will be bad even if one is plump. A person has a particular complexion according to individual characteristics and that complexion changes according to living conditions. A farmer who constantly gets sunlight has dark skin and a scholar who constantly studies indoors has fair skin. However, receiving the same degree of sunlight still results in all different complexions and studying indoors in the same degree also results in different complexions; these are all due to individual characteristics. The skin is a healthy color especially when there is vitality. When there is vitality in a reddish complexion, the Heart is strong and when there is no vitality, the Heart has become fatigued by excessive activity. <P>


		Presence of Spirit - 	Exuberant Heart Qi
1. Red color 
		Absence of Spirit - 	Decline in Heart Qi

		Presence of Spirit - 	Exuberant Lung Qi
2. White color
		Absence of Spirit - 	Decline in Lung Qi

		Presence of Spirit - 	Exuberant Spleen Qi
3. Yellow color
		Absence of Spirit - 	Decline in Spleen Qi

		Presence of Spirit - 	Exuberant Liver Qi
4. Blue color 
		Absence of Spirit - 	Decline in Liver Qi

		Presence of Spirit - 	Exuberant Kidney Qi
5. Black color 
		Absence of Spirit - 	Decline in Kidney Qi
<P>
<LI><H4>Mutual Generating and Controlling Cycles in Complex Colors</H4>
	The color of a person's complexion does not simply appear in one color among the five colors, but the five colors appear in small amounts, thus a so-called red or blue implies the strongest color among them. Accordingly, to observe color in practice is extraordinarily complicated, but it is generally enough to diagnose health or illness entirely through the presence or absence of vitality. Yet there are times when only one type of color shows up strongly or at times two, three, four or five types of colors appear strongly, all individually following the channels. When all five colors appear together, it is a sign that the time of death is drawing near. A color of an autumn leaf showing up on the complexion of a sick person is said to be inauspicious because an autumn leaf has red, yellow, blue, white and black colors.<P>
 
	When many colors are combined, observation under the following standards will generally be very helpful: <P>

<OL>
<LI>The colors of Zang organs in a mutual generating relationship are good. For example, a combination of yellow and white (Earth generates Metal), white and black (Metal generates Water), black and blue (Water generates Wood), blue and red (Wood generates Fire), and red and yellow (Fire generates Earth) reflect no problems in general.
<LI>When the colors of Zang organs in the mutual controlling relationship are combined, it is generally unhealthy. For example: <P>

<OL TYPE=a>

<LI><B>Red and White (Fire controls Metal)</B><BR>
Since this is a color of peach-blossoms, it is the most brilliant color, but it is an extremely bad color when observed from the point of view of health and longevity. This color shows up mostly among patients under 30 years old with a lung disease. The following statements illustrate why this color is unhealthy: "A young man with brilliance, easily acquiring wealth and fame, is a sign of early withering," "A young man with a blossomed flower complexion dies young" and "Men of talent and beauty all die young." <P>

<LI><B>White and Blue (Metal controls Wood)</B><BR>

	This means having a bluish pale complexion. It is a color commonly seen in older women who were widowed at a young age. This is the complexion of a person weakened by a long time of continued strong resentment (Liver) and grief (Lung). Yin-type lung disease patients generally possess this complexion.<P>

<LI><B>Blue and Yellow (Wood controls Earth)</B><BR>

	A green color results when these two colors are combined; jaundice seems to belong here. Other than the green color in the pigment of bile, I have not been able to find examples to clearly explain this color, but I believe that this complexion will be found if many patients are observed. <P>

<LI><B>Yellow and Black (Earth controls Water)</B><BR>

	This color can be seen frequently in chronic diseases of the stomach, especially in gastric atony.<P>

<LI><B>Black and Red (Water controls Fire)</B><BR>

	This complexion has a black color with a red flush, so it seems to look slightly excited: A patient with a lung disease who had a strong constitution prior to the disease generally has such a complexion. <P>
</OL></OL></OL>

	At this point, I would like to caution my readers that these examples must not be over interpreted and presumed as facts. Just because a lung disease patient has the color of (e) above, one must not come to a hasty conclusion that a person having this color has a lung disease. A person with a weak body, searching through the pages of a pathology and symptomatology book, can easily believe that they are suffering from each disease in the book. One should not look at the mirror while reading this and say, "black and red color, blue and yellow color - oh no! I have this disease." <P>

	There are mirrors which have a yellow, blue or white tinge, so there are no correct mirrors. Colors look different depending on their relationship to surrounding light rays. There are also some people who have a slight defect in the optic nerves and there also exists a relationship between visual perception and the emotional activity of the moment. There is no need to foolishly be afraid just because something looks a certain way at a quick glance. Therefore, since there is a concern that the main point will be missed in ascertaining the constitution and disease with the observation of color only, the signs and symptoms of Yin-Yang should be observed through other methods including: pulse diagnosis, channels, observation of color, food preferences, Deficiency-Excess, Exterior- Interior, Above-Below, etc.<P>

<p>&#160;The National Security Agency (NSA) was founded in 1952 by President Truman. As a separately 
organized agency within the Department of Defense, NSA plans, coordinates, directs, and performs 
signals intelligence and information security functions in support of both Defense and non-Defense US 
Government activities. NSA was designated a Combat Support Agency in 1988 by the Secretary of 
Defense in response to the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act. </p>

<p>The CIA is chartered to consolidate intelligence data from all the intelligence agencies of the U.S. government and prepare 
regular reports on this data. Various direcorates of the CIA provide both covert and overt collection capabilities as well, with 
the least visible of these directorates being the Operations Directorate which conducts all field activities. The CIA is prohibited 
by law from practicing its arts within the confines of the U.S., except under very special conditions...mainly when tracking 
agents movements from outside the country to the inside. In this case, the CIA must involve the FBI which is responsible for 
Counter-Intelligence. Historically, the CIA has also been tasked with management of overhead intelligence gathering 
(TECHINT).</p>

<br>
The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) is the single, national program to meet US government needs through 
spaceborne reconnaissance. The NRO is an agency of the Department of Defense and receives its budget through that portion 
of the National Foreign Intelligence Program (NFIP) known as the National Reconnaissance Program (NRP), which is 
approved by both the Secretary of Defense and the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). The existence of the NRO was 
declassified by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, as recommended by the Director of Central Intelligence, on September 18, 
1992. </p>
<p>The mission of the NRO is to ensure that the US has the technology and spaceborne assets needed to acquire intelligence 
worldwide. This mission is accomplished through research, development, acquisition, and operation of the nation's intelligence 
satellites. The NRO's assets collect intelligence to support such functions as indications and warning, monitoring of arms 
control agreements, military operations and exercises, and monitoring of natural disasters and other environmental issues. </p>
<p><br>
The Director of the NRO is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Congress as the Assistant Secretary of the Air<br>
Force for Space. The Secretary of Defense has the responsibility, which is exercised in concert with the Director of Central<br>
Intelligence, for the management and operation of the NRO. The DCI establishes the collection priorities and requirements for<br>
the collection of satellite data. The NRO is staffed by personnel from CIA, the military services, and civilian Department of<br>
Defense personnel. <br>

<h1>The Central Imagery Office</h1>
<p>The Central Imagery Office (CIO) was established in 1992 by the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and the Secretary of 
Defense. It is a joint Intelligence Community-Department of Defense activity organized as a separate agency within the 
Department of Defense and designated as a Combat Support Agency. </p>
<p>The mission of CIO is to ensure responsive imagery support to the Intelligence Community, the Department of Defense, the 
National Security Council, and other US Government departments and agencies. As a Combat Support Agency, CIO is also 
responsible for ensuring timely imagery support to military operations during peace, crisis, and war. </p>
<p>Imagery includes all products of reconnaissance that provide a likeness of any natural or manmade features or related 
objectives or activities. This imagery can be acquired by satellites, airborne platforms, remotely piloted vehicles, or other 
means of sensing the visual or any other segment of the electromagnetic spectrum by sensors, including but not limited to 
panchromatic, multispectral, infrared, and radar. </p>
<p>CIO develops, recommends, and implements policy; formulates guidance and standards for training personnel; and manages 
requirements related to the tasking, collection, processing, exploitation, and dissemination of imagery. CIO also develops and 
implements imagery standards and architectures to foster the interoperability of equipment associated with systems controlled 
separately within the Intelligence Community and the Department of Defense, ensuring that these standards and architectures 
are consistent with programs conducted by civil organizations that use imagery from national collection systems. CIO provides 
centralized functional management of the Consolidated Imagery Program, the Tactical Imagery Program, and all appropriate 
research and development activities related to imagery collection, processing, exploitation, and dissemination. </p>
<p>As the central imagery tasking authority, CIO tasks national imagery collection assets of the Intelligence Community and the 
Department of Defense in accordance with intelligence requirements established by the DCI in peacetime, and the Secretary 
of Defense in wartime. CIO also provides advisory collection tasking to theater and tactical imagery collection assets not 
allocated to meet national requirements. </p>
<p>Since its creation, CIO has promoted improved interaction and a new relationship between imagery producers and users 
through an integrated US Imagery System. This system emphasizes full integration of imagery capabilities, including national, 
theater, tactical, and civil imaging resources. It addresses the full imagery cycle--tasking, collection, processing, exploitation, 
production, and delivery--in all situations from peace through crisis to open conflict, aiming to deliver imagery when, where, 
and how it is needed. </p>

<h1>Department of State</h1>
<h1>Bureau of Intelligence and Research</h1>
<p>The Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) is the State Department's primary source for interpretive analysis of global 
developments. INR was established in 1946 to provide the Secretary of State with timely, objective assessments, free of 
policy prescription or preferences. INR's mandate is to tell policymakers what they need to know, not what they want to hear. 
INR is also the focal point within the State Department for all policy issues and activities involving the Intelligence Community. 
The INR Assistant Secretary reports directly to the Secretary of State and serves as the Secretary's principal advisor for all 
intelligence matters. </p>
<p>In providing the Secretary and other key decisionmakers with expert, independent foreign affairs analysis, INR draws on 
all-source intelligence, diplomatic reporting, and interaction with US and foreign scholars. INR responds rapidly to policy 
priorities, providing early warning and in-depth analysis of events and trends that affect US foreign policy and national security 
interests. INR's analyses are not subject to approval by other parts of the Department or to formal coordination with other 
components of the Intelligence Community. INR contributes to Community analyses such as National Intelligence Estimates, 
with a particular eye to relevance to policy needs. </p>
<p>INR focuses on issues bearing on US national security, economic well-being, and promotion of democracy, including: reform 
and stability in Russia and other former communist states; economic challenges from competitors; evolving trade relationships; 
global issues such as the environment, human rights, terrorism, weapons and military technology proliferation, and 
peacekeeping; international organizations and agreements; and conflict zones, including the Balkans, Africa, the Middle East, 
and the Korean peninsula. </p>
<p>In support of the statutory authority of the Secretary of State and Chiefs of Mission for the conduct of foreign policy and 
oversight of all US Government activities overseas--including agencies like CIA, NSA, FBI, DEA, and Justice--INR 
coordinates the handling of issues that arise in the course of intelligence, security, counterintelligence, investigative, and special 
operations. INR sits on the National Counterintelligence Policy Board, and works with the Bureau of Diplomatic Security on 
matters concerning security and security countermeasures. INR also coordinates with the national security community on visa 
denials, intelligence sharing, and requirements and evaluation for collection in all intelligence disciplines. </p>
<p>Finally, INR develops intelligence policy for the Department of State, ensuring that intelligence activities abroad are in 
harmony with US policy and that collection resources and priorities are in accord with US diplomatic interests and 
requirements. </p>

<h1>The Treasury Department <br>
Office of Intelligence Support </h1>
<p>The Office of Intelligence Support was established in 1977 during the tenure of Treasury Secretary Blumenthal. It succeeded 
the Office of National Security (ONS), which was set up in 1961 under Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon to connect 
Treasury with the work of the National Security Council. ONS's representation of Treasury with the Intelligence Community 
began under a Presidential Memorandum in 1971 during the tenure of Treasury Secretary William E. Simon. In 1972, in 
response to the Murphy Commission Report to the Congress, which stressed the importance of strong links between the 
Intelligence Community and officials responsible for international economic policy, Treasury became a member of the National 
Foreign Intelligence Board. Today, Executive Order 12333 lists the Special Assistant to the Secretary (National Security) as 
a senior intelligence officer of the Intelligence Community. </p>
<p>The Special Assistant and his staff support the Secretary of the Treasury in his roles as chief economic and financial adviser to 
the President, head of the second largest law enforcement department in the federal government, and the official responsible 
for the integrity of the country's currency. As the focal point on intelligence matters for the Department and Community 
agencies, the Special Assistant represents the Treasury Department and maintains continuous liaison with other elements of the 
Intelligence Community. He reviews all proposed support relationships between Community components and Treasury offices 
and bureaus. </p>
<p>Under the Special Assistant's direction, the Office of Intelligence Support (OIS) is responsible for providing timely, relevant 
intelligence to the Secretary and other Treasury Department officials. To carry out its mission, the Office of Intelligence 
Support has three main functions: 1) it alerts the Secretary and other officials to fast-breaking events, foreign and domestic; 2) 
it obtains intelligence reports and products for Treasury officials; and 3) it oversees the intelligence needs of Treasury's offices 
and bureaus. In addition, the Office participates in the preparation of National Intelligence Estimates and other 
Community-wide intelligence products, developing and coordinating Treasury Department contributions. OIS officers also sit 
as Treasury members and advisors on designated national intelligence committees and subcommittees. </p>

<p align=left><strong>Possible locations of classified military facilities</strong><br>
<br>
by Paul McGinnis<br>
<br>
I've been thinking about an interesting question lately -- are there other places that are as classified as the secret U.S. Air<br>
Force air base at Groom Lake, Nevada, and, if so, how would someone know where to start looking for such a place? <br>
<br>
A way of finding classified areas occurred to me while studying Defense Mapping Agency aeronautical charts. On a floor, I<br>
had pieced together 3 very large Tactical Pilot Charts (TPC G-18R, TPC G-19C, and TPC G-19D) By folding parts of the<br>
charts and aligning them together, I had managed to create a giant map showing the airspace over Southern California and<br>
Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and a little part of Texas. <br>
<br>
Looking at all the blue &quot;boxes&quot; used by our military for Restricted airspaces and Military Operating Areas (MOAs), I realized<br>
that I could find areas to study further by finding &quot;boxes&quot; similar to the one covering the air space around the Groom Lake<br>
facility. Hundreds of military controlled zones are listed in the DMA publication Area Planning-Special Use Airspace. These<br>
are published once a year, with 2 supplements. I happen to subscribe to the Special Use Airspace publication for North and<br>
South America (DMA item number AP/1A). The most recent edition is dated October 13, 1994. (Defense Mapping Agency<br>
sources are listed at the end of this report.) <br>
<br>
I came up with some criteria that could be used in the search. I admit that these are arbitrary choices, but they allow one to<br>
discard most of the &quot;boxes&quot;, thus narrowing the choices. My criteria are: <br>
(1) The area must have a ceiling of at least 60,000 feet (18.46 km) to prevent civilian aircraft from flying over the area. Also,<br>
this would tend to discourage military pilots who might get curious and try to fly above the prohibited area. (There are very 
few<br>
aircraft that can fly this high.) The area over Groom Lake has an unlimited ceiling, although one wonders how low orbiting<br>
satellites can be stopped from passing over the area.<br>
(2) The area must have a constant flying restriction, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This eliminates a number of potential 
areas<br>
because flying is only prohibited by advance notice (NOTAMS), or during daytime hours on weekdays. <br>
<br>
This gave me the following list of potential classified areas of interest to the U.S. military. While I realize that some of these<br>
areas have flying restrictions because missiles are fired in these ranges, that still leaves other locations that need further<br>
research. Also, some of these areas are quite large. For example, R-5107B in New Mexico covers an area of approximately<br>
4,500 square miles (11,520 square km.) although there may only be one highly classified activity in the &quot;box&quot;. <br>

<p>From: clarkbr@spot.Colorado.EDU (CLARK BRIAN R)<br>
Subject: Gov't Secrecy<br>
Date: 19 Aug 1994 19:06:23 GMT<br>
<br>
The following file of excepts of testimony by Daniel Ellsberg to the US<br>
Senate in 1973 gives an insider's perspective on government secrecy. I<br>
hope that readers find this of interest.<br>
<br>
*** Begin Included text ***<br>
<br>
Daniel Ellsberg was a high foreign policy official and one who publicly<br>
challenged government policy on secrecy. He testified before the Joint<br>
Senate Hearings held on May 17, 1973 by the Committees on the Judiciary<br>
and Government Operations. Ellsberg spoke of the manner in which the<br>
classification system is used, the hierarchy of security clearances,<br>
and the effect that &quot;privileged information has upon the minds of those<br>
who share in its access.<br>
<br>
Material listed here is from FAIN, ET AL., THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY<br>
since this was Congressional testimony, references to Ellsberg's remarks<br>
can also be found in the appropriate transcript(s) of Congressional<br>
testimony given on that date.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have really been dismayed to discover how quickly to the minds of<br>
Americans come questions that reveal their fear of openness.<br>
<br>
The risks of no secrecy are the risks of democracy.<br>
<br>
The question is: Are the Bill of Rights, and the constitutional checks and<br>
balances obsolete in the 20th century?<br>
<br>
Have nuclear bombs made it impossible for an American Government to be open<br>
to its own people, as so few governments in the world are today?<br>
<br>
What are the costs and risks of executive secrecy, however beneficial it<br>
might be?<br>
<br>
...I believe that the price of executive secrecy...spell[s] the subversion<br>
of our form of government.<br>
<br>
The fact is that our Constitution was written in a spirit of cynicism,<br>
suspicion and distrust, and every clause reflects those attitudes, every<br>
clause reflects the attitudes that humans in authority and power cannot be<br>
trusted to become angels by virtue of their office; cannot be trusted at<br>
all, as a matter of fact, and need to be set watching each other.<br>
p.503<br>
<br>
<br>
In particular, I speak not as a lawyer, but as someone who has had a very<br>
expensive education in the law of secrecy over the last five months and<br>
before that as someone who had an expensive education in the practice and<br>
attitudes of secrecy, who lived in the world of secrets for 12 years<br>
before that, a period when I certainly did not know much of the law of the<br>
Constitution because I worked for the executive branch. I worked for the<br>
President and thus THOUGHT I WAS BEYOND THE LAW, LIKE ALL OTHER EXECUTIVE<br>
SERVANTS. [EMPHASIS ADDED AB]<br>
<br>
The Pentagon Papers...revealed to me, above all, a conspiratorial style in<br>
executive decisionmaking, a style that I was part of in the 12 years that<br>
I have worked with it.<br>
<br>
Why have our executive officials been led to act as if they are members of<br>
a conspiracy? Because I think that does describe it.<br>
<br>
I repeat and will repeat it again, I am sure, what we are seeing in<br>
Watergate is the same attitudes, the same style, the same conspiratorial<br>
attitude we have used for generations to subvert self-determination in<br>
other countries in the world.<br>
p.504<br>
<br>
<br>
Perhaps I could cut through it best by just relating to you some advice I<br>
gave to a man who entered Government 4 years ago, and I might as well name<br>
him -- Henry Kissinger -- someone I had known academically or professionally<br>
for 10 years.<br>
<br>
It seemed to me it was appropriate to pass on some thoughts to him in<br>
advance and perhaps inoculate him against the transformation that I<br>
feared was going to come over this person.<br>
<br>
It was appropriate to do it to this person because I felt he was going to<br>
be initiated into the most esoteric and sinister parts of this system.<br>
<br>
He was not only going to have a top secret but perhaps a SCORE OR TWO SCORE,<br>
for all I know, OF THE CLEARANCES HIGHER THAN TOP SECRET [emphasis added AB]<br>
of which I had held an even dozen when I worked as special assistant to the<br>
Assistant Secretary of Defense.<br>
<br>
...in December of 1968 in the Hotel Pierre...I said to him, 'You are about<br>
to get 10,15, or 20 clearances of a sort that you never knew existed. Their<br>
very names are classified.'<br>
<br>
Code words that identify them on pieces of paper are classified. They are<br>
referred to by the first letters of their codewords; [cf. MAJIC material<br>
and Cooper material e.g. TS: ORCON etc.] they are never to be photographed.<br>
<br>
That applies only to the lowest of these clearances to which I refer.<br>
<br>
Secretary McNamara had at least a few more. I wouldn't suggest how many<br>
each person had in the Defense Dept. Persons in the White House could have<br>
many more in the NSA and CIA and many places I didn't deal with.<br>
p.505<br>
<br>
<br>
[Ellsberg talked to Kissinger about the latter's book NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND<br>
FOREIGN POLICY and said to HK:]' You will feel like a fool for having<br>
written all that without having this special information on which to<br>
judge....But that feeling will only last for a week or two, because<br>
after a week or so of having four star generals bring you in special brief<br>
cases, special pouches, books that are available only to you and your boss<br>
and a few other people...and certainly not to members of the public, you<br>
will forget that you were once a fool and remember only that everyone else<br>
is a fool who does not have this information.<br>
<br>
Moreover, in signing agreements to have this information, you will come to<br>
understand that the only way of keeping secrets this well IS TO LIE.'<br>
[EMPHASIS ADDED AB]<br>
<br>
A contract to observe these clearances, and these are essentially contractual<br>
agreements in the executive branch, conditions of employment, IS A CONTRACT<br>
TO LIE; [emphasis added AB]<br>
<br>
When I say lie, on the first hand, if you are asked if you have this<br>
clearance, you are not allowed to say, no comment. [see p.65 WISE/LYING]<br>
YOUR DUTY IS TO LIE AND SAY YOU DO NOT HAVE IT [EMPHASIS ADDED AB]<br>
<br>
If you are asked about the contents, YOU ARE TO LIE and say you know<br>
nothing about the contents [EMPHASIS ADDED AB]<br>
<br>
If you are asked whether you have aparticular piece of information, YOU<br>
MUST LIE and say you do not. [EMPHASIS ADDED AB]<br>
<br>
The effect of that is that you will HAVE TO LIE and will succeed in lying<br>
and you will FOOL YOUR FORMER ACADEMIC COLLEAGUES.[EMPHASIS ADDED AB Cf.<br>
material relating to Menzel being/not being a member of MJ12. Also see<br>
material below from p.508] You will discover, in collaboration with<br>
thousands of other executive officials all telling the same cover story,<br>
that it is easy to fool people.<br>
<br>
And that is what the President learns.<br>
<br>
In fact if I have learned one thing in 5 months in court, it is TO RESPECT<br>
THE WISDOM OF ALLOWING 12 ORDINARY CITIZENS TO BE THE JUDGES OF TRUTH OR<br>
HONESTY on the witness stand. I believe they are shrewd an extremely<br>
effective weighers of lying on that stand....<br>
<br>
But you will find if any of you go into the executive branch, you will<br>
discover that given the benefit of the doubt that accrues to the President<br>
or anyone who works for him, it is easy to fool people. THERE REALLY ARE<br>
SECRETS AND THEY ARE VERY WELL KEPT. [EMPHASIS ADDED AB]<br>
<br>
The notion that everything comes out in the NEW YORK TIMES is untrue. It<br>
is a cover story meant to keep people from prying too closely.<br>
<br>
You will learn as Kissinger would, as I told him, you will learn there are<br>
secrets that are very well kept, that people can, in effect be easily<br>
fooled if you work for the President....<br>
p.506<br>
<br>
<br>
The security system is an education in contempt for law, because you cannot<br>
be held accountable to law, at least we used to think we could not....<br>
<br>
You are then beyond the law if you do the President's wishes, and the<br>
President is thought to be beyond the law. [cf also ch.5 of WISE/LYING &quot;The<br>
President is Sort of outside the Law&quot; AB]<br>
<br>
Moreover, you cannot be accountable to Justice or even the public if the<br>
secrets of your advice and your actions are bound to be well kept.<br>
<br>
You are safe from accountability. Contempt follows for the public that is<br>
so easily fooled, and that contempt is the death in that individual for the<br>
democratic spirit.<br>
<br>
Indeed, we cannot, our democracy cannot be served or guarded by people<br>
whose core belief is contempt for the democratic process and for the<br>
citizens who elect them and to whom they supposedly are responsible.<br>
<br>
This was the image in my mind on the effects of secrets on a high level<br>
official; not the low level because MERE TOP SECRETS [emphasis added AB]<br>
don't have this effect, they are so low, so close to what you read in the<br>
NEW YORK TIMES....<br>
<br>
So you live in a different world of information. You come to think of<br>
yourself as a resident of a different world with different powers and<br>
responsibilities.<br>
<br>
As I say, I thought of that access like the potion that Circe gave Ulysses'<br>
men that turned men into swine, and made fools of them.<br>
p.507<br>
<br>
<br>
The secrets are kept not only by this conspiratorial type of honor among<br>
thieves, but by the entire apparatus of conspiracy and that is the last<br>
point I want to touch on here.<br>
<br>
I am saying, I have to reiterate, THE SECRETS ARE BETTER KEPT THAN YOU<br>
KNOW. [EMPHASIS ADDED AB].<br>
<br>
I have NEVER [EMPHASIS ADDED AB] met in 12 years a newspaperman...who could<br>
imagine how often and how easily he WAS LIED TO [emphasis added AB] by my<br>
bosses.<br>
<br>
In the field of foreign affairs we have come to expect this from the<br>
President; it is his job and we don't need to know.<br>
<br>
The President shares that belief: That the public does not need to know and<br>
cannot be trusted with the information -- the two requirements of sharing<br>
information with him, in the regulations.<br>
<br>
...they have...an apparatus to keep these secrets EVEN FROM THEIR OWN<br>
SECRETARIES...OR THEIR OWN DEPUTIES OR W I V E S, people who work<br>
closely with them. p.508<br>
<br>
If you had worked all your life with top secret material in the Pentagon for<br>
Assistant Secretaries, unless you were one of the elect, you would not be<br>
aware that there are entire rooms in the Pentagon with safe doors outside,<br>
with a guardian, with a computer list up to date hourly and daily as to<br>
who is admitted in that room, and unless you know the codeword and are on<br>
that list, you cannot enter that room or know of its existence.<br>
<br>
It will have a very nondescript door in the hall that will not suggest what<br>
is inside. You can go in that room and discover yourself in something like<br>
the reading room of the New York Public Library, not a closet, not a safe,<br>
but a room with charts, with library shelves of material, no word of which<br>
you were previously aware existed.<br>
<br>
You did not know how it was gotten. You did not know the President had this<br>
kind of information at all. Of course, the effect of that is very euphoric<br>
at first. You go around and take things off the shelves and begin reading<br>
and imagine you are about to learn all the answers, that Godlike knowledge<br>
is now available to you.<br>
<br>
Now, you can be introduced into one of those rooms and still have NO IDEA<br>
THAT THERE EXIST STILL OTHER ROOMS WITH OTHER SOURCES OF INFORMATION, OTHER<br>
ACCESS LISTS JUST AS LARGE AND JUST AS SECRET. [EMPHASIS ADDED AB]<br>
<br>
I would say it is not until you have four or five such clearances, that THE<br>
NEXT LEVEL is revealed to you. Then you become aware that THERE IS NO LIMIT<br>
TO THIS; that these clearances can be generated very quickly in a day or<br>
two; and such types of information CAN BE SEGREGATED -- I am not saying<br>
only from the public or Congress, BUT EVEN FROM OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE TWO<br>
OR THREE OTHER CLEARANCES -- very effectively. [Emphasis added AB]<br>
p.508<br>
<br>
<br>
Once you have a dozen, from then on, you live in the knowledge there must be<br>
others you don't have.<br>
<br>
Could there be clearances the President doesn't know about? Of course,<br>
certainly, without any doubt....Could it, however, be withheld from him? The<br>
answer is 'Yes,' and even by close associates.<br>
<br>
Top Secret, you have heard in testimony, top secret is accessible to<br>
400,000 to 500,000 people....Comint clearance is far more secret, far more<br>
sensitive.<br>
p.508<br>
<br>
<br>
Members of Congress or their staffs...can't be trusted, but ... 120,000<br>
sergeants, warrant officers, generals and Cabinet secretaries [can].<br>
<br>
The next clearance above that cuts way down to about 14,000 to 20,000. What<br>
I am saying is that the world of secrets is lived in by a very large number<br>
of people, though a very small part of our our electorate and only one branch<br>
of our Government.<br>
<br>
Henry Kissinger lives in a much smaller world, a world that for SOME PIECES<br>
OF INFORMATION might be inhabited only by a couple of people.<br>
<br>
...one White House staffer told me...'I wonder if Henry realizes there were<br>
certain things known only to him, the President, and the Army General<br>
Staff....'<br>
<br>
But I am saying, as many as 100,000 or 400,000, nevertheless keep secrets<br>
very well because of this apparatus of conspiracy, special channels,<br>
special couriers for each clearance.<br>
<br>
The couriers for one clearance do not know the existence of the other ones.<br>
Special briefings, special access lists, special libraries, each separate,<br>
the apparatus of an espionage ring; a Government that consists of cells but<br>
with the President at the top.<br>
<br>
Certainly when I say there are clearances that the President may not know of,<br>
I say that only to make a point. The more important point is, the President<br>
DOES KNOW VIRTUALLY ALL OFL OF THIS....<br>
<br>
[A year later Ellsberg] wanted to tell [Kissinger] that his Vietnam policy<br>
was not necessarily a secret. It was a policy of escalation in my opinion,<br>
although too many people that it was a policy of withdrawal.<br>
<br>
A mass hoax was played on the American public. A preplanned policy of<br>
escalation likely to bring us into Laos and Cambodia and North Vietnam,<br>
into the bombing of North Vietnam [Note: made possible in part by Task Force<br>
157 AB]....<br>
p.510<br>
<br>
[Kissinger told Ellsberg:] 'Cambodia, you must understand, was made for very<br>
complicated reasons.' Secret reasons which could not be exposed to the Senate<br>
or the Congress, and therefore couldn't be discussed or argued with, reasons<br>
so foolish, and yet their foolishness could not be discussed.<br>
<br>
That is why men can live with moronic policies for years, because THEY ARE<br>
SECRET [EMPHASIS ADDED AB]<br>
p.511<br>
<br>
<br>
Sen. Muskie: Thank you Dr. Ellsberg...I assume you have heard of, if not<br>
read, David Wise's book?<br>
<br>
Ellsberg: I have received an advance copy, but I haven't had a chance to<br>
read it.<br>
<br>
Muskie: THE POLITICS OF LYING. Well, I haven't had a chance to read it<br>
altogether, but I have readd two or three chapters that touch the same<br>
points, some of the same points that you did this morning...First of all,<br>
the classification system has no basis in statutory law?<br>
<br>
Ellsberg: Yes<br>
<br>
Muskie: It is entirely a Presidential system?<br>
<br>
Ellsberg: That is correct.<br>
p.511<br>
<br>
<br>
Muskie: What standards should be devised for defining the need for secrecy?<br>
<br>
Ellsberg: I put first emphasis on standards that would keep the system<br>
within the bounds of democratic government.<br>
<br>
I might say, by the way, that I was frequently and ruthlessly accused two<br>
years ago [1971], when the Pentagon Papers came out, of threatining<br>
communications data or codes, threatening codes.<br>
<br>
I knew that not a page of those documents compromised codes for the simple<br>
reason they didn't have the right words. Had they in fact threatened codes I<br>
knew very well they would have had one to a dozen other words on that cover<br>
that would have warned me very effectively, and I had no desire to<br>
compromise codes.<br>
<br>
But the key points here are that, in principle, any secrecy about<br>
Government operations is to some extent an abridgment of our First Amendment.<br>
<br>
Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and implicitly behind it the<br>
freedom to know and gather information is, above all, given to us in the<br>
hopes of maintaining this a republic, so that citizens shall know how<br>
their officials are working.<br>
<br>
It is athe absolute core of our Government. So any abridgment, of course,<br>
has to be regarded with the utmost skepticism and worry.<br>
<br>
But as I say, Congress has to make some allowance for someand so does the<br>
Supreme Court.<br>
<br>
The key characteristics that make that viable in a democracy are: the number<br>
of secrets must be very samll; but above all, the system must be monitored<br>
as it goes on to see that the guideleines are being met.<br>
<br>
Third, there must be a form of appeal both in the executive branch, in<br>
Congress, and in the courts.<br>
<br>
Not one of these three characteristics is currently possessed by our<br>
classification system.<br>
p.513<br>
<br>
<br>
Everything is routinely classified.<br>
<br>
There is essentially no monitoring of the process by anybody, or anything<br>
leading to the same result, and almost nothing gets declassified.<br>
<br>
In fact, you can't challenge that classification in the courts. Most courts<br>
have refused to question the validity of the classification.<br>
<br>
In short, there must be the possibility of questioning the validity of any<br>
mark and the motives of it.<br>

Subject: FOIA Jewel: Original Charter of the National Security Agency
</pre>

At 12:01 On the morning of November 4, 1952, a new federal agency was born. Unlike other such bureaucratic births, however, this one arrived in silence. No news coverage, no congressional debate, no press announcement, not even the whisper of a rumor. Nor could any mention of the new organization be found in the Government Organization Manual of the Federal Register or the Congressional Record. Equally invisible were the new agency's director, its numerous buildings, and its ten thousand employees. <P>

Eleven days earlier, on October 24, President Harry S Truman scratched his signature on the bottom of a seven-page presidential memorandum addressed to secretary of State Dean G. Acheson and Secretary of Defense Robert A. Lovett. Classified top secret and stamped with a code word that was itself classified, the order directed the establishment of an agency to be known as the National Security Agency. It was the birth certificate for America's newest and most secret agency, so secret in fact that only a handful in the government would be permitted to know of its existence. <P>

MEMORANDUM FOR:     The Secretary of State
                    The Secretary of Defense
  
SUBJECT:  Communications Intelligence Activities
</pre>

The communications intelligence (COMINT) activities of the United States are 
a national responsibility. They must be so organized and managed as to exploit 
to the maximum the available resources in all  participating departments and 
agencies and to satisfy the legitimate intelligence requirements of all such 
departments and agencies.<P>

I therefore designate the Secretaries of State and Defense as a Special 
Committee of the National Security Council for COMINT, which Committee shall, 
with the assistance of the Director of Central Intelligence, establish policies
governing COMINT activities and keep me advised of such policies through the 
Executive Secretary of the National Security Council.<P>

I further designate the Department of Defense as executive agent of the 
Government, for the production of COMINT information.<P>

I  direct  this  Special  Committee  to  prepare   and  issue directives which shall include the provisions set forth below and such other provisions  as the Special Committee  may determine to be necessary. <P>

<ol>
<li> A directive to the United States Communication Intelligence Board (USCIB).
     This directive will replace the National Security Council Intelligence 
     Directive No. 9, and shall prescribe USCIB's new composition, 
     responsibilities and procedures in the COMINT fields. This directive 
     shall include the following provisions.
  <ol>
  <li> USCIB shall be reconstituted as a body acting for and under the Special 
       Committee, and shall operate in accordance with the provisions of the 
       new directive. Only those departments or agencies represented in USCIB 
       are authorized to engage in COMINT activities.
  <li> The  Board  shall  be  composed  of  the  following members:
    <ol>
    <li> The  Director  of  Central Intelligence,  who shall be the Chairman of
         the Board.
    <li> A representative of the Secretary of State.
    <li> A representative of the Secretary of Defense
    <li> A representative of the Director of the Federal Bureau of 
         Investigation.
    <li> The Director of the National Security Agency.
    <li> A representative of the Department of the Army.
    <li> A representative of the Department of the Navy.
    <li> A representative of the Department of the Air Force.
    <li> A representative of the Central Intelligence Agency.
    </ol>
  <li> The Board shall have a staff headed by an executive secretary who shall 
       be appointed by the Chairman with the approval of the majority of the 
       Board.
  <li> It shall be the duty of the Board to advise and make recommendations to 
       the Secretary of Defense, in accordance with the following procedure, 
       with respect to any matter relating to communications intelligence which
       falls within the jurisdiction of the Director of the NSA.
    <ol>
    <li> The Board shall reach its decision by majority vote. Each member of
         the Board shall have one vote except the representatives of the 
         Secretary of State and of the Central Intelligence Agency who shall 
         each have two votes. The Director of Central Intelligence, as 
         Chairman, will have no vote. In the event that the Board votes and 
         reaches a decision, any dissenting member of the Board may appeal from
         such decision within 7 days of the Special Committee. In the event 
         that the Board votes but fails to reach a decision, any member of the 
         Board may appeal within 7 days to the Special Committee. In either 
         event the Special Committee shall review the matter, and its 
         determination thereon shall be final. Appeals by the Director of NSA 
         and/or the representatives of the Military Departments shall only be 
         filed with the approval of the Secretary of Defense.
    <li> If any matter is voted on by the Board but -
      <ol>
      <li> no decision is reached and any member files an appeal;
      <li> a decision is reached in which the representative of the Secretary

  <li> The Board will meet monthly, or oftener at the call of the Chairman or 
       any member, and shall determine its own procedures. <P>
  </ol>

<li> A directive to the Secretary of Defense. This directive shall include the 
     following provisions:
  <ol>
  <li> Subject to the specific provisions of this directive, the Secretary of 
       Defense may delegate in whole of in part authority over the Director of 
       NSA within his department as he sees fit.
  <li> The COMINT mission of the National  Security Agency (NSA) shall be to 
       provide an effective, unified organization and control of the 
       communications intelligence activities of the United States conducted 
       against foreign governments, to provide for integrated operational 
       policies and procedures pertaining thereto. As used in this directive, 
       the terms "communications intelligence" or "COMINT" shall be construed 
       to mean all procedures and methods used in the interception of 
       communications other than foreign press and propaganda broadcasts and 
       the obtaining of information from such communications by other than 
       intended recipients, but shall exclude censorship and the production and
       dissemination of finished intelligence.
  <li> NSA shall be administered by a Director, designated by the Secretary of 
       Defense after consultation with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who shall 
       serve for a minimum term of 4 years and who shall be eligible for 
       reappointment. The Director shall be a career commissioned officer of 
       the armed services on active or reactivated status, and shall enjoy at 
       least 3-star rank during the period of his incumbency.
  <li> Under the Secretary of Defense, and in accordance with approved 
       policies of USCIB, the Director of NSA shall be responsible for 
       accomplishing the mission of NSA. For this purpose all COMINT collection
       and production resources of the United States are placed under his 
       operational and technical control. When action by the Chiefs of the 
       operating agencies of the Services or civilian departments or agencies 
       is required, the Director shall normally issue instruction pertaining to
       COMINT operations through them. However, due to the unique technical 
       character of COMINT operations, the Director is authorized to issue 
       direct to any operating elements under his operational control task 
       assignments and pertinent instructions which are within the capacity of 
       such elements to accomplish. He shall also have direct access to, and 
       direct communication with, any elements of the Service or civilian 
       COMINT agencies on any other matters of operational and technical 
       control as may be necessary, and he is authorized to obtain such 
       information and intelligence material from them as he may require. All 
       instruction issued by the Director under the authority provided in this 
       paragraph shall be mandatory, subject only to appeal to the Secretary of
       Defense by the Chief of Service or head of civilian department of agency
       concerned.
  <li> Specific responsibilities of the Director of NSA include the following:
    <ol>
    <li> Formulating necessary operational plans and policies for the conduct 
         of the U.S. COMINT activities.
    <li> Conducting COMINT activities, including research and development, as 
         required to meet the needs of the departments and agencies which are 
         authorized to receive the products of COMINT.
    <li> Determining, and submitting to appropriate authorities, requirements 
         for logistic support for the conduct of COMINT activities, together 
         with specific recommendations as to what each of the responsible 
         departments and agencies of the Government should supply.
    <li> Within NSA's field of authorized operations prescribing requisite 
         security regulations covering operating practices, including the 
         transmission, handling and distribution of COMINT material within and 
         among the COMINT elements under his operations or technical control; 
         and exercising the necessary monitoring and supervisory control, 
         including inspections if necessary, to ensure compliance with the 
         regulations.
    <li> Subject to the authorities granted the Director Central Intelligence 
         under NSCID No. 5, conducting all liaison on COMINT matters with 
         foreign governmental communications intelligence agencies.
    </ol>
  <li> To the extent he deems feasible and in consonance with the aims of 
       maximum over-all efficiency, economy, and effectiveness, the Director 
       shall centralize or consolidate the performance of COMINT functions for 
       which he is responsible. It is recognized that in certain circumstances 
       elements of the Armed Forces and other agencies being served will 
       require close COMINT support. Where necessary for this close support, 
       direct operational control of specified COMINT facilities and resources 
       will be delegated by the Director, during such periods and for such 
       tasks as are determined by him, to military commanders or to the Chiefs 
       of other agencies supported.
  <li> The Director shall exercise such administrative control over COMINT 
       activities as he deems necessary to the effective performance of his 
       mission. Otherwise, administrative control of personnel and facilities 
       will remain with the departments and agencies providing them.
  <li> The Director shall make provision for participation by representatives 
       of each of the departments and agencies eligible to receive COMINT 
       products in those offices of NSA where priorities of intercept and 
       processing are finally planned.
  <li> The Director shall have a civilian deputy whose primary responsibility shall be to ensure the mobilization and effective employment of the best available human and scientific resources in the field of cryptographic research and development.
  <li> Nothing  in  this  directive  shall contravene  the responsibilities  of the  individual departments and agencies for  the  final   evaluation  of   COMINT  information, its synthesis  with  information  from  other  sources,  and the dissemination of finished intelligence to users.
  </ol>
<li> The special nature of COMINT actives requires that they be treated in all respects as being outside the framework of other or general intelligence activities. Order, directives, policies, or recommendations of any authority of the Executive Branch relating to the collection, production, security, handling, dissemination, or utilization of intelligence, and/or classified material, shall not be applicable to COMINT actives, unless specifically so stated and issued by competent departmental of agency authority represented on the Board. Other National Security Council Intelligence Directive to the Director of  Central Intelligence and related implementing directives issued by the Director of Central Intelligence shall be construed as non-applicable to COMINT activities, unless the National Security Council has made its directive specifically applicable to COMINT.

10 June 1992
Mr. Joe Abernathy
Houston Chronicle 
P.O. Box 4260
Houston, TX 77210


 Dear Mr. Abernathy:

        
   Thank you for your inquiry of 3 June 1992 on the 

subject of cryptography. Attached please find answers 

to the questions that you provided our Agency. If 

any further assistance is needed, please feel free 

to contact me or Mr. Jerry Volker of my staff on (xxx)

xxx-xxxx.
        
   
   Sincerely,

        
   MICHAEL S.CONN
        
   Chief
   Information Policy

ENCL:

<h3>1. Has the NSA ever imposed or attempted to impose a weakness on any cryptographic code to see if it can thus be broken?</h3>

One of NSA's missions is to provide the means for protecting U.S. Government and military communications and information systems related to national security. In fulfilling this mission we design cryptologic codes based on an exhaustive evaluation process to ensure to the maximum extent possible that information systems security products that we endorse are free from any weaknesses. Were we to intentionally impose weaknesses on cryptologic codes for use by the U.S. Government, we would not be fulfilling our mission to provide the means to protect sensitive U.S. Government and military communications and our professional integrity would be at risk. <P>

<h3>2. Has the NSA ever imposed or attempted to impose a weakness on the DES or DSS?</h3>

Regarding the Data Encryption Standard (DES), we believe that the public record from the Senate Committee for Intelligence's investigation in 1978 into NSA's role in the development of the DES is responsive to your question. That committee report indicated that NSA did not tamper with the design of the algorithm in any way and that the security afforded by the DES was more than adequate for at least a 5-10 year time span for the unclassified data for which it was intended. In short, NSA did not impose or attempt to impose any weakness on the DES. <P>

Regarding the draft Digital Signature Standard (DSS), NSA never imposed any weakness or attempted to impose any weakness on the DSS. <P>

<h3>3. Is the NSA aware of any weaknesses in the DES or the DSS? The RSA?</h3>

We are unaware of any weaknesses in the DES or the DSS when properly implemented and used for the purposes for which they both are designed. We do not comment on nongovernment systems. <P>

Regarding the alleged trapdoor in the DSS. We find the term trapdoor somewhat misleading since it implies that the messages sent by the DSS are encryptedand with access via a trapdoor one could somehow decrypt (read) the message without the sender's knowledge. The DSS does not encrypt any data. The real issue is whether the DSS is susceptible to someone forging a signature and therefore discrediting the entire system. We state categorically that the chances of anyone - including NSA - forging a signature with the DSS when it is properly used and implemented is infinitesimally small. <P>

Furthermore, the alleged trapdoor vulnerability is true for ANY public key-based authentication system, including RSA. To imply somehow that this only affects the DSS (a popular argument in the press) is totally misleading. The issue is one of implementation and how one goes about selecting prime numbers. We call your attention to a recent EUROCRYPT conference which had a panel discussion on the issue of trapdoors in the DSS. Included on the panel was one of the Bellcore researchers who initially raised the trapdoor allegation, and our understanding is that the panel - including the person from Bellcore - concluded that the alleged trapdoor was not an issue for the DSS. Furthermore, the general consensus appeared to be that the trapdoor issue was trivial and had been overblown in the press. However, to try to respond to the trapdoor allegation, at NIST's request, we have designed a prime generation process which will ensure that one can avoid selection of the relatively few weak primes which could lead to weakness in using the DSS. Additionally, NIST intends to allow for larger modulus sizes up to 1024 which effectively negates the need to even use the prime generation process to avoid weak primes. An additional very important point that is often overlooked is that with the DSS the primes are PUBLIC and therefore can be subject to public examination. Not all public key systems provide for this same type of examination. <P>

The integrity of any information security system requires attention to proper implementation. With the myriad of vulnerabilities possible given the differences among users, NSA has traditionally insisted on centralized trusted centers as a way to minimize risk to the system. While we have designed technical modifications to the DSS to meet NIST's requests for a more decentralized approach, we still would emphasize that portion of the Federal Register notice for the DSS which states: While it is the intent of this standard to specify general security requirements for generating digital signatures, conformance to this standard does not assure that a particular implementation is secure. The responsible authority in each agency or department shall assure that an overall implementation provides an acceptable level of security. NIST will be working with government users to ensure appropriate implementations. <P>

Finally, we have read all the arguments purporting insecurities with the DSS, and we remain unconvinced of their validity. The DSS has been subjected to intense evaluation within NSA which led to its being endorsed by our Director of Information Systems Security for use in signing unclassified data processed in certain intelligence systems and even for signing classified data in selected systems. We believe that this approval speaks to the lack of any credible attack on the integrity provided by the DSS given proper use and implementation. Based on the technical and security requirements of the U.S. government for digital signatures, we believe the DSS is the best choice. In fact, the DSS is being used in a pilot project for the Defense Message System to assure the authenticity of electronic messages of vital command and control information. This initial demonstration includes participation from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the military services, and Defense Agencies and is being done in cooperation with NIST. <P>

<h3>4. Has the NSA ever taken advantage of any weaknesses in the DES or the DSS?</h3>

We are unaware of any weaknesses in the DSS or in the DES when properly implemented and used for the purposes for which they both are designed. <P>

<h3>5. Did the NSA play a role in designing the DSS? Why, in the NSA's analysis, was it seen as desirable to create the DSS when the apparently more robust RSA already stood as a de facto standard?</h3>

Under the Computer Security Act of 1987, NIST is to draw upon computer systems technical security guidelines of NSA where appropriate and to coordinate closely with other agencies, including NSA, to assure: <P>

<blockquote>
a. maximum use of all existing and planned programs, materials, and reports relating to computer systems security and privacy, in order to avoid unnecessary and costly duplication of effort; and <P>

b. that standards developed by NIST are consistent and compatible with standards and procedures developed for the protection of classified systems. <P>
</blockquote>

Consistent with that law and based on a subsequent Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between NSA and NIST, NSA's role is to be responsive to NIST's requests for assistance in developing, evaluating, or researching cryptographic algorithms and techniques. (See note at end). In 19??, NIST requested that NSA evaluate candidate algorithms proposed by NIST for a digital signature standard and that NSA provide new algorithms when existing algorithms did not meet U.S. government requirements. In the two-year process of developing a digital signature for U.S. government use, NIST and NSA examined various publicly-known algorithms and their variants, including RSA. A number of techniques were deemed to provide appropriate protection for Federal systems. The one selected by NIST as the draft Digital Signature Standard was determined to be the most suitable for reasons that were set forth in the Federal Register announcement. One such reason was to avoid issuance of a DSS that would result in users outside the government having to pay royalties. Even though the DSS is targeted for government use, eliminating potential barriers for commercial applications is useful to achieve economies of scale. Additionally, there are features of the DSS which make it more attractive for federal systems that need to have a digital signature capability for large numbers of users. Chief among them are the number of trusted operation points and system management overhead that are minimized with the NIST proposed technique. <P>

<h3>6. What national interests are served by limiting the power of cyptographic schemes used by the public?</h3>

We call your attention to the House Judiciary committee hearing of 29 April 1992. The Director of the FBI expressed his concerns that law enforcement interests in meeting responsibilities given to them by Congress could be affected unless they had access to communications, as was given to them by statute in 1968 (court monitored, court sponsored, court reviewed and subject to Congressional oversight). <P>

The National Security Agency has no role in limiting the power of cryptographic schemes used by the public within the U.S. We have always been in favor of the use of information security technologies by U.S. Businesses to protect their proprietary information, and when we had an information security role with private industry (prior to the Computer Security Act of 1987), we actively advocated use of such technologies. <P>

<h3>7. What national interests are served by limiting the export of cryptographic technology?</h3>

Cryptographic technology is deemed vital to national security interests. This includes economic, military, and foreign policy interests. <P>

We do not agree with the implications from the House Judiciary Committee hearing of 7 May 1992 and recent news articles that allege that U.S. export laws prevent U.S. firms' manufacture and use of top encryption equipment. We are unaware of any case where a U.S. firm has been prevented from manufacturing and using encryption equipment within this country or for use by the U.S. firm or its subsidiaries in locations outside the U.S. Because of U.S. export restrictions. In fact, NSA has always supported the use of encryption by U.S. businesses operating domestically and overseas to protect sensitive information. <P>

For export to foreign countries, NSA as a component of the Department of Defense (along with the Department of State and the Department of Commerce) reviews export licenses for information security technologies controlled by the Export Administration Regulations or the international Traffic in Arms Regulations. Similar export control systems are in effect in all the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom) countries as well as many non-CoCom countries as these technologies are universally considered as sensitive. Such technologies are not banned from export and are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. As part of the export review process, licenses may be required for these systems and are reviewed to determine the effect such export could have on national security interests - including economic, military, and political security interests. Export licenses are approved or denied based upon the type of equipment involved, the proposed end-se and the end-user. <P>

Our analysis indicates that the U.S. leads the world in the manufacture and export of information security technologies. Of those cryptologic products referred to NSA by the Department of State for export licenses, we consistently approve over 90%. Export licenses for information security products under the jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce are processed and approved without referral to NSA or DoD. This includes products using such techniques as the DSS and RSA which provide authentication and access control to computers or networks. In fact, in the past NSA has played a major role in successfully advocating the relaxation of export controls on RSA and related technologies for authentication purposes. Such techniques are extremely valuable against the hacker problem and unauthorized use of resources. <P>

<h3>8. What national interests are at risk, if any, if secure cryptography is widely available?</h3>

Secure cryptography widely available outside the United States clearly has an impact on national security interests including economic, military, and political. <P>

Secure cryptography within the United States may impact law enforcement interests. <P>

<h3>9. What does the NSA see as its legitimate interests in the area of cryptography?  Public cryptography?</h3>

Early one of our interests is to protect U.S. government and military communications and information systems related to national security. As part of that mission, we stay abreast of activities in public cryptography. <P>

<h3>10. How did NSA enter into negotiations with the Software Publishers Association regarding the export of products utilizing cryptographic techniques? How was this group chosen, and to what purpose? What statute or elected representative authorized the NSA to engage in the discussions?</h3>

The Software Publishers Association (SPA) went to the National Security Advisor to the President to seek help from the Administration to bring predictability, clarity, and speed to the process for exporting mass market software with encryption. The National Security Advisor directed NSA to work with the mass market software representatives on their request. <P>

<blockquote>
<h3>ii. What is the status of these negotiations?</h3>

These negotiations are ongoing. <P>
</blockquote>

<h3>12. What is the status of export controls on products using cryptographic  techniques? How would you respond to those who point to the fact that the export of RSA from the U.S. is controlled, but that its import into the U.S. is not?</h3>

To the best of our knowledge, most countries who manufacture cryptographic products regulate the export of such products from their countries by procedures similar to those existing within the U.S. Some even control the import into their countries. The U.S. complies with the guidelines established by CoCom for these products. <P>

Regarding the export of RSA from the U.S., we are unaware of any restrictions that have been placed on the export of RSA for authentication purposes. <P>

<h3>13. What issues would you like to discuss that I have not addressed?</h3>

None. <P>

<h3>14. What question or questions would you like to pose of your critics?</h3>

None. <P>

<b>NOTE</b>: To clarify misunderstandings regarding this Memorandum of Understanding (MOU); this MOU does not provide NSA any veto power over NIST proposals. As was discussed publicly in 1989, the MOU provides that if there is an issue that can not be resolved between the two agencies, then such an issue may be referred to the President for resolution. Enclosed please find a copy of subject MOU which has been made freely available in the past by both NSA and NIST to all requestors. At the House Judiciary Committee hearings on 7 May 1992, the Director of NIST responded that he had never referred an issue to the White House since his assumption of Directorship in 1990. <P>

>Subject: CIA & NSA run remailers (fwd)

I attended last week's ``Information, National Policies, and International
Infrastructure" Symposium at Harvard Law School, organized by the Global
Information Infrastructure Commission, the Kennedy School, and the Institute
for Information Technology Law & Policy of Harvard Law School.

During the presentation by Paul Strassmann, National Defense University, and
William Marlow, Science Applications International Corporation, entitled
``Anonymous Remailers as Risk-Free International Infoterrorists'', the
question was raised from the audience (Professor Charles Nesson, Harvard Law
School) -- in a rather extended debate -- whether the CIA and similar
government agencies are involved in running anonymous remailers, as this
would be a perfect target to scan possibly illegal messages.

Both presenters explicitly acknowledged that a number of anonymous remailers
in the US are run by government agencies scanning traffic.  Marlow said that
the government runs at least a dozen remailers and that the most popular
remailers in France and Germany are run by the respective government
agencies in these countries.  In addition, they mentioned that the NSA has
successfully developed systems to break encrypted messages will less than
1000-bit [public] keys and strongly suggested using at least 1024-bit keys.
They said that they themselves use 1024-bit keys.

I ask Marlow afterwards if these comments were off or on record, he paused
then said that he can be quoted.

So I thought I pass that on. It seems interesting enough, don't you think?

  [Lightly edited for RISKS.  By the way, don't forget that if you can
  monitor and compare the incoming and outgoing mail from an anonymous
  remailer, ``anonymous'' identities can be compromised.  Beware of
  anonymity-bearing gifts.  Also, see Matt Blaze's contribution on key
  lengths for symmetric crypto in RISKS-17.69.  PGN]

 NSA CONTROLLING GOVERNMENT INFO

 WASHINGTON, D.C., U.S.A., 1989 MAY 23 (NB) -- Information Industry
Association Vice President Ken Allen has told Congress the
National Security Agency is trying to take control over U.S.
information, in violation of the Computer Security Act of 1987.

 Allen said the NSA has much more money than the National
Institute of Standards and Technology, formerly the National
Bureau of Standards, and is using ambiguities in the law to seize
power. While the act gives the NIST control over security at the
government's civilian computers, Allen said, a recent memo issued
by the two agencies gave the NSA control over "sensitive but
unclassified" data, which could mean give the super-secret NSA
control over anything.
 
 The Act was passed by Congress in the wake of a secret memo from
Admiral John Poindexter, then National Security advisor, which
could have put both civilian and military information under the
NSA's control, and disrupted the free flow of information vital
to science and industry. The NSA, which maintains U.S. classified
data, has signed agreements with the NIST, formerly the National
Bureau of Standards, including some language from that memo which
might keep secret unclassified data.
 
 "We expressed grave concerns that it was loosely worded, and it could
undercut the intent of Congress," Allen told Newsbytes. "It is quite
possible the Poindexter Memorandum could re-emerge in a new context."
 
 The IIA will have its annual meeting September 10-14 in New York,
at which time it will plot strategy. The IIA was instrumental in
getting the 1987 act passed.

<p align=center><font size=5><strong></strong></font>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>(<a href="#1">1</a>)Although code making and breaking are ancient practices, modern cryptologic communications intelligence activities in the 
United States date from the World War I period and radio communications technology. In 1917 and 1918 the US Army 
created, within the Military Intelligence Division, the Cipher Bureau (MI-8) under Herbert O. Yardley. MID assisted the radio 
intelligence units in the American Expeditionary Forces and in 1918 created the Radio Intelligence Service for operations 
along t he Mexican border. The Navy had established a modest effort, but it was absorbed, by mutual agreement in 1918, 
into Yardley's postwar civilian &quot;Black Chamber.&quot; </p>
<p>The Army (and State Department) continued to support Yardley until the termination of his &quot;Black Chamber&quot; in 1929. Army 
continuity was assumed, however, in the small Signal Intelligence Service of the Army Signal Corps under the direction of 
William F. Fr iedman. The Navy's cryptanalytic function reappeared formally in 1924 in the &quot;Research Desk&quot; under 
Commander Laurance F. Safford in the Code and Signal Section, OP-20-G, within the Office of Naval Communications. 
While emphasis was on the security of US m ilitary communications (COMSEC), both organizations developed radio 
intercept, radio direction finding, and processing capabilities prior to World War II; they achieved particular successes against 
Japanese diplomatic communications. Exploitation successe s of their respective counterpart service communications had to 
await the shift of resources until after hostilities commenced. However, wartime successes by the United States and Britain 
proved the value of COMINT to military and political leaders, and, as a result, both service organizations expanded greatly in 
terms of manpower resources and equipment. </p>
<p>In the latter stages of the war, the services created a coordinating body to facilitate COMINT cooperation, the Army-Navy 
Communications Intelligence Board (ANCIB) with a subordinate coordinating committee (ANCICC). These became the 
instruments for negoci ating joint postwar arrangements. In late 1945, with the addition of the Department of State to its 
membership, ANCIB became the State-Army-Navy Communications Intelligence Board (STANCIB). STANCIB evolved in 
1946 into the United States Communications Int elligence Board (USCIB), which added the FBI as a member. </p>
<p>With the passage of the National Security Act of 1947, Congress reinforced the direction in which the intelligence community 
was moving toward increased centralization - and built the framework for a modern national security structure. Among other 
things, the Act established the National Security Council (NSC) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). CIA became a 
member of USCIB, which received a new charter as the highest national COMINT authority in the form of an NSC 
Intelligence Directive, NSCID No. 9, dated 1 July 1948. </p>
<p>As the Air Force sought to expand its cryptologic organization, Secretary of Defense James V. Forrestal contemplated cutting 
defense expenditures. One solution was a unified cryptologic agency. He appointed a special board under Rear Admiral Earl 
E. Stone , Director of Naval Communications, to formulate a plan for merging all military COMINT and COMSEC activities 
and resources into a single agency. Only the Army favored the Stone Board's recommendations for merger at this time, and 
the plan was shelved. </p>
<p>In 1949, a new Secretary of Defense, Louis A. Johnson, also seeking ways to economize, reviewed the Stone Board's report 
and began to take steps for its implementation. After much discussion among the services regarding the concept of merger, on 
20 May194 9 Secretary Johnson ordered the issuance of JCS Directive 2010. This directive established the Armed Forces 
Security Agency (AFSA), which had as its mission the conduct of communications intelligence and communications security 
activities within the Natio nal Military Establishment. AFSA thus had the actual responsibility for running COMINT and 
COMSEC operations, excluding only those that were delegated individually to the Army, Navy, and Air Force. The JCS 
directive also established an advisory council wi thin the AFSA structure. Known for a time as the Armed Forces 
Communications Intelligence Advisory Council (AFCIAC), it later was renamed Armed Forces Security Agency Council 
(AFSAC). The organization became the mechanism through which AFSA reported to th e JCS. </p>
<p>On 15 July 1949 RADM Stone became AFSA's first director, appointed by the JCS. By January 1950 the Army and Navy 
cryptologic organizations had transferred enough civilian and military personnel, as well as equipment, so that AFSA could 
operate. AFSA did n ot, however, have its own facilities. </p>
<p>Admiral Stone was succeeded in 1951 by Army Major General Ralph J. Canine. By this time, various difficulties in defining 
powers and areas of jurisdiction were painfully obvious. Further, both directors experienced grave difficulties in obtaining the 
Advi sory Council's approval of proposed courses of action because of AFSAC's policy requiring unanimous decisions. 
Finally, the potentialities of expanding technical COMINT capabilities of the late 1940s could not always be realized. During 
the Korean War the quality of strategic intelligence derived from COMINT fell below that which had been provided in World 
War II. Consumers were disappointed and increasingly critical. By late 1951, AFSA had clashed with the service cryptologic 
agencies, with consumers, wit h CIA, and with the State Department, although not all at one time nor with all on one issue. 
Despite the intentions, AFSA had in fact become a fourth military cryptologic agency. </p>
<p>On 13 December 1951 President Truman ordered a searching analysis to be conducted by a special committee to be named 
by the Secretaries of State and Defense, aided by the Director of Central Intelligence. Chaired by George Brownell, an 
eminent New York la wyer, the Brownell Committee surveyed the situation and in June recommended that a unified 
COMINT agency receive greater powers commensurate with clearly defined responsibilities. It also advised that the agency 
be freed of the crippling line of subordina tion through AFSAC to the JCS and, instead, be directly subordinate to the 
Secretary of Defense, acting with the Secretary of State on behalf of the NSC. It further proposed that the unified agency be 
controlled in policy matters by a reconstituted USCIB, under the chairmanship of the Director of Central Intelligence, in which 
the representation of military and nonmilitary intelligence interests would be evenly balanced. </p>
<p>In October 1952 the President and National Security Council adopted most of the Brownell Committee's recommendations 
and issued a revised version of NSCID No.9 on 24 October 1952. </p>
<p>A mingling of military and nonmilitary interests was expressed in the word &quot;national.&quot; The production of COMINT was 
declared to be a national responsibility. In place of an Armed Forces Security Agency, the US government was to have a 
National Security Ag ency, an organization with the same resources plus a new charter. The AFSA Council, while not 
specifically abolished, thus had the agency pulled out from under it. The Joint Chiefs of Staff were no longer in the 
chain-of-command. The Director, NSA, report ed to the Secretary of Defense through a unit in the latter's office that dealt 
with sensitive operations. The Secretary himself was declared to be executive agent of the government for COMINT and 
subordinate to a special committee for the NSC, of which h e and the Secretary of State were the two members and the 
Director of Central Intelligence was an advisor. </p>
<p>The Secretary of Defense was instructed to delegate his COMINT responsibilities to the Director, NSA, and to entrust to him 
operational and technical control of all US military COMINT collection and production resources. The Director, NSA, was 
ordered to bring about the most effective, unified application of all U. S. resources for producing national COMINT to meet 
requirements approved by USCIB. In addition, the DIRNSA was ordered to assume the COMSEC responsibilities 
previously assigned to AFSA. Promulg ation of NSCID No.9 brought about a greater participation by civilian members (CIA 
and State) of the community in the COMINT process. At the same time it was recognition of the necessity for more 
centralized technical operations. On 4 November 1952, Major General Ralph J. Canine, USA, became the first Director, 
NSA. </p>
<p><b>Recent History (</b><a href="#2"><b>2</b></a><b>)</b> </p>
<p>Unlike the DIA, the National Security Agency (NSA) is a presidential creation, established in response to a Top Secret 
directive issued by President Truman in October 1952. In this directive. the President designated the Secretary of Defense as 
Execctive Agent for the signals intelligence and communications security activities of the Government. A specific National 
Security Council Intelligence Directive (NSCID) defines NSA's functions. It is augmented by Director of Central Intelligence 
Directives (DCIDs ) and internal Department of Defense and NSA regulations</p>
<p>NSA assumed the responsibilities of its predecessor, the Armed Forces Security Agency (AFSA), which had been created 
after World War II to integrate the national cryptologic effort. NSA was established as a separate agency responsible directly 
to the Secr etary of Defense. In addition, it was granted SIGINT operational control over the three Service Cryptologic 
(collection) Agencies (SCAs): the Army Security Agency, Naval Security Group Command, and Air Force Security Service. 
Under this arrangement, NSA e ncountered initially the same jurisdictional difficulties that were to plague DIA. </p>
<p>In an effort to strengthen the influence of the Director of the National Security Agency (DIRNSA) over their activities, the 
SCAs were confederated in 1971 under a Central Security Service (CSS) with the DIRNSA as its chief. The National 
Security Agecny/C entral Security Service (NSA/ CSS) provides centralized coordination, direction, and control of the 
Government's Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) and Communications Security (COMSEC) activities. The Central Security 
Service (CSS) was established by a Preside ntial memorandum in order to provide a more unified cryptologic effort within the 
Department of Defense. With the establishment of the CSS, NSA underwent a major internal reorganization to become the 
institution it is today. As Chief, CSS, the Director of NSA exercises control over the signals intelligence activities of the 
military services. NSA, while not a military organization, is one of several elements of the intelligence community administered 
by the Department of Defense. </p>
<p>The Agency was charged with an additional mission, computer security, in a 1984 Presidential directive, and with an 
operations security training mission in a 1988 Presidential directive. Like the Department of State and Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, th e National Security Agency has its own civilian career service, established by Congress in 1959. To maintain 
this career service, the agency conducts its own recruiting and employment programs. From its beginning, NSA has been 
hiring promising college gra duates from all sections of the country - including the Baltimore/Washington area - to augment its 
growing staff of professionals. </p>
<p>The Secretary of Defense approved the Plan for Restructuring Defense Intelligence on 15 March 1991, and subsequently 
forwarded it to Congress. The plan emphasized the centralization of management within the DOD for more effectively dealing 
with the changi ng world situation. However the National Security Agency was only peripherally affected by the plan, under 
which the Office of the Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence does not exercise the 
same degree of control, dir ection and authority over the National Security Agency as was instituted for the Defense 
Intelligence Agency. (<a href="#3">3</a>) </p>

<h1 align=center>FACILITIES</h1>
<hr size=3>
<p>Most NSA employees, both civilian and military, are headquartered at Fort George G. Meade, MD. The rest of the 
workforce is scattered at CONUS and overseas field locations. NSA is one of the largest employers in the state of Maryland. 
Its workforce repres ents an unusual combination of occupational specialties including engineers, physicists, mathematicians, 
linguists, computer scientists. </p>
<p>NSA reportedly has about 20,000 employees in Maryland, with a $831.7 million payroll in 1990 (<a href="#1">1</a>). This estimate is 
consistent with the approximately 5 million square feet of NSA office space at Ft. Meade, somewhat less than the Pentagon, 
which houses somewhat more than 20,000 personnel. Other published estimates that NSA has between 38,000 and 52,000 
employees clearly also include t he personnel of the Central Security Service military components, as well as contractor 
personnel (<a href="#2">2</a>). </p>
<p><b>NSA FACILITIES FOCUS PLAN -- 1989 (</b><a href="#3"><b>3</b></a><b>)</b><br>
</p>
<p>NSA conducted the most significant upgrade of NSA's facilities in its history, based on a blueprint, the Facilities Focus Plan, 
prepared and approved in 1989. The 1989 Facilities Focus Plan provided for the upgrading of over 2.5 million square feet of 
spa ce and will involved the movement of over one-half of the NSA work force. When completed, NSA will have achieved a 
long-sought goal of a minimum of 70 square feet of office space per person across NSA. </p>
<p>In 1991 alone, NSA added over one million square feet of new space to the NSA inventory by opening the new REE 
Building, the SPL state-of-the-art microelectronics Production Facility, the System Processing Center, and the Columbia 
Annex. These facilities were occupied by thousands of NSA employees. In addition, the total renovation of the Headquarters 
Building was 60 percent complete and the offices were partially re-occupied, providing work space for another 1,000-plus 
employees. As NSA moved people into these new spaces, the areas they leave were fully renovated and other employees 
moved into expanded spaces. (a process NSA called &quot;decompression&quot;). In 1992 NSA completed the renovation of SAB I 
for parts of ISL and begin the renovations of FANX 2 for the National Cryptologic School and FANX 3 for another key 
component. </p>
<p>In addition to executing the Facilities Focus Plan, many other major facilities projects are under way or have been completed. 
The Twin Towers Utility Upgrade on the Headquarters Building provided improved air conditioning for people and 
equipment. The 3, 000-ton Chiller Plant constructed in front of the Headquarters Building provided much-needed cooling for 
OPS I occupants. The Chiller Plant's Main Distribution Loop delivers over 430,000 gallons of chilled water per hour to OPS 
I. This project required ov er 200 helicopter airlifts to put equipment in place on the OPS 1 Building. The Road Improvements 
Project provided a much-needed upgrade to the road network throughout the NSA Headquarters complex. The replacement 
of the 16-year-old Uninterrupted Power S ystems protected NSA's most critical mission operations. The OPS I Sprinkler 
Project met the latest fire/safety codes. Extensive asbestos removal was conducted in OPS I and the Headquarters Building to 
provide an asbestos-free environment for NSA employee s. </p>
<p>Upgrades in 1991 and 1992 included the installation of additional landscaping and efforts to repaint and clean up the corridors 
prior to President Bush's visit in 1991, along with the addition of a marble signpost at the intersection of Route 32 and Cani ne 
Road, and the redecorating of the OPS 2B lobby --- all of which were intended to &quot;create a dignified and professional look,&quot; 
at NSA. But some work spaces remained overcrowded and unattractive (with some offices working under such crowded 
conditions tha t everyone in each row must interrupt their work to move each time a teammate enters or exits the aisle). Work 
space requirements and safety regulations were not complied with. </p>
<p><b>NSA DRAWDOWN PLAN -- 1992 (</b><a href="#4"><b>4</b></a><b>)</b> </p>
<p>In 1991 NSA planners anticipated possible personnel and Operations and Maintenance budget cuts, and began planning for 
reduced lease, utility, and facility support costs commensurate with projected budget reductions. The NSA Drawdown Plan 
was approved by the Critical Issues Group (the current Board of Directors) in January 1992, briefed to and approved by 
DIRNSA in February 1992, and presented to and approved by several Congressional staffs in March 1992. </p>
<p>The Plan's strategy focused on the reduction of nine leased buildings. This would not only decrease rent and utility costs, but 
also such facility support costs as security, grounds, maintenance, bus service, mail runs, and local travel time. </p>
<p>Another major goal of the plan is to accommodate the 1992 NSA agency restructure by consolidating several key 
components into fewer buildings, bringing many of the elements in closer proximity to NSA Headquarters at Ft. Meade and 
enhancing the efficiency of SIGINT resources and support services. The Technology and Systems Organization will be 
housed in NBP 1, R&amp;E, and CANX; Operations elements are to be consolidated at the Ft. Meade complex. Several 
Support Services elements will be relocated to the OPS 3 and APS 20 buildings, and the Information Systems Security 
Organization will be consolidated in FANX 3 and OPS 3. </p>
<p>Over the course of the four year implementation, the Drawdown Plan will affect 21 NSA-owned or leased buildings -- over 
1.2 million square feet will be involved -- and 506 organizations, ranging from 10 to 200 people will be moved. The plan 
compromises mo re than 1,700 activities, ranging from building designs and construction to furniture and communications 
installation to the actual organizational moves. The plan is further complicated by over 3,000 constraints, or dependent 
activities. Constrataints are activities that must precede or succeed one another. Therefore, if one activity is delayed, it can 
delay another activity, which in turn delays two more activities, which in turn delay several more activities, and so on and so 
on... These constraints, co mbined with the large volume of work to be accomplished, are what make this plan so complex. </p>
<p>From the beginning, the Drawdown Plan assumed an aggressive schedule. However, since the original plan was devised, two 
major changes occurred. </p>
<p>The first involved a key aspect of the plan, the leasing of NBP 1. Prior to the 1992 NSA reorganization, the building had been 
completely designed for its new occupants, the majority of whom were coming directly from the OPS 1, OPS 2B, and APS 
20 building s However, as a result of the Agency reorganization, the slated occupants of the building completely changed; 
elements from throughout NSA were scheduled to move to NBP I, home of the new Technology and Systems Organization 
This meant that the floor plans , seating arrangements, communications systems, etc, had to be readjusted. The Drawdown 
team was able to rectify the situation with no delay to the already tight schedule. </p>
<p>The second major alteration involved the relocation of the Naval Security Croup (NSC) from its Nebraska Avenue 
headquarters to OPS 3, a direct result of the Federal Base Closure Act. Prior to the decision to relocate NSG, FANX 3 was 
scheduled to be rehabb ed, floor by floor, over the course of 3 years. However, because DDI personnel must vacate their 
OPS 3 spaces to make room for the 1995 arrival of NSG, the rehab of FANX 3, DDI's new home, must be completed in 18 
months. This aggressive schedule requires that the entire FANX 3 building be empty during the rehab. The Drawdown Plan 
had to be altered to allow for temporary retention of ITB and indefinite retention of APS 20 to accommodate the FANX 3 
personnel. This major revision did not lengthen the origina l 4-year Drawdown schedule </p>
<p>The NSA Drawdown Plan includes the termination of leases for FANX 1, APS 8, and APS 9; the complete renovation and 
occupancy of FANX 2; the consolidation of the National Cryptologic School in FANX 2; the consolidation of the Operations 
Organization in the Headquarters complex; and the transfer of all personnel from FANX 3 in preparation of the building 
rehab, with scheduled to be completed by mid-1995. </p>
<p>Equally significant is the complete interior construction and occupancy of NBP 1 When leased in 1992, NBP 1 was essentially 
a &quot;hollow building.&quot; Crews had to construct everything from floors and ceilings to heating and air conditioning systems to 
communic ation lines and sprinkler systems to walls and furniture. </p>
<p>By late 1996, the plan's scheduled completion date, NSA will fully reoccupy the newly renovated FANX 3 and termination of 
leases for Parkway Center, APS 5, APS 10, APS 11, APS 13, and the International Tower Building. </p>
<p>The implementation of the NSA Space Drawdown Plan required the combined efforts of many organizations -- the Support 
Services Organization for design, construction, maintenance, custodial, transportation, furnishings, and security operations; the 
Army Cor ps of Engineers for project lease management; the Technology and Systems Organization for communications fit-up 
and support; the Plans, Policy, and Programs Organization for financial programming and budgeting. </p>
<p>Focusing on quality customer support, the Space Drawdown Plan tries to minimize the inconvenience to NSA personnel as 
much as possible. Other than the time required to pack and unpack, moves are completed overnight, with minimal office 
downtime Whenever p ossible, customers may retain their telephone numbers at their new location And, although double (and 
sometimes triple) moves are occasionally necessary, the team takes great pains not to &quot;hopscotch&quot; their customers all over the 
Agency The NSA Space Dra wdown Plan is a team effort, requiring the coordination of many different Agency elements, 
which will continue until the final move is completed in late 1996. </p>
<p><a href="nsamead.jpg"><b>FORT GEORGE G. MEADE</b></a><br>
Ft. Meade, Maryland </p>
<p>Fort Meade's mission is to provide a wide range of support to 56 tenant organizations from all four services and to several 
federal agencies. Major tenant units include the National Security Agency (NSA), the US Army Intelligence and Security 
Command, the Naval Security Group Activity, and the 694th Intelligence Wing (US Air Force). </p>
<p>Fort George G. Meade, Maryland, is an Army installation dedicated to providing support to servicemen, women, DoD 
civilians and their families. Located midway between the cities of Baltimore, Washington, DC, and Annapolis, near the 
communities of Odenton, Laurel and Columbia, The installation lies four miles east of Interstate 95 and one-half mile east of 
the Baltimore-Washington Parkway between Maryland State Routes 175 and 198. Fort Meade is home to approximately 
9,200 military personnel as well as 29,00 0 civilian employees. Approximately 7,500 family members reside on post. The 
economic impact of Fort Meade to local civilian communities is approximately $2 billion annually. This reaches the community 
in the form of $300 million in military payroll, $1.2 billion in civilian payroll, and nearly $500 million in contracts. Virtually a 
city in itself, Fort Meade has 65 miles of paved roads, and 28 miles of secondary roads and 1,670 buildings. There is also a 
bank, modern exchange mall, credit union, post off ice, hospital, chapels and many other facilities. </p>
<p>Fort George G. Meade became an Army installation in 1917. Authorized by an Act of Congress in May 1917, it was one of 
16 cantonments built for troops drafted for the war with the Central Powers in Europe. The present Maryland site was 
selected on June 23, 1917. Actual construction began in July. The first contingent of troops arrived here that September. The 
post was originally named Camp Meade for Major General George Gordon Meade, whose defensive strategy at the Battle of 
Gettysburg proved a major facto r in turning the tide of the Civil War in favor of the North. During World War I, more than 
100,000 men passed through Fort Meade, a training site for three infantry divisions, three training battalions and one depot 
brigade. </p>
<p>In 1928, when the post was renamed Fort Leonard Wood, Pennsylvanians registered such a large protest that the installation 
was permanently named Fort George G. Meade on 5 March 1929. This action was largely the result of a rider attached to the 
Regular Ar my Appropriation Act by a member of the House of Representatives from the Keystone State. Fort Meade 
became a training center during World War II. Its ranges and other facilities were used by more than 200 units and 
approximately 3,500,000 men between 194 2 and 1946. The wartime peak-military personnel figure at Fort Meade was 
reached in March, 1945-70,000. With the conclusion of World War II, Fort Meade reverted to routine peacetime activities, 
but later returned to build-up status. Many crises, including Korea, West Berlin and Cuba, along with Vietnam-related 
problems, were to come. </p>
<p>One key post-World War II event at Fort Meade was the transfer of the Second US Army Headquarters from Baltimore, on 
15 June 1947. This transfer brought an acceleration of post activity because Second Army Headquarters exercised command 
over Army units th roughout a then seven state area. A second important development occurred on 1 January 1966, when the 
Second US Army merged with the First US Army. The consolidated headquarters moved from Fort Jay, NY, to Fort Meade 
to administer activities of Army insta llations in a 15-state area. </p>
<p>In August 1990, Fort Meade began processing Army Reserve and National Guard units from several states for the 
presidential call-up in support of Operation Desert Shield. In addition to processing Reserve and National Guard units, Fort 
Meade sent two activ e duty units-the 85th Medical Battalion and the 519th Military Police Battalion-to Saudi Arabia. In all, 
approximately 2,700 personnel from 42 units deployed from Fort Meade during Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm. </p>
<p>The National Security Agency was established by presidential directive on 4 November 1952. In 1957 NSA consolidated its 
headquarters operations at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland. Its headquarters complex at Fort Meade is dominated by two 
high-rise buildin gs completed in 1986 and dedicated by then President Ronald Reagan in a special ceremony. The complex 
includes an operations building, a technical library and other facilities which house logistics and support activities. NSA is 
supported by elements of t he Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force, whose officers and enlisted personnel constitute 
approximately 20 percent of the agency work force. The remainder are civilians who are permanently assigned and who 
reside in the Baltimore/Washington area. </p>
<p>A large number of the agency's semi-skilled and clerical employees have been drawn from the local area. NSA has developed 
special educational programs, in conjunction with local high schools, to help prepare students for employment with the agency. 
NSA wo rks with US employment offices and civic groups in the area to promote employment of the handicapped. Graduates 
coming from high schools and college campuses may move into one of three broadly defined professional occupational areas. 
Some specialize in cr yptology (making and testing US codes and ciphers), others become specialists in the data-processing 
fields, and the remainder (especially mathematicians, scientists and engineers) will work in research and development. </p>
<p>NSA has always placed great emphasis on the training and development of its people. The establishment of the National 
Cryptologic School as a separate professional structure is a true symbol of this concern and represents further enhancement of 
the agency 's already extensive training activities. Additionally, the agency has a number of educational programs-both 
undergraduate and graduate-established with the Johns Hopkins University, <a href="http://www.american.edu/">American University</a>, George Washi ngton 
University, University of Maryland and Catholic University, as well as its own special courses. Also a number of NSA 
professional personnel teach part time at these local universities. </p>

Linthicum, Maryland </p>
<p>(<a href="#5">5</a>) As part of the effort to provide improved facilities, reduce fragmented operations, and &quot;decompress&quot; the work force, the 
FANX 2 and FANX 3 Buildings underwent complete renovations, with FANX 2 housing the National Cryptologic Training 
Facility (NCS), and FANX 3 serving as the second campus for the Information Systems Security Organization. All 
INFOSEC resources in the Parkway Center and Airport Square Buildings 10, 11, and 20, as well as select elements from 
OPS 3, were consolidated w ith existing INFOSEC elements at FANX 3, and all non-INFOSEC elements were relocated 
either within the Airport Square Complex or back to Fort Meade. </p>
<p>Renovations on the two-story FANX 2 Building were completed in the second quarter of FY94. As well as meeting all 
Federal accessibility standards, it provided the NCS with 100 classrooms of different sizes; space for nonsecure training; 
space for a satell ite training/video center; and a 300-seat auditorium. A state of the art thermal ice storage system to supply 
air conditioning, raised floor throughout, a sprinkler system, a central fire alarm system, a public address system, and 20 
transport rooms to en hance communications distribution were also provided. </p>
<p>The FANX 3 design was completed in October 1993. Construction began in January 1994 with planned completion in July 
1996. Final move-in of INFOSEC personnel will take place in January 1997. FANX 3 renovations include an ice storage 
HVAC system, primary po wer, and energy efficient modular lighting. In addition, FANX 3 will be equipped with a highrise 
fire detection and prevention system, new elevators, select TEMPEST protection, and an emergency generator. </p>
<p>INFOSEC will occupy all operational space in FANX 3 with the exception of the utility infrastructure and support services on 
the first floor. While all support services will remain, several will be moved to accommodate utility expansion and installation o 
f the Confirm System in the inner lobby. A joint Facilities Engineering/Corps of Engineers/INFOSEC FANX 3 design and 
construction center has been opened in Room B1119E of FANX 3. </p>
<p>As many as 12,000 NSA personnel are housed in 1 million square feet of leased space at the Friendship Annex at Airport 
Square Technology Park and Industrial Park near the Baltimore Washington International airport (<a href="#6">6</a>). The Friendship Ann ex 
is connected to Ft. Meade and other Washington area facilities through the Washington Area Wideband System (WAWS), a

<p>This listing is compiled based in part on information provided in confidence or anonymously. The Dallas entry was based on 
information supplied by an individual who indicated that during the summer of 1994 the NSA advertised employment 
opportunities a Dallas newspaper, with the advertisement noting that a certain number of Cray C916's were being installed at 
a Dallas site, with a planned increase in 1995 to the current number. As this listing is widely publicized on the internet, reader 
feedback usually corrects erroneous entries, and thus far this listing has not been disputed. In addition, the total number of 
Cray C916's in the world (all of which are included in this listing) is consistent with published production of this computer by 
inclusion of the computers at the Dallas facility.</p>
<p>E-Systems has two facilities in the Dallas vicinity (E-Systems, Inc. Form 10-K, For the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 
1994, Securities and Exchange Commission File Number 1-5237). Buildings at the Greenville TX facility cover 2,936,000 
square feet, with activities including offices, engineering, research and development, production: airborne electronic systems 
installation, and aircraft overhaul and maintenance. The Garland TX facility has 1,407,000 square feet of building, including 
offices, engineering, research and development, production facilities: radiation laboratory, electronic components, high 
powered transmitters, and radar antennas and other products.</p>
<p>It would seem that the NSA Crays are at one or the other site, most likely the Greenville site, which would seem to be the 
SIGINT side of the company (Garland appears to be the defense electronics (ie non SIGINT) side of the company, and thus 
the Crays are out at Greenville.) However, the 10-K form also lists: &quot;Other Properties&quot; with a total of 1,243,000 square feet, 
including offices, production and depot maintenance of electronic, equipment and systems. This includes approximately 
899,000 square feet at various locations owned by the United States Government and operated by the Company. These 
would appear to be depot maintenance for RIVET JOINT and other airborne SIGINT systems, but it cannot be excluded 
that this also includes some unacknowledged NSA facility where all the Crays have been stashed (such as perhaps the overly 
large Federal Building in downtown Dallas??).</p>
<p><a href="rsoc.gif"><b>REGIONAL SIGINT OPERATIONS CENTERS</b></a><b> / SATELLITE INTERCEPT OPERATIONS</b> </p>
<p>Army national SIGINT responsibilities include management of the creation and operation of the Regional SIGINT Operations 
Centers (RSOC) at Fort Gordon, GA, Bad Aibling Station, Germany, and Menwith Hill Station, England, as well as 
continued Army support to the National Security Agency (NSA) and its worldwide mission stations (<a href="#10">10</a>). Other RSOC 
locations include the Lackland Air Force Base Training Annex, in San Antonio, Texas, which supports Southern Command, 
and Pacific Command support from Kunia on Oahu, Hawaii. </p>
<p>The National Security Agency operates a global network of ground stations for the interception of civil and military satellite 
communications traffic (<a href="#11">11</a>). </p>
<p>Bad Aibling Kasserne, Germany, conducts satellite communications interception activities, and is also a downlink station for 
geostationary SIGINT satellites. </p>
<p>Menwith Hill, located 13 kilometers west of Harrogate, UK, collects against Russian satellite communications under Project 
MOONPENNY, and is also a downlink station for geostationary SIGINT satellites. </p>
<p>Misawa Air Base, Misawa, Japan, satellite communications intercept activities include collecting against Russian Molniya, 
Raduga and Gorizont systems under project LADYLOVE at a facility 6 kilometers northwest of the main airfield, known as 
the &quot;Hill. &quot; </p>
<p>Rosman Communications Research Station, near Rosman, NC, has a total of twelve antennas for satellite communications 
interception, for communications connectivity with other intelligence facilities, and possibly also for downlinks from 
geostationary S IGINT satellites. </p>
<p>Sugar Grove Naval Communications Facility, near Sugar Grove, WV, intercepts Pacific INTELSAT/COMSAT satellite 
communications traffic routed through the COMSAT ground station at Etam, WV. This facility has four antenna, with 
diameters of 9.2, 18.5, 32. 3 and 46 meters. </p>
<p>Yakima Research Station, near Yakima, WA, intercepts Pacific INTELSAT/COMSAT satellite communications traffic. </p>
<p>Additional COMSAT intercept activities are conducted at Geraldton, Australia, and Bude, in Corwall, UK. The Bad Aibling 
and Menwith Hill facilities are also used for downlink of high altitude SIGINT satellite product, as are facilities at Pine Gap, 
Austra lia, and Buckley Air National Guard Base, Colorado. </p>
<p>Other NSA facilities, including: Clark AFB, Phillipines; Sinope, Turkey; Heraulion, Greece; Berlin, Germany; and Eielson 
AFB, AK, have closed, with others, such as San Vito dei Normani, Italy, have transfered to other agencies (in this case, to 
Air Force Space Command) (<a href="#12">12</a>). </p>
<p><b>National SIGINT Operations Center (NSOC)</b><br>
Ft. Meade, MD </p>
<p>The NSA National SIGINT Operations Center (NSOC) provides round-the-clock continuous service and support to 
customers through a worldwide communications network. NSOC is provided with the most modern integrated data and 
telecommunication infrastructure po ssible to meet the real time requirements of military and other intelligence consumers at 
every echelon (<a href="#13">13</a>). </p>
<p><b>Medina Regional SIGINT Operations Center (RSOC)</b><br>
Lackland (Medina) Training Annex<br>
San Antonio, TX (<a href="#14">14</a>) </p>
<p>The 19 August 1993 activation of the Medina Regional SIGINT Operations Center (RSOC) at the Lackland Training Annex 
(also known as the Medina Training Annex) in San Antonio, was a direct result of the end of the Cold War, which confronted 
the intelligence community with a downsizing force structure and withdrawal of forces deployed overseas. The Medina RSOC 
consolidates SIGINT assets, analytical databases, and experience personnel from various locations. It also provided tactical 
analysts an environment t o keep their cryptologic skills sharp, supporting a pool of capable people which can deploy 
wherever they are needed. By 1996, over 1,000 Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and National Security Agency 
civilian personnel will work at Medina. This consol idated SIGINT joint environment improved the ability to deliver timely, 
tailored intelligence to customers. </p>
<p><b>CONUS-based Regional Operations Facility (CROF)/<br>
Regional SIGINT Operations Center (RSOC)<br>
</b>513th Military Intelligence Brigade<br>
Fort Cordon, (<a href="#15">15</a>) </p>
<p>In early 1993 the relocation of the 513th Military Intelligence Brigade's from Fort Monmouth New Jersey to Fort Cordon, 
Georgia was initiated. Under the terms of the AR 5-10 Study, the 513th will be developed into a power projection support 
element. As pa rt of this process, the NSA established a CONUS-based Regional Operations Facility (CROF) at Fort 
Gordon. The Regional SIGINT Operations Center uses current operations and troop facilities as well as a new 38,000 
square-fool building to support 300 Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps SIGINT personnel. The CBOF incorporates 
tactical and strategic units through TROJAN and other satellite networks to support requirements from theater commanders 
and Joint Task Force (JTF) components, as well as intelligenc e preparation of the battlefield. TROJAN SPIRIT supports 
split-based connectivity between CONUS-based processing and production centers and forward-deployed forces. </p>
<p><a href="menwith.gif"><b>Menwith Hill</b></a><br>
Harrowgate, UK </p>
<p>Menwith Hill in the UK is the principal NATO theater ground segment node for high altitude signals intelligence satellites (<a href="#16">16</a>) . 
Although this facility is jointly operated with the UK's General Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), GCHQ i s not privy 
to the intelligence down-linked to Menwith Hill, since tapes containing the data are returned via air to the United States for 
analysis. </p>
<p>Menwith Hill Station was established in 1956 by the US Army Security Agency (ASA). Inside the closely-guarded 560 acre 
base are two large operations blocks and many satellite tracking dishes and domes. Initial operations focused on monitoring 
internationa l cable and microwave communications passing through Britain. In the early 1960s Menwith Hill was one of the 
first sites in the world to receive sophisticated early IBM computers, with which NSA automated the labor-intensive watch-list 
scrutiny of interc epted but unenciphered telex messages. Since then, Menwith Hill has sifted the international messages, 
telegrams, and telephone calls of citizens, corporations or governments to select information of political, military or economic 
value to the United St ates. </p>
<p>Every detail of Menwith Hill's operations has been kept an absolute secret. The official cover story is that the all-civilian base 
is a Department of Defense communications station. The British Ministry of Defence describe Menwith Hill as a 
&quot;communicatio ns relay centre.&quot; Like all good cover stories, this has a strong element of truth to it. Until 1974, Menwith Hill's 
Sigint specialty was evidently the interception of International Leased Carrier signals, the communications links run by civil 
agencies -- the Post, Telegraph and Telephone ministries of eastern and western European countries. The National Security 
Agency took over Menwith Hill in 1966. Interception of satellite communications began at Menwith Hill as early as 1974, 
when the first of more th an eight large satellite communications dishes were installed. </p>
<p>In 1984, British Telecom and MoD staff completed a $25 million extension to Menwith Hill Station known as 
STEEPLEBUSH. The British government constructed new communications facilities and buildings for STEEPLEBUSH, 
worth L7.4 million. The expansion plan i ncludes a 50,000 square foot extension to the Operations Building and new 
generators to provide 5 Megawatts of electrical power. The purpose of the new construction was to boost an cater for an 
'expanded mission' of satellite surveillance. It also provide s a new (satellite) earth terminal system to support the classified 
systems at the site. With another $17.2 million being spent on special monitoring equipment, this section of the Menwith Hill 
base alone cost almost $160 million dollars. </p>
<p><b>Rosman Research Station</b><br>
Rosman, NC </p>
<p>The Rosman Research Station is located in the Pisgah National Forest of North Carolina's Smoky Mountains, near Balsam 
Grove, NC, off Route 215 approximately 11 kilometers north of Route 64. The station, which closed in 1994, was operated 
by approximately 250 NSA, Bendix Field Engineering and TRW employees. </p>
<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration began operations at the Rosman Spaceflight Tracking Station in 1963, 
and ceased activities there in January 1981. During NASA's tenure the station supported a number of space projects, 
including the Apollo and Apollo-Soyuz missions. The station at Rosman was turned over to the General Services 
Administration by NASA on 1 February 1981. The facility was converted by the Department of Defense for use as a 
Communications Research Station, a process which was completed in early July 1981. Initially there were approximately 35 
contract personnel living in the area, but when the project became operational in July, this number increased to approximately 
75 employees. The NSA role at Rosman apparently began almost immediately thereafter. By 1985 this number was reported 
to have grown to 250 employees, with annual payroll at $5 million, an average of $20,000 a year [<i>The Asheville Citizen 20 
June 1985</i>]. For FY85 NSA requested $500,000 for construction of an e lectric substation to provide additional electric 
transformer capacity that is required to support station operations. It is difficult to ascertain the total number of satellite 
receiving antenna at the facility. These at least include two very large dish es, approximately 27.5 feet in diameter (the size of 
the biggest dish left by NASA), and a smaller 6.2 meter radome. </p>
<p>The Rosman Station was used to intercept telephone and other communications traffic carried by commercial and other 
communications satellites in geostationary orbit over the Western hemisphere. Potential targets of interest could include Latin 
American mi litary, diplomatic and commercial traffic as well as domestic US traffic and drug traffickers in the Caribbean. </p>

<h1 align=center><a href="organ.gif">ORGANIZATION AND FUNCTIONS</a></h1>
<hr size=3>
<p>(<a href="#1">1</a>) Subject to the provisions of National Security Council Intelligence Directive No. 6 (NSCID No. 6), and the National 
Security Act of 1947, as amended, and pursuant to the authorities vested in the Secretary of Defense, the National Sec urity 
Agency is a sep arately organized agency within the Department of Defense under the direction, supervision funding, 
maintenance and operation of the Secretary of Defense. </p>
<p>The National Security Agency is a unified organization structured to provide for the Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) mission of 
the United States and to insure secure communications systems for all departments and agencies of the US Government. The 
Central Security Service will conduct collection, processing and other SIGINT operations as assigned. </p>
<p>Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) is a category of intelligence information comprising all Communications Intelligence (COMINT), 
Electronics Intelligence (ELINT), and Telemetry Intelligence (TELINT). </p>
<p>COMINT is technical and intelligence information derived from foreign communication by other than the intended recipients. 
COMINT is produced by the collection and processing of foreign communications passed by electromagnetic means, with 
specific excepti ons stated below, and by the processing of foreign encrypted communications, however transmitted. 
Collection comprises search, intercept, and direction finding. Processing comprises range estimation, transmitter/operator 
identification, signal analysis, t raffic analysis, cryptanalysts, decryption, study of plain text, the fusion of these processes, and 
the reporting of results. COMINT does not include: intercept and processing of unencrypted written communications, except 
the processing of written plain t ext versions of communications which have been encrypted or are intended for subsequent 
encryption. Intercept and processing of press, propaganda and other public broadcasts, except for processing encrypted or 
&quot;hidden meaning&quot; passages in such broadcasts ; oral and wire interceptions conducted under DoD Directive 5200.24; or 
censorship. </p>
<p>ELINT is technical and intelligence information derived from foreign, non-communications, electromagnetic radiations 
emanating from other than atomic detonation or radioactive sources. ELINT is produced by the collection (observation and 
recording), and t he processing for subsequent intelligence purposes of that information. </p>
<p>TELINT is technical and intelligence information derived from the intercept, processing, and analysis of foreign telemetry. </p>
<p>SIGINT operational control is the authoritative direction of SIGINT activities, including tasking and allocation of effort, and 
the authoritative prescription of those uniform techniques and standards by which SIGINT information is collected, processed 
an d reported. SIGINT resources comprise unit, activities and organizational elements engaged in the conduct of SIGINT 
(COMINT, ELINT or TELINT) activities. </p>
<p>The National Security Agency consists of a Director, a Headquarters, and such subordinate units, elements, facilities, and 
activities as are assigned to the National Security Agency by the Secretary of Defense as the executive agent of the 
Government for the conduct of SIGINT. </p>
<p>The NSA provides technical guidance to all SIGINT or SIGINT-related operations of the Government. It formulates 
programs, plans, policies, procedures and principles, and manages assigned SIGINT resources, personnel and programs. </p>
<p>NSA produces and disseminates SIGINT in accordance with the objectives, requirements and priorities established by the 
Director of Central Intelligence. This function does not include the production and dissemination of finished intelligence which 
are th e responsibilities of departments and agencies other than the National Security Agency / Central Security Service.) </p>
<p>In relation to the Department of Defense SIGINT activities, NSA prepares and submits to the Secretary of Defense a 
consolidated program and budget, and requirements for military and civilian manpower, logistic and communications support, 
and research, de velopment, test and evaluation, together with his recommendations pertaining thereto. NSA conducts 
research, development and systems design to meet the needs of the National Security Agency / Central Security Service and 
coordinate with the departments an d agencies their related research, development, test and evaluation in the SIGINT field. 
The Agency determines and submits to the Secretary of Defense logistic support requirements for the National Security 
Agency, and the Central Security Service, togeth er with specific recommendations as to what each of the responsible 
departments and agencies of the Government should supply. </p>
<p>It also develops requisite security rules, regulations and standards governing operating practices in accordance with the 
policies of the US Intelligence Board and the US Communications Security Board. The Director prescribes within the field of 
authorize d operations requisite security regulations covering operating practices, including the transmission, handling, and 
distribution of SIGINT material within and among the elements under his control; and exercise the necessary monitoring and 
supervisory cont rol to ensure compliance with the regulations. </p>
<p>The Director makes reports and furnish information to the US Intelligence Board or the US Communications Security Board, 
as required. The Director also responds to the SIGINT requirements of all DoD components and other departments and 
agencies, eliminate s unwarranted duplication of SIGINT efforts, standardizes SIGINT equipment and facilities wherever 
practicable, and provides for production and procurement of SIGINT equipments. </p>
<p>NSA provides the Director of Central Intelligence through the Secretary of Defense with such information as required on the 
past, current and propose plans, programs, and costs of the SIGINT activities under the Agency's control. It also provides 
guidance to the military departments to effect and insure sound and adequate military and civilian SIGINT career development 
and training programs, and conduct, or otherwise provide for, necessary specialized and advanced SIGINT training. The 
Agency provides tech nical advice and support to enhance SIGINT arrangements with foreign governments, and conduct, as 
authorized, SIGINT exchanges with foreign governments. </p>
<p><a href="ccs.gif"><b>CENTRAL SECURITY SERVICE</b></a> </p>
<p>The Central Security Service is comprised of a Chief, Central Security Service, a Deputy Chief, jointly staffed headquarters, 
Army, Navy/Marine Corps and Air Force operating elements, and such other subordinate elements and facilities as may be 
assigned t o the Central Security Service by the Secretary of Defense. </p>
<p>The Director, National Security Agency, is also the Chief, Central Security Service. The Director of the National Security 
Agency/Chief, Central Security Service has a Deputy Director for the National Security Agency and a Deputy Chief, Central 
Security S ervice. To provide continuity in SIGINT matters, the Deputy Director, National Security Agency, is a technically 
experienced civilian. The Deputy Chief, Central Security Service, is a commissioned officer of the military Services, of not less 
than two sta r rank, designated by the Secretary of Defense. The Deputy Chief is normally not be selected from the same 
military Service as the Chief. The Director and Deputy Director of the National Security Agency are designated by the 
Secretary of Defense, subject to the approval of the President. The Director is a commissioned officer of the military Services, 
on active or reactivated status, and enjoys not less than three star rank during the period of his incumbency. </p>
<p>The Director, National Security Agency/Chief, Central Security Service reports to the Secretary of Defense. </p>
<p>The Commanders of the Service cryptologic organizations and their subordinate activities which conduct SIGINT operations 
are subordinate to the Chief, Central Security Service, for all matters involving SIGINT activities. In this role they are 
designated as Service element Commanders and subordinate activities of the Central Security Service. The Service 
cryptologic organizations will remain in their parent Services, for the purpose of administrative and logistic support. The 
Secretary of Defense with the advice of the Joint Chiefs of Staff may specifically designate other SIGINT related resources of 
the Department of Defense which will be subordinate to the Chief, Central Security Service for SIGINT operations. </p>
<p>Subject to the direction, authority and control of the Secretary of Defense, the Director, National Security Agency/Chief, 
Central Security Service accomplish the SIGINT mission of the National Security Agency/Central Security Service. The 
Director acts a s principal SIGINT advisor to the Secretary of Defense, the Director of Central Intelligence, and the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff. As principal SIGINT advisor to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Director, National Security Agency keeps the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff f ully informed on SIGINT matters. </p>
<p>The Director exercises SIGINT operational control over SIGINT activities of the US Government to respond most effectively 
to military and other SIGINT requirements. In the case of mobile military SIGINT platforms, the Director shall state 
movement require ments through appropriate channels to the military commanders, which retain responsibility for operational 
command of the vehicle. </p>
<p>Subject to the authority, direction and control of the Secretary of Defense, the Director, National Security Agency / Chief, 
Central Security Service, is specifically delegated authority to exercise SIGINT operational control over SIGINT activities of 
the United States, issue directives to any operating elements such instructions and orders necessary to carry out his 
responsibilities and functions, and have direct access to, and direct communications with, any element of the US Government 
performing SIGINT functions. </p>
<p>The NSA Director may adjust as required, through the Service cryptologic organizations, personnel resources under SIGINT 
operational control, and centralize or consolidate SIGINT operations for which he is responsible to the extent desirable, 
consistent w ith efficiency, economy, effectiveness, and support to field commanders. The Director submits, as appropriate, 
concurrent letter of evaluation efficiency / fitness reports on the commanders of subordinate elements of the Central Security 
Service in accord ance with parent Service procedures, and delegates SIGINT operational tasking of specified SIGINT 
resources and facilities for such periods and for such operational tasks as required or as directed by the Secretary of Defense. </p>
<p>NSA prescribes SIGINT procedures for activities to whom he provides technical guidance, and prescribe, reviews and 
approves security rules, regulations and instructions. It conducts the SIGINT operations undertaken in support of certain 
missions within th e purview of NSCID No. 5, and obtains such information and intelligence material from the departments 
and agencies (military departments, other Department of Defense agencies, or other departments or agencies of the 
Government) as may be necessary for the performance of the National Security Agency / Central Security Service functions. </p>
<p>In the performance of its responsibilities and functions, the National Security Agency / Central Security Service coordinates 
actions, as appropriate, with other DoD components, and other Departments and agencies of the Government. The Agency 
maintains di rect liaison, as appropriate, for the exchange of information and advice in the field of its assigned responsibility 
with other DoD components and other departments and agencies of the Government. It provides for direct liaison by 
representatives of the i ntelligence components of individual departments and agencies regarding interpretation and 
amplification of requirements and priorities within the framework of objectives, requirements, and priorities established by the 
Director of Central Intelligence. </p>
<p>Other DoD components provide support, within their respective fields of responsibility, to the Director, National Security 
Agency / Chief, Central Security Service as may be necessary to carry out assigned responsibilities and functions. The 
National Sec urity Agency / Central Security Service will be authorized such personnel, facilities, funds and other 
administrative support as the Secretary of Defense deems necessary for the performance of its functions. Other DoD 
components shall provide support for the Agency / Service as prescribed in specific directives or support agreements. </p>
<p><b>CENTRAL SECURITY SERVICE COMPONENTS</b></p>
<p>The Naval Security Group Command is the Navy component of the Central Security Service. The Army CSS component is 
the Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM). </p>
<p>&quot;INSCOM organizations which perform national SIGINT functions are being restructured from conventional OCONUS lines 
of sight and HF collection mission units into jointly manned organizations, at CONUS locations, with the access to enemy 
signals provided v ia remote collection technology and communications linkages.... The Army Technical Control and Analysis 
Element (A-TCAE) in the 704th Ml Brigade at Fort Meade will direct the Army's SIGINT exploitation efforts in support of 
operational commanders and nat ional collection needs, and will assist in technical training and support for all Army 
Intelligence forces as part of preparations for deployment.(<a href="#2">2</a>) &quot; </p>
<p>The 694th Intelligence Group (formerly the 694th Intelligence Wing), headquartered at Fort Meade, MD, steers Air Force 
Intelligence Agency's mission operations on the east coast. It is a vital part of AIA's continuing support to national missions in 
suppo rt of US intelligence activities. The Air Force's 694th Intelligence Group (formerly 694th Wing) is the largest military 
unit on Fort Meade. It is subordinate to the <a href="airintell.gif">Air Intelligence Agency</a>, Kelly Air Force Base, Texas. With a widely varied 
mission the 69 4th Intelligence Wing has more than 2,000 officers and airmen within its subordinate units at Fort Meade. In 
addition, the 694th provides operational, technical, administrative and resource management to include representation al 
support to the commander of the Air Intelligence Agency and other government elements in the Washington, DC area. 
Responsible for an integral part of the US worldwide communications network, the unit provides rapid radio relay, secure 
communications an d command, control and communications countermeasures support to US and allied forces. Unit members 
develop and apply techniques and materials designed to ensure that friendly command and control communications are secure 
and protected from enemy counterm easures. The 694th Intelligence Group also advises US and allied commanders on 
procedures and techniques which could be used to counter enemy command and control communications. Additional 
functions include research into electronic phenomena. </p>
<p><b>DIRECTORATES AND GROUPS</b> </p>
<p>Unlike other intelligence organizations such as CIA or DIA, NSA is particularly reticent concerning its internal organizational 
structure. The following description is based on the best available current information. The best comprehensive treatments of 
N SA's organization are found in Jeffrey Richelson's The U.S. Intelligence Community (<i>Ballinger, Cambridge, 1989</i>), and 
James Bamford's The Puzzle Palace (<i>Houghton Mifflin Company, New York, 1982</i>). It was reported (<i>Bill Gertz, 
&quot;Electronic Sp ying Reoriented at NSA,&quot; The Washington Times, 27 January 1992</i>) that the A Group had been 
expanded to include all of Europe, in addition to Eastern Europe and the USSR, and that the B Group, focused on 
Communist Asia, had been combined with the G Grou p, collecting against the Rest of the World. The most detailed insight 
into NSA organization is found in the <b>NSA Employee's Security Manual</b>, posted on the Internet on 6 April 1994 
(grady@netcom.com in igc:alt.pol.org.ns), which provided building lo cations for the security offices of each of the groups, 
among other interesting tidbits. Additional information, primarily related to information security developments, is reported in 
the computer trade press, such as &quot;<i>More Changes at NSA,&quot; Federal Com puter Week, 22 August 1994, page 4.&quot;</i> </p>
<p>The National Security Agency is organized into five <a href="director.gif">Directorates</a>, each of which consists of several groups or elements. The 
<a href="operatio.gif">Operations Directorate</a> is responsible for SIGINT collection and processing. T he <a href="techsyst.gif">Technology and Systems Directorate</a> 
develops new technologies for SIGINT collection and processing. The Information Systems Security Directorate is 
responsible for NSA's communications and information security missions. The Pl ans, Policy and Programs Directorate

<title>NSA: Budget and Personnel</title>

<p align=center>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 align=center>BUDGET AND PERSONNEL</h1>
<hr size=3>
<p>While the CIA budget is regularly the subject of public reports which are generally rather consistent, the NSA budget is less 
frequently subject to press speculation, and published reports vary widely, with some estimates running as high as $10 billion. 
A principal source of confusion is the distinction between NSA proper and the associated military elements of the Central 
Security Service. These service elements have historically been quite expensive, encompassing many thousands of personnel 
at overseas ground stations. In fact, the NSA turns out to be not much larger than that of CIA, and surprisingly, much more 
readily discernable from official public sources. </p>
<p>The annual R-1 and P-1 military budget documents provide total figures for RDT&amp;E and procurement for all Defense 
Agencies, as well as funding for each individual agency, except for NSA and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). Simple 
arithmetic reveals t he total for these two agencies, and since NSA is much larger than DIA, the bulk of this remainder must be 
NSA. Contracts with NSA are routinely announced by the Defense Department, which shyly refers to NSA as the &quot;Maryland 
Procurement Office.&quot; </p>
<p>Unfortunately, there was until recently no &quot;O-1&quot; for the operations and maintenance account, but each year testimony is given 
to Congress which displays the operations and maintenance budget for Defense Agencies. As with the R-1 and P-1, this 
display prov ides a total figure for all Defense Agencies, as well as funding for each individual agency, with a few exceptions. 
One of the amusing examples of the foolish inconsistency with which the &quot;secret&quot; budget is publicly discussed is the 
presentation of the op erations &amp; maintenance budget, which coyly provides an aggregate figure for intelligence and 
communications (about $2.8 billion). This includes NSA and DIA, as well as the Defense Information Systems Agency 
(DISA), which is included in the aggregate to av oid revealing the intelligence portion of this account (a reticence which does 
not extend to the RDT&amp;E and procurement accounts). However, DISA has no reticence in revealing its annual operations and 
maintenance budget (nearly $400 million) in its annual report. Again simple arithmetic reveals the total for DIA and NSA, and 
the bulk of this remainder (about $2 billion) must be NSA. </p>
<p><img src="budcur.jpg" align=bottom> <br>
</p>
<hr size=3>
<p><br>
<img src="budcon.jpg" align=bottom> </p>
<hr size=3>
<p><br>
The operations &amp; maintenance account consists of spending for contractor services, and civilian employees (uniformed service 
members are funded through the military personnel account). NSA reportedly has about 20,000 employees in Maryland, with 
a $831.7 m illion payroll in 1990 (<a href="#1">1</a>). Based on the precedent of other Defense Agencies, most (over 90%) of these are 
civilians. The reported 20,000 civilian employees is consistent with an operations and maintenance budget of about $2 billion, 
as s een by dividing the typical cost of a civilian government employee (about $100,000, which is about equally divided 
between direct pay and purchases of supplies and contract services). These estimates are also consistent with the 
approximately 5 million sq uare feet of NSA office space at Ft. Meade, somewhat less than the Pentagon, which houses 
somewhat more than 20,000 personnel. Other published estimates that NSA has between 38,000 and 52,000 employees 
clearly also include the personnel of the Central Sec urity Service military components, as well as contractor personnel (<a href="#2">2</a>) . 
As many as 12,000 of these personnel are housed at the Friendship Annex at Airport Squares near the Baltimore Washington 
International airport.(<a href="#3">3</a>) </p>

<title>NSA Handbook</title>
<h1>NSA Handbook</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Security Guidelines</h2>
<p>
<meta name="keywords" content="nsa security manual, national security agency manual, secret"> 
This handbook is designed to introduce you to some of the basic
security principles and procedures with which all NSA employees must comply.
It highlights some of your security responsibilities, and provides guidelines
for answering questions you may be asked concerning your association with this
Agency.  Although you will be busy during the forthcoming weeks learning your
job, meeting co-workers, and becoming accustomed to a new work environment, you
are urged to become familiar with the security information contained in this
handbook.  Please note that a listing of telephone numbers is provided at the
end of this handbook should you have any questions or concerns.
<p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
In joining NSA you have been given an opportunity to participate in the
activities of one of the most important intelligence organizations of the United
States Government.  At the same time, you have also assumed a trust which
carries with it a most important individual responsibility--the safeguarding of
sensitive information vital to the security of our nation.
<p>
While it is impossible to estimate in actual dollars and cents the value of the
work being conducted by this Agency, the information to which you will have
access at NSA is without question critically important to the defense of the
United States.  Since this information may be useful only if it is kept secret,
it requires a very special measure of protection.  The specific nature of this
protection is set forth in various Agency security regulations and directives.
The total NSA Security Program, however, extends beyond these regulations.  It
is based upon the concept that security begins as a state of mind.  The program
is designed to develop an appreciation of the need to protect information vital
to the national defense, and to foster the development of a level of awareness
which will make security more than routine compliance with regulations.
<p>
At times, security practices and procedures cause personal inconvenience.  They
take time and effort and on occasion may make it necessary for you to
voluntarily forego some of your usual personal perogatives.  But your
compensation for the inconvenience is the knowledge that the work you are
accomplishing at NSA, within a framework of sound security practices,
contributes significantly to the defense and continued security of the United
States of America.
<p>
I extend to you my very best wishes as you enter upon your chosen career or
assignment with NSA.
<p>
<b>Philip T. Pease<br>
Director of Security</b>
<p>
<p>
<h2>INITIAL SECURITY RESPONSIBILITIES</h2>
<p>
<h3>Anonymity</h3>
<p>
Perhaps one of the first security practices with which new NSA personnel should
become acquainted is the practice of anonymity. In an open society such as ours,
this practice is necessary because information which is generally available to
the public is available also to hostile intelligence.  Therefore, the Agency
mission is best accomplished apart from public attention.  Basically, anonymity
means that NSA personnel are encouraged not to draw attention to themselves nor
to their association with this Agency.  NSA personnel are also cautioned neither
to confirm nor deny any specific questions about NSA activities directed to them
by individuals not affiliated with the Agency.
<p>
The ramifications of the practice of anonymity are rather far reaching, and its
success depends on the cooperation of all Agency personnel.  Described below you
will find some examples of situations that you may encounter concerning your
employment and how you should cope with them.  Beyond the situations cited, your
judgement and discretion will become the deciding factors in how you respond to
questions about your employment.
<p>
<h3>Answering Questions About Your Employment</h3>
<p>
Certainly, you may tell your family and friends that you are employed at or
assigned to the National Security Agency.  There is no valid reason to deny them
this information.  However, you may not disclose to them any information
concerning specific aspects of the Agency's mission, activities, and
organization.  You should also ask them not to publicize your association with
NSA.
<p>
Should strangers or casual acquaintances question you about your place of
employment, an appropriate reply would be that you work for the Department of
Defense.  If questioned further as to where you are employed within the
Department of Defense, you may reply, "NSA."  When you inform someone that you
work for NSA (or the Department of Defense) you may expect that the next
question will be, "What do you do?"  It is a good idea to anticipate this
question and to formulate an appropriate answer.  Do not act mysteriously about
your employment, as that would only succeed in drawing more attention to
yourself.
<p>
If you are employed as a secretary, engineer, computer scientist, or in a
clerical, administrative, technical, or other capacity identifiable by a general
title which in no way indicates how your talents are being applied to the
mission of the Agency, it is suggested that you state this general title.  If
you are employed as a linguist, you may say that you are a linguist, if
necessary.  However, you should not indicate the specific language(s) with which
you are involved.
<p>
The use of service specialty titles which tend to suggest or reveal the nature of
the Agency's mission  or specific aspects of their work.  These professional
titles, such as cryptanalyst, signals collection officer, and intelligence
research analyst, if given verbatim to an outsider, would likely generate
further questions which may touch upon the classified aspects of your work.
Therefore, in conversation with outsiders, it is suggested that such job titles
be generalized.  For example, you might indicate that you are a "research
analyst."  You may not, however, discuss the specific nature of your analytic
work.
<p>
<h3>Answering Questions About Your Agency Training</h3>
<p>
During your career or assignment at NSA, there is a good chance that you will
receive some type of job-related training.  In many instances the nature of the
training is not classified.  However, in some situations the specialized
training you receive will relate directly to sensitive Agency functions.  In
such cases, the nature of this training may not be discussed with persons
outside of this Agency.
<p>
If your training at the Agency includes language training, your explanation for
the source of your linguistic knowledge should be that you obtained it while
working for the Department of Defense.
<p>
You Should not draw undue attention to your language abilities, and you may not
discuss how you apply your language skill at the Agency.
<p>
If you are considering part-time employment which requires the use of language
or technical skills similar to those required for the performance of your NSA
assigned duties, you must report (in advance) the anticipated part-time work
through your Staff Security Officer (SSO) to the Office of Security's Clearance
Division (M55).
<p>
<h3>Verifying Your Employment</h3>
<p>
On occasion, personnel must provide information concerning their employment to
credit institutions in connection with various types of applications for credit.
In such situations you may state, if you are a civilian employee, that you are
employed by NSA and indicate your pay grade or salary.  Once again, generalize
your job title.  If any further information is desired by persons or firms with
whom you may be dealing, instruct them to request such information by
correspondence addressed to:  Director of Civilian Personnel, National Security
Agency, Fort George G. Meade, Maryland 20755-6000.  Military personnel should
use their support group designator and address when indicating their current
assignment.
<p>
If you contemplate leaving NSA for employment elsewhere, you may be required to
submit a resume/job application, or to participate in extensive employment
interviews.  In such circumstances, you should have your resume reviewed by the
Classification Advisory Officer (CAO) assigned to your organization.  Your CAO
will ensure that any classified operational details of your duties have been
excluded and will provide you with an unclassified job description.  Should you
leave the Agency before preparing such a resume, you may develop one and send it
by registered mail to the NSA/CSS Information Policy Division (Q43) for review.
Remember, your obligation to protect sensitive Agency information extends
beyond your employment at NSA.
<p>
<h3>The Agency And Public News Media</h3>
<p>
From time to time you may find that the agency is the topic of reports or
articles appearing in public news media--newspapers, magazines, books, radio
and TV.  The NSA/CSS Information Policy Division (Q43) represents the Agency in
matters involving the press and other media.  This office serves at the
Agency's official media center and is the Director's liaison office for public
relations, both in the community and with other government agencies.  The
Information Policy Division must approve the release of all information for and
about NSA, its mission, activities, and personnel.  In order to protect the
aspects of Agency operations, NSA personnel must refrain from either confirming
or denying any information concerning the Agency or its activities which may
appear in the public media.  If you are asked about the activities of NSA, the
best response is "no comment."  You should the notify Q43 of the attempted
inquiry.  For the most part, public references to NSA are based upon educated
guesses.  The Agency does not normally make a practice of issuing public
statements about its activities.
<p>
<h2>GENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES</h2>
<p>
<h3>Espionage And Terrorism</h3>
<p>
During your security indoctrination and throughout your NSA career you will
become increasingly aware of the espionage and terrorist threat to the United
States.  Your vigilance is the best single defense in protecting NSA
information, operations, facilities and people.  Any information that comes to
your attention that suggests to you the existence of, or potential for,
espionage or terrorism against the U.S. or its allies must be promptly reported
by you to the Office of Security.
<p>
There should be no doubt in your mind about the reality of the threats.  You
are now affiliated with the most sensitive agency in government and are
expected to exercise vigilance and common sense to protect NSA against these
threats.
<p>
<h3>Classification</h3>
<p>
Originators of correspondence, communications, equipment, or documents within
the Agency are responsible for ensuring that the proper classification,
downgrading information and, when appropriate, proper caveat notations are
assigned to such material.  (This includes any handwritten notes which contain
classified information).  The three levels of classification are Confidential,
Secret and Top Secret.  The NSA Classification Manual should be used as
guidance in determining proper classification.  If after review of this document
you need assistance, contact the Classification Advisory Officer (CAO) assigned
to your organization, or the Information Policy Division (Q43).
<p>
<h3>Need-To-Know</h3>
<p>
Classified information is disseminated only on a strict "need-to-know" basis.
The "need-to-know" policy means that classified information will be
disseminated only to those individuals who, in addition to possessing a proper
clearance, have a requirement to know this information in order to perform
their official duties (need-to-know).  No person is entitled to classified
information solely by virtue of office, position, rank, or security clearance.
<p>
All NSA personnel have the responsibility to assert the "need-to-know" policy
as part of their responsibility to protect sensitive information.
Determination of "need-to-know" is a supervisory responsibility.  This means
that if there is any doubt in your mind as to an individual's "need-to-know,"
you should always check with your supervisor before releasing any classified
material under your control.
<p>
<h3>For Official Use Only</h3>
<p>
Separate from classified information is information or material marked "FOR
OFFICIAL USE ONLY" (such as this handbook).  This designation is used to
identify that official information or material which, although unclassified, is
exempt from the requirement for public disclosure of information concerning
government activities and which, for a significant reason, should not be given
general circulation.  Each holder of "FOR OFFICAL USE ONLY" (FOUO) information
or material is authorized to disclose such information or material to persons
in other departments or agencies of the Executive and Judicial branches when it
is determined that the information or material is required to carry our a
government function.  The recipient must be advised that the information or
material is not to be disclosed to the general public.  Material which bears
the "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY" caveat does not come under the regulations
governing the protection of classified information.  The unauthorized
disclosure of information marked "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY" does not constitute an
unauthorized disclosure of classified defense information.  However, Department
of Defense and NSA regulations prohibit the unauthorized disclosure of
information designated "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY."  Appropriate administrative
action will be taken to determine responsibility and to apply corrective and/or
disciplinary measures in cases of unauthorized disclosure of information which
bears the "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY" caveat.  Reasonable care must be exercised in
limiting the dissemination of "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY" information.  While you
may take this handbook home for further study, remember that is does contain
"FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY" information which should be protected.
<p>
<h3>Prepublication Review</h3>
<p>
All NSA personnel (employees, military assignees, and contractors) must submit
for review any planned articles, books, speeches, resumes, or public statements
that may contain classified, classifiable, NSA-derived, or unclassified
protected information, e.g., information relating to the organization, mission,
functions, or activities of NSA.  Your obligation to protect this sensitive
information is a lifetime one.  Even when you resign, retire, or otherwise end
your affiliation with NSA, you must submit this type of material for
prepublication review.  For additional details, contact the Information Policy
Division (Q43) for an explanation of prepublication review procedures.
<p>
<h3>Personnel Security Responsibilities</h3>
<p>
Perhaps you an recall your initial impression upon entering an NSA facility.
Like most people, you probably noticed the elaborate physical security
safeguards--fences, concrete barriers, Security Protective Officers,
identification badges, etc.  While these measures provide a substantial degree
of protection for the information housed within our buildings, they represent
only a portion of the overall Agency security program.  In fact, vast amounts
of information leave our facilities daily in the minds of NSA personnel, and
this is where our greatest vulnerability lies.  Experience has indicated that
because of the vital information we work with at NSA, Agency personnel may
become potential targets for hostile intelligence efforts.  Special safeguards
are therefore necessary to protect our personnel.
<p>
Accordingly, the Agency has an extensive personnel security program which
establishes internal policies and guidelines governing employee conduct and
activities.  These policies cover a variety of topics, all of which are
designed to protect both you and the sensitive information you will gain
through your work at NSA.
<p>
Association With Foreign Nationals
<p>
As a member of the U.S. Intelligence Community and by virtue of your access to
sensitive information, you are a potential target for hostile intelligence
activities carried out by or on behalf of citizens of foreign
countries.  A policy concerning association with foreign nationals has been
established by the Agency to minimize the likelihood that its personnel might
become subject to undue influence or duress or targets of hostile activities
through foreign relationships.
<p>
As an NSA affiliate, you are prohibited from initiating or maintaining
associations (regardless of the nature and degree) with citizens or officials
of communist-controlled, or other countries which pose a significant threat to
the security of the United States and its interests.  A comprehensive list of
these designated countries is available from your Staff Security Officer or the
Security Awareness Division.  Any contact with citizens of these countries, no
matter how brief or seemingly innocuous, must be reported as soon as possible
to your Staff Security Officer (SSO).  (Individuals designated as Staff
Security Officers are assigned to every organization; a listing of Staff
Security Officers can be found at the back of this handbook).
<p>
Additionally, close and continuing associations with any non-U.S. citizens which
are characterized by ties of kinship, obligation, or affection are prohibited.
A waiver to this policy may be granted only under the most exceptional
circumstances when there is a truly compelling need for an individual's
services or skills and the security risk is negligible.
<p>
In particular, a waiver must be granted in advance of a marriage to or
cohabitation with a foreign national in order to retain one's access to NSA
information.  Accordingly, any intent to cohabitate with or marry a non-U.S.
citizen must be reported immediately to your Staff Security Officer.  If a
waiver is granted, future reassignments both at headquarters and overseas may
be affected.
<p>
The marriage or intended marriage of an immediate family member (parents,
siblings, children) to a foreign national must also be reported through your
SSO to the Clearance Division (M55).
<p>
Casual social associations with foreign nationals (other than those of the
designated countries mentioned above) which arise from normal living and
working arrangements in the community usually do not have to be reported.
During the course of these casual social associations, you are encouraged to
extend the usual social amenities.  Do not act mysteriously or draw attention
to yourself (and possibly to NSA) by displaying an unusually wary attitude.
<p>
Naturally, your affiliation with the Agency and the nature of your work should
not be discussed.  Again, you should be careful not to allow these associations
to become close and continuing to the extent that they are characterized by
ties of kinship, obligation, or affection.
<p>
If at any time you feel that a "casual" association is in any way suspicious,
you should report this to your Staff Security Officer immediately.  Whenever
any doubt exists as to whether or not a situation should be reported or made a
matter of record, you should decided in favor of reporting it.  In this way,
the situation can be evaluated on its own merits, and you can be advised as to
your future course of action.
<p>
<h3>Correspondence With Foreign Nationals</h3>
<p>
NSA personnel are discouraged from initiating correspondence with individuals
who are citizens of foreign countries.  Correspondence with citizens of
communist-controlled or other designated countries is prohibited.  Casual
social correspondence, including the "penpal" variety, with other foreign
acquaintances is acceptable and need not be reported.  If, however, this
correspondence should escalate in its frequency or nature, you should report
that through your Staff Security Officer to the Clearance Division (M55).
<p>
<h3>Embassy Visits</h3>
<p>
Since a significant percentage of all espionage activity is known to be
conducted through foreign embassies, consulates, etc., Agency policy
discourages visits to embassies, consulates or other official establishments of
a foreign government.  Each case, however, must be judged on the circumstances
involved.  Therefore, if you plan to visit a foreign embassy for any reason
(even to obtain a visa), you must consult with, and obtain the prior approval
of, your immediate supervisor and the Security Awareness Division (M56).
<p>
<h3>Amateur Radio Activities</h3>
<p>
Amateur radio (ham radio) activities are known to be exploited by hostile
intelligence services to identify individuals with access to classified
information; therefore, all licensed operators are expected to be familiar
with NSA/CSS Regulation 100-1, "Operation of Amateur Radio Stations" (23
October 1986).  The specific limitations on contacts with operators from
communist and designated countries are of particular importance.  If you are
an amateur radio operator you should advise the Security Awareness Division
(M56) of your amateur radio activities so that detailed guidance may be
furnished to you.
<p>
<h3>Unofficial Foreign Travel</h3>
<p>
In order to further protect sensitive information from possible compromise
resulting from terrorism, coercion, interrogation or capture of Agency
personnel by hostile nations and/or terrorist groups, the Agency has
established certain policies and procedures concerning unofficial foreign
travel.
<p>
All Agency personnel (civilian employees, military assignees, and contractors)
who are planning unofficial foreign travel must have that travel approved by
submitting a proposed itinerary to the Security Awareness Division (M56) at
least 30 working days prior to their planned departure from the United States.
Your itinerary should be submitted on Form K2579 (Unofficial Foreign Travel
Request).  This form provides space for noting the countries to be visited,
mode of travel, and dates of departure and return.  Your immediate supervisor
must sign this form to indicate whether or not your proposed travel poses a
risk to the sensitive information, activities, or projects of which you may
have knowledge due to your current assignment.
<p>
After your supervisor's assessment is made, this form should be forwarded to
the Security Awareness Director (M56).  Your itinerary will then be reviewed in
light of the existing situation in the country or countries to be visited, and
a decision for approval or disapproval will be based on this assessment.  The
purpose of this policy is to limit the risk of travel to areas of the world
where a threat may exist to you and to your knowledge of classified Agency
activities.
<p>
In this context, travel to communist-controlled and other hazardous activity
areas is prohibited.  A listing of these hazardous activity areas is
prohibited.  A listing of these hazardous activity areas can be found in Annex
A of NSA/CSS Regulation No. 30-31, "Security Requirements for Foreign Travel"
(12 June 1987).  From time to time, travel may also be prohibited to certain
areas where the threat from hostile intelligence services, terrorism, criminal
activity or insurgency poses an unacceptable risk to Agency employees and to
the sensitive information they possess.  Advance travel deposits made without
prior agency approval of the proposed travel may result in financial losses by
the employee should the travel be disapproved, so it is important to obtain
approval prior to committing yourself financially.  Questions regarding which
areas of the world currently pose a threat should be directed to the Security
Awareness Division (M56).
<p>
Unofficial foreign travel to Canada, the Bahamas, Bermuda, and Mexico does not
require prior approval, however, this travel must still be reported using Form
K2579.  Travel to these areas may be reported after the fact.
<p>
While you do not have to report your foreign travel once you have ended your
affiliation with the Agency, you should be aware that the risk incurred in
travelling to certain areas, from a personal safety and/or counterintelligence
standpoint, remains high.  The requirement to protect the classified
information to which you have had access is a lifetime obligation.
<p>
<h3>Membership In Organizations</h3>
<p>
Within the United States there are numerous organizations with memberships
ranging from a few to tens of thousands.  While you may certainly participate
in the activities of any reputable organization, membership in any international
club or professional organization/activity with foreign members should be
reported through your Staff Security Officer to the Clearance Division (M55).
In most cases there are no security concerns or threats to our employees or
affiliates.  However, the Office of Security needs the opportunity to research
the organization and to assess any possible risk to you and the information to
which you have access.
<p>
In addition to exercising prudence in your choice of organizational
affiliations, you should endeavor to avoid participation in public activities
of a conspicuously controversial nature because such activities could focus
undesirable attention upon you and the Agency.  NSA employees may, however,
participate in bona fide public affairs such as local politics, so long as such
activities do not violate the provisions of the statutes and regulations which
govern the political activities of all federal employees.  Additional
information may be obtained from your Personnel Representative.
<p>
<h3>Changes In Marital Status/Cohabitation/Names</h3>
<p>
All personnel, either employed by or assigned to NSA, must advise the Office of
Security of any changes in their marital status (either marriage or divorce),
cohabitation arrangements, or legal name changes.  Such changes should be
reported by completing NSA Form G1982 (Report of Marriage/Marital Status
Change/Name Change), and following the instructions printed on the form.
<p>
<h3>Use And Abuse Of Drugs</h3>
<p>
It is the policy of the National Security Agency to prevent and eliminate the
improper use of drugs by Agency employees and other personnel associated with
the Agency.  The term "drugs" includes all controlled drugs or substances
identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended,
which includes but is not limited to:  narcotics, depressants, stimulants,
cocaine, hallucinogens ad cannabis (marijuana, hashish, and hashish oil).
The use of illegal drugs or the abuse of prescription drugs by persons employed
by, assigned or detailed to the Agency may adversely affect the national
security; may have a serious damaging effect on the safety and the safety of
others; and may lead to criminal prosecution.  Such use of drugs either within
or outside Agency controlled facilities is prohibited.
<p>
<h3>Physical Security Policies</h3>
<p>
The physical security program at NSA provides protection for classified
material and operations and ensures that only persons authorized access to the
Agency's spaces and classified material are permitted such access.  This
program is concerned not only with the Agency's physical plant and facilities,
but also with the internal and external procedures for safeguarding the
Agency's classified material and activities.  Therefore, physical security
safeguards include Security Protective Officers, fences, concrete barriers,
access control points, identification badges, safes, and the
compartmentalization of physical spaces.  While any one of these safeguards
represents only a delay factor against attempts to gain unauthorized access to
NSA spaces and material, the total combination of all these safeguards
represents a formidable barrier against physical penetration of NSA.  Working
together with personnel security policies, they provide "security in depth."
<p>
The physical security program depends on interlocking procedures.  The
responsibility for carrying out many of these procedures rests with the
individual.  This means you, and every person employed by, assign, or detailed
to the Agency, must assume the responsibility for protecting classified
material.  Included in your responsibilities are:  challenging visitors in
operational areas; determining "need-to-know;" limiting classified
conversations to approved areas; following established locking and checking
procedures; properly using the secure and non-secure telephone systems;
correctly wrapping and packaging classified data for transmittal; and placing
classified waste in burn bags.
<p>
<h3>The NSA Badge</h3>
<p>
Even before you enter an NSA facility, you have a constant reminder of
security--the NSA badge.  Every person who enters an NSA installation is
required to wear an authorized badge.  To enter most NSA facilities your badge
must be inserted into an Access Control Terminal at a building entrance and you
must enter your Personal Identification Number (PIN) on the terminal keyboard.
In the absence of an Access Control Terminal, or when passing an internal
security checkpoint, the badge should be held up for viewing by a Security
Protective Officer.  The badge must be displayed at all times while the
individual remains within any NSA installation.
<p>
NSA Badges must be clipped to a beaded neck chain.  If necessary for the safety
of those working in the area of electrical equipment or machinery, rubber
tubing may be used to insulate the badge chain.  For those Agency personnel
working in proximity to other machinery or equipment, the clip may be used to
attach the badge to the wearer's clothing, but it must also remain attached to
the chain.
<p>
After you leave an NSA installation, remove your badge from public view, thus
avoiding publicizing your NSA affiliation.  Your badge should be kept in a safe
place which is convenient enough to ensure that you will be reminded to bring it
with you to work.  A good rule of thumb is to afford your badge the same
protection you give your wallet or your credit cards.  DO NOT write your
Personal Identification Number on your badge.
<p>
If you plan to be away from the Agency for a period of more than 30 days, your
badge should be left at the main Visitor Control Center which services your
facility.
<p>
Should you lose your badge, you must report the facts and circumstances
immediately to the Security Operations Center (SOC) (963-3371s/688-6911b) so
that your badge PIN can be deactivated in the Access Control Terminals.  In the
event that you forget your badge when reporting for duty, you may obtain a
"non-retention" Temporary Badge at the main Visitor Control Center which serves
your facility after a co-worker personally identifies your and your clearance
has been verified.
<p>
Your badge is to be used as identification only within NSA facilities or other
government installations where the NSA badge is recognized.  Your badge should
never be used outside of the NSA or other government facilities for the purpose
of personal identification.  You should obtain a Department of Defense
identification card from the Civilian Welfare Fund (CWF) if you need to
identify yourself as a government employee when applying for "government
discounts" offered at various commercial establishments.
<p>
Your badge color indicates your particular affiliation with NSA and your level
of clearance.  Listed below are explanations of the badge colors you are most
likely to see:
<p>
<ul>
   <li>     Green (*)       Fully cleared NSA employees and certain military
                        assignees.
<p>
      <li>  Orange (*)      (or Gold) Fully cleared representative of other
                        government agencies.
<p>
       <li>Black (*)       Fully cleared contractors or consultants.
<p>
        <li>Blue            Employees who are cleared to the SECRET level while
                        awaiting completion of their processing for full
                        (TS/SI) clearance.  These Limited Interim Clearance
                        (LIC) employees are restricted to certain activities
                        while inside a secure area.
<p>
        <li>Red             Clearance level is not specified, so assume the holder
                        is uncleared.
</ul>
<p>
<i>* - Fully cleared status means that the person has been cleared to the Top
Secret (TS) level and indoctrinated for Special Intelligence (SI).</i>
<p>
All badges with solid color backgrounds (permanent badges) are kept by
individuals until their NSA employment or assignment ends.  Striped badges
("non-retention" badges) are generally issued to visitors and are returned to
the Security Protective Officer upon departure from an NSA facility.
<p>
<h3>Area Control</h3>
<p>
Within NSA installations there are generally two types of areas,
Administrative and Secure.  An Administrative Area is one in which storage of
classified information is not authorized, and in which discussions of a
classified nature are forbidden.  This type of area would include the
corridors, restrooms, cafeterias, visitor control areas, credit union, barber
shop, and drugstore.  Since uncleared, non-NSA personnel are often present in
these areas, all Agency personnel must ensure that no classified information is
discussed in an Administrative Area.
<p>
Classified information being transported within Agency facilities must be
placed within envelopes, folders, briefcases, etc. to ensure that its contents
or classification markings are not disclosed to unauthorized persons, or that
materials are not inadvertently dropped enroute.
<p>
The normal operational work spaces within an NSA facility are designated Secure
Areas.  These areas are approved for classified discussions and for the storage
of classified material.  Escorts must be provided if it is necessary for
uncleared personnel (repairmen, etc.) to enter Secure Areas, an all personnel
within the areas must be made aware of the presence of uncleared individuals.
All unknown, unescorted visitors to Secure Areas should be immediately
challenged by the personnel within the area, regardless of the visitors'
clearance level (as indicated by their badge color).
<p>
The corridor doors of these areas must be locked with a deadbolt and all
classified information in the area must be properly secured after normal
working hours or whenever the area is unoccupied.  When storing classified
material, the most sensitive material must be stored in the most secure
containers.  Deadbolt keys for doors to these areas must be returned to the key
desk at the end of the workday.
<p>
For further information regarding Secure Areas, consult the Physical Security
Division (M51) or your staff Security Officer.
<p>
<h3>Items Treated As Classified</h3>
<p>
For purposes of transportation, storage and destruction, there are certain
types of items which must be treated as classified even though they may not
contain classified information.  Such items include carbon paper, vu-graphs,
punched machine processing cards, punched paper tape, magnetic tape, computer
floppy disks, film, and used typewriter ribbons.  This special treatment is
necessary since a visual examination does not readily reveal whether the items
contain classified information.
<p>
<h3>Prohibited Items</h3>
<p>
Because of the potential security or safety hazards, certain items are
prohibited under normal circumstances from being brought into or removed from
any NSA installation.  These items have been groped into two general classes.
Class I prohibited items are those which constitute a threat to the safety and
security of NSA/CSS personnel and facilities.  Items in this category include:
<p>
<ul>
        <li>  Firearms and ammunition
        <li>  Explosives, incendiary substances, radioactive materials, highly
            volatile materials, or other hazardous materials
        <li>  Contraband or other illegal substances
        <li>  Personally owned photographic or electronic equipment including
            microcomputers, reproduction or recording devices, televisions or
            radios.
	    </ul>
<p>
Prescribed electronic medical equipment is normally not prohibited, but
requires coordination with the Physical Security Division (M51) prior to being
brought into any NSA building.
<p>
Class II prohibited items are those owned by the government or contractors
which constitute a threat to physical, technical, or TEMPEST security.
Approval by designated organizational officials is required before these items
can be brought into or removed from NSA facilities.  Examples are:
<p>
<ul>
        <li>  Transmitting and receiving equipment
        <li>  Recording equipment and media
        <li>  Telephone equipment and attachments
        <li>  Computing devices and terminals
        <li>  Photographic equipment and film
	</ul>
<p>
A more detailed listing of examples of Prohibited Items may be obtained from
your Staff Security Officer or the Physical Security Division (M51).
<p>
Additionally, you may realize that other seemingly innocuous items are also
restricted and should not be brought into any NSA facility.  Some of these
items pose a technical threat; others must be treated as restricted since a
visual inspection does not readily reveal whether they are classified.  These
items include:
<p>
<ul>
        <li>  Negatives from processed film; slides; vu-graphs
        <li>  Magnetic media such as floppy disks, cassette tapes, and VCR
            videotapes
        <li>  Remote control devices for telephone answering machines
        <li>  Pagers
	</ul>
<p>
<h3>Exit Inspection</h3>
<p>
As you depart NSA facilities, you will note another physical security
safeguard--the inspection of the materials you are carrying.  This inspection
of your materials, conducted by Security Protective Officers, is designed to
preclude the inadvertent removal of classified material.  It is limited to any
articles that you are carrying out of the facility and may include letters,
briefcases, newspapers, notebooks, magazines, gym bags, and other such items.
Although this practice may involve some inconvenience, it is conducted in your
best interest, as well as being a sound security practice.  The inconvenience
can be considerably reduced if you keep to a minimum the number of personal
articles that you remove from the Agency.
<p>
<h3>Removal Of Material From NSA Spaces</h3>
<p>
The Agency maintains strict controls regarding the removal of material from its
installations, particularly in the case of classified material.
<p>
Only under a very limited and official circumstances classified material be
removed from Agency spaces.  When deemed necessary, specific authorization is
required to permit an individual to hand carry classified material out of an NSA
building to another Secure Area.  Depending on the material and circumstances
involved, there are several ways to accomplish this.
<p>
A Courier Badge authorizes the wearer, for official purposes, to transport
classified material, magnetic media, or Class II prohibited items between NSA
facilities.  These badges, which are strictly controlled, are made available by
the Physical Security Division (M51) only to those offices which have specific
requirements justifying their use.
<p>
An Annual Security Pass may be issued to individuals whose official duties
require that they transport printed classified materials, information storage
media, or Class II prohibited items to secure locations within the local area.
Materials carried by an individual who displays this pass are subject to spot
inspection by Security Protective Officers or other personnel from the Office
of Security.  It is not permissible to use an Annual Security Pass for personal
convenience to circumvent inspection of your personal property by perimeter
Security Protective Officers.
<p>
If you do not have access to a Courier Badge and you have not been issued an
Annual Security Pass, you may obtain a One-Time Security Pass to remove
classified materials/magnetic media or admit or remove prohibited items from an
NSA installation.  These passes may be obtained from designated personnel
in your work element who have been given authority to issue them.  The issuing
official must also contact the Security Operations Center (SOC) to obtain
approval for the admission or removal of a Class I prohibited item.
<p>
When there is an official need to remove government property which is not
magnetic media, or a prohibited or classified item, a One-Time Property Pass is
used.  This type of pass (which is not a Security Pass) may be obtained from
your element custodial property officer.  A Property Pass is also to be used
when an individual is removing personal property which might be reasonably be
mistaken for unclassified Government property.  This pass is surrendered to the
Security Protective Officer at the post where the material is being removed.
Use of this pass does not preclude inspection of the item at the perimeter
control point by the Security Protective Officer or Security professionals to
ensure that the pass is being used correctly.
<p>
<h3>External Protection Of Classified Information</h3>
<p>
On those occasions when an individual must personally transport classified
material between locations outside of NSA facilities, the individual who is
acting as the courier must ensure that the material receives adequate
protection. Protective measures must include double wrapping and packaging of
classified information, keeping the material under constant control, ensuring
the presence of a second appropriately cleared person when necessary, and
delivering the material to authorized persons only.  If you are designated as a
courier outside the local area, contact the Security Awareness Division (M56)
for your courier briefing.
<p>
Even more basic than these procedures is the individual security responsibility
to confine classified conversations to secure areas.  Your home, car pool, and
public places are not authorized areas to conduct classified discussions--even
if everyone involved in he discussion possesses a proper clearance and
"need-to-know."  The possibility that a conversation could be overheard by
unauthorized persons dictates the need to guard against classified discussions
in non-secure areas.
<p>
Classified information acquired during the course of your career or assignment
to NSA may not be mentioned directly, indirectly, or by suggestion in personal
diaries, records, or memoirs.
<p>
<h3>Reporting Loss Or Disclosure Of Classified Information</h3>
<p>
The extraordinary sensitivity of the NSA mission requires the prompt reporting
of any known, suspected, or possible unauthorized disclosure of classified
information, or the discovery that classified information may be lost, or is not
being afforded proper protection.  Any information coming to your attention
concerning the loss or unauthorized disclosure of classified information should
be reported immediately to your supervisor, your Staff Security Officer, or the
Security Operations Center (SOC).
<p>
<h3>Use Of Secure And Non-Secure Telephones</h3>
<p>
Two separate telephone systems have been installed in NSA facilities for use in
the conduct of official Agency business:  the secure telephone system (gray
telephone) and the outside, non-secure telephone system (black telephone).  All
NSA personnel must ensure that use of either telephone system does not
jeopardize the security of classified information.
<p>
The secure telephone system is authorized for discussion of classified
information.  Personnel receiving calls on the secure telephone may assume that
the caller is authorized to use the system.  However, you must ensure that the
caller has a "need-to-know" the information you will be discussing.
<p>
The outside telephone system is only authorized for unclassified official
Agency business calls.  The discussion of classified information is not
permitted on this system.  Do not attempt to use "double-talk" in order to
discuss classified information over the non-secure telephone system.
<p>
In order to guard against the inadvertent transmission of classified
information over a non-secure telephone, and individual using the black
telephone in an area where classified activities are being conducted must
caution other personnel in the area that the non-secure telephone is in use.
Likewise, you should avoid using the non-secure telephone in the vicinity of a
secure telephone which is also in use.
<p>
<h2>HELPFUL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>
<h3>Security Resources</h3>
<p>
In the fulfillment of your security responsibilities, you should be aware that
there are many resources available to assist you.  If you have any questions or
concerns regarding security at NSA or your individual security
responsibilities, your supervisor should be consulted.  Additionally, Staff
Security Officers are appointed to the designated Agency elements to assist
these organizations in carrying out their security responsibilities.  There is
a Staff Security Officer assigned to each organization; their phone numbers are
listed at the back of this handbook.  Staff Security Officers also provide
guidance to and monitor the activities of Security Coordinators and Advisors
(individuals who, in addition to their operational duties within their
respective elements, assist element supervisors or managers in discharging
security responsibilities).
<p>
Within the Office of Security, the Physical Security Division (M51) will offer
you assistance in matters such as access control, security passes, clearance
verification, combination locks, keys, identification badges, technical
security, and the Security Protective Force.  The Security Awareness Division
(M56) provides security guidance and briefings regarding unofficial foreign
travel, couriers, special access, TDY/PCS, and amateur radio activities.  The
Industrial and Field Security Division (M52) is available to provide security
guidance concerning NSA contractor and field site matters.
<p>
The Security Operations Center (SOC) is operated by two Security Duty Officers
(SDOs), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  The SDO, representing the Office of
Security, provides a complete range of security services to include direct
communications with fire and rescue personnel for all Agency area facilities.
The SDO is available to handle any physical or personnel problems that may
arise, and if necessary, can direct your to the appropriate security office
that can assist you.  After normal business hours, weekends, and holidays, the
SOC is the focal point for all security matters for all Agency personnel and
facilities (to include Agency field sites and contractors).  The SOC is located
in Room 2A0120, OPS 2A building and the phone numbers are 688-6911(b),
963-3371(s).
<p>
However, keep in mind that you may contact any individual or any division
within the Office of Security directly.  Do not hesitate to report any
information which may affect the security of the Agency's mission, information,
facilities or personnel.
<p>
<h3>Security-Related Services</h3>
<p>
In addition to Office of Security resources, there are a number of
professional, security-related services available for assistance in answering
your questions or providing the services which you require.
<p>
The Installations and Logistics Organization (L) maintains the system for the
collection and destruction of classified waste, and is also responsible for the
movement and scheduling of material via NSA couriers and the Defense Courier
Service (DCS).  Additionally, L monitors the proper addressing, marking, and
packaging of classified material being transmitted outside of NSA; maintains
records pertaining to receipt and transmission of controlled mail; and issues
property passes for the removal of unclassified property.
<p>
The NSA Office of Medical Services (M7) has a staff of physicians, clinical
psychologists and an alcoholism counselor.  All are well trained to help
individuals help themselves in dealing with their problems.  Counseling
services, with referrals to private mental health professionals when
appropriate, are all available to NSA personnel.  Appointments can be obtained
by contacting M7 directly.  When an individual refers himself/herself, the
information discussed in the counseling sessions is regarded as privileged
medical information and is retained exclusively in M7 unless it pertains to the
national security.
<p>
Counselling interviews are conducted by the Office of Civilian Personnel (M3)
with any civilian employee regarding both on and off-the-job problems.  M3 is
also available to assist all personnel with the personal problems seriously
affecting themselves or members of their families.  In cases of serious
physical or emotional illness, injury, hospitalization, or other personal
emergencies, M3 informs concerned Agency elements and maintains liaison with
family members in order to provide possible assistance.  Similar counselling
services are available to military assignees through Military Personnel (M2).

"A little sunlight is the best disinfectant."
				--Justice Louis Brandeis
	
	
Over a year ago, in a condition of giddier innocence than I enjoy today,
I wrote the following about the discovery of Cyberspace: Imagine
discovering a continent so vast that it may have no other side. Imagine
a new world with more resources than all our future greed might exhaust,
more opportunities than there will ever be entrepreneurs enough to
exploit, and a peculiar kind of real estate which expands with
development.

One less felicitous feature of this terrain which I hadn't noticed at
the time was a long-encamped and immense army of occupation.

This army represents interests which are difficult to define. It guards
the area against unidentified enemies. It meticulously observes almost
every activity undertaken there, and continuously prevents most who
inhabit its domain from drawing any blinds against such observation.

This army marshals at least 40,000 troops, owns the most advanced
computing resources in the world, and uses funds the dispersal of which
does not fall under any democratic review.

Imagining this force won't require the inventive powers of a William
Gibson. The American Occupation Army of Cyberspace exists. Its name is
the National Security Agency.

It can be argued that this peculiar institution inhibits free trade, has
damaged American competitiveness, and poses a threat to liberty anywhere
people communicate with electrons. Its principal function, as my
colleague John Gilmore puts it, is "wire-tapping the world." It is free
to do this without a warrant from any judge.

It is legally constrained from domestic surveillance, but precious few
people are in a good position to watch what, how, or whom the NSA
watches. Those who are tend to be temperamentally sympathetic to its
objectives and methods. They like power, and power understands the
importance of keeping it own secrets and learning everyone else's.

Whether it is meticulously ignoring every American byte or not, the NSA
is certainly pursuing policies which will render our domestic affairs
transparent to anyone who can afford big digital hardware.  Such
policies could have profound consequences on our liberty and privacy.

More to point, the role of the NSA in the area of domestic privacy needs
to be assessed in the light of other recent federal initiatives which
seem aimed at permanently denying privacy to the inhabitants of
Cyberspace, whether foreign or American.

Finally it seems an opportune time, directly following our disorienting
victory in the Cold War, to ask if the threats from which the NSA
purportedly protects Americans from are as significant as the hazards
the NSA's activities present.

Like most Americans I'd never given much thought to the NSA until
recently. (Indeed its very existence was a secret for much of my life.
Beltway types used to joke that NSA stood for "No Such Agency.") I
vaguely knew that the NSA was one of the twelve or so shadowy federal
spook houses erected shortly after the creation of the Iron Curtain with
the purpose of stopping its advance.

The NSA originated in response to a memorandum sent by Harry Truman on
October 24, 1952 to Secretary of State Dean Acheson and Defense
Secretary Robert Lovatt. This memo, the very existence of which remained
secret for almost 40 years, created the NSA, placed it under the
authority of the Secretary of Defense, and charged it with monitoring
and decoding any signal transmission relevant to the security of the
United States.

Even after I started noticing the NSA, my natural immunity to paranoia
combined with a belief in the incompetence of all bureaucracies
continued to mute any sense of alarm. This was before I began to
understand the subterranean battles raging over data encryption and the
NSA's role in them. Lately, I'm less sanguine.

Encryption may be the only reliable method for securing privacy in the
inherently public domain of Cyberspace. I certainly trust it more than
privacy protection laws. Relying on government to protect your privacy
is like asking a peeping tom to install your window blinds.

In fact, we already have a strong-sounding federal law protecting our
electronic privacy, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act or ECPA.
But this law is not very effective in those areas where electronic eaves
dropping is technically easy. This is especially true in the area of
cellular phone conversations, which, under the current analog
transmission standard, are easily accessible to anyone from the FBI to
you.

The degree of present-day law enforcement apprehension over secure
cellular encryption provides evidence of how seriously they've been
taking ECPA. Law enforcement organizations are moving on a variety of
fronts to see that robust electronic privacy protection systems don't
become generally available to the public.  Indeed, the current
administration may be so determined to achieve this end they may be
willing to paralyze progress in America's most promising technologies
rather than yield.

Push is coming to shove in two areas of communications technology:
digital transmission of heretofore analog signals, and the encryption of
transmitted data.

As the communications service providers move to packet switching, fiber
optic transmission lines, digital wireless, ISDN and other advanced
techniques, what have been discrete channels of continuous electrical
impulses, voices audible to anyone with alligator clips on the right
wires, are now becoming chaotic blasts of data packets, readily
intelligible only to the sender and receiver. This development
effectively forecloses traditional wire-tapping techniques, even as it
provides new and different opportunities for electronic surveillance.

It is in the latter area where the NSA knows its stuff. A fair
percentage of the digital signals dispatched on planet Earth must pass
at some point through the NSA's big sieve in Fort Meade, Maryland, 12
underground acres of the heaviest hardware in the computing world.
There, unless these packets are also encrypted with a particularly
knotty algorithm, sorting them back into their original continuity is
not very difficult.

In 1991, alarmed at a future in which it would have to sort through an
endless fruit salad of encrypted bits, the FBI persuaded Senator Joseph
Biden to include certain language in Senate Bill 266. The new language
in the bill required electronic communications services and those who
created communications devices to implement only such encryption methods
as would assure government's ability to extract the plain text of any
voice or data communications in which it took a legal interest. It was
as if the government had responded to a technological leap in lock
design by requiring all building contractors to supply it with skeleton
keys to every door in America.

The provision raised wide-spread concern in the computer community,
which was better equipped to understand its implications than the
general public. In August of last year, the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, in cooperation with Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility and other industry groups, successfully lobbied to have
it removed from the bill.

Our celebration was restrained. We knew we hadn't seen the last of it.
For one thing, the movement to digital communications does create some
serious obstacles to traditional wire-tapping procedures. I fully
expected that law enforcement would be back with new proposals, which I
hoped might be ones we could support. But what I didn't understand then,
and am only now beginning to appreciate, was the extent to which this
issue had already been engaged by the NSA in the obscure area of export
controls over data encryption algorithms.  Encryption algorithms,
despite their purely defensive characteristics, have been regarded by
the government of this country as weapons of war for many years. If they
are to be employed for privacy (as opposed to authentication) and they
are any good at all, their export is licensed under State Department's
International Traffic in Arms Regulations or ITAR.

The encryption watchdog is the NSA. It has been enforcing a policy,
neither debated nor even admitted to, which holds that if a device or
program contains an encryption scheme which the NSA canUt break fairly
easily, it will not be licensed for international sale.  Aside for
marveling at the silliness of trying to embargo algorithms, a practice
about as pragmatic as restricting the export of wind, I didn't pay much
attention to the implications of NSA encryption policies until February
of this year. It was then that I learned about the deliberations of an
obscure group of cellular industry representatives called the Ad Hoc
Authentication Task Force, TR45.3 and of the influence which the NSA has
apparently exercised over their findings.

In the stately fashion characteristic of standard-setting bodies, this
group has been working for several years on a standard for digital
cellular transmission, authentication, and privacy protection. This
standard is known by the characteristically whimsical telco moniker
IS-54B.

In February they met near Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, NJ. At that
meeting, they recommended, and agreed not to publish, an encryption
scheme for American-made digital cellular systems which many
sophisticated observers believe to be intentionally vulnerable.  It was
further thought by many observers that this Rdumbing downS had been done
indirect cooperation with the NSA.  Given the secret nature of the new
algorithm, its actual merits were difficult to assess. But many
cryptologists believe there is enough in the published portions of the
standard to confirm that it isnUt any good.

One cryptographic expert, who asked not to be identified lest the NSA
take reprisals against his company, said:
"The voice privacy scheme, as opposed to the authentication scheme, is
pitifully easy to break. It involves the generation of two `voice
privacy masks' each 260 bits long. They are generated as a byproduct of
the authentication algorithm and remain fixed for the duration of a
call. The voice privacy masks are exclusive_ORed with each frame of data
from the vocoder at the transmitter. The receiver XORs the same mask
with the incoming data frame to recover the original plain text. Anyone
familiar with the fundamentals of cryptanalysis can easily see how weak
this scheme is."

And indeed, Whitfield Diffie, co-inventor of Public Key cryptography and
arguably the dean of this obscure field, told me this about the fixed
masks:
"Given that description of the encryption process, there is no need for
the opponents to know how the masks were generated. Routine
cryptanalytic operations will quickly determine the masks and remove
them."

Some on the committee claimed that possible NSA refusal of export
licensing had no bearing on the algorithm they chose. But their decision
not to publish the entire method and expose it to cryptanalytical abuse
(not to mention ANSI certification) was accompanied by the following
convoluted justification:
"It is the belief of the majority of the Ad Hoc Group, based on our
current understanding of the export requirements, that a published
algorithm would facilitate the cracking of the algorithm to the extent
that its fundamental purpose is defeated or compromised." (Emphasis
added.)

Now this is a weird paragraph any way you parse it, but its most
singular quality is the sudden, incongruous appearance of export
requirements in a paragraph otherwise devoted to algorithmic integrity.
In fact, this paragraph is itself code, the plain text of which goes
something like this: "We're adopting this algorithm because, if we
don't, the NSA will slam an export embargo on all domestically
manufactured digital cellular phones."

Obviously, the cellular phone system manufacturers and providers are not
going to produce one model for overseas sale and another for domestic
production. Thus, a primary effect of NSA-driven efforts to deny some
unnamed foreign enemy secure cellular communications is on domestic
security. The wireless channels available to Americans will be cloaked
in a mathematical veil so thin that, as one crypto- expert put it, "Any
county sheriff with the right PC-based black box will be able to monitor
your cellular conversations."

When I heard him say that, it suddenly became clear to me that, whether
consciously undertaken with that goal or not, the most important result
of the NSA's encryption embargoes has been the future convenience of
domestic law enforcement. Thanks to NSA export policies, they will be
assured that, as more Americans protect their privacy with encryption,
it will be of a sort easily penetrated by authority.

I find it increasingly hard to imagine this is not their real objective
as well. Surely, the NSA must be aware of how ineffectual their efforts
have been in keeping good encryption out of inimical military
possession. An algorithm is somewhat less easily stopped at the border
than, say, a nuclear reactor. As William Neukom, head of Microsoft Legal
puts it, "The notion that you can control this technology is comical."

I became further persuaded that this was the case upon hearing, from a
couple of sources, that the Russians have been using the possibly
uncrackable (and American) RSA algorithm in their missile launch codes
for the last ten years and that, for as little as five bucks, one can
get a software package called Crypto II on the streets of Saint
Petersburg which includes both RSA and DES encryption systems.

Nevertheless, the NSA has been willing to cost American business a lot
of revenue rather than allow domestic products with strong encryption
into the global market.

While it's impossible to set a credible figure on what that loss might
add up to, it's high. Jim Bidzos, whose RSA Data Security licenses RSA,
points to one major Swiss bid in which a hundred million dollar contract
for financial computer terminals went to a European vendor after
American companies were prohibited by the NSA from exporting a truly
secure network.

The list of export software containing intentionally broken encryption
is also long. Lotus Notes ships in two versions. DonUt count on much
protection from the encryption in the export version. Both Microsoft and
Novell have been thwarted in their efforts to include RSA in their
international networking software, despite frequent publication of the
entire RSA algorithm in technical journals all over the world.

With hardware, the job has been easier. NSA levied against the inclusion
of a DES chip in the AS/390 series IBM mainframes in late 1990 despite
the fact that, by this time, DES was in widespread use around the world,
including semi-official adoption by our official enemy, the USSR.

I now realize that the Soviets have not been the NSA's main concern at
any time lately. Naively hoping that, with the collapse of the Evil
Empire, the NSA might be out of work, I learned that, given their own
vigorous crypto systems and their long use of some embargoed products,
the Russians could not have been the threat from whom this forbidden
knowledge was to be kept. Who has the enemy been then? I started to ask
around.

Cited again and again as the real object of the embargoes were Third-
World countries, terrorists and... criminals. Criminals, most generally
drug-flavored, kept coming up, and nobody seemed concerned that some of
their operations might be located in areas supposedly off- limits to NSA
scrutiny.

Presumably the NSA is restricted from conducting American surveillance
by both the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978(FISA) and a
series of presidential directives, beginning with one issued by
President Ford following Richard Nixon's bold misuse of the NSA, in
which he explicitly directed the NSA to conduct widespread domestic
surveillance of political dissidents and drug users.

But whether or not FISA has actually limited the NSA's abilities to
conduct domestic surveillance seemed less relevant the more I thought
about it. A better question to ask was, "Who is best served by the NSA's
encryption export policies?" The answer is clear: domestic law
enforcement. Was this the result of some plot between NSA and, say, the
Department of Justice? Not necessarily.

Certainly in the case of the digital cellular standard, cultural
congruity between foreign intelligence, domestic law enforcement, and
what somebody referred to as "spook wannabes on the TR45.3 committee"
might have a lot more to do with the its eventual flavor than any actual
whisperings along the Potomac.

Unable to get anyone presently employed by the NSA to comment on this or
any other matter, I approached a couple of old hands for a highly
distilled sample of intelligence culture.

I called Admirals Stansfield Turner and Bobby Ray Inman. Their Carter
administration positions as, respectively, CIA and NSA Directors, had
endowed them with considerable experience in such matters In addition,
both are generally regarded to be somewhat more sensitive to the limits
of democratic power than their successors. And their successors seemed
unlikely to return my calls.  My phone conversations with Turner and
Inman were amiable enough, but they didn't ease my gathering sense that
the NSA takes an active interest in areas beyond its authorized field of
scrutiny.  Turner started out by saying he was in no position to confirm
or deny any suspicions about direct NSA-FBI cooperation on encryption.
Still, he didn't think I was being irrational in raising the question.
In fact, he genially encouraged me to investigate the matter further.
He also said that while a sub rosa arrangement between the NSA and the
Department of Justice to compromise domestic encryption would be
"injudicious," he could think of no law, including FISA (which he helped
design), which would prevent it.

Alarmingly, this gentleman who has written eloquently on the hazards of
surveillance in a democracy did not seem terribly concerned that our
digital shelters are being rendered permanently translucent by and to
the government. He said, "A threat could develop...terrorism, narcotics,
whatever...where the public would be pleased that all electronic traffic
was open to decryption. You can't legislate something which forecloses
the possibility of meeting that kind of emergency."

Admiral Inman had even more enthusiasm for assertive governmental
supervision. Although he admitted no real knowledge of the events behind
the new cellular encryption standard, he wasn't disturbed to hear it
might be purposely flawed.

And, despite the fact that his responsibilities as NSA Director had been
restricted to foreign intelligence, he seemed a lot more comfortable
talking about threats on the home front.  "The Department of Justice,"
Inman began, "has a very legitimate worry. The major weapon against
white collar crime has been the court-ordered wiretap. If the criminal
elements go to using a high quality cipher, the principal defense
against narcotics traffic is gone."  This didn't sound like a guy who,
were he still head of NSA, would rebuff FBI attempts to get a little
help from his agency.

He brushed off my concerns about the weakness of the cellular encryption
standard. "If all you're seeking is personal privacy, you can get that
with a very minimal amount of encipherment."  Well, I wondered, Privacy
from whom?

Inman seemed to regard real, virile encryption to be something rather
like a Saturday Night Special. "My answer," he said, "would be
legislation which would make it a criminal offense to use encrypted
communication to conceal criminal activity."

Wouldn't that render all encrypted traffic automatically suspect? I
asked.

"Well," he said, "you could have a registry of institutions which can
legally use ciphers. If you get somebody using one who isn't registered,
then you go after him."

You can have my encryption algorithm, I thought to myself, when you pry
my cold dead fingers from its private key.

It wasn't a big sample, but it was enough to gain an appreciation of the
cultural climate of the intelligence community. And these guys are the
liberals. What legal efficiencies might their Republican successors be
willing to employ to protect the American Way?  Without the familiar
presence of the Soviets, we can expect a sharp increase in over-rated
bogeymen and virtual states of emergency.  This is already well under
way. I think we can expect our drifting and confused hardliners to burn
the Reichstag repeatedly until they have managed to extract from our
induced alarm the sort of government which makes them feel safe.

This process has been under way for some time. One sees it in the war on
terrorism, against which pursuit "no liberty is absolute," as Admiral
Turner put it. This, despite the fact that, during last year for which I
have a solid figure, 1987, only 7 Americans succumbed to terrorism.

You can also see it clearly under way in the War on Some Drugs. The
Fourth Amendment to the Constitution has largely disappeared in this
civil war. And among the people I spoke with, it seemed a common canon
that drugs (by which one does not mean Jim Beam, Marlboros, Folger's, or
Halcion) were a sufficient evil to merit the government's holding any
keys it wanted.

One individual close to the committee said that at least some of the
aforementioned "spook wannabes" on the committee were interested in weak
cellular encryption because they considered warrants not "practical"
when it came to pursuing drug dealers and other criminals using cellular
phones.

In a fearful America, where the people cry for shorter chains and
smaller cages, such privileges as secure personal communications are
increasingly regarded as expendable luxuries. As Whitfield Diffie put
it, "From the consistent way in which Americans seem to put security
ahead of freedom, I fear that most would prefer that all electronic
traffic was open to government decryption."

In any event, while I found no proof of an NSA-FBI conspiracy to gut the
American cellular phone encryption standard, it seemed clear to me that
none was needed. The same results can be delivered by a cultural
"auto-conspiracy" between like-minded hardliners and cellular companies
who will care about privacy only when their customers do.

You don't have to be a hand-wringing libertarian like me to worry about
the domestic consequences of the NSA's encryption embargoes.  They are
also, as stated previously, bad for business. Unless, of course, the
business of America is no longer business but, as sometimes seems the
case these days, crime control.

As Ron Rivest (the "R" in RSA) said to me, "We have the largest
information-based economy in the world. We have lots of reasons for
wanting to protect information, and weakening our encryption systems for
the convenience of law enforcement doesn't serve the national interest."

But by early March, it was clear that this "business-oriented"
administration had made a clear choice to favor cops over commerce even
if the costs to the American economy were to become extremely high.

A sense of White House seriousness in this regard could be taken from
their response to the first serious effort by Congress to bring the NSA
to task for its encryption embargoes. Rep. Mel Levine (D- Calif.)
proposed an amendment to the Export Administration Act to transfer mass
market software controls to the Commerce Department, which would relax
the rules. The administration responded by saying that they would veto
the entire bill if the Levine amendment remained attached to it.

Even though it appeared the NSA had little to fear from Congress, the
Levine amendment may have been part of what placed the agency in a
bargaining mood for the first time. They entered into discussions with
the Software Publishers Association who, acting primarily on behalf of
Microsoft and Lotus, got to them to agree "in principle" to a
streamlined process for export licensing of encryption which might
provide for more robust standards than previously allowed.

But the negotiations between the NSA and the SPA were being conducted
behind closed doors. The NSA imposed an understanding that any agreement
would be set forth only in a "confidential" letter to Congress. As in
the case of the digital cellular standard, this would eliminate the
public scrutiny by cryptography researchers.

Furthermore, some cryptographers worried that the encryption key lengths
to which the SPA appeared willing to restrict its members might be too
short for the sorts of brute-force decryption assaults which advances in
processor technology will yield in the near future.  And brute force
decryption has always been the NSA's strong suit.  The impression
engendered by the style of the NSA-SPA negotiations did not inspire
confidence. The lack of confidence will operate to the continued
advantage of foreign manufacturers in an era when more and more
institutions are going to be concerned about the privacy of their
digital communications.

But the economic damage which the NSA-SPA agreement might cause would be
minor compared to what would result from a startling new federal
initiative, the Department of Justice's proposed legislation on digital
telephony. If you're wondering what happened to the snooping provisions
which were in Senate Bill 266, look no further.  They're back. Bigger
and bolder than before.

They are contained in a sweeping proposal by the Justice Department to
the Senate Commerce Committee.  It proposes legislation which would
"require providers of electronic communications services and private
branch exchanges to ensure that the Government's ability to lawfully
intercept communications is unimpeded by the introduction of advanced
digital telecommunications technology or any other telecommunications
technology."

This really means what it says: before any advance in telecommunications
technology can be deployed, the service providers and manufacturers must
assure the cops that they can tap into it. In other words, development
in digital communications technology must come to a screeching halt
until The Department of Justice can be assured that it will be able to
grab and examine data packets with the same facility they have long
enjoyed with analog wire-tapping.

It gets worse. The initiative also provides that, if requested by the
Attorney General, "any Commission proceeding concerning regulations,
standards or registrations issued or to be issued under authority of
this section shall be closed to the public." This essentially places the
Attorney General in a position to shut down any telecommunications
advance without benefit of public hearing.

When I first heard of the digital telephony proposal, I assumed it was a
kind of bargaining chip. I couldn't imagine it was serious. But it now
appears they are going to the mattresses on this one.

Taken together with NSA's continued assertion of its authority over
encryption, a pattern becomes clear. The government of the United States
is so determined to maintain law enforcement's traditional wire-tapping
abilities in the digital age that it is willing to cripple the American
economy. This may sound hyperbolic, but I believe it is not.

The greatest technological advantages this country presently enjoys are
in the areas of software and telecommunications. Furthermore, thanks in
large part to the Internet, much of America is already wired for bytes.
This is as significant an economic edge in the Information Age as the
existence of a railroad system was for England one hundred fifty years
ago.

If we continue to permit the NSA to cripple our software and further
convey to the Department of Justice the right to stop development the
Net without public input, we are sacrificing both our economic future
and our liberties. And all in the name of combating terrorism and drugs.

This has now gone far enough. I have always been inclined to view the
American government as fairly benign as such creatures go. I am
generally the least paranoid person I know, but there is something scary
about a government which cares more about putting its nose in your
business than it does about keeping that business healthy.  As I write
this, a new ad hoc working group on digital privacy, coordinated by the
Electronic Frontier Foundation, is scrambling to meet the challenge. The
group includes representatives from organizations like AT&T, the
Regional Bells, IBM, Microsoft, the Electronic Mail Association and
about thirty other companies and public interest groups.

Under the direction of Jerry Berman, EFF's Washington office director,
and John Podesta, a capable lobbyist and privacy specialist who helped
draft the ECPA, this group intends to stop the provisions in digital
telephony proposal from entering the statute books.

We intend to work with federal law enforcement officials to address
their legitimate concerns. We donUt dispute their need to conduct some
electronic surveillance, but we believe this can be assured by more
restrained methods than they're proposing. We are also preparing a
thorough examination of the NSA's encryption export policies and looking
into the constitutional implications of those policies. Rather than
negotiating behind closed doors, as the SPA has been attempting to do,
America's digital industries have a strong self-interest in banding
together to bring the NSA's procedures and objectives into the sunlight
of public discussion.

Finally, we are hoping to open a dialog with the NSA. We need to develop
a better understanding of their perception of the world and its threats.
Who are they guarding us against and how does encryption fit into that
endeavor? Despite our opposition to their policies on encryption export,
we assume that NSA operations have some merit. But we would like to be
able to rationally balance the merits against the costs.

The legal right to express oneself is meaningless if there is no secure
medium through which that expression may travel. By the same token, the
right to hold unpopular opinions is forfeit unless one can discuss those
opinions with others of like mind without the government listening in.

Even if you trust the current American government, as I am still
inclined to, there is a kind of corrupting power in the ability to
create public policy in secret while assuring that the public will have
little secrecy of its own.

In its secrecy and technological might, the NSA already occupies a very
powerful position. And conveying to the Department of Justice what
amounts to licensing authority for all communications technology would
give it a control of information distribution rarely asserted over
English-speaking people since Oliver Cromwell's Star Chamber
Proceedings.

Are there threats, foreign or domestic, which are sufficiently grave to
merit the conveyance of such vast legal and technological might?  And
even if the NSA and FBI may be trusted with such power today, will they
always be trustworthy? Will we be able to do anything about it if they
aren't?

Senator Frank Church said of NSA technology in 1975 words which are more
urgent today:
"That capability at any time could be turned around on the American
people and no American would have any privacy left. There would be no
place to hide. If this government ever became a tyranny, the
technological capacity that the intelligence community has given the
government could enable it to impose total tyranny. There would be no
way to fight back, because the most careful effort to combine together
in resistance to the government, no matter how privately it was done, is
within the reach of the government to know. Such is the capacity of this
technology."

* In October 1994, NASA requested that the National Academy of 
Sciences assemble a review panel to validate the technical 
feasibility and scientific merits of Gravity Probe-B relative 
to other science priorities within the NASA budget.  
Discussions are currently underway, with final results 
anticipated in mid-1995.  In the event the panel recommends 
continuation of Gravity Probe-B, equivalent offsets within the 
NASA budget must be identified.

During 1995, each NASA installation is undergoing a workforce 
review including both civil servants and contractor support.  
It is anticipated that the preliminary conclusions from this 
review as well as the recently announced buyout will be reached 
by mid-1995.

OFFICE OF SPACE FLIGHT    (Code M)
Associate Administrator:  J. Wayne Littles
Public Affairs Contacts:  Mark Hess, 202/358-1776

The Human Space Flight program leads the United States in its 
quest to expand the human presence in space.  The business of 
the Human Space Flight program is to provide safe, assured 
and economic transportation to and from space for people and 
payloads, and to develop and operate habitable space 
facilities, in order to enhance scientific knowledge, support 
technology development and enable commercial activity.

The Human Space Flight appropriation provides funding for 
NASA's human space flight activities.  This includes the on-
orbit infrastructure (Space Station and Spacelab), 
transportation capability (Space Shuttle program, including 
operations, program support and safety and performance 
upgrades), and the U.S.-Russian Cooperative program which 
includes the flight activities associated with the 
cooperative research flights to the Russian Mir Space 
Station.

Space Station $1.83 billion

The Space Station is unique because it will provide the world 
with a permanent outpost in space.  The schedule for the 
current design emphasizes an early permanent crew capability 
that provides an advanced  research laboratory for use by 
international crews for extended durations.  Therefore, very 
early into the program, the Space Station will provide 
enormous benefits to stimulate new technologies, enhance 
industrial competitiveness, further commercial space 
enterprises and add greatly to the storehouse of scientific 
knowledge.  In March 1994, a Systems Design Review (SDR) was 
completed, which validated the current system design as 
meeting program requirements.

The international Space Station is the culmination of the 
redesign work begun in 1993 to increase efficiency and 
effectiveness in response to lower projections for the Agency 
budget and growing emphasis on other programs, such as 
science and aeronautics.  Human presence in space is one of 
NASA's missions, and the redesigned Space Station has met the 
President's goal to reduce the program cost while still 
providing significant research capabilities.  An entirely new 
management approach has been implemented, in which a single 
contractor (Boeing) has been given total prime and 
integration responsibilities, with the previous prime 
contractors (McDonnell Douglas, Rocketdyne and Boeing 
Huntsville) serving as first-tier subcontractors to Boeing.  
This has produced clearer lines of authority and 
accountability.  In addition, program management has 
relocated to a streamlined Space Station Program Office 
(SSPO) in Houston, structured around integrated product teams 
with responsibility for bringing the systems and elements 
into integrated launch packages.  Project management 
organizations at the various centers have been eliminated.  
Efficiencies have been gained through these program 
management improvements, design changes, a simplified 
integration effort and the recent invitation to the Russians 
to enter into the international partnership.

U.S/Russian Cooperative Program $129.2 million

This program provides for:  (1) the funding ($100 million) of 
the contract with the Russian Space Agency; and (2) the 
mission specific costs for provision of the Spacehab, 
Spacelab, and Shuttle flights to Mir.

Significant U.S.-Russia cooperative effort milestones will be 
reached in FY 1996 when the second, third and fourth of seven 
joint Shuttle-Mir missions are conducted.  The primary 
objectives of these flights are to rendezvous and dock with 
the Mir, perform on-orbit joint U.S.-Russian life sciences 
and microgravity investigations, resupply Mir logistics and 
provide crew exchange.

The United States and the Russian federation have begun a 
joint cooperative space program to accomplish six major 
goals.  First, the program will permit NASA to develop, 
maintain and enhance capabilities and operations to allow 
humans to live and work continuously in space.  Second, by 
establishing a relationship with Russia as an international 
partner for the human exploration of space, the United States 
can reduce the cost of future U.S. space initiatives by 
applying Russian-developed technology.  Third, by flying 
Shuttle missions to the Russian Mir, the United States can 
enhance its understanding of long-duration operations, along 
with life sciences and microgravity research benefits from 
long-duration experimentation.  Fourth, early cooperation 
with the Russians will permit NASA to develop common systems 
and operating procedures that will increase the probability 
of success and mitigate risks in the design, assembly, and 
operation of the international Space Station in which Russia 
is a full partner.  Fifth, by engaging Russia in constructive 
space work, the United States can advance its foreign policy 
initiatives.  Finally, this relationship between the U.S. and 
Russian space agencies will advance both countries' national 
space programs as well as their respective national aerospace 
industries.

Space Shuttle Program $3,231.8 million

The FY 1996 budget for the Space Shuttle program provides for 
a program that will continue to improve safety margins, fly 
the established manifest, launch seven flights every year, 
provide a vehicle that must undergo significant modifications 
to operate with the international Space Station and continue 
to reduce cost.

The budget structure of the Space Shuttle program consists of 
two major components:  Space Shuttle Operations and Safety 
and Performance Upgrades.  The funding request for Shuttle 
Operations in FY1996 is $2,390.0 million.  This funding 
provides for the hardware and manpower required to support 
the launch of eight Shuttle flights and their associated 
payloads.  This includes the requirements for the Orbiter, 
external tank, redesigned solid rocket booster and manpower 
and support services required for launch and landing and 
mission operations for each flight.

The funding request for Safety and Performance Upgrades in 
FY1996 is $837 million.  This budget provides for 
modifications and improvements to the flight elements and 
ground facilities, including expansion of safety and 
operating margins and enhancement of Space Shuttle 
capabilities as well as the replacement of obsolete systems.

Payload and Utilization Operations $315.0 million

Funding requested for Payload and Utilization Operations 
supports the payloads flying on the Shuttle and Spacelab, as 
well as advanced technology projects and Engineering 
Technical base support for the field centers supporting Human 
Space Flight activities.



SHUTTLE FLIGHTS SCHEDULED FOR FY 1996
(October 1, 1995 - September 30, 1996)

STS-74 (October 1995) - Space Shuttle Atlantis will make its 
second trip to the Russian Space Station Mir in October 1995, 
this time to install a permanent docking module that will 
simplify future Shuttle linkups to the Russian complex.  
After Atlantis is docked to Mir, the astronauts will conduct 
a variety of science experiments and will transfer water and 
other consumables to the Russian station.  The Shuttle crew 
also will deliver two solar arrays that will be stowed on the 
side of the docking module.  The arrays, which were built as 
a cooperative project using technology from both the U.S. and 
Russia, will be installed on the Russian station sometime 
after STS-74 concludes.

STS-72 (November 1995)  STS-72 mission objectives include 
retrieval of an octagonally-shaped science satellite carrying 
14 experiments that is scheduled to be launched aboard a 
Japanese H-2 rocket in early 1995.  The Space Flyer Unit 
(SFU) was developed jointly by NASDA, the Institute of Space 
and Astronautical Science and the Ministry of Trade and 
Industry.

In addition to the SFU retrieval, the crew will use the 
Shuttle's robot arm to deploy and retrieve another science 
satellite, the Shuttle Pointed Autonomous Research Tool for 
Astronomy (SPARTAN).  This multi-use spacecraft flies free of 
the Shuttle for several days, gathering astronomical data 
prior to its retrieval.

Also during the flight, astronauts Chiao and Barry will 
conduct two spacewalks designed to evaluate and better 
understand assembly requirements and techniques for the 
International Space Station.

STS-75 (February 1996)  STS-75 will see the reflight of the 
Tethered Satellite System (TSS), a joint project between NASA 
and the Italian Space Agency (ASI).  TSS originally was flown 
on the Space Shuttle STS-46 mission launched July 1992.  TSS 
deployment was curtailed when mechanical interference in the 
deployer reel assembly prevented full deployment of the 
satellite.  The TSS reflight will focus on science objectives 
not accomplished on the STS-46 mission.

The TSS could place a satellite into the Earth atmospheric 
regions that are difficult to study.  These regions lie above 
the range of high altitude balloon flights and below the 
altitude of free-flying science satellites.

Also flying on the STS-75 mission will be the United States 
Microgravity Payload (USMP) which will be making its third 
flight on the Shuttle.  USMP-3 involves a series of missions 
designed to study the effects of microgravity on materials 
and fundamental sciences. USMP microgravity experiments are 
designed to be accomplished in the Space Shuttle payload bay.


STS-76 (March 1996) STS-76 will be the third of seven 
currently scheduled Shuttle/Mir missions through 1997.  The 
mission will see the transfer one of the six astronaut 
crewmembers for a four-month stay on the Russian space 
station.  The 10-day STS-76 mission also will include life 
and materials sciences experimentation in the Spacehab 
mounted in Atlantis' payload bay.


STS-77 (April 1996)  The commercial development of space 
activities continue with Shuttle Mission STS-77 and the 
fourth flight of the commercially developed SPACEHAB payload.  
NASA's primary objective for leasing the SPACEHAB Space 
Research Laboratory is to support the agency's efforts of 
providing access to space to test, demonstrate or evaluate 
techniques or processes in a weightless environment, and 
thereby reduce operational risks to a level appropriate for 
commercial development.

Also flying on the STS-77 mission are the Technology 
Experiments Advancing Mission in Space (TEAMS) payload 
consisting of a collection of experiments designed to enable 
or extend space flight technology and the Inflatable Antenna 
Experiment (IAE) payload which will validate the space based 
deployment of a large inflatable parabolic reflector antenna 
and characterize its mechanical performance.


STS-78 (June 1996)  Space Shuttle Columbia will carry the 
Life and Microgravity Sciences (LMS) Spacelab during Mission 
STS-78.  The crew will conduct research through a series of 
experiments in a stable low-gravity environment, emphasizing 
Life Sciences and Microgravity Sciences.  This mission will 
also accomplish the human science investigations previously 
approved for the Spacelab Life Sciences-3 mission which was 
cancelled.


STS-79 (August 1996) Shuttle Mission STS-79, the fourth in 
the series of joint missions with the Space Shuttle and the 
Russian Space Station Mir.  The fourth docking mission will 
drop off another astronaut and bring home the astronaut 
launched on STS-76.  In addition to conducting experiments 
within the Spacehab pressurized module, the mission will 
feature a spacewalk to transfer several experiments from the 
Shuttle's payload bay to the docking module on the Mir 
station.  The spacewalk also will be used to validate and 
demonstrate assembly techniques for the International Space 
Station.

OFFICE OF SPACE COMMUNICATIONS (CODE O)
Associate Administrator:  Charles T. Force
Public Affairs Contact:  Dwayne Brown, 202/358-1600

The FY 1996 budget request for NASA's Office of Space 
Communications (OSC) is $780.7 million.  This funding is 
contained in two appropriations:  Science, Aeronautics & 
Technology and Mission Support.  Activities most directly 
related to support of NASA's science and aeronautics programs 
is contained in the Mission Communication Services program 
($461.3 million) under Science, Aeronautics and Technology.  
Activities whose support encompasses all of NASA's strategic 
enterprises are contained in the Space Communication Services 
program ($319.4 million) under Mission Support.  All Space 
Network major development activities are contained in Mission 
Support.

Reliable electronic communications are essential to the 
success of every NASA flight mission, from interplanetary 
spacecraft to the Space Shuttle to aeronautical flight tests.  
NASA's OSC manages the provision of telecommunication 
services needed to ensure that the goals of NASA's 
exploration, science, and research and development programs 
are met; that they are met cost-effectively; and that mission 
operations and planning are performed in an integrated and 
standardized way.  The OSC is committed to seeking and 
encouraging commercialization of NASA telecommunications 
capabilities and to participate with NASA's strategic 
enterprises in collaborative interagency, international, and 
commercial enterprises.  As NASA's agent for operational 
communications and associated information handling services, 
the OSC seeks opportunities for using technology in pursuit 
of more cost-effective solutions, highly optimized designs of 
mission systems, and advancement of NASA's and the nation's 
best technological and commercial interests.

The range of capabilities provided by NASA's Space 
Communications program is necessarily very broad.  This 
function provides all of NASA's capability to track, command, 
and acquire data from NASA spacecraft.  This function is 
performed through utilization of ground-based antennas and 
network systems; the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System 
(TDRSS) of geosynchronous communications satellites and two 
ground stations in New Mexico; a telecommunications network 
needed to relay data among NASA mission control facilities; 
and the mission control and data processing facilities for 
NASA's currently operational Earth-orbiting robotics systems.  
The function also provides for the telecommunications network 
used for all NASA administrative and scientific exchanges.  
All NASA telecommunications scheduling, network management 
and engineering, flight system maneuver planning and 
analysis, and preflight communications interface verification 
is performed by this strategic function.  Near-term 
demonstration and application of advanced communications and 
information systems technologies are conducted through the 
support of various sponsored labs and facilities.

Some NASA missions have unique needs -- e.g., communicating 
with spacecraft having low-powered transceivers flying in the 
outer reaches of our solar system and beyond or relaying very 
high rates of data from spacecraft anywhere over the roughly 
785 million square miles of surface area of the Earth.  
Specialized systems such as the TDRSS and the Deep Space 
Network (DSN) are required.  Other needs can be satisfied 
using alternate approaches, including smaller ground 
transceive systems and commercially-available systems and 
services.  Key to NASA's future is our ability to take 
advantage of emerging communications technologies, especially 
the increasing levels of automation and standardization of 
systems and procedures that these technologies allow.

Mission Communication Services $461.3 million

NASA's FY 1996 request provides $268.8 million for the Ground 
Network Systems and Operations; $162.2 million for Mission 
Control, Data Processing and Flight Dynamic Services; and 
$30.3 million for the Space Network Control Center and other 
activities.  

While the focus of this program is on the support of NASA 
science and aeronautics programs, the breadth of NASA 
missions receive some form of support from this program.  
Planetary and interplanetary missions; near-Earth and Earth-
orbiting spacecraft missions; and suborbital and aeronautical 
test flight systems are the primary beneficiaries of this 
program; support for NASA's Human Space Flight programs also 
is provided.  Services include ground network tracking, 
command and data acquisition on an operational and emergency 
basis; orbit and attitude determination and maneuver 
analysis; data acquisition networks scheduling; and mission 
control and science data processing for select NASA missions.  
Data acquisition and management technologies; flight mission 
planning and preflight testing and simulation; and management 
and coordination of NASA's use of radio frequencies also is 
performed.

NASA's DSN; Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network; Wallops 
Flight Facility; Western Aeronautical Test Range; Flight 
Dynamics Facility; Space Network Control Center, and selected 
mission control and data systems are contained in this 
program.  These activities are in the process of being 
automated and modernized so that the burgeoning workload of 
NASA flight systems can be accommodated.

Space Communications Services $319.4 million

The FY 1996 budget request provides $206.7 million for the 
Space Network major development programs and operation of its 
White Sands Complex; and $112.7 million for 
Telecommunications Systems.  

NASA's Space Network provides high data rate, near-continuous 
coverage of Earth-orbiting spacecraft, including the Space 
Transportation System, the Hubble Space Telescope, the Upper 
Atmospheric Research Satellite, the Compton Gamma Ray 
Observatory, and other spacecraft systems.  The unique 
requirements of some suborbital missions for continuous 
tracking and communication services also are supported by 
this program.  The Space Network performs as a complementary 
asset to NASA's other communications facilities and systems.  
Ground and space network systems and facilities coordinate 
their tracking, command, and data acquisition support of 
near-Earth NASA flight systems; flight dynamics and Space 
Network scheduling, planning and preflight verification 
testing services provided under the Mission Communication 
Services program are integral to the performance of Space 
Network systems.

The seventh Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) is 
scheduled to be deployed in FY 1995; a constellation of four 
fully functional and two partially functional TDRS spacecraft 
will then be on orbit.  The sixth TDRS was lost aboard the 
Space Shuttle Challenger.  Complementing this constellation 
of on orbit systems is the new Danzante, or Second TDRS 
System Ground Terminal.  This newly developed White Sands 
facility was recently transitioned to being the primary TDRS 
ground terminal.  In March, following a period of stable 
Danzante operations, the existing White Sands Ground Terminal 
will be shut down and its refurbishment begun.

In order to ensure a continuity of TDRS services into the 
middle part of the next decade, three additional TDRS 
spacecraft are being procured.  For FY 1996, $195.8 million 
is being requested for continuation of development of the 
TDRS Replenishment Spacecraft.  Funds to procure three launch 
vehicles also is included in this amount.  Source evaluation 
has been underway since last summer, and contract award is 
imminent.  This firm fixed-price contract will have 
provisions for spacecraft replacement and recovery of funds 
for loss of TDRS services.  The three functionally similar 
Replenishment Spacecraft are being procured under a unique 
commercial practices arrangement.

NASA's Telecommunications services for all of NASA's 
operational, research and analysis and administrative 
requirements also are included under the Space Communication 
Services program.  An upcoming demonstration of advanced 
switching technology promises to allow the consolidation and 
improved efficiency of service of NASA telecommunications 
systems.

OFFICE OF SAFETY AND MISSION ASSURANCE (Code Q)
Associate Administrator:  Frederick D. Gregory

OFFICE OF THE CHIEF ENGINEER (Code AE)
Acting Chief Engineer:  Dr. Dan Mulville
Public Affairs Contact:  Dwayne Brown, 202/358-1600

The FY 1996 budget request for NASA's Safety, Reliability, 
Maintainability & Quality Assurance (SRM&QA) program is $37.6 
million.  The activities of NASA's Office of Safety and 
Mission Assurance and the Office of the Chief Engineer are 
funded under this program.

These offices seek to ensure the safe and successful 
execution of NASA programs by providing oversight of NASA's 
flight and ground systems development and operations 
programs; by developing Agency-wide safety, reliability, 
maintainability, quality assurance and engineering policies, 
standards and practices; and providing for the identification 
and qualification of key technologies to improve the 
performance and reliability of NASA flight systems.  The 
offices provide leadership in promoting and ensuring the 
safety, innovation, and quality of all NASA programs; and 
improving the practice of engineering in NASA programs.  This 
work is performed in four programmatic areas.

Policy, Oversight and Standards $17.6 million

The FY 1996 budget request of $17.6 million supports the 
areas of safety, reliability, maintainability and quality 
assurance.  Activities include studies and investigations to 
formulate NASA safety and mission assurance policy; and 
safety oversight and flight readiness assessments for all 
NASA programs, including the Space Shuttle and the 
international Space Station.  Documentation and analysis of 
NASA experience in the SRM&QA disciplines, mishap 
investigations, NASA emergency preparedness, and range safety 
helps improve the safety and risk management practices of 
NASA programs.  Guidance to the Agency's SRM&QA organizations 
for the conduct of self-assessments will be used to augment 
OSMA's oversight role and enhance the implementation of 
SRM&QA policies.  Compliance with the Occupational Safety and 
Health Act is supported and monitored.  NASA is also in the 
process of adopting the international standard for quality, 
ISO 9000, in concert with the Department of Defense and other 
federal agencies.

Quality Management $8.1 million

The FY 1996 budget request of $8.1 million supports the early 
introduction of tailored safety, reliability and quality 
requirements into space flight systems design and manufacture 
in the early stages of a program.  This approach is expected 
to result in decreased life cycle costs in NASA programs by 
reducing or eliminating costly redesign of systems in the 
latter stages of development and test.  The Quality 
Management program provides direct assurance support to NASA 
robotics, aeronautics, and expendable launch vehicle 
programs.  Studies of optimized quality assurance 
surveillance for Space Transportation System processing also 
are performed.  Studies are conducted of risk factors in 
specific flight programs; the effectiveness of qualification 
test methods; and non-destructive evaluation techniques.  
Improved qualification methods for electrical, electronic, 
and electromechanical (EEE) parts and qualification of 
advanced EEE parts and packaging technologies for use by NASA 
flight programs is supported.  New focus will be given to 
qualification of parts manufacturing processes rather than 
the previous focus on auditing parts quality.

Software Independent Verification and Validation $6.4 million

The FY 1996 budget request of $6.4 million supports the 
management of NASA's IV&V facility located at Fairmont, West 
Virginia.  This program supports the development of software 
assurance standards, practices, and technology for evaluation 
of flight systems, mission control, and science data 
processing systems software.  This initiative is expected to 
result in enhanced performance and reliability of 
increasingly complex and critical software used throughout 
NASA facilities and systems.

Engineering $5.5 million

This program provides both oversight and improvement of 
NASA's technical ability to successfully execute its 
programs.  The Office of Chief Engineer provides direct 
support to the NASA Administrator by conducting independent 
evaluation of the performance of NASA programs and other 
engineering issues.  The office also coordinates the 
activities of NASA's Engineering Management Council.  The 
office develops NASA engineering policies, standards and 
guidelines; promotes increased use of industry and 
international standards to enhance the interoperability of 
NASA and other aerospace systems; encourages cooperative 
endeavors; and seeks to improve NASA-industry exchanges.  
Efforts to improve engineering practices in areas such as 
systems engineering, software engineering, structural 
analysis, and test methods will facilitate continuous 
improvement of NASA capabilities.  Validation of critical 
technologies, focusing on demonstration of potential program 
applications to improve system reliability and performance 
also is performed.

As a part of their responsibilities, the two NASA 
Headquarter's offices also coordinate NASA activities with 
various external groups and agencies, including the 
International Standards Organization and the Interagency 
Nuclear Safety Review Panel.

OFFICE OF AERONAUTICS (Code R)
Associate Administrator:  Dr. Wesley L. Harris
Public Affairs Contact:  Barbara E. Selby, 202/358-1983


The FY 1996 total budget request for the Office of 
Aeronautics is $917.3 million, which includes $5.4 million 
for Construction of Facilities (CofF).

The NASA Aeronautics Research and Technology budget request 
for FY 1996 is $911.9 million.  This includes $245.5 million 
for the High-Speed Research Program, $188.4 million for the 
Advanced Subsonic Technology Program, $75.2 million for High 
Performance Computing and Communications and $354.7 million 
for the research and technology base.  

High-Speed Research $245.5 million

The High Speed Research Program, which is developing the 
technology necessary for a next-generation supersonic 
airliner, continues to be NASA's highest priority aeronautics 
effort. 

The FY 1996 budget request of $245.5 million will enable the 
program to achieve and advance beyond the planned Preliminary 
Concept Definition milestone.  This major event will include 
the selection of preliminary engine and airframe materials, 
engine components and flight deck concepts for focused 
technology development.

The FY 1996 budget also will continue funding for 
environmental research including atmospheric effects of 
aviation, community noise and sonic boom, to assure the 
technologies addressing economic viability also achieve 
environmental compatibility goals.  

Advanced Subsonic Technology $188.4 million

The Advanced Subsonic Technology program's FY 1996 budget 
request of $188.4 million will focus on development, in 
cooperation with the Federal Aviation Administration and the 
U.S. aeronautics industry, of high payoff technologies to 
enable a safe, highly productive global air transportation 
system, including a new generation of environmentally 
compatible, economical U.S. subsonic aircraft such as 
commercial transports, general aviation and civil tiltrotor. 
There are thirteen critical elements that, as an integrated 
program, provide a focused technology foundation to ensure 
U.S. leadership in aircraft manufacture, aviation system 
efficiency and safety, and protection of the environment.

As a result of redirection within the ongoing NASA 
aeronautics program, the FY 1996 request includes funds for 
two new areas of research vital to the future health of the 
U.S. aviation industry and aviation infrastructure:  air 
traffic management and affordable design and manufacturing.  
In air traffic management, NASA plays a pivotal role by 
leveraging its expertise in aircraft guidance and air traffic 
controls technology to develop and validate high risk 
elements of new air traffic architecture.  In affordable 
design and manufacturing, NASA plans to study, in close 
collaboration with industry, generic "building block" 
technologies for affordable aircraft and engine design and 
manufacturing processes.

The FY 1996 budget also contains funding to continue research 
in aircraft and engine noise reduction, terminal area 
productivity, aging aircraft, integrated wing design, 
propulsion systems, environmental assessment, short-haul 
aircraft (general aviation and civil tiltrotor), fly-by-light 
(fiber optic) and power-by-wire control systems and 
composites.

High Performance Computing and Communications $75.2 million

NASA's High Performance Computing and Communications program 
is part of the multi-agency effort to boost supercomputer 
speeds one thousand-fold to at least one trillion arithmetic 
operations per second -- one teraflops -- and communications 
capabilities one hundred-fold.  The FY 1996 budget request 
for this program remains flat at $75.2 million.

The FY 1996 request continues research on advanced computing 
tools for computational aerosciences, Earth and space 
sciences, and information infrastructure technology for the 
"information superhighway," including access to schools, 
libraries and museums.  Efforts begun in FY 1995 in cost 
effective high performance computing for aerospace design 
will continue to be emphasized in FY 1996.  A new focus for 
research in FY 1996 is the remote exploration and 
experimentation effort addressing Agency emphasis on reduced 
mission costs.

Research and Technology Base $354.7 million

Working closely with its customers, NASA's Research and 
Technology Base program has led the world in aeronautical 
breakthroughs and advanced aviation concepts, many of which 
are being used by industry today.  The FY 1996 budget for the 
R&T base is $334.7 million.  For FY 1996, hypersonic research 
has been reintegrated into the R&T Base program. 

The R&T base program emphasizes the development of knowledge-
based technologies important to aeronautics customers, 
providing an essential foundation to respond to critical 
needs.  The Supercritical Wing for the B-757 and B-767 
aircraft; Winglets for the MD-11 and B-747-400; Active 
turbine cooling for the JT9D Engine and the B-747; Digital 
Fly-by-wire for the F-18A, F-16C/D; Stall, Spin & Crash-
worthiness for General Aviation; and Wind Shear Detection for 
all transports are all concepts that originated in the R&T 
Base.

The program develops tools for use in analysis and design 
processes in the technology areas of aerodynamics; propulsion 
and power; materials and structures; controls, guidance, and 
human factors; flight systems, and systems analysis.  The R&T 
Base Program supports the capability to implement and conduct 
the research activities described above by providing a 
facilities infrastructure for our focused technology 
programs, and industrial development activities.  The major 
aeronautical facilities and services are at the four 
aeronautical research centers -- Ames Research Center, Dryden 
Flight Research Center, Langley Research Center and Lewis 
Research Center.  The program encourages partnerships among 
industry, universities, and government agencies to take 
advantage of their cumulative strengths.  Typically, work is 
performed through cooperative agreements with industry and 
other Government agencies facilitating rapid technology 
transfer.

Construction of Facilities $5.4 million

The FY 1996 Aeronautics Construction of Facilities request of 
$5.4 million represents the final phase of funding for 
modernization of the Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel Complex at 
NASA's Ames Research Center.  Planned improvements include 
upgrading, automating and replacing controls, improving 
airflow quality and repairing the pressure vessel shell.

In addition, the $74 million appropriated in FY 1994 will 
fund a high level of activity in FY 1995 on studies of the 
two National Wind Tunnels now under consideration.  Congress 
appropriated $400 million in FY 1995 for the initial 
construction phase, but attached a number of conditions.  
These conditions, if not met, would result in rescission of 
the funds on July 31, 1995.  The Administration has requested 
Congress to extend the availability of the $400 million, with 
the proviso that none of these funds would be outlayed until 
October 1, 1996.  These wind tunnels would provide greatly 
improved design evaluation and test capabilities in the 
transonic and subsonic speed regimes.


February 1995




OFFICE OF SPACE SCIENCE   (CODE S)
Associate Administrator:  Dr. Wesley T. Huntress, Jr.
Public Affairs Contacts:  Don Savage, 202/358-1727; 
                          Doug Isbell, 202/358-1753

In fiscal year 1996, NASA's Office of Space Science intends 
to build upon the momentum it gained during 1994 through a 
series of major discoveries regarding the nature of the solar 
system and the Universe.  Many of these findings, such as 
those surrounding the impact of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with 
Jupiter, generated intense public interest and showcased the 
excitement of space science.

The FY 1996 request of $1.959 billion (including launch 
services) represents a balanced effort that continues to 
pursue the fundamental scientific questions in astrophysics, 
planetary exploration, space physics and related research, 
while addressing the challenges that will define space 
science in the 21st Century.  Of this amount, $1.057 billion 
is for physics and astronomy research, $672 million is for 
planetary exploration, and $230 million is for launch 
services. 

Highlights of the Space Science budget request include:

New Millennium Spacecraft $30.0 million

A proposed new program, New Millennium spacecraft is an 
aggressive flight technology demonstration effort that will 
precipitate a revolution in the design, development and 
operation of scientific spacecraft.  With simultaneous 
objectives of increasing the capability of NASA spacecraft, 
their instruments and their flight rates, while significantly 
reducing their mass and lifecycle costs, this program is 
another step NASA is taking toward achieving science and 
technology goals. 

The FY 1996 budget requests $30 million to begin the 
development of New Millennium spacecraft through investments 
in potential breakthrough technologies such as 
microelectronics and micromechanical devices.   The program's 
aim is to create a fleet of microspacecraft returning a 
continuous flow of information to Earth about the solar 
system and large-scale dynamic systems within it, and the 
possible existence of planets in neighboring solar systems.  
The first New Millennium technology demonstration flight test 
could occur as early as FY 1997, with missions launched at a 
rate of one or more every 12-24 months.

Infrared astronomy:  SOFIA and SIRTF

Space and ground-based observatories have provided a wealth 
of information and scientific discoveries in almost every 
wavelength of the spectrum.  The investigation of infrared 
wavelengths with high sensitivity and resolution has required 
development of better detection instruments.  In FY 1996, the 
NASA budget request includes funding to open a new era in 
infrared astronomy and begin development of two complementary 
missions:  the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared 
Astronomy (SOFIA) and the Space Infrared Telescope Facility 
(SIRTF).  SIRTF's exquisite sensitivity and large detector 
arrays are designed to search for faint galaxies at the edge 
of the observable universe, while SOFIA will capitalize on 
its superior spatial resolution and spectroscopic sensitivity 
to study close galaxies, protostars and transient cosmic 
events.  The two missions are described below.

SOFIA $48.7 million

SOFIA is an infrared airborne observatory designed to replace 
the aging Kuiper Airborne Observatory (KAO), which has been 
in operation since 1974.  SOFIA consists of a 2.5 meter 
telescope that will be carried by a specially modified, used 
Boeing 747 aircraft.  SOFIA will be developed and operated in 
partnership with the German space agency, DARA.  Initial 
operations for SOFIA will begin in late 2000.  With spatial 
resolution and sensitivity far superior to KAO, SOFIA will 
enable significant advances in the study of star and planet 
formation, the makeup of the interstellar medium, galactic 
structure and evolution, and the Sun and the solar system.  
In addition, SOFIA will be the first NASA space science 
program with a significant educational outreach component 
built-in from the beginning.  The program will build upon a 
very successful program of flying teachers on the KAO, by 
reaching out to Kindergarten - 12th grade teachers, as well 
as science museums and planetaria around the country.

SIRTF $15.0 million

The FY 1996 budget request includes a significant increase 
for mission studies of the SIRTF observatory, in anticipation 
of entering development in FY 1998.  SIRTF is the last of the 
four Great Observatories and has been the highest priority 
new mission (as ranked by the National Academy of Sciences) 
in astrophysics for many years.  Recent technological 
breakthroughs in infrared detector technology in the United 
States have excited scientists and enabled an improved, less 
costly mission design.   The SIRTF mission, planned for 
launch in 2002, has been vastly simplified from its original 
design, resulting in a dramatic five-fold reduction in life-
cycle costs.  SIRTF also may include a collaboration with 
Japan to achieve a portion of its science objectives.

Mars Surveyor $108.5 million

NASA's new Mars exploration strategy reaches full development 
in FY 1996 under the Mars Surveyor program.  It consists of 
an initial orbiter, Mars Global Surveyor, and a subsequent 
series of two small missions launched every two years.  With 
these missions, the U.S. will be able to resume the detailed 
exploration of Mars begun by Viking in the late 1970s.  

The FY 1996 budget request for Mars Surveyor will support 
Mars Global Surveyor instrument testing and integration with 
the spacecraft, and final spacecraft assembly and testing.  
It also will support the start of  development of a small 
orbiter and a lander to be launched in 1998, built by 
contractors due to be selected this spring.

Mars Global Surveyor will carry five science instruments -- 
comprised largely of parts from the Mars Observer program -- 
aboard a small, industry-developed spacecraft that will 
aerobrake into its final Martian orbit using techniques 
refined by the Magellan mission to Venus.  Scheduled for 
launch in November 1996, it will capture much of the data 
that would have been obtained by Mars Observer.  Following 
Global Surveyor will be a series of small scientific and 
communications orbiters.  A separate series of landers will 
make surface measurements of the Martian climate and soil 
composition.   

In the pursuit of answers to long-held questions about the 
possibilities of ancient free flowing water and life on Mars, 
the Mars Surveyor effort should provide clues about the long-
term processes of atmospheric and geologic changes on Earth. 

Discovery Program $103.8 million

Previously, NASA's Discovery program consisted of two 
Discovery missions initiated in FY 1994 and currently under 
development:  Mars Pathfinder and the Near Earth Asteroid 
Rendezvous (NEAR).  The FY 1996 request augments the previous 
budget plan by $36.6 million and provides the new funding 
required to continue the Discovery program.  Within the next 
several months, NASA intends to select one or more new 
Discovery missions for detailed study, followed by 
development starting in 1996.  Twenty-eight formal proposals 
have been received and are currently under evaluation.

Mars Pathfinder, scheduled for launch in December 1996 aboard 
a Delta II, is designed to demonstrate the technology, 
systems and mission elements involved in landing a series of 
small surface stations and rovers on Mars.  The FY 1996 
funding request of $35.9 million supports completion of 
instrument and subsystem deliveries, spacecraft integration 
and final spacecraft systems testing before launch.

Following its February 1996 launch, NEAR will rendezvous with 
its main target, the near-Earth asteroid Eros, in early 1999.  
The spacecraft will orbit and study Eros for at least one 
year.  The FY 1996 funding request of $31.3 million supports 
completion of final spacecraft systems testing and 
preparation for its launch aboard a Delta II launch vehicle.

Explorer Program  $129.2 million

FY 1996, funding will continue development activities on the 
highly successful Explorer program.  These include the 
Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), the Transition Region 
and Coronal Explorer (TRACE), the Wide-field Infrared 
Explorer (WIRE), and the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic 
Explorer (FUSE).  ACE, scheduled for a 1997 launch, will 
study the composition of the solar corona, interplanetary and 
interstellar media, and galactic matter.  TRACE, scheduled 
for launch in late 1997, is a solar science mission that will 
observe the Sun to study the connection between its magnetic 
fields and the heating of the Sun's corona.  WIRE, scheduled 
for launch in late 1998, will detect and study the evolution 
of starburst galaxies, ultraluminous galaxies and luminous 
protogalaxies, all at extreme distances from Earth.  

The Explorer program currently is being restructured, with 
the goal of reducing costs in order to enable funding for a 
class of medium explorers with a one-per-year flight rate.  
The FUSE mission, pending approval of a restructuring plan, 
will be the first of these missions.  FUSE will conduct high 
resolution spectroscopy in the far ultraviolet region.

During the summer of 1995, three Explorer spacecraft are 
expected to launch.  These include the X-ray Timing Explorer 
(XTE), the Fast Auroral Snapshot (FAST) small explorer, and 
the Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite (SWAS) small 
explorer.  XTE will provide a comprehensive record of the 
source of x-rays with varying intensity over time.  FAST will 
provide high resolution data on the Earth's aurora.  SWAS 
will provide discrete spectral data for study of the water, 
molecular oxygen, and carbon monoxide in dense interstellar 
clouds.

Cassini $191.5 million

Significant progress has been made toward preparing the 
Cassini mission for its scheduled launch to Saturn in October 
1997, including the recent successful completion of Critical 
Design Reviews for its ground system and the majority of 
spacecraft subsystems.  FY 1996 funding will support the 
completion of spacecraft subsystem and instrument integration 
and testing, and the initiation of system-level environmental 
testing. 

Saturn and its distinctive rings have been a source of 
fascination for Earth-bound astronomers for more than 300 
years.  Information relayed from the Pioneer and Voyager 
spacecraft flybys has provided some insights into this unique 
planetary system, while raising many more intriguing 
questions.  As a planetary orbiter, Cassini is designed to 
investigate in-depth why the gaseous outer planets have 
evolved so much differently than the rocky inner planets like 
Earth, and whether the Saturn's icy moons preserve a record 
of this formation.  The mission's European Space Agency-
provided Huygens probe will seek to determine whether the 
necessary building blocks for the chemical evolution of early 
life exist on Saturn's mysterious moon Titan.

AXAF $237.6 million

The Advanced X-ray Astrophysics program has made excellent 
progress over the past year.  Grinding and polishing of all 
AXAF mirrors has been completed five months ahead of schedule 
and ten months before the need date, and the shape and 
smoothness of the mirrors exceeds required specifications. 
Schedule margin towards the 1998 launch has increased by two 
months.  AXAF development will be about 2/3 complete by the 
end of FY 95, and about 80% complete by the end of FY 1996.  
During FY 1996, detailed design activities for the spacecraft 
should be completed, and fabrication of the flight structure 
will begin.  The spacecraft Critical Design Review is 
scheduled for February 1996.  AXAF will study the composition 
and nature of galaxies, stellar objects and interstellar 
phenomena as well as basic issues in theoretical physics.  

International Programs

A number of on-going international and U.S development 
projects are funded in the FY 1996 request.  These include 
the Japanese Astro-E mission; the Japanese and French High 
Energy Transient Experiment, a small satellite for study of 
gamma-ray burst phenomena; cooperative programs with Russia 
including the U.S. Stellar X-ray Polarimeter and Monitoring 
Experiment instruments to be flown on Russia's Spectrum X-
Gamma mission; and U.S. cooperation on Europe's Infrared 
Space Observatory, X-ray Mirror Mission, and the Rosetta 
comet mission.  The FY 1996 budget reflects the decision to 
proceed with U.S. participation in the Astro-E mission.  On 
the Astro-E mission, NASA is providing the x-ray spectrometer 
and will contribute improved foil mirrors and an x-ray 
calorimeter previously planned for the canceled AXAF-S 
mission. 

Gravity Probe-B Mission $51.5 million

The Relativity Mission proposes a major test of Einstein's 
general theory of relativity, which could have profound 
implications on science's understanding of the nature of the 
Universe.  Due to agency budget constraints, continuation of 
this mission beyond FY 1995 is currently under review.  An 
assessment of the  technical feasibility and scientific 
merits of the Gravity Probe-B Mission relative to other 
science priorities within the NASA budget by the National 
Academy of Sciences will be completed in mid-1995.  If the 
Academy recommends continuation of the Relativity Mission, 
equivalent offsets within the NASA budget must be identified 
to support the program in FY 1996 and beyond.

Mission Operations and Data Analysis (MO&DA) $556.4 million

MO&DA funds are used to support the prime missions of science 
spacecraft, ongoing analysis of selected mission data sets 
and support for future servicing requirements of the Hubble 
Space Telescope (see HST section below).  For FY 1996, $556.4 
million is requested.

*  In Planetary Exploration, operations for the Galileo 
spacecraft at Jupiter, NEAR during its cruise phase, and 
multimission support for other deep space missions will 
amount to $127.8 million.  

*  In Physics and Astronomy, the requested funds of $428.6 
million will support continuing operations and data analysis 
of the HST, Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, Extreme 
Ultraviolet Explorer, International Ultraviolet Explorer, 
XTE, SWAS, ROSAT, the Astro-D/ASCA mission, Pioneer 10, 
Voyagers 1 & 2, Wind, Polar, SOHO, Cluster, FAST, Ulysses, 
IMP-8, Geotail, SAMPEX and Yohkoh missions.  

In FY 1996 the complete set of missions in the International 
Solar-Terrestrial Physics program are expected to be 
operational with the launches in FY 1995 and FY 1996 of FAST, 
SOHO, Polar, and Cluster which join Geotail and Wind in orbit 
to study the Sun and its influences on the Earth's space 
environment.

With a highly successful first servicing mission completed, 
followed by a year of unparalleled scientific discoveries, 
the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is expected to continue to 
generate an ongoing stream of major discoveries, as well 
generating great public interest.  The $226.2 million in 
MO&DA funds also will support planning and development of 
instruments and other critical components for future HST 
servicing missions.  These components include the recently-
selected Hubble Advanced Camera for Exploration to be 
installed on the third servicing mission in 1999, as well as 
the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and the Near 
Infrared Camera/Multi-Object Spectrometer, scheduled for 
installation during the 1997 servicing mission.

OFFICE OF LIFE AND MICROGRAVITY SCIENCES AND APPLICATIONS 
(Code U)
Associate Administrator:  Harry Holloway, M.D.
Public Affairs Contact:  Michael Braukus, 202/358-1979

A total of $504 million is requested in the FY 1996 budget 
for the Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences and 
Applications (OLMSA), including $134.4 million for Life 
Science Research, $139.9 million for Microgravity Science 
Research, $85.4 million for Shuttle/Spacelab mission 
management, $137.3 million for Space Station payload 
facilities, and $7 million for Aerospace Medicine and 
Occupational Health.

Life and Biomedical Sciences

OLMSA's Life and Biomedical Sciences program seeks to advance 
medical and biological knowledge and to develop technologies 
needed to protect the health of humans living and working in 
space.  The program works to facilitate the transfer of the 
knowledge and technology it gains to improve our nation's 
competitiveness, education and quality of life on Earth.

The life sciences program includes the ongoing Shuttle and 
Spacelab flight experiment programs; the cooperative research 
program with Russia, including the cooperative research 
aboard the Russian Mir Space Station; and the research 
program planned for the international Space Station.

During FY 1996, NASA will launch the Life and Microgravity 
Spacelab (LMS) into orbit aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia.  
This 16-day Spacelab mission will carry 21 science 
investigations:  15 in life sciences and six in microgravity 
sciences.  NASA will launch its last scheduled Life Sciences 
spacelab in 1998, and OLMSA will begin supporting Neurolab's 
science investigators and developing their experiment 
hardware in FY 1996.

Life sciences will apply FY 1996 resources to continue the 
U.S./Russia cooperative research program.  The NASA/Mir 
investigations will enable the life sciences program to 
conduct research, develop new technologies, enhance 
capabilities for on-orbit environmental monitoring and expand 
basic knowledge of the effects of space walks on humans.  

Life sciences will continue to fund an expanding list of 
collaborative activities with the National Institutes of 
Health (NIH) in FY 1996.  Life sciences and NIH will continue 
to provide mutual support to a NASA-NIH specialized center of 
research and technology for research on the balance system at 
Northwestern Medical Center in Chicago.  Other collaborative 
research and technology projects include neurological and 
behavioral sciences research; developmental physiology and 
human development research; cardiovascular, pulmonary, and 
hematological systems research; and several cancer research 
projects, including work on advanced digital mammography 
techniques.  The agencies also are examining similarities 
between the effects of space flight and the aging process.

The life sciences small payloads program provides flight 
opportunities aboard the Space Shuttle or unmanned vehicles.  
In FY 1996, the program will finance 20 investigations 
including the NIH-Rodent 3 payload, which is a verification 
payload for Neurolab, and the Aquatic Research Facility, 
developed by the Canadian Space Agency.

Microgravity Sciences and Applications

OLMSA's microgravity sciences program works to develop a 
deeper understanding of important physical, chemical and 
biological processes by observing phenomena that are obscured 
by gravity in laboratories on Earth.  The results derived 
from conducting experiments in the Space Shuttle, the Mir 
space station and the International Space Station will 
stimulate the imagination of the academic and industrial 
science community, enhance the nationUs technological and 
industrial base and foster international cooperation.

Microgravity sciences will expend FY 1996 funds to continue 
experiment payload development for use in the Space Shuttle 
middeck, Spacelab, and Shuttle cargo bay.  Scheduled future 
missions include, the Life and Microgravity Spacelab  (LMS) 
mission, the Microgravity Science Laboratory mission and the 
United States Microgravity Payload (USMP) series of missions.  
NASA plans to fly the LMS and USMP-3 missions during FY 1996.  
Microgravity science funds also support principal 
investigators and data analysis during and after a mission.  
Ground-based research and analysis will continue in FY 1996 
in the areas of biotechnology, combustion sciences, fluid 
physics, material science and gravitational physics.

The continued NASA/Mir research program will include funding 
to support launching U.S. science hardware to Mir and support 
of science operations for the Mir experiments.  Microgravity 
sciences will use FY 1996 funding to develop experiments and 
support principal investigators, especially in the fields of 
combustion science and fluid physics, for the approaching 
operational phases of the International Space Station.

The requested FY 1996 funding level includes the continuation 
of the NASA/NIH cooperative program in biotechnology using 
the NASA developed bioreactor.  The microgravity program's 
cell culture technologies and protein crystal growth research 
will receive major emphasis for the next 5-6 years.

Shuttle/Spacelab Mission Management and Integration

The Mission Management and Integration program is responsible 
for mission planning, integration and successful execution of 
all NASA Spacelab, NASA/Mir and attached Shuttle payloads.

Mission management activities in FY 1996 will continue with 
the launch of several Space Shuttle module missions including 
LMS, NASA/Mir 3, NASA/Mir 4 and USMP-3.  Other mission 
planning efforts will support the final three flights of the 
NASA/Mir program, the MSL and the fourth flight of USMP.  
NASA will intensify Space Station planning and integration 
efforts as the first element launch date of space station 
approaches (12/97).

Aerospace Medicine and Occupational Health

This program provides for the health care and well-being of 
all NASA employees in their ground- and space-based work 
environments; and promotes applications of knowledge and 
technologies developed in the public and private sectors.

In FY 1996 Aerospace Medicine will continue to develop and 
demonstrate an operational telemedicine system for medical 
consultations between U.S. and Russian sites.  The program 
will provide operational medical support for NASA/Mir 
missions and the International Space Station.  It will 
perform a comprehensive risk assessment and review of medical 
requirements in preparation for Space Station, and continue 
and/or initiate collaborative efforts with national and 
international agencies to apply NASA derived technology for 
health applications.

Space Station Payload Facilities

The International Space Station will be the world's premier 
laboratory facility for studying the role of gravity in 
biological, physical and chemical systems.  OLMSA plans to 
use the Space Station as a science and technology research 
institute in space to advance fundamental scientific 
knowledge and to contribute new scientific discoveries for 
the benefit of the United States.  OLMSA will manage its 
Space Station effort to accelerate the rate at which it 
develops beneficial applications.  The program will deliver 
the capability to perform unique, long-duration, 
microgravity-dependent, space-based research in cell and 
developmental biology, plant biology, human physiology, 
biotechnology, fluid physics, combustion science, materials 
science and benchmark physics.

OLMSA's life sciences Space Station payload facilities 
program will develop three important Space Station hardware 
facilities: the Human Research Facility (HRF), the 
Gravitational Biology Facility (GBF) and the Centrifuge 
Facility (CF).

During FY 1996, the HRF project will continue the development 
of four racks of research hardware.  The initial design of 
the first rack of GBF hardware will be completed and members 
of the science community will conduct tests to evaluate the 
science utility of the design.  OLMSA will select a 
centrifuge contractor which will develop the centrifuge 
rotor, its habitat holding racks and the support rack.  The 
CF project plans to complete preliminary design reviews in FY 
1996.

The microgravity sciences Space Station payload facilities 
program will develop three major facilities for the Space 
Station; the Biotechnology Facility (BTF), the Fluids and 
Combustion Facility (FCF) and the Space Station Furnace 
Facility (SSFF).  These facilities, coupled with 
investigator-class payloads, will support a wide array of 
research in biotechnology, combustion science, fluids 
science, materials science and gravitational physics.

In FY 1996, the BTF experiment control computer will control 
cell and tissue culture experiments onboard the Mir space 
station.  This Mir precursor flight will reduce risk in the 
design and development of full facility operations for Space 
Station.  The BTF program will conduct its Critical Design 
Review near the end of FY 1996.  The SSFF core will be 
fabricated after the critical design review in December 1996.  
Modifications to the U.S. Spacelab furnace will begin in 
early 1996 to allow it to be the first U.S. furnace module in 
the facility .

In addition to the major facility-class payload facilities, 
NASA plans to fly smaller, less complex payloads on the 
International Space Station which will typically have more 
focused research objectives and shorter development time 
cycles.  The Expedite the Processing of Experiments to Space 
Station (EXPRESS) rack project provides a means for 
accommodating these smaller payloads.   The EXPRESS rack will 
enable a simple, streamlined analytical and physical 
integration process for small payloads by providing standard 
hardware and software interfaces.  The project includes a 
precursor flight of an EXPRESS rack in FY 1997 on the MSL 
Spacelab mission.  EXPRESS racks will be available to support 
initial payload operations in the U.S. Laboratory on the 
Space Station.

OFFICE OF SPACE ACCESS AND TECHNOLOGY (Code X)
Associate Administrator:  Dr. John E. Mansfield
Public Affairs Contact:   Jim Cast, 202/358-1779

The goal of the Office of Space Access and Technology is to 
pursue, in partnership with industry and government, new and 
innovative technologies that will meet the challenges and 
lower the costs of future space missions.  The Space Access 
and Technology program stimulates the development of advanced 
space technologies which improves the international 
competitiveness of U.S. aerospace and non-aerospace 
industries.  The ability of the U.S. to compete in the global 
market mandates that it develop new and innovative 
technologies that will dramatically lower the cost to 
develop, build and launch new spacecraft.  The OSAT budget 
request of $705.6 million in FY 1996 supports these new 
technologies and brings us closer to meeting the overall 
goal.  Highlights of the program are listed below.

Advanced Space Transportation $193 million

The goal of the Advanced Transportation program is to develop 
new technologies aimed at revolutionizing access to space.  
These new technologies are targeted at reducing launch costs 
dramatically over the next decade, increasing the safety and 
reliability of both current and next generation launch 
vehicles and increasing the reliability of spacecraft 
propulsion systems while reducing cost and weight.

In accordance with the National Space Transportation Policy 
released in August 1994, NASA is taking the lead in 
developing the technology for the next generation reusable 
space transportation system.  FY 1996 funding for the program 
provides for systems engineering and concept analysis ($4.7 
million), ground-based technology development ($59.3 
million), and a series of flight demonstrators ($95.0 
million) -- the DC-XA, the X-34 Small Booster technology 
testbed and the X-33 Large-Scale Advanced Technology 
Demonstrator.

Each part of this integrated program contributes to the 
process of validating key component technologies, proving 
that they can be integrated into a functional vehicle and 
demonstrating that they can be operated as required to make 
low-cost access to space a reality.

Spacecraft and Remote Sensing $177.5 million

The Spacecraft and Remote Sensing program has the primary 
goals of developing advanced spacecraft technology and 
systems concepts to reduce cost and increase performance of 
current and planned missions; to enable future missions; and 
to support the commercial development of space.  The program 
also has the goal of establishing and maintaining technical 
expertise not only critical to the success of NASA missions, 
but also valuable to the success of other government 
initiatives.

The Spacecraft and Remote Sensing program encompasses a range 
of technology, from far-term basic research to identify and 
exploit major new scientific and technical discoveries, 
through more near-term focused efforts aimed at specific user 
needs.  Organizationally, the program is focused along three 
general thrusts emphasizing the development and delivery of 
technology products.  The first thrust, Earth applications, 
focuses on scientific Earth observing systems technology to 
better understand global change and to develop commercial 
remote sensing as a viable new space industry.  The second 
thrust is technology for space science missions including 
space physics, deep space observation and planetary 
exploration.  The third technology thrust supports 
developments for Earth-orbiting platforms such as occupied 
space stations.  All three efforts are supported by specific 
activities implemented through cross-cutting technology areas 
including power and propulsion, materials and structures, 
operations, robotics, sensors and instruments and electronics 
and avionics.

In addition, NASA's efforts in the government-industry 
collaboration in automotive technologies, referred to as the 
Partnership for a Next Generation Vehicle (PNGV), are funded 
in this budget at $7.0 million.  PNGV, established by the 
President and the "Big 3" U.S. automobile manufacturers in 
1993, has the goals of:  (1) advancing manufacturing 
technology to improve productivity; (2) developing technology 
to improve the emissions and economy of conventional 
automobiles (3-5 years); and, (3) designing and developing 
technology and production prototype vehicles to triple 
current fuel economy in a "Taurus/Lumina/Concorde"-like 
automobile within 10-years.  NASA's role in the PNGV is 
primarily to develop advanced aerospace technology with 
direct application to the goals of the partnership.  The 
agency also uses its systems experience to lead the PNGV 
systems analysis activity and guide overall investment in the 
most promising vehicle concepts and technologies.

Advanced Smallsat Technology $33.9 million

The major goals of the Small Spacecraft Technology Initiative 
(SSTI) are to demonstrate how to reduce the cost and 
development time of space missions for science and commercial 
applications; to demonstrate new design and qualification 
methods for small spacecraft, including use of commercial and 
performance-based specifications and integration of small 
instrumentation technology into bus design; and to 
proactively promote commercial technology applications.

NASA is capitalizing on recent U.S. industry developments in 
the early generations of lightweight satellite concepts and 
critical subsystem component technology.  These developments 
have demonstrated the potential capability for small 
spacecraft design and methodology to greatly reduce the cost 
of civil and military space missions.  At the present time, 
international competition to design and launch more advanced 
commercial spacecraft for remote sensing and communications 
is impacting market opportunities for current products of the 
U.S. space industry.  This major national effort will exploit 
the "next generation" of miniaturization techniques for 
spacecraft components, advanced instrumentation and sensors 
in order to integrate them into U.S. advanced design 
concepts.

By using highly integrated teams of industry, small business, 
academia and government technologists, SSTI will demonstrate 
on-orbit--in a fast-track timeframe--advanced technologies 
for future space systems and develop new ways of conducting 
business that are unfettered by government specifications and 
excessive oversight.  As an example, NASA currently has 
contracts with TRW and CTA, Inc., for the design, 
development, production and launch of two advanced smallsats, 
named "Lewis" and "Clark", respectively.  These innovative, 
cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts contain clauses which 
should mitigate any cost overruns.  The integrated 
development team concept was emphasized in these contracts 
and resulted in a significantly larger percentage of small 
and disadvantaged business involvement.

Space Processing $18.1 million

The Space Processing program within Space Access and 
Technology has three major goals.  The first is to foster the 
development of new products using the unique micro-gravity 
and vacuum attributes of space.  The second is to increase 
U.S. business participation and investment in space-linked 
commercial goods and services in order to benefit the U.S. 
industries involved and the economy as a whole.  The third is 
to provide the opportunity for students to engage with 
industry in space program activities.

The Space Processing program is conducted in partnership with 
NASA's Life and Microgravity Science and Applications 
program, industry, universities, state governments and other 
federal agencies.  Utilizing program bases at universities 
and NASA field centers provides excellent opportunities to 
seek numerous and varied industrial affiliations.  The Space 
Processing program provides the required access to 
experimental facilities and offers frequent access to space 
utilizing the Space Shuttle middeck, SPACEHAB, Spacelab and 
Wake Shield facilities.  Such access is prohibitively 
expensive for most single corporations or small businesses, 
and this barrier to entry has greatly retarded the commercial 
development of space-linked products.  Through the cost-
sharing partnerships among NASA, the universities and 
industry offered by the Space Processing program, private 
enterprises of all sizes are able to afford the research most 
important to the development of space-linked commercial 
products.

Flight Programs $76 million

The primary goal of the Flight Programs budget element is to 
support the development and launch of flight experiments that 
will validate advanced space technologies, promote the 
creation of new knowledge, expand learning opportunities for 
students and produce new jobs, products and industries.  The 
primary goals of the In-Space Technology Experiments Program 
(IN-STEP) funded in the Flight Experiments budget element 
($30.1 million) are:  to reduce the cost and risk associated 
with future space missions; and to improve U.S. industry 
competitiveness by developing and operating the innovative 
flight experiments required to validate advanced technologies 
or investigate space environmental effects.  A secondary goal 
of the IN-STEP is to support U.S. educational objectives 
through the use of the "fast-track" student experiment 
program.

The goal of the Space Station Utilization program ($37.1 
million) is to support the development and operation of space 
processing and technology research using space stations as 
long-duration orbital facilities.  The long-duration space 
experiments created by the Space Station Utilization program 
will allow development of new products for both aerospace and 
non-aerospace applications, and for both commercial and 
government use.  An additional goal for the Phase I Space 
Station experiments is to reduce risk for follow-on Phase 
II/III Station experiments.

NASA's Commercial Middeck Augmentation Module contract ($8.1 
million) with SPACEHAB, Inc., enables industry participation 
in the commercial development of space by providing 
additional Shuttle middeck-type accommodations.

Commercial Technology Programs $40.4 million

NASA's goal is to elevate the commercial technology mission 
to a fundamental NASA mission, as important as any in the 
agency, by reinventing the way that the agency imparts the 
benefits of its knowledge, capabilities and research efforts 
into the national economy and the way that NASA derives 
benefits from the technological strength of American 
industry.

NASA is in the process of implementing a new way of doing 
business in the area of technology transfer.  Changes in the 
national R&D investment guidelines have elevated the 
commercial technology mission to a fundamental NASA mission.  
NASA's Agenda for Change, approved by the Administrator in 
July 1994, is the agency's blueprint for achieving this 
mission.  The Agenda for Change is organized into six 
sections, each reflecting an important aspect of this new way 
of doing business.  The six sections are:  Commercial 
Technology Policy; Commercial Technology Business Practices; 
Marketing NASA's Capabilities; Commercial Technology Metrics; 
Cultural Change Through Training and Education; and the 
Commercial Technology Electronic Network.  Each section 
implements components of the national and agency policies in 
order to reinvent the way that NASA transfers technology to 
and from the national economy.

Launch Vehicle Support $37.6 million

Through the Launch Services Mission Support budget, the 
Launch Vehicles Office (LVO) aggregates NASA and NOAA and 
international cooperative mission requirements and 
establishes appropriate acquisition strategies for purchasing 
firm, fixed-price launch services from the U.S. industry to 
support the various mission requirements.  The LVO also 
provides the required technical oversight of the commercial 
expendable launch vehicle (ELV) operator's delivery of 
service.  The objective is to provide affordable, 100-percent 
successful delivery to space.

Since the re-introduction of a national mixed fleet strategy 
in 1987, the LVO has delivered 100% successful launch 
services (24 ELV and 9 upper stages).  

Small Business Innovation Research Programs $129.1 million

The goal of NASA's Small Business programs is to promote the 
widest possible award of NASA research contracts within the 
small business community and to facilitate commercialization 
of these research results by the small business community.

Established by Congress, the Small Business Innovation 
Research (SBIR) program helps NASA develop innovative 
technologies by providing competitive research contracts to 
U.S.-owned small businesses.  NASA typically receives 2,300 
or more individual proposals each year.  Proposals are 
evaluated by the NASA field centers for scientific and 
technical merit; key staff qualifications; soundness of work 
plan; and anticipated commercial benefits.  NASA HQ program 
offices provide additional insight into commercial 
applications, program balance and critical agency 
requirements.  Selections are made by NASA HQ based on these 
recommendations and other considerations.  Typically, about 
600 awards are made each year.

The NASA Small Business Technology Transfer Pilot program 
(STTR) is a three-year program established in 1994.  In STTR, 
small businesses and research institutions with technological 
and business expertise submit joint proposals to convert 
intellectual property resident in the research institution 
into products that meet a NASA need and have commercial 
potential.  The STTR program, though modeled after the SBIR 
program, is a separate activity with separate funding and 
important differences in scope relative to SBIR.  The STTR 
program is to stimulate and foster scientific and 
technological innovation, including increasing 
commercialization of federal R&D.

MISSION TO PLANET EARTH (Code Y)
Associate Administrator:  Charles Kennel
Public Affairs Contact:  Brian Dunbar, 202/358-1547

The total Fiscal Year 1996 Budget Request for the Mission to 
Planet Earth (MTPE) Office is $1.3411 billion.

The overall goal of the Mission to Planet Earth is to 
understand the total Earth system and the effects of natural 
and human-induced changes on the global environment.  To 
preserve and improve the Earth's environment for future 
generations, governments around the world need policies based 
upon the strongest possible scientific understanding.  The 
vantage point of space provides information about the Earth's 
land, atmosphere, ice, oceans, and life that is obtainable in 
no other way.  In concert with the global research community, 
the MTPE is developing the understanding needed to support 
the complex environmental policy decisions that lie ahead and 
is establishing the foundation for long-term environmental 
monitoring and climate prediction.

Earth Observing System $591.1 million

The EOS program consists of a series of U.S. and 
international spacecraft, with the first launch--EOS-AM-1--
planned for 1998.  The overall goal of the Earth Observing 
System (EOS) is to advance the understanding of the Earth's 
global environment by improving our knowledge of its 
components, the interactions between them, and how the Earth 
system is changing.  EOS will study the atmosphere, oceans, 
ice, biosphere, land surface and solid Earth, particularly 
the flow of energy and the cycling of chemicals through the 
environment.

EOS Data and Information System $289.8 million

The EOS Data and Information System (EOSDIS) will produce the 
data and information products from the EOS, preserve them and 
all other MTPE observations and make all these data and 
information easily available to users ranging from the 
scientific communities to local governments and the education 
community.  EOSDIS is critical to achieving the goals of 
Mission to Planet Earth by enabling the public to benefit 
fully from our increased understanding and observations of 
the environment.

Earth Probes $36.9 million

The Earth Probes program addresses specific, highly-focused 
mission requirements.  It has the flexibility to take 
advantage of unique opportunities presented by international 
cooperative efforts or technical innovation, and to 
complement EOS by providing the ability to investigate 
processes that require special orbits or have unique 
requirements.  The currently approved Earth Probes are three 
Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometers (TOMS), scheduled for 
launch in mid-1995 aboard a Pegasus launch vehicle, February 
1996, aboard Japan's Advanced Earth Observing Satellite 
(ADEOS) and 2000 in a cooperative mission with the Russians; 
the NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT), also aboard ADEOS; and the 
U.S.-Japanese Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), 
scheduled for launch from Japan in 1997.

Payload and Instrument Development $4.9 million

Payloads and instrument development has two parts, 
atmospheric payloads and solid Earth payloads.  The goals of 
the atmospheric payloads program are to provide information 
related to the chemical constituency and dynamics of the 
Earth's atmosphere, and to provide highly calibrated 
measurements against which other measurements, particularly 
satellite data, can be compared.  The goal of the solid Earth 
payloads program is to demonstrate the technology and 
analytical techniques needed to make multi-frequency, multi-
polarization active radar measurements of the Earth's surface 
(i.e., land, sea, and ice).  

Applied Research and Data Analysis $308.4 million

The goal of Applied Research and Data Analysis is to advance 
our understanding of global climate and to provide the 
computer models and other tools necessary for understanding 
global climate change.  The program is divided into two major 
components:  Mission to Planet Earth Science (MTPE Science) 
and Operations, Data Retrieval and Storage.  MTPE Science 
contributes unique interdisciplinary scientific understanding 
of the global environment and the effects human activities 
have on it.  Operations, Data Retrieval and Storage consist 
of several independent activities responsible for spacecraft 
operations, the purchase and management of scientific data, 
and the provision of computing infrastructure.

GLOBE $5.0 million

NASA is participating in an interagency program involving 
NOAA, NSF and EPA.  The GLOBAL OBSERVATIONS TO BENEFIT THE 
ENVIRONMENT (GLOBE) Initiative will link scientific discovery 
with the education process in the study of the Earth's global 
environment.  The objective is to bring school children, 
teachers, and scientists together to: (1) enhance 
environmental awareness of individuals throughout the world; 
(2) contribute to scientific understanding of the Earth; and 
(3) help all students reach higher standards in science and 
mathematics.  In April 1995, on Earth Day, the first major 
observing event will occur, involving approximately 200 
schools worldwide.

Launch Services $88.0 million

This line item provides funding to NASA's Launch Vehicle 
Office to procure launch services for MTPE missions.  FY 1996 
funds will support continued preparations for the 1998 
launches of Landsat 7 and the first EOS satellite.


Construction of Facilities $17.0 million

The MTPE budget request includes funds to continue 
construction of the Earth System Science Building at GSFC.

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<p align=left><font size=5><strong>CIA Covert Operations</strong></font><br>
<br>
Historical Beginnings<br>
<br>
1947: Formed by Truman, as supported by section 102 of the National Security Act of 1947 principally assigned the missions<br>
of: <br>
<br>
Coordinate the U.S. intelligence effort. <br>
Correlate and evaluate intelligence (but other intelligence agencies may also do so). <br>
CIA will access to the product of other intelligence agencies (including information from the FBI) <br>
Eschew police and internal security functions (in other words no domestic operation <br>
CIA reports to the President through the National Security Council and should perform such other functions and duties<br>
related to intelligence affecting the national security as the National Security Council may from time to time direct. <br>
<br>
12/47: NSC Directive 4/A placed the CIA in charge of &quot;psychological operations&quot;, most likely in response to the October<br>
formation of the Cominform, a collective propoganda organization whose members were not only the Eastern Bloc countries<br>
but included the Soviet Union, France, Italy, Bulgariak, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia. The<br>
addition of France and Italy in this list did not come as a surprise, as it was seen that the Soviet Union was already infiltrating<br>
labor unions, student organizations, women's organizations, and others in both countries. The CIA had already been directed<br>
by the CIA to &quot;prop up&quot; the democracy in Italy. <br>
<br>
12/22/47: DCI Hillinkoetter sent James Angleton to Italy to set up a &quot;special procedure group&quot; to direct such covert<br>
operations as &quot;might be authorized&quot;. By 1948, Angleton was receiving adequate sums to be used to subsidize the center right 
in<br>
Italian politics, and to manipulate opinion through forgeries and other devices. <br>
<br>
1/48: Secratary of State Forrestal urged DCI Hillenkoetter to intensify cover operations in Italy to support the democratic<br>
government. Forrestal was reluctant both becuase of the repercussions to any public disclosure which could occur, and<br>
because he the agency's legal counsel did not believe they had the authority to conduct covert operations without the advice<br>
and consent of the U.S. Senate. <br>
<br>
2/48: NSC declared Italy essential to the U.S. national security, and that the country be preserved from external attack and<br>
from subversion by Soviet dominated communist movements within Italy. <br>
<br>
4/9/48: During meetings to setup the charter for the Organization of American States (OAS), the Liberal Party opposition<br>
leader Jorge Eliecar Gaitan was killed by an assasin. This touched off riots, all occuring on the same day as the U.S.<br>
Washington Post had released the precepts of a U.S. propoganda program to &quot;counter-inform&quot;. The CIA was wrongly taken<br>
to task for not providing intelligence on the riot. <br>
<br>
5/48: NSC 10/2 cancelled 4/A and established a new covert operational branch of the CIA. Its covert operations would have<br>
to be of a type which the U.S. Government can plausibly disclaim any responsibility and could not involve armed conflict by<br>
recognized military forces, but could include propoganda; economic warfare; preventitive direct action, including sabotage,<br>
anti- sabotage, demolition, and evacuation measures; subversion against hostile states, includingg assistance to underground<br>
resistance movements, guerillas and refugee liberation groups, and support of indigenous anti-communist elements in 
threatened<br>
countries of the free world. <br>
<br>
1949: Central Intelligence Act of 1949, provided the CIA with a seal of office, authorized training for CIA officers, and<br>
specified employment conditions (personnel issues). More importantly, the act specified how the CIA could use secret funds<br>
(one budget item to be doled out by the DCI as needed without normal accounting review), the right to borrow personnel 
from<br>
other agencies of government (Military, FBI, NSA, etc.), to ignore immigration laws, allowing up to one hundred illegal aliens<br>
per year (allowing the use of defectors), and gave the DCI the right to determine what in the CIA is should be kept secret. <br>
<br>
Chronological History of Operations<br>
<br>
RADIO FREE EUROPE, 1949 <br>
<br>
Radio Free Europe setup as a major propoganda tool, broadcasting into Eastern Europe. <br>
<br>
GREECE, 1949 <br>
<br>
Truman authorized major aid to Greek anti-communists as part of a coopertive plan with the British MI-6. <br>
<br>
ALBANIA, 1949 <br>
<br>
CIA's first (as far as we know) attempt to topple a government, was against the goverment of Enver Hoxha of Albania. This<br>
was also a plan taken over from the financially strapped British (MI-6). Funds were given to the British to support their agents<br>
in Albania. The operations failed, primarily it would seem due to Kim Philby, a very famous Soviet Agent in the British MI-6<br>
contingent in Washington, D.C. <br>
<br>
PHILIPPINES 1948 <br>
<br>
1948-1954: CIA worked with indigenous folk in the Philippines to help defeat the HUK left wing insurgency movement (funds<br>
and support were used rather than actual CIA agents). This was a clear case of successful counter-insurgency due to a major<br>
contribution of Lt. Colonel Edward G. Lansdale, an Air Force Officer actually volunteered to the the CIA who befriended<br>
Ramon Magsaysay who was eventually elected in 1953. As part of this operation the U.S. built 4000 prefabricated<br>
schoolhouses. The key to the victory was the advocacy of local nationalism and promotion by indigenous personnel rather 
than<br>
advocacy from external sources. <br>
<br>
10/10/49: Civil Air Transport began operating exclusively as part of the CIA's worlwide air transport company, and now the<br>
most well known of the CIA &quot;propietaries&quot;. <br>
<br>
IRAN 1953 <br>
<br>
8/53: Prime Minister of Iran, Mohammed Mosaddeq was ousted by Mohammed Reza Shah Pahlavi, who became the Shah 
of<br>
Iran. The &quot;legned&quot; is that five U.S. Army officers on loan to the CIA financed the coup with US$1 million worth of Iranian 
cash<br>
in Tehran, led by Kermit (Kim) Roosevelt, the grandson of Teddy Roosevelt and cousin to FDR. British Petroleum (in their<br>
wholly owned company Anglo-Iranian Old Company) probably contributed a great deal to the coup as well. <br>
<br>
GUATEMALA 1954 <br>
<br>
1954: CIA engineered the downfall of the democratically elected leftward leaning President of Guatemala Jacobo Arbenz<br>
Guzman. Unfortunately the man taking over was Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas who soon became a notorious dictator. The<br>
coup was in part due to propoganda broadcasts from the &quot;Voice of Liberation&quot; radio stations run by the CIA accusing Arbenz<br>
of ineptitude, and having communist sympathies (including faking news of a shipment of arms from Czechoslovakia). The final<br>
lie was news of a massive overland invading force of rebels, which were in fact air missions by CAT and the CIA. It should be<br>
noted that Che Guevara narrowly escaped capture in the operation, and became a problem thereafter until his murder later in<br>
another CIA operation. <br>
<br>
HUNGARY 1956 <br>
<br>
Due to a promise made by the Republican administration to free Eastern Europe, a means for enciting trouble within the<br>
Eastern bloc countries was being searched for. A copy of Kruschev's secret de-Stalinization speech was broadcast over<br>
Radio Free Europe. The members of the Hungarian Desk at Radio Free Europe further hinted at U.S. aid coming to help East<br>
European countries who rose against the communists. Hungarian dissidents killed 7000 Russians while taking losses of 30,000<br>
themselves before the revolt was crushed by some 200,000 Russian troops and 2,500 Russian tanks. <br>
<br>
INDONESIA 1958 <br>
<br>
CIA attempted to topple the leftward leaning government of President Achmed Sukarno. In May of '58, a B-26 aircraft being<br>
operated by C.A.T. was shot down while it was on a bombing and strafing mission to aid the rebels. The CIA involvement<br>
became apparent and ended the operation. <br>
<br>
NORTH VIETNAM 1954-1958 <br>
<br>
Edward Lansdale could not succeed at overthrowing the existing government in North Vietname despite his working on it 
from<br>
1954 to 1958. <br>
<br>
CUBA 1959-60s <br>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the difference between the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and the Central<br>
Intelligence Agency (CIA)? </strong><br>
<br>
A: The DIA serves as the Nation's primary manager and producer of foreign military intelligence and a Combat Support<br>
Agency in the Department of Defense (DoD). It fills a critically important need for a central intelligence producer and manager<br>
for the Department of Defense (DoD) to support directly the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), the Unified<br>
Combatant Commands and the Military Services. While DIA and CIA are both members of the Intelligence Community, DIA<br>
is the principal source for military-related foreign intelligence. CIA is focused on providing foreign intelligence to the President,<br>
Vice President, National Security Council and the members of the Cabinet. For more information on CIA, please refer to the<br>
CIA Home Page which can be accessed under Related Web Sites on DIA's Home Page. <br>
<br>
<strong>Q: How do I go about doing business or contracting with DIA? <br>
</strong><br>
A: For information on how DIA's contract process and procedures, please refer to the Virginia Contracting Authority section<br>
of the DIA Home Page which can be found under Related Web Sites. <br>
<br>
<strong>Q: How do I apply for a position at DIA? </strong><br>
<br>
A: The Civilian Personnel Division maintains a resource pool for entry level positions (grades GS-07 thru GS-11) in the<br>
Intelligence Officer and Support Officer fields. This pool is used to fill current and anticipated vacancies. Applicants interested<br>
in competing for entry into this pool should submit an SF-171 (Application for Federal Employment), OF 612 (Optional<br>
Application for Federal Employment), or a thorough resume along with a copy of their college transcript(s). <br>
<br>
Applicants interested in positions graded at the GS-12 level or above must apply directly to a vacancy announcement. To<br>
review a listing of current civilian vacancy announcements, please refer to the Employment section of our DIA Home Page.<br>
You may also wish to call the DIA Job Line on (703) 907-1710 or (800) 526-4629 to hear a listing of current employment<br>
opportunities with DIA. Individuals interested in applying for an advertised position must submit a separate application and a<br>
supplemental narrative statement (SNS) for each position. Applications should be forwarded to DIA, Civilian Personnel<br>
Division (DAH-2), Washington, DC, 20340-5100; telephone: (202) 231-4311. <br>
<br>
<strong>Q: Does DIA offer summer internships to college students? </strong><br>
<br>
A: Summer internship opportunities are available for students who will be in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area during 
the<br>
summer months. Students must: (1) be enrolled in a baccalaureate or graduate degree program that is primarily focused on<br>
skills deemed critical to DIA (i.e., engineering, computer science, mathematics, geography, earth sciences, foreign area<br>
studies/international relations, political science, or specific liberal arts degree), and (2) have a minimum grade point average<br>
(GPA) of 2.75 on a 4.0 scale or its equivalent. These opportunities are staffed at grades GS-03 thru GS-09 depending on the<br>
number of credit hours the student has earned. <br>
<strong><br>
Q: How do I go about submitting a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to DIA? </strong><br>
<br>
A: All requests for information under FOIA must be submitted to DIA in writing. FOIA requests and additional information<br>
may be directed to DIA's FOIA Office, Washington, DC, 20340-5100; telephone: (202) 231-3916. </p>

Baden</P><P>PRESIDENT Clinton is desperately looking for places to cut the budget. He even hints of hitting the Rural Electrification Administration. REA is an egregious example of government subsidies that enrich the wealthy while retarding environmentally beneficial innovation.</P><P>       REA was established in 1935 by President Roosevelt. It subsidized the delivery of electric power to remote rural locations at a time when few rural areas were electrified. Because the costs of stringing miles of power lines to isolated customers was so high, and alternative energy just developing, only 10 percent of farms had electricity.</P><P>     Lack of electricity contributed to low rural living standards. With collectivism in vogue, it appeared reasonable for the public to pay for power delivery. Taxpayers were to lose nothing: Federal subsidies were made at interest rates higher than the government's costs of borrowing. However, being a political promise, it was short-lived.</P><P>     Economies are like ecosystems in that you cannot do only one thing. REA had unintended, perverse consequences. Once these consequences are understood, the REA's appeal shrinks. But it has built a constituency and it won't quietly go away.</P><P>     First, few of the REA's subsidies actually benefit poor, rural areas. They did for a while, but do not now. Today, subsidies go to wealthy resort communities such as Vail, Aspen and Beaver Creek, Colo., and Hilton Head, S. C. They also go to wealthy suburbs of Atlanta, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and Washington, D.C. Over half the subsidies benefit Fortune 500 companies. The REA is subsidizing skiers, suburbanites, resorts and big businesses with middle-class taxes.</P><P>     Second, the REA loans almost $2 billion annually, and more than 60 percent of these loans will never be repaid because interest rates on the loans are less than the rates the government must pay to borrow money. However, subsidies for the rich and increases in the federal deficit pale in comparison to the third consequence of the REA: nearly 60 years of discouraging research into alternative energies and conservation.</P><P>     The REA subsidized centrally generated power. This created a bias against small-scale alternative energies. Centralized power plants sometimes have cost advantages, what economists call economies of scale. But if delivering this power is expensive, alternative energy sources (e.g. biomass conversions, solar, wind, small-scale hydroelectric, and tidal power) become competitive. Also, people are encouraged to conserve by seeking more-efficient appliances, machinery and tools.</P><P>     The REA eliminated the delivery-cost advantages of alternative energies and discouraged their development. Research into solar and wind power and organic fuels declined sharply after the creation of the REA. Inventors and investors realized that oil, coal, large-scale hydroelectric and eventually nuclear power were favored over small-scale alternatives.</P><P>     For example, Marcellus Jacobs, founder of the once-successful Jacobs Wind Electric Co., states that the spread of REA-subsidized facilities signaled the end of his business. The solar water-heating industry, resurging after World War II, was also stunted by cheap electric rates. Likewise, the ultimate demise of research into tidal power is attributable to the subsidized introduction of cheap electricity.</P><P>     Subsidies usually have negative environmental consequences. In this case, some of the environmental costs are the loss of nearly 60 years of research and development in conservation and alternative energy. In rural areas, the cost of centrally generated power is high. This gave incentive for research and development into small-scale alternative energy and energy conservation. But REA subsidies favored central power.</P><P>     Even when subsidies do some good, such as electrifying rural America, they frequently do great hidden harm. In the case of the REA, the harm is almost 60 years of lost alternative energy research. Subsidized rural electricity has deepened dependence on foreign oil, on dirty coal, on big dams, and on expensive nuclear power.</P><P>     Since alternative futures are unknowable, we cannot know the costs of stifling innovation with subsidies. But we do know there will be costs, and that they are often significant. We know that government subsidies often become twisted to serve the interests of the rich and powerful at the expense of the weak and vulnerable. In the case of the REA, the financial and environmental costs of subsidies have been huge.</P><P>     Government subsidies are dangerous and costly, even when originally intended for good purposes. And once in place, they are very hard to eliminate. Let the public remember this when considering the Clinton administration's new budgets.</P><P> __________ </P><P> John A. Baden, Ph.D., is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment and teaches in the University of Washington Business School.

And many environmentalists are gloating.</P><P>      They are using the grizzly, the wolf and the salmon - symbolically some of America's most important creatures - together with one of the most obscure, the northern spotted owl, to hold development hostage.</P><P>      But if pushed to its ultimate extreme, the Endangered Species Act could so disrupt economies that pressure to amend it - or challenge it on constitutional grounds - will become irresistible.</P><P>      Environmentalists do a good job of explaining the prime rule of ecology: Everything is tied to everything else. We can never do just one thing; everything in an ecosystem is linked. This is why &quot;indicator species&quot; that measure the quality of habitat, such as the spotted owl, are important. A threat to them indicates the system is awry.</P><P>      However, we are also learning that such interdependence applies equally to political and economic systems: There, too, it is impossible to do only one thing. We take one action and see unintended consequences.</P><P>      Those of us who value the endangered wolf, grizzly or owl's habitat should ask the same question for any actions taken under the Endangered Species Act - especially when that law begins to affect private-property rights.</P><P>      The political process inevitably links economics and ecology. People's ecological concern is directly related to their security and prosperity. Since economic as well as ecological systems are highly dynamic, proposed changes are likely to bring unintended mischief. We are seeing this unfold with the spotted owl.</P><P>      The reaction from the timber industry and many Northwest politicians to preserving a habitat of 11.3 million acres was vitriolic. At a rally in May, Washington Gov. Booth Gardner told 3,000 loggers and their families: &quot;The latest designation of habitat is unnecessary, unacceptable and inconsistent with the law, and we can't allow it.&quot;</P><P>      On the same day, U.S. District Judge William Dwyer barred the U.S. Forest Service from selling any more timber in northern-spotted-owl habitat until it finished writing rules to ensure the bird's survival.</P><P>      If there is any certainty in the spotted-owl saga, it is that the government will not voluntarily compensate private landowners for their losses in helping to save the owl. Like the spotted owl, property rights are threatened, if not endangered.</P><P>      The critical habitat plan for preserving the spotted owl has many unintended consequences. Some of these, like the loss of timber-related jobs, are obvious. Others are less apparent. Among these hidden consequences is the impact on management incentives of property owners.</P><P>      There is no doubt that the Endangered Species Act applies to private lands. Under Fish and Wildlife Service regulations, private landowners are prohibited from &quot;taking&quot; or &quot;harming&quot; listed species. There is nothing in the act that speaks to the taking or harming of private-property rights, but there is such a provision in the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.</P><P>      The spotted-owl controversy is the tip of the iceberg of conflict between endangered-species protection and private-property rights. The Fish and Wildlife Service also is on the verge of listing the Columbia River sockeye salmon as endangered.</P><P>      The sockeye is only the first of many anadromous fish runs being studied by the agency. The potential impact for private rights in land and water could make the spotted-owl regulations seem insignificant.</P><P>      The Endangered Species Act specifically states that economic factors are not to play a role in the decision to list a species as threatened or endangered.</P><P>       Many biologists even questioned the appropriateness of placing two economists on the recovery task force for the spotted owl. Once a recovery plan is written, the only incentive for public and private land managers to follow the plan is the threat of a lawsuit if they do not.</P><P>      A far better solution would be to use economic incentives to help protect endangered species. One approach would create a Biodiversity Trust Fund, derived from a fixed percentage of the revenues from public land activities - such as logging, mining, grazing and recreation - that impinge on wildlife habitat.</P><P>      If these resources were sold at fair market value, and 10 percent were paid to the fund, between $500 million and $1 billion per year would be available to protect critical wildlife habitat.</P><P>      A Biodiversity Fund board of trustees, consisting of respected scientists with specialties in fields such as evolutionary biology and restoration ecology, could be nominated by the National Academy of Sciences to allocate this money.</P><P>       They could buy conservation easements in the areas where disturbances might harm listed species. They also could pay &quot;bounties&quot; to land managers if an endangered species successfully breeds on their land.</P><P>      The trust fund would completely change the incentives surrounding rare and endangered species. Private landowners would support, rather than oppose, the listing of new species because of the potential that they could get paid for harboring such species.              In the end, protection would be possible for a wider number of species without all the political and legal turmoil that now surrounds the Endangered Species Act.</P><P>      And the Endangered Species Act might no longer be endangered.</P><P>________________</P><P> John Baden, Ph.D., is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment (FREE), with offices in Bozeman, Mont., and Seattle. </P><!--FOOT--><HR>

Baden</P><P>&quot;THE Tragedy of the Commons&quot; appeared in Science magazine in 1968.</P><P> Though written by an ecologist, Garret Hardin, the article is a classic of political economy.</P><P>     Understanding the logic of this article should be a requirement of running for political office. It explains how and why we should expect waste when biological resources such as fisheries are openly available.</P><P>     The logic of the commons is straightforward. When no one has control over a resource, be it a parcel of ocean or a dormitory lounge, it tends to be poorly maintained, overused, or depleted. Without social or legal constraints, some people will maximize their personal advantages to the detriment of others. All users suffer, while benefits go to the exploiting individual. The incentive is for people to seek narrow personal advantages at the expense of the group and the resource. Few people act as wise stewards because others take a &quot;free ride&quot; on such actions, and rarely reciprocate.</P><P>     The North Pacific groundfish fishery within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone off Alaska exemplifies a commons problem. Under the current open-access regime, there are only indirect controls on fishing. Short seasons and restrictions on fishing boats' size and horsepower are examples. These controls are extremely inefficient, have resulted in billions of dollars in excessive capital investment, and encourage chaotic races for fish that magnify the dangers of an already risky job.</P><P>     Experience suggests the problem may get worse under the current open-access system. Human, ecological and financial losses are likely to increase as the race for the fish becomes more frenzied. Brief, hurried seasons will increase pressure on fish populations and promote bycatch - the incidental capture of non-target species. Fortunately, unlike many of the world's fisheries, the basic stock remains healthy for now.</P><P>     A smart, honest and principled political leader could create huge safety, economic and ecological benefits by seriously addressing our fishery commons. Action need not be difficult, for we already have a solution. It is individual transferable quotas (ITQs) - a method of creating secure, transferable and reasonably well-defined property rights to fish. Here's how they work.</P><P>     First, peer reviewed research establishes the biologically sustainable yield of a fishery: how many fish can be taken without reducing the quantity or quality of the catch over time. Because these are estimates, not certainties, the allowable catch is always less than the theoretical maximum. Based on this estimated yield, a set of quotas is issued. Each entitles its holder to a fixed percentage of the total allowable catch.</P><P>     The initial distribution of rights has wealth implications. That's why parceling out quotas is the contentious feature of ITQ systems. Assigning quotas is one of the main factors delaying action by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, the body overseeing the region's fisheries. The two principal alternatives for distributing quotas are a giveaway to existing fishermen, or an auction, perhaps one open to the public.</P><P>     With an ITQ system, quota holders have secure claims to a percentage of the total allowable catch. Only those with quotas may fish. Fishermen need not race to get their share. An extended fishing season means fewer days at sea for long hours or in dangerous weather. We'd also expect reductions in bycatch.</P><P>     Quotas give their owners incentives to conserve fish. As long as fisheries remain a commons, there are strong incentives to catch as many fish as quickly as possible. With ITQs, fishermen can increase the value of their quota and the size of their future catch, by allowing fish populations to increase. Such behavior has already been observed in the wreckfish, Southern bluefin tuna and various shellfish fisheries.</P><P>     With ownership, quotas can be bought and sold. Some fishermen will exit the industry. The more efficient fishermen and those who love fishing will buy or retain quotas and remain. Fewer ships and less equipment will be needed to catch a given amount of fish, reducing overhead and improving efficiency. And ITQs do not necessarily favor large operations over smaller ones.</P><P>     An increasing number of professional environmentalists, including well-respected economists with the Environmental Defense Fund, are showing an interest in ITQs. ITQs have the support of associations representing more than 80 percent of the seafood harvested in the North Pacific fisheries. They are the least painful way to downsize an industry made dangerous by short seasons and by federal subsidies that have promoted excessive investments in men, ships and equipment.</P><P>     The North Pacific Fishery Management Council has, overall, resisted consideration of ITQs, although its own staff concluded such a system would solve many of the industry's problems.</P><P>     Political entrepreneurs such as Greenpeace and the Alliance Against IFQs (IFQs being roughly similar to ITQs) have opposed ITQs because they fear the impact of such quotas on their private interests. Though we may sympathize with their concerns, political leadership is required to overcome their opposition to a valuable improvement in fishery management. Without it, more lives will be lost and politically sanctioned ecological plunder will continue. </P><P> _________</P><P>  John A.

BADEN</P><P>           AS PRESIDENT-ELECT Clinton and Vice President-elect Gore look toward Jan. 20, they must confront the problem of reconciling their environmental rhetoric with economic reality. Much is promised: Al Gore's environmental commitment is unprecedented for a vice president and adds to pent-up pressures to address environmental concerns.</P><P>       But this pressure comes during a flat economy and, thanks to Ross Perot, a heightened concern for our ballooning federal debt. These problems will seriously constrain the available options. As forest economist Randal O'Toole said, &quot;the federal deficit has become the nation's No. 1 environmental threat.&quot;</P><P>        We see a resolution in Senator Gore's book &quot;Earth in the Balance.&quot; He links fiscal prudence with environmental concern when he proposes that &quot;the first and most obvious changes involve the elimination of those public expenditures . . . that encourage and subsidize environmentally destructive economic activity.&quot; His position merits the support of both the National Taxpayers Union and Greenpeace. This opportunity was missed by the self-professed &quot;fiscally conservative&quot; administrations of the past 12 years.</P><P>     But if the new administration is to successfully advance such reforms, it must have a strong and consistent messenger to forcefully articulate this vision.</P><P>     Fortunately, one exists. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) is an unused treasure. Created in 1970 by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), it was to be the ecological equivalent of the Council of Economic Advisers, &quot;to make and furnish . . . recommendations with respect to matters of (environmental) policy.&quot; But it never exercised a strong voice, and under the Reagan administration its funding was drastically cut. Rather than employing the CEQ as an instrument to advance reforms, the Reagan and Bush administrations simply shunted off, defunded and ignored it.</P><P>     The CEQ is required by law to publish an annual environmental-quality report. This volume can be used to show innovative ways to address environmental problems. Many such opportunities exist.</P><P>     For example, west of the 100th meridian, the federal government owns 50 percent of the land. These lands and waters are prime candidates for such reform. The growing field of environmental history documents the century plus of abuse which has plagued these lands as they were exploited by one constituency after another. The policies of government agencies were consistently rigged to benefit special interests. Heralded reforms only changed the channels of political control; they did not pull the plug.</P><P>     Today the West suffers from the bureaucratic residual of the well-intentioned Progressive Era reforms of the late 1800s and early 1900s. Under the Progressive Era's model, modern science and technology were to advance the public interest. Federal agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service (1896) and the Bureau of Reclamation (1902) were created to provide omniscient, benevolent and far-sighted management.</P><P>     But they didn't. In reality, these agencies led to a century of government mismanagement and special-interest plums. Here, as in Eastern Europe, socialized management has failed to meet high environmental or economic standards while eroding ethics of those who work in or deal with the agencies.</P><P>     This is shown in virtually every government land-management agency: In the Northern and Central Rockies, Forest Regions 1 and 2, every forest lost money in fiscal year 1991, while the Forest Service promoted, through creative accounting and outright subsidies, clear-cutting on lands that would not be logged without government help.</P><P>       The Bureau of Land Management short-changes wildlife and encourages overgrazing while charging far below market rates for livestock. The Mining Law of 1872 allows firms to acquire minerals with no royalties, and then claim the land for nominal sums. The Bureau of Reclamation and the Corps of Engineers subsidize the damming of free-flowing rivers to the benefit of a few politically powerful irrigation interests.</P><P>     Politics distorts National Park Service management of sensitive ecosystems and leads to massive disturbances of supposedly protected areas. These are the predictable consequences of political management.</P><P>     All of these abuses are ecologically and economically wasteful. They continue, of course, because the interests who benefit from these arrangements fight to maintain their favored status. They see their way of life threatened by reforms.</P><P>     They are not paranoid. It is threatened, and should be. Most of these government programs are disguised welfare. But in the mountains and on the plains as elsewhere, welfare generates dependency, not wealth. A program's existence should not guarantee its continuance.</P><P>     Perception of our fiscal crisis can drive these overdue reforms. By making users of federal lands, including recreation users, pay their own way, we can address both budgetary and ecological concerns. Hard-nosed analysis must be applied to other government programs as well. For example, government-subsidized coastal flood insurance, in addition to being a subsidy for wealthy home builders and buyers, increases seaside development in ecologically sensitive areas.</P><P>     In this world of scarcity we should always combine environmental concern with economic awareness. The Council on Environmental Quality can articulate these visions. Just as the Council of Economic Advisers has at times provided a strong voice for innovative economic policy prescriptions, the CEQ can provide a strong platform for environmental reform. If the environmental promises of our new administration are to be honored, they must harmonize the environment with economic forces. The CEQ can explain and advertise the appropriate reforms.</P><P>__________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>            AT a conference last October, I listened to a speech by Gregory Benford, a respected biophysicist and acclaimed writer of science fiction. He noted that the 19th century had been dominated scientifically and culturally by chemistry, the 20th by physics, and predicted the 21st would be dominated by biology.</P><P>       Professor Benford is undoubtedly correct that the coming &quot;Biological Century&quot; promises staggering benefits, benefits likely to rival those wrought by chemistry and physics. But there will also be resistance. Before we can judge how to react to biological developments and their opponents, it may be helpful to consider some relevant facts.</P><P>      One important point is that biotechnology has already produced many useful innovations. For example, bioengineered human insulin has reduced the discomfort and inconveniences of diabetes. Drought- and disease-resistant crops have dramatically improved yields worldwide and reduced the need for fertilizers, pesticides and cropland. Perhaps most impressive of all, the ambitious Human Genome Project is already increasing our knowledge of genetics and revealing the causes of many inheritable diseases.</P><P>      Consider one potentially beneficial innovation: synthetic bovine somatotropin (BST), a replica of the hormone that stimulates lactation in cows. Synthetic BST supplements cows' natural hormones, increasing milk production by an average of 9 pounds per cow per day. It is environmentally beneficial because it increases the amount of milk that can be produced from a given amount of grains and grasses. But such wonders are costly. Monsanto, a leading pharmaceutical company, spent an estimated $300 to $500 million developing BST during the 1980s.</P><P>      BST has undergone extensive safety testing. In 1985, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that its use poses no danger to humans or cows. The FDA found that milk from cows treated with BST is virtually indistinguishable from other cows' milk. It has the same proteins, nutrients and concentrations of BST as milk from untreated cows. The National Institutes of Health, American Medical Association, American Academy of Pediatrics and World Health Organization have also found BST to be completely safe for humans.</P><P>      In spite of the financial and research investments made to ensure BST's effectiveness and safety, certain groups have strongly opposed its introduction. The opposition has three sources: genuine fears that modified organisms may be harmful to humans or the environment; political entrepreneurs who seek to benefit by creating a crisis atmosphere, and special interests whose political privileges are threatened by its introduction.</P><P>      Such opportunistic opposition to innovation has great risks. It can increase the already significant costs of developing products like BST, slowing their rate of introduction and denying people their benefits.</P><P>      Apprehension regarding BST is understandable and I, too, urge caution. But after years of study and research, little, if any, danger is likely. Bioengineered organisms have caused no harm to people or the environment even after dozens of field tests and the escape of millions of microbes from laboratories. The National Academy of Sciences, Ecological Society of America and most DNA biologists agree that biotechnology poses minimal risks if properly monitored. BST is no exception.</P><P>      The opposition voiced by political entrepreneurs and special interests is less principled. As demonstrated by the Alar scare (not a biotech product), these groups are quite willing to purposely mislead the public through incorrect science and media hype.</P><P>      Jeremy Rifkin is perhaps the most prominent political entrepreneur in the realm of biotechnology. Rifkin has made a career from fear-mongering - authoring numerous anti-technological books and running his &quot;nonprofit&quot; Foundation for Economic Trends. Ignoring scientific evidence and preying on the public's lack of information, he has implied that BST and other biotech products are unhealthy or unnatural. By creating public opposition, he increases the pressure on legislators and regulators to institute policies that slow biotechnological innovation.</P><P>      The conflict over BST is a harbinger of things to come. If selfishly motivated individuals are allowed to manipulate public opinion and the regulatory process without being accountable for the accuracy of their facts, we will seriously curtail the development of biotechnology. This would be an enormous tragedy because the benefits it promises are immense and within reach.</P><P>      The century of biology is neither guaranteed nor automatic. If it is to blossom we must ensure that regulatory decisions follow sound science and the interests of the citizenry, not the machinations of special interests. The alternative will leave all of us poorer. </P><P>__________</P><P>John A.

This summer, the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment (FREE) again hosted conferences for federal judges, seminars for environmental writers, bike trips, and research on environmental economics and policy.</P><P>       But I see changes in Montana. One is congestion and the new rich who've discovered the &quot;last best place.&quot; Also, new bureaucratic pathologies have arrived. A dramatic example is the Idaho Pole Superfund site in north Bozeman. Though many cities have Superfund sites - Denver and Salt Lake have three, Seattle has four - they are ripples in the economic ocean of a big city. In Bozeman, they are tidal waves.</P><P>     Professor Richard Stroup, my former colleague, and Sandra Goodman recently published a report on Superfund, EPA's effort to clean up toxic waste (&quot;Rights vs. Regulation; How to Reform Superfund&quot;). Their report includes a description of Bozeman's Idaho Pole facility and indicates that Idaho Pole exemplifies many Superfund sites where health risks are overstated and bureaucratic power enhanced. This is not an accident, for the EPA has strong incentives to push caution to dangerous levels.</P><P>     Twenty-five years ago, I worked in the woods and helped send some of the best and largest lodgepole pines to Idaho Pole. They treated these logs with chemicals to make long lasting wooden utility poles. At some point, a chemical used to treat these poles, pentachlorophenol (PCP), was spilled, leaving what the EPA says are potentially harmful concentrations. The EPA has tried to convince the public that the Idaho Pole site is a threat to the community.</P><P>     But the EPA is probably wrong. EPA calculations of the future risks posed by the Idaho Pole site, as at many other Superfund sites, rely upon shaky assumptions. The EPA assumed that Idaho Pole's property would become a residential trailer park within two years - even though Idaho Pole is profitable - and that residents would drill wells for drinking water even though Bozeman's municipal water supply is already there. The EPA also ignored information from its own Office of Toxic Substances indicating that the concentration of PCP in water decreases by half every 20 to 200 days. Risks that may exist will diminish significantly over time.</P><P>     Stroup and Goodman see further problems with the EPA's risk assessments. In identifying Superfund sites, the EPA consistently assumes unlikely, risk-enhancing situations and ignores mitigating factors in their Superfund decisions. Such methodological errors undermine the agency's judgment and make the usefulness of its National Priorities List highly suspect. Yet the Superfund law severely limits the accused polluter's right to review EPA claims in court.</P><P>     Stroup and Goodman do not discuss, but I find more disturbing, Superfund's apparent violations of the spirit of our constitutional prohibition on ex post facto laws - laws that make past actions illegal and punishable. It forces firms to finance cleanups of perfectly legitimate activities when no actual harm has been demonstrated.</P><P>     If people were engaged in legal, productive activities and we later decide that cleanup is necessary, we the public should pay. It is not just or equitable to impose cleanup costs on someone whose responsibility is tangential and trivial. But with Superfund's joint and several liability, any involvement can lead to complete responsibility as EPA searches for deep pockets.</P><P>     To a political economist, these problems are predictable consequences of the EPA's incentives. The EPA is blamed when toxic waste harms people directly, but rarely criticized if its regulations harm people in hidden ways. For example, if a highly carcinogenic chemical leached into groundwater, and the EPA failed to act, there would be severe repercussions in Congress.</P><P>     The EPA takes this logic to the extreme, concocts its farfetched &quot;reasonable maximum exposures&quot; and uses them to guide action. Concurrently, the agency discounts the consequences of its cleanup mandates: disruption of local communities and increasing exposure to a chemical by site disturbance. The incentives are to overstate the risks of toxic waste and to discount the human and financial costs of cleaning up.</P><P>     Improving Superfund's environmental performance and reducing its ethical and economic costs requires fundamental reform. First, the EPA's farfetched risk assessments should be replaced by more sober science. Second, people should only be liable for past actions if real harms were wrongly imposed on other people. Even then, they should pay in rough proportion to their responsibility. And third, we should remove the near prohibition on accused polluters having their day in court to challenge EPA directives.</P><P>     Toxic chemicals are not romantic. They lack the appeal of parks or forests. But their lesson is applicable throughout environmental policy: Well-intended government programs often go awry. Successful environmental reform must heed the ecological insight that many actions have unintended consequences. It applies to political economy as well as biology. I explore this theme in future columns.</P><P>_________</P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>I OFTEN defend the habitat of species I care for deeply: grizzly bears, wild trout and birds of all kinds. But, like most people, I care even more about preserving the quality of my own habitat, my neighborhood and community. Within that habitat, we not only worry about pollution and disease, we are concerned with human predators (i.e. criminals).</P><P>       This concern has recently resurfaced in a vigorous debate about the merits of gun control and its impact on crime. Is it wise to support gun control? This is a difficult question, one worthy of careful attention.</P><P>     National Public Radio, The New York Times and The Atlantic Monthly exemplify progressive thinking on many matters of social policy. Hence it is revealing that they have recently featured articles challenging the conventional view that citizens' access to handguns should be severely constrained. In these articles, Daniel Polsby of Northwestern University's School of Law and James Q. Wilson of UCLA argue that this sort of policy is likely to be ineffective and indeed counterproductive.</P><P>     In Polsby and Wilson's view, handguns are tools that give their owners an advantage when bargaining or interacting with others.</P><P>     For example, I am a healthy, athletic, 6-foot, 190-pound male - a difficult mark for an unarmed person. However, if I left my neighborhood cash machine some evening and a 97-pound weakling with an Uzi demanded my money, he would surely get it. The Uzi gives my assailant the upper hand.</P><P>     If guns are tools they are subject to the laws of economics. Using economic logic, we can ask: Who will give up their guns if an aggressive program of handgun control is enacted?</P><P>       People who expect to use guns frequently, such as criminals, find them very valuable. They are unlikely to easily relinquish their guns. People who value guns very little, perhaps professors who live and work in safe neighborhoods, are  most likely to relinquish them. Thus gun control will have the most impact on those least likely to commit crimes. Should gun control succeed, the habitat of once-safe communities will degrade as still more armed criminals confront an increasingly vulnerable (i.e. unarmed) populace.</P><P>     Consider a lesson from the Montana ranch my wife and I own. For many years, we ran sheep on rangeland between our low-lying fields and the higher-elevation timberlands. Although the area is beautiful, it is also burdened with an abundance of predators. We suffered losses from bears, coyotes and an occasional mountain lion. Late summer, when coyote pups learn to hunt, was the worst time. They wounded many sheep while learning to kill. Tending wounded sheep was wrenching and most unpleasant because the cuts are hidden under the wool, where they often become infected and maggot infested. But we felt an obligation to care for and protect them.</P><P>     In the late 1970s we adopted an ancient strategy to defend our stock: guard dogs. Long before the invention of guns, steel traps and poison, Europeans trained guard dogs to stay with livestock to protect it from wolves, bears and human raiders. Though hardly perfect, this strategy works quite well. Guard dogs very rarely kill predators, even when two 100-pound dogs confront a 25-pound coyote and her pups. And because our dogs, a Komondor and a Sharplenenitz, are big and white and look much like sheep from a distance, the predators cannot easily know when the dogs are nearby and when they are not. The dogs raise the cost of predation by &quot;arming&quot; the sheep. They make our stock too risky a target for most coyotes, cougars and bears.</P><P>     An armed household is like a herd of sheep protected by guard dogs. A serious human predator, a career criminal, is reticent about striking a residence if its occupants are likely to be armed. However, if a criminal knows that a house is unarmed, the dangers are less and the pickings are easier. It is as if the sheep have no guard dogs.</P><P>     In the short run, we can do little about the presence of guns in our town, neighborhood or city. About the only thing we can do is make sure that our houses contain no weapons. I am not at all sure that people would disarm themselves if they realized that by going unarmed, and letting everyone know it, they were making life easier for criminals. Yet this is exactly what conventional gun control seeks to do. The consequences are clear if my ranch analogy holds.</P><P>     Ask yourself, would I like to have this sign and display it on my house? If you would, let me know; I would be happy to sell you one and donate the proceeds to charity. But if not, perhaps you agree with the economic argument that guns in the hands of honest citizens raise the costs of crime and make crime less likely.</P><P> __________ </P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>TOMORROW is the Seattle meeting of the President's Council on Sustainable Development. According to their news release, the council's goal is to: &quot;explore and develop policies that encourage economic growth, job creation, and effective use of our natural resources.&quot; Council leaders want to learn what works in environmentally sound economic-development policies.</P><P>       The council includes prominent environmental officials from the Clinton administration such as Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, EPA Administrator Carol Browner and Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary. They know that Al Gore is emerging as the most influential vice president in our history, a leader with genuine responsibility for establishing and guiding policy in several areas, especially environmental policy. With the Clintons preoccupied by health care, foreign affairs and recurrent allegations of scandal, Gore's importance will grow. We may see a Gore presidency in the year 2000 or before.</P><P>     How might a Gore presidency affect America's natural resource and environmental policies? Will his policies work? For starters, Gore seems to care a great deal about our environment. He correctly identifies many serious problems - species extinction, population pressures, aquifer depletion - in his book, &quot;Earth in the Balance&quot;.</P><P>     Unfortunately, although he gets many facts straight, his proposed reforms are likely to be genuinely harmful; he has learned little from history. Gore sees the problem as evil and ignorant people and insufficient government management. His approach to environmental bliss is naive - place good, intelligent people in positions of authority and empower them to pursue rational, publicly beneficial policies. He assumes that political bureaucracies can consistently promote environmental ends. While this may work at the community level, it normally fails at the national level as both ecological sensitivity and economic efficiency are trumped by politics.</P><P>     Gore's policy inclinations are right in the trivial sense that many environmental problems could easily be dealt with if we could &quot;rewire&quot; people and produce a new environmental man. This creature would enthusiastically support programs that improved the quality of the environment, even if they implied significant personal costs. Environmental man's self interest is subservient to ecology. But this is as unrealistic as the Soviet's efforts to create a &quot;new socialist man,&quot; another altruistic creature. And like the Soviet's efforts, rewiring - or in this case repainting people a new shade of green - will fail, causing much environmental mischief and fostering political opportunism.</P><P>     The key to environmental protection is not reliance upon more extensive political micromanagement. Neither is it dependence upon good people in high places or mass conversion to a more ecologically responsible perspective. True, my fellow conservationists and I would rest easier if we could count upon having people such as Aldo Leopold, a profound social observer and a founder of wildlife science, as Interior Secretary. And yes, I'd be delighted if voters shared my views and joined in mass support of The Nature Conservancy and Ducks Unlimited.</P><P>     But in reality, no society has learned how to identify Platonic despots, i.e., people who will wisely and disinterestedly safeguard the public good. Likewise, mass political movements that inspire sacrifice and achieve sustained, dedicated support normally generate horrid results. Castro, Franco, Hitler, Pol Pot and Stalin are but extreme examples of the corruption inherent to centralized power.</P><P>     The temptations to abuse power are enormous in environmental policy and elsewhere. If we accept Gore's approach, with its heavy reliance on good intentions, good people and strong government, we invite abuses. Good people will not always be in top positions and ordinary people will not always act in environmentally beneficial ways. As America's founders clearly explained, government power is likely to be misdirected. Political management and ecological sustainability are not complementary for several reasons.</P><P>     The most important reason is that a politician must capture campaign contributions to survive. This means he typically must favor his constituents over the national interest. The greater the government's role in the economy, the more costly it is to neglect one's voters in favor of the public interest in the environment.</P><P>     We can learn this lesson from federal agencies such as the Forest Service (1897), Bureau of Reclamation (1902) and Park Service (1906). The creators of these agencies, the first Progressives, expected good people to use scientific principles to publicly manage natural resources. But as the power of these agencies grew, so did the subsidized abuse to Western environments and citizens. Gore seems not to understand that these earlier efforts failed because their incentives were perverse and the information they generated was of poor quality.</P><P>     Gore has taken the important first step of recognizing our environmental ills. But like the progressive reformers of a century ago, he has misdiagnosed the causes and hence the cures. A few in the Clinton administration, including Browner but excluding Babbitt, seem to understand the importance of property rights and incentives to a greener future. I'm afraid that if Gore doesn't learn these lessons and we follow his lead, we will have the worst of all worlds: ineffective environmental protection, inefficient economics and a citizenry disenchanted with environmental causes. The trick is to harmonize economics with ecology. Unfortunately, Gore hasn't learned it.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>IS economics an enemy of ecology? Many environmentalists seem to think so. They portray economists as insensitive number crunchers with Republican leanings, people stricken by a ghoulish preference for money over ecological integrity. The perceived focus of economics - money, business and mathematics - is distasteful to people motivated by environmental concerns.</P><P>       But greens' conventional wisdom is wrong. Economic analysis can be environmentalism's best tool. By considering how economics can further environmental objectives, we may be able to alleviate greens' allergy to economics.</P><P>     Since most resources are scarce, we lose opportunities if we fail to minimize waste. Tumbleweeds in Arizona, spotted knapweed in Montana and bureaucrats in the Department of Agriculture are so overabundant that they are &quot;bads&quot; - not goods. Items we value should be treated as though they are scarce.</P><P>     When environmental policies waste talent, time or material, the price of environmental protection is higher than necessary. The economist's &quot;first law of demand,&quot; a social analog to the law of gravity, states that as the price of a good rises, demand falls. Making environmental quality needlessly expensive subverts environmental goals because the expense lowers people's demand for environmental protection. Americans' growing opposition to needlessly expensive Superfund sites is just one example.</P><P>     To make the most of limited environmental dollars and to achieve real improvements in pollution control, watershed protection and other important goals, we should first address those problems where the payoffs are greatest per dollar invested. This requires risk-benefit analysis, a method of comparing values (lives, endangered species) that can be saved by investing resources on different problems. Not all activities generate equal benefits. Since we can't do everything, risk-benefit analysis helps us choose among our options.</P><P>     Greens have shown a curious reluctance to accept risk analysis. Some groups have included it in the &quot;unholy trinity&quot; of principles they oppose in environmental legislation.</P><P>     But, in terms of achieving green values, environmentalists are misguided when they reject risk analysis. Eliminating some very expensive regulations would save lives or improve health if we thereby free up resources enabling people to achieve less-onerous environmental objectives. Eliminating extremely costly regulations also increases incomes, saving roughly one life for every $7.5 million added to our economy. Richer really is safer and cleaner.</P><P>     Risk analysis is one way to get more for our environmental efforts. Another is minimizing government micromanagement. When government agencies try to specify how people are to reach environmental objectives, waste and ineffective policies are the predictable result.</P><P>     Consider the case of the Amoco Corporation's Yorktown, Va., oil refinery. Amoco and the EPA conducted a two-year joint study into how chemical emissions from the Yorktown plant were addressed by existing regulations. They found that EPA regulations required pollution controls that ignored major sources of pollution and were roughly $30 million more expensive than the more-effective approaches uncovered by the study. Amoco's costs were nearly four times greater than needed to achieve regulatory goals, $41 million versus $11 million. Nevertheless, existing regulations disallow the more-efficient strategies.</P><P>     The Yorktown case illustrates problems endemic to national environmental regulations. Sweeping, undifferentiated regulations are necessarily inflexible, excessively costly, and do little to control pollution. They make few allowances for local situations. Like the Forest Service, BLM and other large centralized bureaucracies, the EPA's regulations are at odds with the ecology of particular places.</P><P>     Thoughtful risk analysis and the end of regulatory micromanagement can yield better and less-expensive environmental protection.</P><P>     Some environmental organizations, such as Defenders of Wildlife and the Environmental Defense Fund, are pursuing principled, innovative and constructive policies. However, the leaders of other organizations, including Greenpeace and the Natural Resources Defense Council, see a niche in crisis entrepreneurship. They use shoddy science and biased media coverage to exaggerate (as with chlorine) or fabricate (as with Alar) environmental dangers. These efforts pressure government officials to adopt wasteful policies.</P><P>     By exaggerating environmental dangers, and posturing as the great green hope with full-page ads in The New York Times, crisis entrepreneurs seduce members and donations. Their budgets, professional status and political influence may increase in the short run. But environmental protection is lost and ethical standards are eroded. Ultimately, the credibility of the environmental movement is reduced.</P><P>     Economics does not offer a cure-all. Environmental quality implies real changes and real costs. But economics helps us better use our scarce efforts to craft effective policies. It exposes those seeking to use the public's interest in environmental protection for private ends. This is why some fear the use of environmental economics.</P><P>_________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           THE president and Hillary Rodham Clinton are selling the outlines of their health-care program to the nation. We have been told to expect many good things from it. Universal access, coverage of pre-existing conditions and expanded basic care would benefit many people. But it is likely that fully implementing a nationalized health-care plan will cost between $50 and $100 billion per year.</P><P>       Expanding access and coverage conflicts with the desire to trim the nation's health-care bill. But the president feels pressure to &quot;do something&quot; about costs of health care. The pharmaceutical industry is an obvious and tempting target.</P><P>     The drug industry is vulnerable to attack for several reasons. It has been consistently profitable, with returns as much as double those of the rest of manufacturing. Most prescription drug cost are paid directly by patients, making price increases immediately apparent. And the patent protection provided to new drugs creates an effective temporary monopoly, at least to the extent that a drug's properties are not duplicated by other drugs on the market.</P><P>     All of this makes drug companies an easy target for government intervention: Some people claim we need price controls to protect the consumer. And what consumer would not like drugs to be cheaper? (Even though prescription drugs account for only a nickel of every health-care dollar, and thus have only a small impact on overall health-care costs.) But more importantly, there are several good arguments as to why price controls would hurt, not help, consumers.</P><P>     Consumers care about more than just low prices. In the drug market especially, they are served by innovative new products with greater healing properties. That is the trade-off: prices versus innovation. We could have a constrained drug market with low prices and protracted negotiations between companies and the federal government over prices that may be charged for new drugs. But most people would prefer an innovative market with many new, and presumably more helpful, drugs.</P><P>     It is the profits on new, successful drugs that prompt the intensive research and development to find the next generation of miracle cures and therapies. New drugs are expensive to develop, costing an average of $231 million each in 1987. Of these, only three in 10 break even.</P><P>     So a successful drug must pay for its own research, as well as the research on the unsuccessful ones on which the company also risked money. In addition to the high emotions of illness, it is this risk and expense that make the drug industry so special. And the high risk explains why the government awards 14-year patents on new drugs. This gives the makers time to recoup their tremendous development expenditures before their research is copied and generic alternatives are offered.</P><P>     Price controls would take away the monopoly advantages of patent protection and undermine the incentives for research that patents were designed to provide. As an academic report on Medicaid and Medicare drug price controls not-so-succinctly put it, the revenue decline to drug companies resulting from price controls &quot;can be expected to negatively influence the expected returns on new drugs and to decrease the cash flow available to undertake R&amp;D.&quot;</P><P>        Price control enthusiasts will argue that it will be possible to hold down prices, but not so low that it undermines research. But this faith in the ability of regulators to control the market is not supported by our experience with regulation and price controls elsewhere. Medicaid and Medicare efforts to control the price of drugs and services caused cost-shifting to unregulated health-care payers. But industrywide price controls will prevent such shifting, leading to shortages and black markets.</P><P>     There were similar results during the Nixon-era price controls of 1971-74, as regulations and regulators multiplied while trying in vain to keep pace with the market's ability to circumvent price controls.</P><P>       As with the rest of the health-care program, we have only been told about the benefits of price controls on drugs. What is hidden are the harder-to-quantify but still real constraints upon innovation and new drug development.</P><P>       If we do not understand the logic driving the system we are likely to take well-intended actions that have perverse consequences. Unless we are sensitive to the importance of incentives to innovation, we can be sure that some important drugs will not be developed or introduced because of drug-price controls.</P><P>__________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           IS RANCHING on the federal range an environmentally destructive anachronism? Many environmentalists seem to think so. Less than 30,000 ranchers graze cattle on 350 million acres of federal lands, an area twice the size of Texas. Environmentalists hope the public lands will be, as the bumper sticker intones, &quot;Cattle Free by '93.&quot;</P><P>         Grazing has also been the target of budget reformers; grazing programs subsidize what environmental writer Edward Abbey called &quot;welfare cowboys.&quot; These programs cost taxpayers about $50 million a year. Some permit holders, however, have found public lands to be quite profitable.</P><P>     A recent report by the Department of the Interior highlights one case in which a California public utility subleased its public grazing privileges to ranchers. It charged subleases 315 percent more per animal unit month than it paid to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for the grazing permits. The bottom line: The public loses money to permit holders' benefit.</P><P>     Ranchers are politically powerful and have successfully headed off attempts at fee reform. Last September, for example, a modest fee increase approved by the House was subsequently negotiated away by the Senate. Today grazing rates remain at about one-quarter of the average of private lands in the same region.</P><P>     The answer seems to be raising grazing fees to the market level. Ethically and economically, it is not that simple.</P><P>     BLM grazing privileges were assigned to ranchers under the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934. Preference was given to nearby landowners. Over time, grazing privileges have become linked to these &quot;base properties,&quot; with leases being routinely renewed. Today the permits are virtually owned by the base property holders, though technically given as &quot;privileges&quot; by the BLM.</P><P>     This &quot;ownership&quot; has been ratified in a number of ways. The value of the grazing permits is taxed by the Internal Revenue Service when a ranch is inherited. Permits are also accepted by FDIC-insured banks as collateral for loans. And they are routinely transferred to new owners by the BLM when a base property is sold. Over time, the value of these &quot;rights&quot; has been incorporated into the value of associated private ranch lands.</P><P>     Consider this analogy: Two cars are auctioned. They are identical in every way except that one carries a sticker entitling it to half-price gasoline for the life of the automobile. Surely the cheaper gasoline does not come free; the discount on gas will produce higher bids for the car. Gas or grass, it works the same. A ranch sold with federal grazing permits is worth more than one without permits. An economist would say that the value of access to cheap grass becomes capitalized into the ranch's value.</P><P>     So those who have received a subsidy are those who got the initial windfall and sold out for a higher price. Many ranchers who own the base properties today have paid for their subsidy, which makes it no subsidy at all. As the director of the BLM wrote, &quot;The point is that we simply do not know who is `unduly' benefiting or if they are benefiting at all.&quot;</P><P>       Simply raising grazing fees is unfair to the ranchers who have paid for cheap government-land grazing through the value capitalized into their ranch's purchase price. So how else can we reform the federal grazing lands?</P><P>       A free market in permits can help end government subsidies in a just way. Grazing permits could be offered to the current ranchers for the value of future grazing fees. The permits could then be freely exchanged.</P><P>     The federal government would stop subsidizing management of the land but would still own it and set environmental standards; for example, by requiring protection of riparian areas as a condition of holding permits.</P><P>     Environmentalists have long pointed out that there are many valuable uses for federal lands, among them recreation and wildlife habitat. The current system's &quot;use it or lose it&quot; requirements effectively prevent shifts from cattle to other uses. A permit holder cannot save winter range for elk and other wildlife because even if the grazing fees are paid, the permits may be revoked and &quot;unused&quot; forage reallocated to another ranch.</P><P>     A transferable permit system would encourage diverse uses. Grazing would continue, but land would surely be dedicated to esthetics and biodiversity by groups like the North American Elk Foundation or the Nature Conservancy.</P><P>     There are several benefits of owned and transferable permits. For example, with more secure access, permit holders would have incentives to invest in and improve the public lands. Property rights encourage diversity and provide incentives for stewardship. This change will benefit our range land and the people who care about its diverse values.</P><P> _______________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>PEOPLE who believe in the power of government to do good probably found it outrageous that the U.S. Senate squandered weeks debating higher grazing fees, a financially trivial issue. The Western Senators' filibuster diverted the Senate from critically important issues like NAFTA and health care. But this posturing is a predictable consequence of political management of the Western range.</P><P>       Current policies encourage overgrazing, discourage range improvements, inhibit innovation and sharply restrict allowable uses on the 315 million acres of public land administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Forest Service. But below-cost grazing fees are not the primary source of ecological problems. The sources are rigid bureaucracies and insecure property rights.</P><P>     When looking at grazing fee &quot;subsidies,&quot; most commentators ignore an important fact: Aside from unanticipated inflation, the value of the &quot;subsidy&quot; has largely been incorporated into the sales price of private ranches with grazing privileges on public range. The BLM and Forest Service permits are attached to a &quot;base unit&quot; property (i.e., a private ranch). The ranch's sales price captures the value of cheap public grazing that comes with it.</P><P>     It is as if a car came with a sticker entitling the owner to 20 cent a gallon gas. The car with the sticker would sell for more than one without because it includes a valuable subsidy. Similarly, subsidies increase the value of a ranch possessing federal grazing permits.</P><P>     Ranchers who received the original fee subsidy in 1934 died with a one-time windfall gain. But many present owners have already paid for the subsidy through higher prices when they bought ranches with public grazing permits. Most present owners can afford higher fees, but ethically, this is irrelevant.  While we should adjust fees for inflation, it seems unfair to impose a penalty on present owners just because the original owners received an unjust, unearned financial gain.</P><P>     Dr. Karl Hess Jr., a range ecologist, expert on Western lands and author of &quot;Visions Upon the Land,&quot; notes that higher fees are unlikely to improve ecological conditions and reduce overgrazing on the public range. If we want improvement, we need to change existing institutional arrangements, not simply fiddle with prices.</P><P>     Ecological and social problems are caused by regulations that encourage poor management practices - grazing too many cows and sheep, underinvesting in range improvements and maintenance and failing to replace domestic stock with more valuable wildlife. As noted above, poor management persists for two reasons: bureaucracy and imperfectly transferable property rights. Better management will follow secure, well-defined, and transferable property rights for those who use the public range, be they a private ranch or the Nature Conservancy Trust.</P><P>    I suggest a modest reform. Give those with privileges to graze on public land the opportunity to buy a grazing right at a price incorporating the future value of the &quot;subsidized&quot; fee. Economists call this price the capitalized value of the fee. Logically, it would be similar to converting an apartment to a condominium. Future rents of the apartment are capitalized into the sale price of the condominium.</P><P>     With this reform, ranchers would have legal property rights to the public forage. They could exchange those rights among themselves or sell them to those with other interests, e.g., ecological diversity, wildlife habitat for hunters, or stream-side preservation. These interests are growing and new ones will surely develop.</P><P>     Incorporating the subsidy into the permit's price avoids penalizing owners who &quot;purchased&quot; a subsidy when they bought their private land and should reduce their opposition to reform. Everyone is better off because current owners retain access to the public range and taxpayers no longer subsidize management. There are also new incentives for innovation.</P><P>     At present, the permit is only for grazing domestic livestock, even if the land has greater value for wildlife or recreation. BLM policy dictates that grazing privileges must be used. If not used, they are sold to others. Thus, when organizations acquire public range privileges and try to retire them from grazing, the privileges are stripped away. Last April, this happened to the Nature Conservancy in Mercer vs. BLM. If grazing rights were freely transferable, diverse uses would flourish, reflecting emerging environmental values.</P><P>     A legal property right to forage on public lands would also discourage overgrazing and encourage range improvements. Ranchers could rest overused lands without fear of regulatory reprisal. Moreover, if ranchers knew they would benefit from range improvements, they are more likely to replant native grasses and forbs that have been destroyed by a century of overgrazing. Cooperating with others, some would also manage for wildlife.</P><P>     Environmentalists and those seeking efficient government can join to promote institutional reforms that recognize new ecological understandings and changing tastes. When we allocate via politics, special interests and financial waste will prevail. Property rights and voluntary arrangements are far more responsive - and often more responsible. </P><P>------------------------------------------------------------------- </P><P>John A.

NAFTA would create the world's largest free-trade zone, encompassing over 360 million people and $6.2 trillion worth of goods and services a year.</P><P>     The potential benefits are substantial. One recent economic analysis by the Institute for International Economics calculated that NAFTA's adoption would result in a net increase of about 175,000 jobs in the U.S. by 1995. The pact would also benefit Mexico</P><P> by further opening the wealthy U.S. market to their goods, creating jobs and prosperity. And Mexico would benefit as a trade agreement creates new opportunities for direct foreign investment and energizes its rapidly modernizing economy.</P><P>     However, all is not rosy for the future of NAFTA. While both President Bush and Governor Clinton claim to support free trade, both are subject to election-year pressures. This has produced protectionist benefits for brewers, state-owned industries, auto producers, and bankers, among others. Environmentalists and traditional protectionists, &quot;Baptists and Bootleggers&quot; as their unholy alliance is called, have formed a powerful voice against NAFTA and gained a hearing with both Congress and trade negotiators.</P><P>     Earlier this month the House of Representatives voted 362 to 0 in favor of a nonbinding resolution that calls for the trade accord to not jeopardize American health, safety, and environmental standards. Worries abound that Mexico will become a &quot;pollution haven,&quot; spawning a multitude of dirty industries and encouraging U.S. companies to migrate to Mexico to avoid tough domestic environmental laws. However, the best available information suggests that NAFTA will foster both environmental safeguards and progress.</P><P>     The Bush administration states that any trade agreement must &quot;maintain the right to prohibit the entry of goods that do not meet U.S. health, safety, pesticide, food and drug and environmental regulations.&quot; The qualifications are (1) such regulations must apply equally to domestic and foreign producers (and therefore not constitute an unfair barrier to trade), and (2) they must have a scientific basis. A trilateral commission composed of trade experts, scientists, and environmentalists is being formed to hear challenges to the environmental rules of trading partners.</P><P>     Much concern about the creation of &quot;pollution havens&quot; centers on Mexico and its lax enforcement of environmental laws. However, the World Bank finds little evidence that companies are willing to move manufacturing plants simply to avoid environmental regulations, as environmental costs form a small percentage of total costs. And it is likely that the increased foreign investment brought by free trade will bring with it advanced pollution control technologies. U.S. multinationals often hold foreign plants and subsidiaries to U.S. environmental standards.</P><P>     Historically, Mexico's environment has been far dirtier than accepted U.S. standards. But that is changing because environmental knowledge, sensitivity, and managerial ability all increase with rising per capita income. These good things go together.</P><P>     For Mexican President Salinas, environmental protection holds a high priority. He has privatized many inefficient and polluting state-owned industries, requiring them to meet tougher environmental standards to which they were not subject as state-owned companies. He has increased his environmental agency's budget from $4.3 million to $88.4 million in five years. Mexico has started to work with the U.S. EPA to clean up the highly polluted maquiladoras assembly plants and the rapidly growing &quot;sister cities&quot; of the border region. The two countries are planning to spend about $1 billion here over the next three years.</P><P>     These steps will go a significant way toward protecting human health and the environment in Mexico. And it is important to note that the best way for the U.S. to ensure that Mexico continues this environmental progress is to support NAFTA.</P><P>     This is because a free-trade agreement brings increased national prosperity - and it is prosperity that fuels demand for higher standards of environmental quality. Rich nations have cleaner environments than do poor nations. Recent research by Professor Donald Coursey of Washington University in St. Louis shows that across time and across countries per capita spending on the environment rises directly with income. Protected land acreage also rises with income, implying that more forest preserves and parks will be created as Mexico grows richer.</P><P>     Delegates at June's Earth Summit in Rio noted that poverty is the chief threat to both the environment and human health. EPA Administrator William Reilly writes about NAFTA that &quot;As the Mexican economy grows, so will its devotion to environmental protection and its ability to pay the costs of environmental stewardship.&quot; The lesson is that environmental quality and economic prosperity are strongly and positively linked. As a free country grows and rises out of subsistence living it becomes more, not less, environmentally friendly.</P><P>     By increasing incomes and promoting economic growth in Mexico through a North American Free-Trade Agreement, the U.S. can increase Mexico's environmental awareness and ability to effectively steward its environmental resources. That is a relationship that should appeal to both environmentalists and free-traders alike.</P><P>______________</P><P> John Baden is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment (FREE) and teaches in the Environmental Management Program in the School of Business at the University of Washington.

Baden</P><P>WHAT is a hero? In literary epics such as &quot;Gilgamesh,&quot; the &quot;Illiad,&quot; or &quot;Beowulf,&quot; heroes are those who defy pain and death to live out a personal code of unqualified honor. In economists' parlance, heroes risk significant personal costs to help others. Heroism continues today, though it is, as always, in short supply.</P><P>       The familiar hero jumps into an icy river to save a drowning child. Such isolated, impulsive acts are dramatic and admirable, but are not the most important kind of heroism. The more important involves standing against the tide of opinion to do what is right. Such people may resist the power of an abusive government or cultural norms that harm the less fortunate or the environment. Two heroes in this tradition are Arthur Temple and Harry Teasley.</P><P>     Arthur Temple Jr. was born in l920, and for 26 years ran the Temple family's extensive timber empire in east Texas. In l973, he merged Temple Industries with the much larger and highly diversified Time Inc., becoming a major shareholder in Time. Arthur Temple was an entrepreneur who transformed Temple Industries into a major forest products company.</P><P>     But Temple's heroism is only tangentially related to his business success. For many years, Temple's formative years, rural people in southeast Texas attached little importance to environmental values. Since wildlife habitat had no immediate dollar value, it was ignored by the east Texas forest industry. Forest-dependent wildlife were open-access, common-pool resources. With no one to protect them, entire species were decimated by poor forestry and poaching.</P><P>     Temple stood against these pressures for years to enforce stewardship on his lands. His conservation efforts affronted the dominant culture. Arson and threats of violence were commonplace. But Temple persisted and today Temple Inland remains a national leader in supporting and applying wildlife research.</P><P>     Temple is also a civil-rights hero. Six years before &quot;Brown v. Board of Education,&quot; he led the integration of schools in his company's town of Diboll, Texas. In the mid-1960s, a group of civil-rights activists was traveling through the South, going into segregated restaurants and staging sit-ins if they were refused service. Temple Industries had built a cafe in Diboll, the Pine Bough, to provide company visitors and residents with a quality restaurant.</P><P>     The manager called Arthur Temple, then company president, saying these activists would soon test the Pine Bough - what should he do? &quot;Serve 'em&quot; replied Temple. Then, realizing this might be difficult for the manager, Temple said he could work the cash register and his wife could wait tables. Temple led by example to overcome the prejudices of his time. With such leadership, the regular staff handled the situation.</P><P>     Our other hero is Harry E. Teasley Jr., CEO of the Coca-Cola Nestle joint enterprise headquartered in Tampa, Fla. Teasley vigorously opposed the construction of a taxpayer-subsidized hotel intended to boost business for Tampa's money-losing, city-owned convention center.</P><P>     Teasley had a principled opposition to this misadventure in civic socialism. He spent $15,000 of his own money on a public opinion survey. The survey, done by a professional polling firm, showed 90 percent of Tampa's voters wanted a referendum on the hotel's bonds. Two-thirds of registered voters opposed publicly subsidized funding. Teasley then purchased an ad in the Tampa Tribune Times explaining the economic and ethical problems with the hotel. Teasley had no financial interest in the hotel or convention business. He was simply a public-spirited citizen with the means, the character, and the intelligence to promote good public policy.</P><P>     Like Arthur Temple, Harry Teasley took the hero's stance. In doing so, he demonstrates the difference between being pro-business and pro-free market. There was strong business support for the hotel - the Greater Tampa Chamber of Commerce and Tampa Downtown Partnership urged the City Council's support. Before Teasley, there was only weak opposition because people of substance wouldn't take a public position.</P><P>     Like Dr. Stockman in Henrik Ibsen's &quot;Enemy of the People,&quot; Teasley stood up and told the truth. Defying the business community, he kept standing and telling the truth. Unlike Dr. Stockman, Teasley won.</P><P>     Teasley offered a pro-free market position with strong theoretical and ethical legitimacy: Government should not subsidize services that are provided by the market. Since wealth and political power go together, such subsidies become socialism for the well-off. Tampa's convention center was an economic loser, and the hotel could not rescue it. As Ludwig von Mises noted: &quot;Government intervention always breeds economic dislocations that necessitate more Government intervention.&quot;</P><P>       Heroes such as Arthur Temple and Harry Teasley are important to all societies; their behavior exemplifies values we want people to emulate. They defy prevailing opinion, be it racial prejudice, faith in socialism, or poaching. Heroes are role models who make it easier for the less-courageous to act justly. At a time when there is widespread cynicism toward those active in public affairs, we should recognize and honor our heroes. We are going to need more of them.</P><P>_________</P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>IN addition to their disappointment with the elections, major environmental groups are learning the pain of limits to growth.</P><P>       From 1990 to 1993, membership fell 33 percent for Greenpeace and 35 percent for the Wilderness Society. The Sierra Club has lost 130,000 members and has accumulated deficits of nearly $3 million. Although groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the folks who brought us the Alar hoax, have held even, overall memberships peaked in 1990 and have been falling ever since. Only the Environmental Defense Fund, a group that values entrepreneurship and stresses incentives, has gained a substantial number of members.</P><P>     What explains these dramatic losses? Why are people electing to invest less time and money in the traditional green groups? As with most interesting economic changes, several forces are at work.</P><P>     First, with Clinton in the White House, Gore at the Naval Observatory, Babbitt in Interior, and ecologist Jack Ward Thomas as titular head of the Forest Service, some environmentalists believe that our environment is in good hands. They think they can relax their vigilance, secure in the belief that the people from the Potomac will manage our natural resources with prudence and sensitivity. With the environment covered by jolly green giants, concerned greens can direct their efforts to other causes.</P><P>     Today's situation is similar to that faced when Jimmy Carter was in office. The &quot;good guys&quot; were in Washington and green groups' memberships and money declined. Some believe God sent Jim Watt, Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Interior, to save the environmental movement. Watt personified evil and exploitation, making it easy to recruit crusaders to battle him.</P><P>     Second, the upper middle class and the wealthy provide most of the financial support for environmental groups. At the same time, Americans in the top 5 percent of the income distribution pay 43 percent of all personal income taxes. This is a terribly big hit. With government taking an ever bigger first bite, charities are bound to suffer. If the top 5 percent were paying 25 percent rather than 43 percent, contributions to all charities, the arts, churches, hospitals and schools, would increase dramatically. When government takes more there is simply less for worthy causes.</P><P>     The third reason is by far the most complex. It involves culture and political evolution as well as economics. However, the short version is easily stated: Professional environmentalists have been found out.</P><P>     For 25 years, the professional environmental groups have postured as selfless defenders of the public interest. The myth is that these underpaid servants of ecological integrity fight the public's battles against big business. Armed mainly with truth, virtue and purity, they fight the good fight though heavily outgunned. Clearly, all well-intentioned people would support such champions. But after a generation of success, the environmental organizations grew fat and rich. Their myth is losing its luster. Increasingly, people believe that under the costume of virtue lies sleaze and flab.</P><P>     Jim Watt actually hurt the environmental groups because he cost them their purity. Before Watt, most of us who joined were active in the outdoors. Although there was overlap, Audubon was for bird watchers, Sierra Club was for climbers, the Wilderness Society was for backpackers, and so forth. We were lifestyle members; our environmentalism was integrated with our living.</P><P>     Watt so offended those sensitive to environmental values that previously uninvolved people stampeded to the environmental movement. The organized groups became trapped by their gains. As David Foreman, a founder of Earth First! told me, Sierra stressed Club more than rocks and Wilderness emphasized Society more than trees. For most of the new members, environmentalism was a cause rather than a lifestyle, and today most causes have short lives. Stable members became ephemeral. Homelessness, world hunger, reproductive rights and other causes offered competing opportunities for well-intentioned people to demonstrate their good intentions by writing letters and sending checks.</P><P>     With every good cause competing, the leaders of green groups emphasized marketing. They became salesmen, their product was their cause. A premium was placed on exaggerating or fabricating environmental crises to galvanize members and attract new recruits. But there's a tension between maintaining integrity and making the sale.</P><P>     Incentives to make environmental problems big, dramatic and scary led to half-truths or outright lies about the actual risks of many alleged environmental crises. Alar, toxic waste, ivory, global warming, and other issues were often distorted by green groups as they tried to maintain their membership and budgets.</P><P>     Time has exposed environmentalists as just another special interest. Every dollar spent on a cause defined in New York and D.C. offices is a dollar less for local problems people can see and feel. The obvious failures of legislation such as Superfund and the problems with the Endangered Species Act caution people to be skeptical of dire warnings from Manhattan and the Beltway.</P><P>     Just as political corruption and deception have fueled a voter backlash, so deception by green groups has real consequences. A new environmentalism that recognizes the importance of property rights, entrepreneurship and incentives must emerge if we are to preserve environmental quality and ethical integrity.</P><P>_________</P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>THIS is my last column until I return from Montana next autumn.</P><P> While there, I'll continue working on the three E's of environmental policy: ecology, economics and ethics. Only systems that link freedom to act with responsibility for the results of the action work well in dealing with them. Others fail. Linking action with accountability for outcomes is a classic problem of political economy. It plagues efforts to harmonize our environmental and economic interests.</P><P>     All my columns deal with these themes. Next fall, when I return to FREE's Seattle office and the University of Washington, I will again apply economic thinking to pressing environmental and ethical issues. I often think of my columns while bicycling.</P><P>     Seattle and a ranch near Bozeman, Mont., are great places to live. For years, I have wanted to make the spring pilgrimage from Seattle to Bozeman by bicycle. This year my wife Ramona and I joined 110 participants for the first week of Cycle America's annual trip across America.</P><P>     Some bicycle tourists go self-contained. We see these hardy individuals on the road each summer. Their bikes resemble over-loaded pack animals with lumps of clothing, cooking gear, sleeping bags, and tents. Imagine a Porche 911 Carrera towing a U-Haul. These riders proudly identify as self-supported cyclists - others might call them masochists.</P><P>     In contrast, Cycle America provides fully supported tent touring. Trucks transport the extra clothing, sleeping bags and tents, and vans pick up the stragglers. Meals are prepared by people in local communities. The support staff is excellent, cheerful and highly competent. These cycle tourists are neo-Spartan hedonists.</P><P>     In the most luxurious kind of bicycle touring, cyclists carry only sun screen, water and a credit card. They sleep at inns and eat fine food. This Stoic Epicurean cycling is my favorite kind of tour. Each year FREE offers such a &quot;Seminar on Wheels&quot; for special friends. These Bozeman-based tours are &quot;rolling salons&quot; with readings for each day and seminar discussions over dinner. Last year we biked from Yellowstone to Glacier National Park. This year we'll tour the Big Hole Country of Southwest Montana.</P><P>     Linkages between economic and environmental systems are especially clear when cycling. For example, our Cycle America Tour left Bellingham and headed over Rainey and Washington Pass and into Grand Coulee. This area was logged early in the century. We saw large stumps from four to eight feet off the ground. Cyclists asked, &quot;Was logging only in the winter and was stump height determined by snow depth?&quot; No, I explained, the relative value of wood and labor, not snow depth, explains the high stumps of years ago.</P><P>     America had a huge timber inventory. Trees were so plentiful that their value was often negative. Fertile cleared ground was often worth more than land with standing timber.</P><P>     Because trees swell at their base, timber cutters created temporary platforms from which they sawed the trees above the butt swell. This left much high quality wood in the forest, but it saved labor. Our ancestors &quot;wasted&quot; wood to economize on labor.</P><P>     Today the relative values are reversed.</P><P>     We biked past several dozen sawmills filled with second-growth and third-growth logs. Today, some mills utilize tops down to 2 inches in diameter. Twenty-five years ago, some mills would take no top less than 7 inches. But as relative values shift, the market naturally adjusts, responding quickly to changing scarcities.</P><P>     Another adjustment is coming. On the third day of the trip, we arrived at Grand Coulee and Lake Roosevelt. I spoke with Gary Kuiper, recently retired superintendent of Lake Roosevelt National Recreational Area. He had served on parks throughout the United States and loves the Park Service.</P><P>     Throughout his career, he saw politics interfering with sound and sensitive management. He saw no way out of the dilemma between long-term protection and constant short-term political pressures. This political problem is increasingly obvious. It's the natural result of the &quot;scientific management&quot; model of the Progressive Era, a century ago.</P><P>     This approach assumes federal control by experts uncontaminated by self interest or political pressures. However, bureaucratic and political entrepreneurship normally trump scientific understanding, concern for local communities, and property rights. Ecological damage, economic waste, and ethical violations result.</P><P>     As problems grow, concerned citizens seek new answers. People who are intellectually and ethically responsible don't expect different results from the same institutions. They want institutional change. To be successful, new approaches must replace political management. I suggest that we adopt a variety of alternative institutional arrangements. These should be modest and careful experiments that rely on various mixes of nonprofit and for-profit organizations, not federal bureaucracies. The feds will monitor, not manage.</P><P>     We've had a hundred years experience with sylvan socialism and we know a lot about what doesn't work. This summer I'll explore new approaches to these problems with academic and business leaders, federal judges, journalists and environmental writers, and some Montana fun-hog cyclists. I look forward to sharing the results with you during the next academic year.</P><IMG SRC="/free/Images/biker.gif" WIDTH=341 WIDTH=249><IMG SRC="/free/Images/van.gif" WIDTH=212 HEIGHT=176><P>__________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P> I'M BACK HOME in Montana for the Christmas break. It's zero degrees at daybreak, no wind, clear day. It's great to be on the ranch, but there is something I miss. This morning brought it back.</P><P>       In this holiday season when we show understanding toward others, it helps to know people who spend their lives living in the rural spaces of the country. Most of us who spend our time in cities cannot know about the rural way of life or understand those who identify with the Wise Use movement. Coming back to Montana always helps me understand why people want to protect the life they have here.</P><P>       This morning was like a morning 23 years ago: Daylight breaking, just below zero, no wind, off to work, a great day in the making. I'd like to share the best part.</P><P>       Up Taylor Fork of the West Gallatin River, about 15 miles from Yellowstone Park, I heard a beautiful and moving sound. This morning it came back in my mind. It's still beautiful, and it still moves me.</P><P>       It's quiet at dawn, at zero degrees, at 7,000 feet - no background noise. Any sound captures attention. And I hear this deep, rhythmic, resonant, powerful call. It told me, &quot;Let's go. It's cold out, but we aren't very cold yet and soon we'll both be warm.&quot; If the sun stays out and the wind stays down I'll shed my jacket by noon and work in long johns and a shirt until lunch. I'll enjoy the food and the rest. I'll need the recharge.</P><P>       I wish I could write sounds, for my story is better if you hear this. This sound is compelling, and its message is passing. This and other sounds of the West remind people of better times.</P><P>       The sound starts deep, regular and rhythmic. It's loud but muffled. We can't see its source, yet we know what it is - but today it's a bit different. What's happened?</P><P>        A faller's saw wouldn't start, and he's standing on the tracks of a D 7 Cat with his chain saw over the exhaust. They're warming up together. His saw will start; the Cat's wake-up purr will shift to a good working growl, changing with load and slope.</P><P>       We were good at doing solid work, making logs from trees and getting them to a mill where they were converted to products people wanted. Although few on the crew thought of it this way, we were part of the international economy. Our work in the woods was economic coordination spontaneously at work. Here are the details we experienced and enjoyed.</P><P>       Cutters put standing trees on the ground without hanging the falling trees on others. They stuck the nail of the tape on the butt of what would become the first log. They walked the tree, limbing it on the way, then bucked it to log length, two or three logs per tree. Skidders jumped off their Cats, set chokers on two to six logs, swung back into the Cat and hit the winch.</P><P>       The mainline of the rigging tightened, and the chokers came taut. Maneuvering the Cat to avoid hang-ups on stumps, the skidder headed for the landing. He'd unhook the chokers and deck the logs, then spin the Cat and go for another turn. Football linebackers and collegiate wrestlers are well-suited to this work.</P><P>       It was great! I miss it still. And I didn't need a workout before going to work.</P><P>       We worked together and with nature. The faller and Cat skinner warming engines together, falling and bucking were with an eye toward choker setting and skidding; otherwise the snow would soon hide the logs. The work, the action, the coordination, the clear and unambiguous value of what we produced, I liked it a lot. Occasionally, when looking for something else in the ranch's shop, I find artifacts of those years.</P><P>       The story of that morning 23 years ago illustrates parts of the Wise Use philosophy so many critics ignore: strength, skill, trust, teamwork producing real products with obvious value. Neglecting these values in the interest of promoting a &quot;new West,&quot; all green and sensitive but absent grease and guts, isn't fully honest.</P><P>       As lattes replace logging boots, arrogance often overrides empathy. There are good people out there who identify with Wise Use. They have different and competing visions for the West's future. I thought of them this holiday season.</P><P>       I respect the best of these people just as I respect the best of my academic colleagues. I can't forget them even though I work more with symbols than with metal and drink wine rather than whiskey. The world they envision is no more. Like the open range, it can't be preserved in its old form. I'd like to help smooth the transition to a sustainable economy that respects liberty and recognizes the culture of our recent past.</P><P>       This is the holiday season that stresses good will to all. I hope we will have enough good will to realize that there are values of the old that would benefit the new Northwest. Perhaps we can build new communities with shared values of liberty and environmental quality. This is my goal for the new year. You are welcome to join me. </P><P>__________</P><P>John A.

Baden</P><P>HOW HAS Forbes magazine, the self-described capitalist tool, become a green advocate? The influential people at Forbes see markets as the most ethical and efficient means to coordinate much of society.</P><P>       In contrast, political management implies economic inefficiencies and ecological destruction. These are logical consequences of political incentives.</P><P>     A recent Forbes feature by Ellie Winninghoff explains how government subsidies promote environmental harm. Here is a sordid story of socialism for the wealthy and duplicity by politicians whose opportunism trumps their environmentalism.</P><P>     Three-fourths of the Pacific Northwest's electricity comes from hydroelectric dams. Many of these, including Bonneville and Grand Coulee, were financed by the taxpayers through the Bureau of Reclamation and Army Corps of Engineers.</P><P>     Once built, the feds subsidized electricity, making power here far cheaper than in other regions of the country. Nearly $1 billion in annual subsidies keep Washington's power prices at about 3 cents per kilowatt hour. Industrial consumers such as Alcoa, Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical, and Reynolds Metals pay even less.</P><P>     But insulating households and businesses from the real costs of power production has negative consequences. In addition to lost revenue, these costs include diminished salmon runs, lost wild rivers, wasteful irrigation and  additional coal-fired power elsewhere. These dams, along the Columbia and Snake, strangle formerly rich salmon runs. Salmon populations are only 15-25 percent of their 19th century levels. Some runs are gone.</P><P>     Here's how dams effect salmon. When hatchlings move from the upriver spawning beds to the Pacific, the slack, warm waters of reservoirs and the blades of hydroelectric turbines take a high toll. Mortality runs about 15 percent per dam. When mature salmon swim from the Pacific to the inland Northwest, the big dams again pose a formidable obstacle. Even with fish ladders, upstream travel has a mortality of 5-13 percent per dam.</P><P>     With 14 major dams on the main stem of the Columbia, and 10 on the Snake River, mortality quickly mounts. The Grand Coulee and Hells Canyon dams completely block salmon from the upper stretches of these rivers. Transporting hatchlings around dams and using hatchery fish has sorry results; hatchery fish are weaker and more disease prone than wild salmon. Thus, in spite of expensive efforts, the runs are dying. Ecological health declines, outdoor recreation suffers, and a perpetually renewable resource is lost.</P><P>     In the Northwest the price of electricity is less than its cost. With rates kept at 3 cents per kilowatt, Northwest consumers use 60 percent more electricity than average Americans. This compares to New York's 10.2 cents, Califomia's 9.7 cents, and Florida's 7 cents. In an age when power can be wheeled around the country, this implies huge unnecessary economic and environmental waste.</P><P>     Insulated from the information and incentives communicated by prices, people don't respond to changing values and ecological conditions. Continued high consumption, not conservation, of electricity is encouraged by subsidized power. And greater use of electricity favors running turbines to maximize production with continuing damage to remaining salmon runs.</P><P>     This story of dams and salmon illustrates a principle of political economy. Once subsidies are created, they persist. People view them as entitlements. Major electricity users, especially aluminum companies, invest in politics to keep power subsidies. Our representatives and senators seldom act in a principled way if that raises voters' electric bills to fair market rates.</P><P>     Dams generate not only power but also opportunistic politicians. For example, in 1982, then-representative Al Gore of Tennessee invited William Niskanen, an economist nationally respected for both his intelligence and integrity, to his office. Gore asked for a casual, informal meeting to discuss Niskanen's planned research into the pricing policy of federal power agencies. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was important to Gore, and so he organized a manipulative ploy to protect his constituents' pork - cheap TVA power.  Niskanen arrived to find not the promised casual conversation, but rather TV cameras and other congressmen. Gore staged the meeting as a Star Chamber interrogation for the consumption of home districts.</P><P>     Gore's showmanship paid off. Oregon's Mike Hatfield, a Republican, passed the &quot;Niskanen Amendment.&quot; This act prohibited government officials from studying how market pricing could improve federal power pricing. The subsidies remained unexamined and unchallenged by those best positioned to do so.</P><P>     This tale of political privileges and opportunism does not imply that markets are perfect. Market prices will poorly reflect the value of salmon or of free flowing rivers. But market-driven power production and allocation won't subsidize environmental harm as federal hydropower has done for five decades.  With vested interests behind each dam, the feds radically increased stakes in subsidies. Adjustments are difficult, salmon suffer, and ethics erode.</P><P>     The problems which flow from federal power subsidies exemplify the complementary interests of groups such as the Environmental Defense Fund and National Taxpayers Union. Greens, fiscal conservatives, and supporters of reduced government all favor the elimination of power subsidies.</P><P>     The question is, will the new political leaders realize the potential to harmonize economics, ecology, ethics, and growing demands for limited government?</P><P>       While we hope they will act in a principled manner, we should not confuse our hopes with our expectations. Yet, as Al Gore said on page 236 of his book, Earth in the Balance, &quot;a pattern of dysfunctionality need not persist indefinitely, and the key to change is the harsh light of truth.&quot; And when dams break, the truth may flood out.</P><P>_________</P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>GOLD mining on federal lands, raising sugar cane near the Everglades, and irrigating Western deserts all illustrate the critical differences between being pro-free market and pro-business.</P><P>       It is easy to see why many people confuse the two. Wise Use groups and others, out of duplicity or ignorance, posture as defenders of the free market. But in fact, they often argue for special privileges and protections that cost the environment, consumers and taxpayers dearly. It is important to understand the difference between advocating the free market as a process and advocating special treatment for businesses.</P><P>     The market is a system of information and incentives. It coordinates human action and allocates resources to their highest valued uses with greater efficiency than other systems. It works extremely well, though never perfectly, with commodities such as minerals, agricultural goods and manufactures.</P><P>     However, some valuable things, such as clean air, species diversity, migratory waterfowl, and scenic landscapes are difficult to protect and allocate through the market. Economists call these public goods and common-pool resources. It is difficult or impossible to price or to establish clear property rights over them - and without clear and transferable property rights, the market cannot function well. If markets are to minimize waste and efficiently protect the environment, people must bear the costs of their actions.</P><P>     Businesses are players within the market framework. Each shares the framework with other groups as well as unorganized individuals. Businesses in the market are like organisms in an ecological system.</P><P>     Businesses have incentives to avoid the full costs of their actions. They often favor policies that advantage themselves and impose costs on others. If responsible for their full costs, the things they produce may be more expensive. For example, gold mining, which can involve dynamiting entire mountains and bathing the rubble in poisonous cyanide solutions to leach out the gold, may not be profitable if ecological, aesthetic and health costs are counted. Companies may even have to give up their mines. Society (i.e. all of us) would reap a net gain, but stockholders and employees would suffer losses.</P><P>     A pro-market position puts the public's well-being ahead of special privileges for any business. In contrast, the phrase &quot;pro business&quot; means allowing certain people to evade responsibility for the costs of their actions and to insulate themselves from competition. Many businesses try to avoid or ignore environmental costs because by doing so, they gain in the short run. To avoid costs, businesses lobby legislatures to limit competition, obtain subsidies, or ignore certain costs.</P><P>     Consider Florida sugar growers. U.S. sugar quotas protect them from less-expensive imports. Moreover, sugar growers can ignore the enormous ecological damage they inflict on the Everglades. Their political power (even then-Sen. Al Gore voted to protect them) allows them to retain these subsidies at the financial and environmental expense of the country.</P><P>     But such pro-business strategies always advantage one industry by disadvantaging others. For instance, candy manufacturers who use sugar have higher costs than Canadian competitors because U.S. sugar prices are kept artificially high by quotas. They have been forced to use corn syrup as a higher cost and imperfect substitute for sugar. And now the corn syrup producers lobby to keep the quotas on foreign sugar. In economies as in ecology, everything is tied to everything else.</P><P>     Or consider the Mining Act of 1872. It grants companies the right to mine federal lands virtually for free. It probably made sense 100 years ago, but today it is an indirect subsidy to environmentally destructive mining. Mining companies favor the law because they don't want to pay market prices for the lands they mine and be responsible for the environmental damage they cause. Again, being pro-market by requiring mining companies to bear these environmental costs would hurt the companies while benefiting the public.</P><P>     Federal subsidies for irrigation are a notorious pro-business strategy. With water delivered at 10 percent of its cost, it is profitable to grow water-intensive crops such as rice in semi-deserts like the Central Valley of California. But the &quot;cheap&quot; water does not reflect the opportunity costs of taxpayers' money, the wildlife habitat and fish runs damaged by dams and water diversions, and the pollution created by chemical runoff from irrigated fields. Subsidized water costs society a great deal. Here again, being pro-market puts us at odds with the private interests of agribusiness.</P><P>     People who take pro-market stands take equally strong stands against special privileges for businesses. Both justice and efficiency demand that businesses bear full responsibility for the costs their actions impose on society, including the environmental costs. Market principles favor the environment because many environmental problems arise when people are isolated from the costs of their actions. This insulation comes from favors for the politically powerful. This is why being pro-market supports the public's interests first and foremost. As environmentalists learn this distinction, I hope to see a union of pro-market and environmental forces.</P><P> __________ </P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>ECONOMIES are like ecosystems in that everything is tied to everything else. We cannot do only one thing. Protecting owls by limiting timber harvest has multiple consequences, mostly unintended. People anticipate outcomes, estimate how regulations affect their security and livelihood, and often change their behavior accordingly.</P><P>       Regulations that ignore this interconnectedness can make matters worse, despite good intentions. For example, giving people orders seems cheaper than creating positive incentives for them to cooperate, especially if the order limits what people can do rather than taking physical possession of their property. But we should be extremely careful because over the long run, &quot;takings&quot; are expensive. At a minimum, they erode faith in government's most important role: the fair protector of social life.</P><P>     Most people agree that forests are environmentally and economically important. This is why there are strong pressures to impose regulations preserving watersheds, ecosystems, biodiversity and other forest values. But these restrictions do not come free. They may be worth the price they exact but we should recognize that they impose substantial costs upon owners, society and even ecosystems. As John Muir taught us more than a century ago, everything is tied to everything else.</P><P>     In the Douglas fir region of the Northwest a landowner typically invests $300 to $500 per acre preparing the soil, planting it and tending the seedlings until they are established. This investment generates nothing until the first commercial thinning perhaps 25 to 35 years later. In Western Washington a landowner would normally have the final cut 50 to 75 years after planting. Some owners prefer older stands and keep timber standing long after it is economically mature.</P><P>     Restrictive regulations, or the mere prospect of such regulations, reduce or eliminate the owner's future security. Without the certainty that they can harvest their trees a generation or two later, or sell to someone who can, landowners have weaker incentives to be good stewards. Trees are likely to be cut prematurely and the land converted to non-forestry use. This is happening throughout the Northwest today.</P><P>     Throughout the 1980s, small woodlands owners in Washington obtained about 8,000 permits to cut their timber. That rose 50 percent by 1990 and preliminary estimates by the Washington Farm Forestry Association suggest an additional 50 percent increase by 1993. Money and fear, a powerful combination, are two important reasons for this increase.</P><P>     First, let's consider money. Today, owners see extraordinarily high prices for timber from private lands. Concern for the spotted owl dramatically reduced the timber available from federal lands, shifting demand to private and state forests. Until recently, prices in the export market have been high. Finally, low interest rates have substantially increased new home construction and hence demand for forest products. Each factor contributes to higher log prices and stronger incentives to harvest timber.</P><P>     Fear is also important, particularly the fear that if timber is not sold now, it will be impossible to sell later. This fear seems justified to many people who were counting on their timber as an investment, perhaps for retirement. There are many horror stories in the media and far more floating around rural cafes of people whose &quot;nest egg&quot; has been cracked by restrictive regulations. This gives landowners very strong incentives to cut while they still can.</P><P>     Likewise, if timber mills fear that logs won't be available later, their buildings and equipment will decline in value and may become essentially worthless. They have incentives to run as long as they cover their out-of-pocket costs and just a smidgen more and wear out their capital. This fear causes them to buy logs at higher prices than could be sustained over the long run.</P><P>     Forestry is quite different when people are secure in their holdings. Most important, people secure in their rights can prudently look ahead 35 to 60 years. When their rights to harvest in the future are secure, there are many things that landowners will often do to increase yields. For example, people can plant expensive but genetically improved seedlings, and thin, prune and fertilize. These practices can increase productivity per acre over 50 percent. This means fewer acres will be cut.</P><P>     At the minimum, concern over regulatory &quot;takings&quot; causes rational people to dramatically reduce their investment in yield-enhancing efficiency. In addition, when productive forestry practices are reduced on private lands in the United States, more trees will be cut elsewhere. According to U.C. Berkeley forestry professor W.J. Libby, we will lose 49 species for every 25,000 acres of rain forest cut. To the degree that demand is shifted to tropical rain forests, some species will go extinct. Also, as wood supplies are constrained, substitutes with greater environmental impacts will displace wood products, e.g., steel studs in house construction.</P><P>     Actions have consequences, in ecosystems and markets. Regulatory &quot;takings&quot; of private property will encourage behavior that defeats our environmental goals and strengthens opposition to environmental reforms. We should consider the reality of unintended consequences when designing environmental reforms. </P><P>__________ </P><P> John A.
