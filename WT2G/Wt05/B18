<P>2.1 In this Supplementary Proof I comment on the Proofs of Evidence which
oppose the planning application for the RCF on the grounds that aspects of
safety assessment research and modelling have not been adequately addressed by
Nirex.  I include comments on the Proofs and the Evidence led by:

<P><B> Principal Points of Agreement
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 There are four main areas in which there appears to be substantial
agreement or, at least, no dispute between all the principal parties, namely:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD>the performance of barriers in the repository system must be evaluated
carefully to ensure that radionuclides would be sufficiently contained by the
system to assure safety of the people living at the time of repository closure
and in the future;</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>ii.</TD>
<TD>the groundwater pathway for release of radionuclides from the repository is
the most significant pathway against which barrier performance should be
assessed;</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>iii.</TD>
<TD>calibration and validation of models is of importance in assessing
repository performance; and<BR>
</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>iv.</TD>
<TD>Nirex is not yet in a position to make a safety case for the disposal of
radioactive wastes, nor yet to give the regulatory authorities a sufficiently
firm view of the suitability of locating a repository at the Sellafield site to
warrant an application for its development.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><B> Principal Points of Disagreement
</B>
</P>
<P>2.3 The assertions made in the Objectors' Proofs of Evidence which form the
principal points of disagreement that I address in this Supplementary Proof of
Evidence, fall essentially into three categories: 
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD>Nirex's evaluation of the post-closure performance of a repository at
Sellafield does not properly reflect current knowledge of the site and processes
influencing radionuclide return: the 'true' performance is likely to give a less
favourable comparison against the regulatory target;</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>ii.</TD>
<TD>a detailed understanding of all processes potentially influencing
radionuclide return is required: such understanding has not been achieved and
will require substantial further  work; and</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>iii.</TD>
<TD>in both the above regards, the RCF will not take us significantly forward.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>2.4 The various points raised by the Objectors within each of these
categories are addressed by Sections 4 to 10 of this Supplementary Proof of
Evidence as outlined in paragraphs 2.7 to 2.13 below.  In summary my response to
each of the three categories is as follows:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD>In its evaluation of Sellafield, Nirex takes a balanced approach to
reflecting current knowledge of the repository system.  I believe that we have
properly reflected current knowledge in our performance assessment work and that
the processes and features identified by the Objectors are adequately addressed
for the current stage of development in our programme. Given the agreed
significance of the groundwater pathway, I believe our performance assessment
gives a good indication of the system performance and that the site shows good
promise. However, further work is needed to help resolve uncertainties and the
RCF has an essential role to play in this. Resolving these issues to a
satisfactory level will demonstrate the confidence required to reach a decision
on whether to submit a planning application for repository development.</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>ii.</TD>
<TD>Nirex does not accept that a complete understanding of all processes is
essential to assessing system performance.  Dealing with uncertainty is
recognised by Nirex and HMIP as an integral part of carrying out post-closure
performance assessments.  When knowledge is incomplete it is accepted that this
uncertainty is dealt with either explicitly, within a range of models, or
through the use of appropriate parameter distributions in a probabilistic
assessment.</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>iii.</TD>
<TD>The RCF will provide an opportunity to gain further information and reduce
uncertainties in the key areas identified in my Proof of Evidence (<A
HREF="nrx15.htm"><B>PE/NRX/15</B></A>).  The factors directly affecting
repository performance include groundwater flow and radionuclide transport and
the engineered sealing system needed at repository closure. In certain key
areas, the RCF is the only route to obtaining this information and to
demonstrating clearly to decision makers and peer reviewers that Nirex is able
to validate its assessment modelling approach.

various aspects of the role of geochemistry in performance assessment. Dr
Wogelius' Evidence is shown to be either of marginal relevance to performance
assessment or to require the kind of work that Nirex has in progress or planned
for the RCF. Dr Haszeldine is shown to have misinterpreted the controls on the
deep hydrochemical environment of the repository.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>In late September 1995, in the light of updated indications of

to 2060 is a range of 200,000m<SUP>3</SUP> to 275,000m<SUP>3</SUP>, including
15,000m<SUP>3</SUP> of LLW</I>.&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 In this Section of my Supplementary Proof I comment on the radioactivity
content of the reduced volume in respect of the three radionuclides chlorine&#173;36,
iodine&#173;129 and uranium&#173;238 which are found to be of greatest
importance to the safety of disposal (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para5.6">paragraph 5.6</A>).
</P>
<P>3.3 Radioactivity contents of chlorine&#173;36, iodine&#173;129 and
uranium-238 for the 275,000m<SUP>3 </SUP>volume are estimated to be the same as
those given previously at <A HREF="nrx15.htm#Table5.1">Table 5.1</A> (page 63)
of my Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>) for a repository capacity of
400,000m<SUP>3</SUP>.  This is because the reduction to the new figure of
275,000m<SUP>3 </SUP>involves:
</P>
<P>  the elimination of 85,000m<SUP>3 </SUP>of low-level wastes (LLW), having
a relatively low content of chlorine&#173;36, iodine-129 and  uranium-238; and
the reduction of the volume of various intermediate-level wastes (ILW) through
more efficient packaging and the radioactive decay of some ILW to LLW that will
not require deep disposal.
</P>
<P> Estimated radioactivity contents for the low end of the range, 200,000m<SUP>3</SUP>,
are given in the following paragraphs 3.4 to 3.6.  The reductions in
radioactivity contents come about because of the potential elimination of
notional future waste arisings that are included in the figures given for the
275,000m<SUP>3</SUP> volume.

<P>3.4 The figure for the radioactivity of chlorine&#173;36 in the disposal
inventory given  in <A HREF="nrx15.htm#Table5.1">Table 5.1</A> (page 63) of my
Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>) is 16.6 TBq.  This value was the central
case determined in an exercise to take account of uncertainties in the
quantities present, as reported in <I>Nirex  95</I> (Volume 3, Table 6.3, page
6.25) [COR/522].  The corresponding value for 200,000m<SUP>3 </SUP>of waste is

200,000m<SUP>3</SUP> of waste is 0.51 TBq.

<P>3.7 Peak risks calculated in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3) [COR/522] in
relation to release of chlorine&#173;36 and iodine&#173;129 would be expected to
be reduced somewhat as a consequence of any reduction in the quantities of these
radionuclides in the disposal inventory.
</P>
<P>3.8 Peak risks calculated in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3) [COR/522]<I></I>
in relation to release of daughter radionuclides of uranium&#173;238 would be
expected not to change significantly.  This is because the concentration of
uranium dissolved in the porewater in the repository is still expected to be at
the solubility limit.

<P><B>4. <A NAME="TREATMENT">TREATMENT OF UNCERTAINTY</A>
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 Dr Starmer's Proof of Evidence (PE/CCC/5) deals primarily with Nirex's
preliminary assessment of the groundwater pathway for a deep repository at
Sellafield in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522].  He questions a number of aspects of
the Nirex assessment including the modelling of the biosphere and groundwater
flow.  I respond to those matters in Sections 8 and 9 respectively of my
Supplementary Proof of Evidence.  In this Section, I focus on his discussion of
the issue of uncertainty in  <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522].
</P>
<P>4.2 In summary, Dr Starmer (PE/CCC/5) attempts a quantification of the &quot;<I>errors
and uncertainties</I>&quot; associated with the preliminary assessment of the
groundwater pathway presented in <I>Nirex 95</I> COR/522.  Within his analysis,
he draws on cases set out in<I> Nirex 95</I> COR/522 to develop &quot;<I>range
bars</I>&quot;.  These purport to show the uncertainty associated with the Nirex
risk assessment.  They are presented (PE/CCC/5, Figure 3) as resulting in an
order of magnitude uncertainty about the highest risk curve presented in <I>Nirex
95</I> COR/522 for the groundwater pathway.  By comparing these risk curves
incorporating range bars with the regulatory target, he concludes (PE/CCC/5,
paragraph 4.1.1):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>The nature and extent of the uncertainties associated with the
Nirex assessment call into question the likelihood that those estimates will
remain below the risk target as a more complete assessment of those
uncertainties is undertaken.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.3 In this section, I explain why the basis of his quantification and steps
in his argument are flawed.  First, I outline the nature of the risk target and
the manner in which Nirex performs its risk calculations.  Then I address Dr
Starmer's treatment of uncertainty. 
</P>
<P> <B>Risk Target and Risk Calculations

</P>
<P>4.4 The <I>HMIP 1995 Consultation Draft, GRA2, Disposal  Facilities on Land
for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes: Guidance on Requirements for
Authorisation, September 1995</I> (HMP/1/1, paragraph 6.7) states as a
radiological requirement of the disposal facility:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> </I>&quot;<I>After control of the facility is withdrawn, the assessed
radiological risk to a representative member of the critical group should  be
consistent with a risk target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP> per year (i.e. 1 in a million
per year)</I>.&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.5  The document also defines radiological risk (paragraph 6.10): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>Radiological risk to a member of a critical group is the product
of the probability that a given dose will be received and the probability that
the dose will result in a serious health effect, summed over all situations that
could give rise to exposure to the group.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This describes the method for the calculation of the expectation value of
risk (which is, therefore, the value which is to be compared with the regulatory
target) using probabilistic safety assessment methods such as those employed by
Nirex, as I described in my Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para4.10">paragraphs 4.10</A> and 4.11). 
</P>
<P>4.6 In confirming the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> risk target the Government recognised
the advice of the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group which advised on the general criteria
against which disposal facilities should be assessed in order to provide for an
appropriate level of public safety.  The Government noted in <I>the July 1995
White Paper
</I>(page 21, paragraph 76) [GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>The Group recognised that the confidence limits placed on an
estimate of risk arising from a repository would be wider than for other nuclear
plant, particularly at long times in the future, but felt that this should be
taken into account in the way the potential risks were estimated and assessed
rather than by applying different criteria of acceptability</I>.&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.7 Therefore, in carrying out performance assessments Nirex is required to
incorporate uncertainty into the assessment of risk and not to consider it
separately.  Nirex has stated in <I>Nirex Science Report S/94/001, Post-closure
Performance Assessment - Probabilistic Safety Assessment: Overview</I> (page 5)
[COR/507]:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>The approach developed for Nirex by the DSAT [Disposal Safety
Assessment Team] involves:
</I>
</P>
<UL>
<LI><I>preparing an assessment in which acknowledgement and treatment of
uncertainty is central</I>.&quot;
</LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.8 The major technique for addressing uncertainty used by Nirex is
probabilistic safety assessment.  In this technique models of the disposal
system are set up in which parameter values are specified as ranges rather than
exact values.  The equations are solved using values selected from these ranges
by a Monte-Carlo sampling technique.  The outcome of such calculations is a
distribution of possible consequences such as dose or risk.  The technique is
outlined in my Proof of Evidence, <A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para4.10">paragraphs 4.10</A>
to 4.16 (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>). 
</P>
<P>4.9 A key aspect of these calculations is that some values of dose or risk
are more probable than others.  From the many repeated realisations constituting
an assessment, some values occur more frequently and thus have a higher
probability.  From the distribution of all the values the mean value of risk is
calculated as a function of time, also know as the expectation value.  This is
calculated and compared with the regulatory target.  As noted in paragraph 4.5
above, it is this comparison and no other which is the recognised way of
addressing the regulatory target.
</P>
<P>4.10 This technique was applied in the preliminary assessment of the
groundwater pathway described in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522].  This assessment
focused on the groundwater pathway because it has been identified to be the most
important pathway at the current stage of the investigation of the Sellafield
site.  This pathway is a key contributor to risk and to understanding of site
performance. 
</P>
<P>4.11 In the <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522] probabilistic safety assessment,
calculations were undertaken for a base-case conceptual model of the
hydrogeology of the Sellafield site.  This base case was developed by an expert
group taking account of the data obtained from the Nirex Site Characterisation
Programme at Sellafield.  It was judged to be the most probable model of the
hydrogeology of the Sellafield site based on the  information available when the
study was carried out.
</P>
<P>4.12 In his Proof of Evidence (PE/CCC/5, Section 6) Dr Starmer has used the
information set out in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522] to develop a treatment of &quot;<I>errors
and uncertainties</I>&quot; in a way which I consider is incorrect and which
fails to follow the guidance laid down by Government, particularly as identified
at paragraphs 4.5 and 4.6 above.  Dr Starmer appears not to understand the basis
of risk calculation and regulation.  I illustrate this with two examples in the
following paragraphs. 
</P>
<P> Example 1.  Sub-Surface Routing in the Biosphere
</P>
<P>4.13 As part of the analysis reported in Nirex 95 [COR/522] one test of
sensitivity looked at model uncertainty associated with a process in the
biosphere termed sub-surface routing.  This was identified as a pessimistic
bounding calculation to address the uncertainty in the quantification of the
sub-surface routing parameter used to describe the distribution of radionuclides
between soil and water on emerging into the biosphere.  This resulted in risks
about ten times higher than calculated for the base case. 
</P>
<P>4.14 As explained in Sub-section 5.2.5 of <I>Nirex 95</I>, Volume 3
[COR/522], there is good evidence that sub-surface routing will occur and this
is now supported by <I>Environmental Science and Technology, Volume 29, No 7</I>,
(pages 1719 - 1720) [NRX/15/4].  The pessimistic bounding calculation was
undertaken because of  then current uncertainties about the value that should be
assigned to the fraction of the total radionuclide flux entering the surface
soils in the biosphere that is translocated to the soils.  The value chosen for
this parameter for the <I>Nirex 95</I> base case assessment was believed to be
conservative.  The pessimistic bounding calculation assumed that the value was
one.
</P>
<P>4.15 Dr Starmer employs the calculated risks from this pessimistic case for
comparison with the risk target in his Proof of Evidence (PE/CCC/5, Figure 3). 
He gives them equal weight in comparison to the risk target as he give to the
calculated risks from the
<I>Nirex 95</I> base case.  For this to be valid he must assume that there is
the same probability that the sub-surface routing factor is one as that it is
the value used for the <I>Nirex 95
</I>base case.  This is incorrect.  The probability that the value is one was
known to be effectively zero and this has now been confirmed by [NRX/15/4],
whereas the probability of the value being the same as that employed in the base
case or even less was believed to be high and that has now been confirmed.  In
simple terms there is zero probability of a risk being incurred under the
conditions of the case promoted by Dr Starmer and his comparison with the risk
target is meaningless.
</P>
<P> Example 2.  Numerical Analyses
</P>
<P>4.16 In his Proof of Evidence (PE/CCC/5, paragraph 6.5) Dr Starmer uses the 
histograms showing the distribution of conditional risk for the base-case
probabilistic calculation reported in <I>Nirex 95</I> (Volume 3, Figures 6.9
and 6.10) [COR/522] as a presentation of the &quot;variability of risk&quot;. 
He uses this to generate an order of magnitude which is translated into &quot;range
bars&quot;.  This seems to  reflect a failure to understand probabilistic
assessments.
</P>
<P>4.17 These histograms show the varying probabilities of realising risks of
different values.  The products of the probabilities and the risk values are
summed to give the expectation value of risk.  There may well be individual
realisations giving values of risk above 10<SUP>-6</SUP> as in <I>Nirex 95</I>
(Volume 3, Figure 6.10) [COR/522].  Provided that these have a low probability,
the expectation value of risk which takes these realisations into account, will
be below the risk target, as in the case considered in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522].
</P>
<P>4.18 The risks calculated from individual realisations are only comparable
with the risk target after they have been multiplied by the  probability of
their occurrence.  The selection of extreme values of risk shown on the
histograms in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Figures 6.9 and 6.10) is a meaningless
exercise in terms of addressing the risk target unless the probability of
occurrence is accounted for.
</P>
<P>4.19 Dr Starmer repeats this meaningless exercise in his Proof of Evidence
(PE/CCC/5, paragraph 6.12) by claiming that a distribution of results shown in
<I>Nirex Report S/94/001</I> [COR/507] reflects two orders of magnitude
variation.  In the probabilistic assessments analysed, the realisations giving
risks much greater, or less, than the central value have very low probabilities
which must be taken into account when making statements on their true
significance. 
</P>
<P><B>Summary
</B>
</P>
<P>4.20 Dr Starmer has built in his Proof of Evidence (PE/CCC/5) a description
of the impacts of uncertainties by combining speculation on the significance of
certain cases, of which the sub-surface routing case is an example, with
semi-quantitative treatments and overlaying these confusingly onto the results
of a probabilistic risk analysis.  This segregation of uncertainty from the risk
calculation is contrary to the requirements of the <I>Government White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] as described in paragraph 4.7 of my Supplementary Proof of
Evidence.  In addition, Dr Starmer has: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  been selective in his choice of cases (taken from the <I>Nirex 95</I>
[COR/522] study), not reflecting the relative probabilities of different cases,
and attempting to compound a variety of unconnected cases (PE/CCC/5, paragraph
4.5.5).  This is contrary to the requirements of a properly structured
probabilistic analysis and inevitably introduces unquantifiable biases into his
presentation;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>established no sound basis for the mathematical meaning or the magnitude of
his 'range bars' which, in any case, appear to convolute uncertainties and
probabilities which are neither additive or multiplicative; and
</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>attempted to use these 'range bars' to invite comparisons of risks with the
regulatory target.  This is contrary to the requirements of the regulatory
guidelines (paragraph 4.5 of this Supplementary Proof of Evidence) which
indicate that it is the expectation value of risk, derived from a proper
probabilistic analysis that is to be used for comparison, not outlying values
with low probability.
</LI></UL>
<P>4.21 Dr Starmer's attempted comparison to the regulatory target is thus not
based on a sound scientific treatment of risk, being essentially a product of
manipulation of random and incorrectly derived values.

Section 8 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/GNP/2), Dr Mackay suggests a procedure
for a staged investigation process and asserts that it is necessary to identify
a procedure in advance to demonstrate the appropriateness of predictions
(PE/GNP/2, paragraph 8.1).  In Section 10 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/GNP/2),
Dr Mackay then criticises Nirex's approach to site investigation and, in

4.1 and 4.2), Dr Mackay draws the conclusion that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;<I>....it cannot be simply assumed that collecting more data will 
necessarily improve risk predictions.</I>&quot;(PE/GNP/2, paragraph 4.12)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> He further asserts that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>Using increasing amounts of data to develop the model can lead to
worsening<B> </B>predictions of risk.  This unexpected result is counter&#173;
intuitive but of the utmost importance for site characterisation.</I>&quot;<I></I>(PE/GNP/2,
paragraph 6.3)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.5 These conclusions are not  relevant to the Nirex Site Investigation at
Sellafield because of the material differences between Dr Mackay's rather
unrealistic exercise and the approach taken by Nirex.
</P>
<P>5.6 The sequence of modelling and synthesised investigations developed in Dr
Mackay's study [GOV/662, GOV/623 and GOV/628] involved using data from old
regional boreholes, followed by boreholes in the repository region and finally
from new boreholes in the region. This is rather an unusual approach and quite
different to the way in which regional data have been obtained and included in
the Nirex assessment. Dr Mackay acknowledges (PE/GNP/2, paragraph 6.1) the fact
that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>The Harwell site is geologically very different from Sellafield
and the way the investigations and modelling were conducted may differ from the
methods used by Nirex.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Indeed, the way they were conducted does differ substantially, but Dr
Mackay  does not discuss how the differences between the phasing of data
acquisition in his synthetic &quot;<I>site investigation</I>&quot; and the
long-term programme at Sellafield would affect his conclusions. 
</P>
<P>5.7 In paragraph 4.9 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/GNP/2), Dr  Mackay
describes the conduct of his own exercise and notes that:  
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> </I>&quot;<I>The site investigation team did not have sight of the
risk predictions at the end of each assessment exercise and were given only a
short amount of time in which to develop the assessment analysis.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Dr Mackay's procedure is thus in marked contrast to the assessment cycle
outlined in my Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para4.17">paragraphs 4.17</A> to 4.19) and described in <I>Nirex
Report 525</I> (Sub-Section 5.2, pages 30 to 31) [COR/505].  Over a period of
seven years since the initiation of site investigations at Sellafield,
assessment studies have enabled the priorities for site investigations to be
identified with the specific purpose of improving risk predictions.  As a result
of this, the difficulties which Dr Mackay encountered do not, in practice, arise
in Nirex's work. 
</P>
<P><B> Point ii: The Use of RCF Investigations in the Prediction of
Groundwater Flows 
</B>
</P>
<P>5.8 In Section 5 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/GNP/2), Dr Mackay continues
his account of the theoretical study undertaken on behalf of HMIP, concluding in
paragraph 5.7:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> </I>&quot;<I>With reference to Nirex's planned investigations in the
RCF, it should be noted that a concentration of investigations in the RCF will
not necessarily improve predictions of groundwater flows</I>.&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.9 By ensuring that the RCF programme complements the ongoing regional
characterisation programme, and by focusing its model validation activities on
key uncertainties identified in previous assessment cycles, the limitations of
Dr Mackay's exercise will be overcome.  The role of the RCF in improving
predictions of groundwater flows is described at <A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para6.15">paragraphs
6.15</A> to 6.27 in my Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, pages 40 to 44) and
at <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14s1.htm#Para8.79">paragraphs 8.79</A> to 8.88 of Dr
Chaplow's Supplementary Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14/S1</B>, pages 84 to
87).
</P>
<P><B> Point iii: The Use of Conservative Model Assumptions
</B>
</P>
<P>5.10 Dr Mackay asserts that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Calculated error bounds in predicted risks do not necessarily
encompass the true<B> </B>risks and false confidence in risk predictions can be
obtained. Conservative model assumptions such as uniform hydraulic properties do
not necessarily lead to conservative risk predictions</I>.&quot;<I> </I>(PE/GNP/2,
paragraph 6.4)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.11 While the problem identified in the first sentence could apply, and did
in Dr Mackay's exercise, it can be overcome by careful evaluation of
uncertainty.  As discussed in Section 10 of this Supplementary Proof, the
methodology adopted by Nirex to test alternative conceptual models and to reduce
biases means that our combined site investigation and safety assessment
programmes are designed so as not to suffer the limitations imposed by Dr Mackay
in his synthetic exercise, limitations which, Dr Mackay notes, included the
inability to validate any of the models of formation properties being used (<I>A
Study of the Effect of the Extent of Site Investigation on the Estimation of
Radiological Performance: Volume 1</I>)[GOV/622, page 145].
</P>
<P>5.12 Dr Mackay's second sentence is unsupported by any information provided
in his Proof of Evidence and, indeed, I have not been able to locate any similar
statement in the report on which his evidence is based. I would, in any case,
disagree that an assumption of uniform hydraulic properties is actually a
conservative assumption, in safety assessment terms (see definition of a
conservative assumption in <I>Glossary of Scientific Terms</I> [COR/519]). In
the case of Sellafield, as <I>Nirex 95</I> (Volume 3, Chapter 3) [COR/522] has
shown, the inclusion of heterogeneous properties and fracture networks can lead
to channelled flow.  This leads to higher calculated risks than would an
assumption of uniform properties.
</P>
<P><B> Point iv: Calibration and Validation of Models
</B>
</P>
<P>5.13 In paragraph 6.6 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/GNP/2), Dr Mackay asserts
that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Calibration against hydraulic head data is not necessarily
sufficient to distinguish between different conceptual models.  It is important
to also compare model predictions with measurements of other hydraulic
properties.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para5.14"></A>5.14 Nirex envisages a wide range of validation
tests, consistent with Dr Mackay's view, and as identified in <I>Nirex Report
S/94/004</I> (Section 2.4, page 18) [COR/510]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>The final stage of the detailed multi-dimensional groundwater
flow and transport calculations is to compute various quantities that can be
compared against experimental data to test the models.  Suitable quantities are
the groundwater head, the groundwater salinity, locations of recharge and
discharge, values of recharge and discharge, and groundwater age (which can be
estimated by calculating back along pathlines to the point on the surface at
which they start).  Testing the results of the model against experimental data
is a very important part of the process of validation for the underlying
conceptual model.  A reasonable match helps to build confidence in the model,
and consequently in the results of the assessment</I>.&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.15 Thus, it is seen that, in accordance with the approach endorsed by Dr
Mackay, Nirex is indeed comparing model predictions with measurements of other
hydraulic properties.
</P>
<P><B> Point v: The Predictive Value of Models
</B>
</P>
<P>5.16 I cover the issue of confidence in the &quot;<I>correctness</I>&quot;
of models and their validation in detail in Section 10 of this Supplementary
Proof of Evidence.
</P>
<P><B> Point vi: Validation of the <I>Macroscopic</I> Conceptual Model
</B>
</P>
<P>5.17 In paragraph 10.3 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/GNP/2), Dr Mackay
criticises Nirex for not proposing to validate its &quot;<I>macroscopic</I>&quot;<I></I>model
of the site's geology and hydrogeology:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> </I>&quot;<I>....the description of tasks to be undertaken in the RCF
programme has not included a framework in which validation of the current
conceptual macroscopic model of the site's geology and hydrogeology is
attempted.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.18 Furthermore, in paragraph 10.5 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/GNP/2), Dr
Mackay asserts that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>The model validation described in Nirex's evidence as taking
place in the RCF is therefore only that of 'component conceptual models' ....</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.19 I understand Dr Mackay's term &quot;<I>macroscopic model</I>&quot; to
refer to the regional hydrogeological model (PE/GNP/2, paragraph 2.14).  The RCF
has an important role in validating the regional model, as described in
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14s1.htm#Para8.79">paragraphs 8.79</A> to 8.88 of Dr
Chaplow's Supplementary Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14/S1</B>, pages 84 to
87). 
</P>
<P><B> Point vii: Procedure for a Multiple Staged Investigation Process 
</B>
</P>
<P>5.20 In Section 8 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/GNP/2), Dr Mackay advances a &quot;<I>multiple</I>&quot;
staged (as opposed to &quot;<I>single</I>&quot;<I></I>staged) procedure for
site investigation and model validation.  In particular, he asserts that
(PE/GNP/2, paragraph 8.1):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Although a single stage of site investigation may yield the
conceptual macroscopic model, if all data are used for its development,
validation cannot be attempted.  Consequently a staged investigation is
preferable in which the results of each new investigation are used to examine
the performance of the models previously developed from prior site
investigations.  This is a minimum requirement for validation in the weak sense
of improving confidence in the conceptual model as investigation proceeds.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.21 By way of criticism of Nirex's programme, Dr Mackay then states in
paragraph 10.6 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/GNP/2) that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>This raises the concern that criteria have not yet been
established in advance to say what level of prediction is acceptable.  It is not
sufficient for Nirex to establish such criteria after the comparison has been
made as this makes failure to recognise problems with the model predictions far
more likely.  There must be scientific peer review and open publication of such
criteria before site characterisation proceeds.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.22 The Nirex approach, involving multiple validation stages, prior
establishment of  performance measures, and peer review is described in Section
10 of this Supplementary Proof of Evidence.
</P>
<P><B> Point viii: The Development and Assessment of Alternative Conceptual
Models
</B>
</P>
<P>5.23 Dr Mackay raises the issue of alternative conceptual models in
paragraph 10.8 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/GNP/2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>There is no mechanism to ensure that alternative conceptual
models are identified and explored.  Nirex has produced results from only a
single conceptual model of the hydrogeology of the site in their reports,.</I>..&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>It is clear from the Harwell study described above that Nirex's
focus on a single conceptual model limits their chances of providing improved
confidence in the assessment predictions as site investigation proceeds.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.24 In paragraph 11.2 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/GNP/2), Dr Mackay
concludes:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>The method of demonstrating the adequacy of the conceptual model
must be clearly and openly stated in advance of any construction of an RCF and
should be agreed in advance with an appropriate authority.  It is not apparent
that this is the case at present.  If such a method cannot be established then
the development of the RCF should be rejected until such a method has been
developed.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.25 The process of development of the hydrogeological conceptual models
used as the 'base case' for risk calculations in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522] was
described in considerable detail in Volume 1 of that document.  Section 6 of
Volume 1 (page 6.1) states: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>At that time it was also recognised that a number of alternative
choices could have been made in the formulation of the model and that some of
these alternatives could also lead to a model that was as compatible with the
available data.  The following issues were noted by the expert group in the
course of the meetings held to formulate the conceptual model and are recorded
here for reference and for possible consideration in later  work......Various
mechanisms which could lead to the production of the observed head values were
discussed by the group...A number of these possibilities, as well as the effect
of explicitly imposing the observed head gradients on the base of the model were
investigated in the variant calculations performed in Nirex 95 (see Section 7 of
Volume 3).</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.26 Section 10 of this Supplementary Proof of Evidence describes the
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test. This exercise has been used to compare six alternative
conceptual models of groundwater flow within the BVG.
</P>
<P>5.27 Thus, there is ample evidence to contradict DrMackay's statements on
alternative conceptual models as reproduced at paragraph5.23 of this
Supplementary Proof.
</P>
<P>5.28 The Nirex validation approach, as described in Section 10 of this
Supplementary Proof of Evidence, meets the concerns expressed by DrMackay at
paragraph 11.2 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/GNP/2) as reproduced at paragraph
5.24 above.  Hence his reservation regarding the development of the RCF is
unfounded.
</P>
<P>5.29 The adequacy of models used in repository post-closure performance
assessments that will be submitted in support of an application for
authorisation under RSA 93 will be a matter for the appropriate regulatory
bodies.  Nirex expects the regulator to have an interest in the methods that
were used to test the adequacy of the relevant models; models which will almost
certainly be different from those that have been developed to date, and plans to
present an appropriate submission containing such information.  The RCF is an
essential facility for the calibration, validation and improvement of models to
be used in post-closure performance assessments and is therefore integral to the
method of demonstrating their adequacy to the regulator.
</P>

<P><B>6.</B> <B><A NAME="CONCEPT">THE NIREX REPOSITORY CONCEPT</A>
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Dr Allison, for Friends of the Earth,  makes a number of points
concerning the engineered barriers in the Nirex repository concept and the
relationship of the concept to the experimental programme proposed for the RCF
in Sections 4, 5 and 6 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/7).  He asserts that the
safety of a repository at Sellafield will rely on the performance of the
engineered barrier as a means of physical containment (PE/FOE/7, paragraphs 4.14
and 4.15).  Dr Wogelius, also for Friends of the Earth, makes points concerning
the value to the Nirex repository concept of geochemical controls on
radionuclide migration in Section 4 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8).  He
asserts that the engineered barrier cannot be relied upon to meet the long-term
safety requirements of a radioactive waste repository (PE/FOE/8, paragraph 4.2)
and that the beneficial operation of geochemical processes will be essential. 
Dr Salmon in Section 4 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/5) raises similar points
to those of Dr Allison in respect of sealing of RCF shafts and the potential
impact on repository performance.
</P>
<P>6.2 The points which Dr Allison raises in his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/7)
in relation to:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  siting and future use of the RCF (paragraphs 4.36 and 4.44 to 4.54);
</P>
<P>  methods of excavation of the RCF (paragraphs 4.37 and 4.55 to 4.60); and
</P>
<P> design of rock support for the RCF shafts and galleries (paragraphs 4.38
and 4.61 to 4.68)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> will be dealt with in a Supplementary Proof of Evidence from Dr Mellor (<A
HREF="../nrx16/nrx16s1.htm"><B>PE/NRX/16/S1</B></A>).
</P>
<P>6.3 The remaining points which Dr Allison raises in Sections 4, 5 and 6 of
his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/7) together with Dr Salmon's concerns on sealing
are dealt with in this Section of my Supplementary Proof of Evidence.
</P>
<P>6.4 The points which Dr Wogelius raises on geochemical processes and related
experiments in the RCF in Section 5 to 9 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8) are
dealt with in Section 7 of my Supplementary Proof of Evidence.
</P>
<P>6.5 The points which Dr Wogelius raises in Section 4 of his Proof of
Evidence (PE/FOE/8) are dealt with in this Section of my Supplementary Proof of
Evidence.
</P>
<P>6.6 The overall theme of Sections 4, 5 and 6 of Dr Allison's Proof of
Evidence (PE/FOE/7), as set out at paragraphs 4.14 to 4.16, is that, in view of
the current picture of the hydrogeology at Sellafield, the engineered barriers
for a repository at Sellafield require an advanced level of development. In
particular, he asserts (PE/FOE/7, paragraph 4.14):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex's evidence, particularly that of Dr Chaplow [<A
HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm"><B>PE/NRX/14</B></A>] and Dr Hooper [<A
HREF="nrx15.htm"><B>PE/NRX/15</B></A>], demonstrates that the geological
setting at the Sellafield site is complex and that the rocks within the PRZ are
variable, both in terms of their intrinsic properties (small&#173;scale) and
mass properties (large&#173;scale). By comparison with the attributes of the
ideal repository site, it is evident that the degree to which uncertainties can
be resolved at Sellafield, even through construction of an RCF, is itself
uncertain.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and goes on to say (PE/FOE/7, paragraph 4.15):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In these circumstances, the multi&#173;barrier philosophy
indicates that the level of attention to be focused on engineered barriers
should assume a particularly high level of importance in studies directed
towards the planning of a final repository at Sellafield</I>&quot;.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.7 Dr Allison is wrong to make reference to &quot;<I>the ideal repository
site</I>&quot;.  As explained by Dr Chaplow (<B>PE/NRX/14/S1</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14s1.htm#Para5.5">paragraphs 5.5</A>, 5.6 and 5.7) in
response to this statement by Dr Allison, there is no basis for citing &quot;<I>complexity</I>&quot;
as an issue either from the point of view of Nirex, provided that it is willing
to deploy the necessary resources to generate an adequate understanding, or from
the point of view of HMIP, provided that &quot;<I>a complex geological
structure</I>&quot; was &quot;<I>addressed thoroughly in any future application</I>&quot;
(PE/HMP/1, page 9, paragraph 4.9).
</P>
<P>6.8 I believe that the &quot;<I>level of attention to be focused on
engineered barriers</I>&quot; should assume a &quot;<I>high level of importance</I>&quot;
at any repository site.  Further, I believe that the engineered barriers should
be designed to take account both of the wastes to be disposed of and of the
characteristics of the site, and to be in accordance with the regulatory
requirements for the adoption of best practicable means, as laid down in &quot;<I>the
July 1995 White Paper</I>&quot; (page 22, paragraph 78) [GOV/208]. 
</P>
<P>6.9 It is clear that Dr Allison has based his thesis upon an incorrect
reading of &quot;<I>Euradwaste series No 6</I>&quot;<I> </I>which he cites
(FOE/7/14 page 20, paragraph 4.13) as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;<I>The site should be such that significant water outlets
surrounding the repository can be easily identified and the water pathways can
be modelled.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> This citation occurs within the section of the EC report dealing with &quot;<I>near
surface repositories</I>&quot; [FOE/7/14, page 7] &quot;<I>for short lived, low
and medium level waste</I>&quot; [PE/FOE/7, page 5] and is therefore
inappropriate to a deep geological repository. 
</P>
<P>6.10 The overall theme of his evidence in general and in particular Section
4 of Dr Wogelius' Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8), as set out in paragraph 4.2, is
that  in view of &quot;<I>the limitations of the engineered barrier, the
long-term safety requirements of a radioactive waste repository make it
necessary for the geological setting of a proposed site to demonstrably
contribute to the immobilisation of the radionuclides</I>.&quot;
</P>
<P>6.11 It is clear that Dr Wogelius has based his thesis upon <I>Brady (1994)</I>
(FOE/8/1), a paper submitted to the scientific journal Waste Management but not
yet accepted for publication.  The statements abstracted from the submitted
paper in paragraph 4.1 of Dr Wogelius' Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8) have no
relevance to a deep geological repository since the paper deals with &quot;<I>near-surface
disposal facilities</I>&quot; (page 3) (FOE/8/1).
</P>
<P>6.12 However, I am in full agreement with the general principles expressed
at page 5 of <I>Brady (1994)</I> (FOE/8/1):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;<I>Using cement-based material as a waste form or backfill material
may potentially lead to a simpler, more defensible performance assessment for a
number of reasons....Hydrogeochemical modelling of radionuclide  mobility in the
near-field is much more straight forward if the pH is known to be </I>&quot;<I>fixed</I>&quot;<I>by
hydrolysis of cement</I>&quot;.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> This is a concise statement of a principal reason for the selection by
Nirex of a cementitious backfill for a deep repository, Nirex Reference Vault
Backfill.
</P>
<P>6.13 I am unable to reconcile the theme of Dr Allison for Friends of the
Earth, that great reliance must be placed on engineered physical barriers, since
(PE/FOE/7, paragraph 5.7):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;<I>Physical systems reach states of equilibria which are much more
readily identified then the geochemical 'equilibria' which evolve within the
repository environment</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> with the theme of Dr Wogelius, also for Friends of the Earth, that reliance
must be placed on geochemical processes because, he says (PE/FOE/8, paragraph
4.2), of:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;<I>...the limitations of the engineered barrier...</I>&quot;. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.14 Furthermore, I reject both these themes because they both
over-emphasise the importance of the performance of one component of the
multi-barrier containment system.  I have laid down the principles of
multi-barrier containment in the Nirex repository concept in
<A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para4.3">paragraphs 4.3</A> to 4.6 of my Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>).
 The Nirex repository concept has been developed to take account of the volumes
and natures of the wastes that it is intended to contain and the statements
repeated in &quot;<I>the July 1995 White Paper</I>&quot;<I> </I>(pages 22 and
23, paragraphs 80 and 81) [GOV/208] concerning the unlimited period into the
future over which risk should be assessed.
</P>
<P>6.15 Good physical containment, as proposed by Dr Allison (PE/FOE/7), and
good chemical containment, as proposed by Dr Wogelius (PE/FOE/8), are afforded
by the barriers of the Nirex repository concept.  The time-frames over which
these barriers can be relied upon has been taken into account.  The longer term
reliance on chemical containment, rather than complete physical containment, is
supported in principle by Dr Wogelius who states (PE/FOE/8, paragraph 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;<I>However, geochemical processes may act to keep radionuclides in
solution low and effectively limit the release of radionuclides even after the
engineered barriers have failed.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.16 The specific assertions which Dr Allison makes in Sections 4, 5 and 6
of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/7) can be summarised as follows:
</P>
<P>i. there are uncertainties about the performance of the containment concept
that will not be adequately addressed by the proposed programme of works in the
RCF (paragraphs 4.30 to 4.32); and
</P>
<P>ii. inadequate attention is being paid to the design of seals for the RCF
(paragraphs 4.69 to 4.80) and for the repository access and underground
excavations, other than the disposal vaults (Section 5), and inadequate
attention is being paid to &quot;<I>quality objectives</I>&quot; and
large-scale tests of backfilling and sealing designs (Section 6).
</P>
<P>6.17 The specific assertions that Dr Wogelius makes in paragraphs 4.5 to 4.9
of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8) can also be summarised as referring to
uncertainties about the performance of the containment concept, as at i. in
paragraph 6.16 above.  My response to point i is given at paragraphs 6.18 to
6.44 below, and to point ii at paragraphs 6.45 to 6.94 below.</P>
<P> <B>Point i: Uncertainties about Performance of the Containment Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>6.18 I respond in detail to these points below but my overall response is
that:
</P>
<P> the uncertainties which Dr Allison lists are being addressed by the
long-established Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme or will be addressed
by the RCF; and the assertions which Dr Wogelius makes are based on incorrect
assumptions concerning the Nirex repository concept and assessment of its
long-term performance that I identify.</P>
<P>6.19 In paragraphs 4.30 and 4.32 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/7), Dr
Allison asserts that there are uncertainties about the performance of the
containment concept that will not be adequately addressed by the proposed
programme of works in the RCF. These fall into two categories:
</P>
<P> areas of uncertainty which Nirex has identified - as raised by Dr Allison
(PE/FOE/7); and
</P>
<P> areas of uncertainty which Dr Allison suggests Nirex has overlooked. 
</P>
<P> I deal with these in turn in paragraphs 6.20 to 6.24 and 6.25 to 6.33 below
</P>
<P> Areas of Uncertainty which Nirex has Identified
</P>
<P>6.20 At paragraph 4.30 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/7), Dr Allison sets
out a list of uncertainties which, in the main, he has extracted from my
original proof (<A HREF="nrx15.htm"><B>PE/NRX/15</B></A>) without further
comment. However, in two instances he elaborates on the original point.
</P>
<P>6.21 In the third bullet point of paragraph 4.30 (PE/FOE/7), Dr Allison
refers to the uncertainty concerning:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>the reliability of the predicted groundwater flow through the
repository of 140m<SUP>3</SUP> per year and the risk that higher rates of flow
(approximately five times greater) could deplete the buffering properties of the
backfill to an extent which undermines confidence in post&#173;closure safety
performance [<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, <A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para5.21">paragraphs 5.21</A>,
5.22, 5.23, <A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para5.51">5.51</A>].</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.22 Dr Allison does not give any justification for considering a rate of
flow approximately five times greater than the figure of 140m<SUP>3 </SUP> per
year given in <A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para5.21">paragraph 5.21</A> of my Proof of
Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>).  However, as I note in that paragraph, simple
calculation shows that for a flow rate of 140m<SUP>3</SUP> per year the pH of
the porewater in the near-field of the repository would be maintained at a value
greater than the desired value of 10 for many millions of years.  The flow rate
would have to be considerably greater before it &quot;<I>could deplete the
buffering properties of the backfill to an extent which undermines confidence in
post-closure safety performance</I>&quot;.  If such a concern existed, the
repository design and in particular  the quantity of backfill would be optimised
in order to ensure that the pH buffering capacity of the repository would be
maintained for an adequately long period of time.  Dr Allison is therefore wrong
to raise this as an uncertainty.
</P>
<P>6.23 In the fourth bullet point of paragraph 4.30 (PE/FOE/7), Dr Allison
refers to the uncertainty concerning:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>the extent to which spreading and dilution in the 'far field'
meets the predicted dilution of one part in two thousand [<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para4.5">paragraphs 4.5</A>, 4.6,
<A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para5.28">5.28</A>, 5.29, <A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para5.52">5.52</A>,
<A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para6.17">6.17</A>] - this implies that no express route for
groundwater will occur within the 'near&#173;field'.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.24 The extent to which spreading and dilution in the &quot;<I>far-field</I>&quot;
meets the predicted dilution of one part in two thousand is an important area of
uncertainty.  The RCF is needed to address this.  The dilution factor of one
part in two thousand is not given in the paragraphs of my Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>)
that are cited by Dr Allison but is that which applies in calculations for the
inventory-limited radionuclides chlorine-36 and iodine&#173;129 in <I>Nirex 95</I>
(Volume 3, Section 2.3, page 2.13) [COR/522].  However, the relevance of an
express route for groundwater within the &quot;<I>near-field</I>&quot; is not
clear.  An &quot;<I>express route</I>&quot; implies a preferential flow path
which would result in the groundwater that would move along such a path having
access to only a small fraction of the total inventory of radionuclides.  The
flow of groundwater through the repository would thus contain a lower dissolved
level of radionuclides.  Since dilution is afforded by the flow in the overlying
sandstones, which is independent of flows within the repository, a higher
dilution factor would result.  <I>Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme,
Nirex Near-Field Research: Report on Current Status in 1994, July 1995 (&quot;Nirex
Report S/95/011&quot;)</I> (Figure 9, page 57) [COR/529] illustrates results
where the iodine-129 inventory is released more rapidly from the repository near
field when using a homogeneous model of a repository vault with groundwater flow
accessing the entire volume of the vault, as compared with models containing
various preferential flow paths. Therefore, I conclude that Dr Allison is wrong
in raising the issue of an &quot;<I>express route</I>&quot; within the near
field as a means of lowering radionuclide dilution. 
</P>
<P> Areas of Uncertainty which Nirex has Allegedly Overlooked - as Raised by Dr
Allison (PE/FOE/7)</P>
<P>6.25 In paragraph 4.32 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/7), Dr Allison sets
out a list of uncertainties which he says are not addressed by Nirex. In the
following paragraphs 6.26 to 6.33 I address, in turn, each of the uncertainties
he identifies.
</P>
<P>6.26 Uncertainties arising from: &quot;<I>the rate of generation and
dispersion of gas within the 'near&#173;field' as a function of the rate of
groundwater flow, the spatial arrangements within the backfilled vaults, and the
possibility of utilising the generation of gas over&#173;pressures as a means of
preventing groundwater ingress.&quot;</I> (PE/FOE/7, paragraph 4.32, point 1)
have been addressed by Nirex. In particular:
</P>
<P> <I>Nirex Report NSS/G120, NSARP Reference Document, Gas Generation and
Migration January 1992 [NRX/15/5]</I> states on page 18: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The gas generation model couples gas generation from the corrosion
of metals and from the microbial degradation of cellulosic wastes.  This model
is encoded in the GAMMON computer program</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and on page 22:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>GAMMON has been developed to take account of the movement of
groundwater through the repository environment.</I>&quot;; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> <I>Nirex Report S/95/011</I> (Sub-section 5.23, page 57, entitled &quot;<I>Modelling
of interactions between packages or between vaults</I>&quot;) [COR/529]
describes the work that has been carried out on the spatial arrangements within
the vaults; and the possibility of utilising the generation of gas
over-pressures as a means of preventing groundwater ingress has been considered
and rejected as a concept which could not be demonstrated to give any benefit in
terms of radiological protection.</P>
<P>Therefore, I conclude that Dr Allison is wrong to assert that these are &quot;<I>uncertainties
not addressed by Nirex</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.27"></A>6.27 Uncertainties arising from the: &quot;<I>means
by which the vault backfill will be introduced to fill all the voids of the
waste emplacement chambers, including those at the crown of the vaults.</I>&quot;
(PE/FOE/7, paragraph 4.32, point 2) have been addressed by Nirex.  Indeed, Dr
Allison quotes the relevant sections of the <I>Nirex Vault Backfill </I>(FOE/7/17)<I>Patent
Application</I> in paragraph 5.30 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/7) :
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The backfilling material slurry is suitable for mixing, handling,
pumping and remove </I>[sic - &quot;remote&quot; in original document]<I> vault
filling operations.  The slurry is self-levelling and compacting and able to
infill the spaces between waste packages.  Bleed should not be greater than 2%
to minimise the formation of voids at waste package interfaces.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The backfilling material slurry may be mixed underground at a mixing
station within the repository vault.  The vault slurry could be pumped directly
along a long pipeline for placement in the vault as required, or pumped into
tanks and transported into the vault.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In <I>Hooper (1995)</I> (pages 8 and 9 and Figure 5) [GNP/3/5], a
large-scale test is reported which showed that the Nirex Reference Vault
Backfill satisfied aspects of the specification that Dr Allison claims are not
addressed.  Finally, the models of the repository near field used in <I>Nirex
95</I> (Sub-section 3.2.1, page 3.2) [COR/522] assumed that the vaults have open
crown spaces.  This has been shown to be a beneficial arrangement in reducing
radionuclide release in work carried out to date and illustrated in <I>Nirex
Report S/95/011</I> (Figure 9, page 57) [COR/529]. 
</P>
<P> Therefore, I conclude that Dr Allison is unjustified in claiming that these
are &quot;<I>uncertainties not addressed by Nirex</I>&quot;.
</P>
<P>6.28 Uncertainties arising from the: &quot;<I>means of enhancing
radionuclide retention within the waste emplacement vaults, by physical
restriction of groundwater flow through the repository backfill.</I>&quot;
(PE/FOE/7, paragraph 4.32, point 3) are being addressed.  Referring to the main
channels for groundwater flow in the BVG, <I>Nirex Report 525</I> (page 43)
[COR/505] states: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In practice, of course, if a repository were constructed at
Sellafield at some time in the future, then considerably more would be known
about the hydrogeological properties of the rocks in the Potential Repository
Zone than at present.  In particular, the intention would be to establish the
frequencies and specific positions of zones of locally enhanced conductivity. 
The repository could be designed to avoid them or, if found to intersect vaults,
it may be possible to effectively seal them off.  Meanwhile the conservative
assumption made in current models is that unsealed zones of locally enhanced
conductivity cross some of the vaults.  This is likely to over-estimate risks.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In my Proof of Evidence (<A HREF="nrx15.htm"><B>PE/NRX/15</B></A>, page
56) I identify the features that Nirex wishes to consider sealing and for which
work in the RCF is required.  The first feature is given as :
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>flowing fractures intersecting repository vaults (which are
assumed not to be sealed in current models);</I>&quot;<BR>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Therefore, I conclude that Dr Allison is wrong to claim that there are &quot;<I>uncertainties
not being addressed by Nirex</I>&quot; and I identify that the RCF is planned to
play an important role in their resolution.<BR>
</P>
<P>6.29 Uncertainties arising from: &quot;<I>the types of materials and
designs for special seals which can prevent development of preferential
flowpaths through the disturbed rock, through imperfections in backfilled
openings, and at the interface between the BVG and the overlying materials which
are penetrated by access routes to the emplacement horizon.</I>&quot; 
(PE/FOE/7, paragraph 4.32, point 4) are being addressed, as is made clear in
<A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para7.2">paragraph 7.2</A> of my Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>).<BR>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 Uncertainties arising from: &quot;<I>the
merits of alternative methods of rock excavation in limiting the amount of
peripheral rock disturbance.</I>&quot; (PE/FOE/7, paragraph 4.32, point 5) can
only be addressed when excavation disturbance of the rocks at Sellafield has
been investigated through the RCF.  In the interim Nirex has sought to gain an
understanding of the relevant principles through participation in the
international &Auml;sp&ouml; Hard Rock Laboratory Project.  In <I>GEOVAL '94
Validation Through Model Testing, Proceedings of an NEA/SKI Symposium Paris,
France, 11-14 October 1994</I> [NRX/15/6] it is stated (page 24):

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To obtain a better understanding of the properties of the

<P>6.31 Uncertainties arising from: &quot;<I>the long&#173;term stability of
repository openings including shafts and galleries, and the need for linings

(PE/FOE/7, paragraph 4.32, point 6) are being addressed, as set out in
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para8.11">paragraph 8.11</A> of Dr Chaplow's Proof

<P><A NAME="Para6.32"></A>6.32 Uncertainties arising from: &quot;<I>the need
to verify that the selection of concrete as a material for backfilling the

longevity</I>&quot; (PE/FOE/7, paragraph 4.32, point 7) are being addressed in
respect of the backfill and of the hydrostatic lining to be placed in the upper
section of the RCF shaft.  &quot;<I>The selection of concrete as a material for
backfilling the repository vaults</I>&quot;<I> </I>is taken to refer to the
Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  The &quot;<I>material longevity</I>&quot; is
covered in part by tests simulating long-term exposure to groundwater in the BVG
rocks of the PRZ at Sellafield, the results of which were summarised in <I>Hooper
(1995)</I> (page 9) (GNP/3/5) as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Long-term buffering properties substantially exceed those required

<P><I>The cured mix retains high sorption capacity for sorbing radionuclides

</I>
</P>
<P><I>The mix specimens subjected to accelerated leaching and groundwater
reactions retained physical integrity and a suitably high permeability to gas
(to allow gas formed in the repository to escape without overpressurising the
material).&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Further evidence is obtained from natural analogues of the key components of
the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill and in particular the natural analogue at
Maqarin in Jordan where the mineral phase calcium silicate hydrate gel, which is
responsible for the later stages of the repository long-term alkali buffering
and sorption properties, has been stable in relatively high groundwater flows
for tens of thousands of years.  The longevity of the shaft lining in terms of
its hydraulic properties requires to satisfy a relatively undemanding standard,
given its location, well above any potential repository horizon, and the
information on sealing standards required throughout the shaft in
<A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para7.2">paragraph 7.2</A> of my Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>).
 Finally, I note in my Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para5.23">paragraph 5.23</A>) with respect to long term
reactions with the backfill that account is taken of the resulting uncertainties
in current safety assessment studies.  Again, I must conclude that Dr Allison's
assertion that these are &quot;<I>uncertainties not being addressed by Nirex</I>&quot;
is unjustified.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.33"></A>6.33 Uncertainties arising from: &quot;<I>the need
to carry out confirmation trials on backfilling and sealing for which practical
operational methods have already been tried, tested and validated, and shown to
be capable of producing consistently a prescribed set of quality objectives.</I>&quot;
(PE/FOE/7, paragraph 4.32, point 8) are addressed by the strategy for sealing
studies proposed for the RCF in my Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para6.68">paragraphs 6.68</A> and 6.69).  In the case of
backfilling as indicated in the RCF Environmental Statement [COR/101] at
paragraph 1.52, a backfilling trial is under consideration for the RCF. 
However, it may be more appropriate to carry out such trials in a surface-based
facility or as part of non-radioactive commissioning trials when a repository
vault has been constructed.
</P>
<P>Matters raised by Dr Wogelius (PE/FOE/8)
</P>
<P>6.34 In paragraphs 4.5 to 4.9 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8), Dr
Wogelius asserts that there  are inadequacies in the performance of the Nirex
repository concept in respect of:
</P>
<P>  enhanced transport conditions for radionuclide  release  as a consequence
of the &quot;high permeability&quot; grouting material  (paragraph 4.5,
PE/FOE/8) and;
</P>
<P>  inadequate dilution of radionuclides that do not have a low solubility
under repository conditions.
</P>
<P> I deal with these in turn in paragraphs 6.35 to 6.38 and 6.39 to 6.44 
below.
</P>
<P> Enhanced Transport Conditions
</P>
<P>6.35 Referring to the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill, Dr Wogelius (PE/FOE/8,
paragraph 4.5), notes that it has been selected to provide &quot;<I><B>relatively</B></I>
[my emphasis] <I>high permeability and porosity</I>&quot; and he lists some,
but not all, the reasons for Nirex's requiring these properties.  He then goes
on to state, omitting the word &quot;<I>relatively</I>&quot;:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;<I>This high permeability will also provide enhanced transport
conditions for radionuclide release</I>.&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> This is wrong because the release of radionuclides dissolved in the
porewater of the backfill will be determined by the rate of groundwater flow
through the near field of the repository, which will in turn be determined by
the hydrogeological characteristics of the host rock.
</P>
<P>6.36 Dr Wogelius omitted to note that one of the reasons given in my Proof
of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, <A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para5.18">paragraph 5.18</A>),
for selecting a relatively high porosity material is:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;<I>long-term maintenance of a high active surface-area for sorption
of key radionuclides</I>&quot;.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> This is a powerful process for the retardation of release of many
radionuclides, as noted in the paper <I>Brady (1994)</I> (pages 13 and 14)
[FOE/8/1] that Dr Wogelius cites.
</P>
<P>6.37 The backfill is not &quot;<I>highly permeable</I>&quot; but does have
a &quot;<I>relatively high permeability</I>&quot; in comparison with structural
concrete and the BVG.  The permeability of the backfill has been measured as 10<SUP>-16</SUP>
m<SUP>2</SUP> (<I>Nirex Report NSS/309, The Mass Transport Properties of
Cementitious Materials for Radioactive Waste Repository Construction, July 1995
</I>(page 6) [NRX/15/7]) (equivalent to a hydraulic conductivity of 10<SUP>-9</SUP>
m s<SUP>-1</SUP>), some orders of magnitude less permeable than sands and
gravels for example.
</P>
<P>6.38 In conclusion, Dr Wogelius seems not to have understood the nature of
the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill and some of the processes that will
contribute to its performance in containing radionuclides within the repository.
 Far from enhancing &quot;<I>transport conditions for radionuclide release</I>&quot;,
the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill will reduce such a release, as it is designed
to do.
</P>
<P> Inadequate Dilution
</P>
<P>6.39 Referring to the role of dilution in solving &quot;<I>the problem</I>&quot;
of radionuclides that do not have a low solubility under repository conditions,
Dr Wogelius (PE/FOE/8, paragraph 4.9) uses dose-based limiting concentrations
(DBLC's) to imply that the dilution factors  cited in my Proof of Evidence  (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para5.32">paragraph 5.32</A>) gave a misleading impression
of safety.
</P>
<P>6.40 In order to make this point, Dr Wogelius focuses on some calculations
for the radionuclide caesium-137 (PE/FOE/8, paragraph  4.9), stating that the
dilution argument has been applied in evaluating the safety of disposal of this
radionuclide.  This is not the case.  Caesium-137 is contained within the
repository system by physical containment within the waste containers and
additional containment would be afforded by sorption in the near field and the
geosphere as explained in <I>Nirex 95</I> (Volume 3, Sub-section 8.1, pages 8.1
to 8.4).
</P>
<P>6.41 The safety of disposal of the radionuclides chlorine-36 and iodine-129
does rely on the extent of dilution in near-surface groundwaters.  The
calculated risks arising from these radionuclides given in my Proof of Evidence
(<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, <A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para5.37">paragraph 5.37</A>) are
consistent with the dilution factor of about 2,000 (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para5.23">paragraph 5.23</A>).
</P>
<P>6.42 The argument presented by Dr Wogelius is entirely inappropriate to
evaluations of safety of deep geological disposal of radioactive wastes.  For a
deep geological repository it is appropriate to take account of some delay in
time between disposal and the first possible radiological exposure of people. 
Taking a notional total containment time for the disposal inventory of caesium&#173;137
(<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, <A HREF="nrx15.htm#Table5.1">Table 5.1</A>) of just one
thousand years to account for physical containment in the waste containers and
travel through the geosphere, the dilution factor of 2,000 would lead to a
concentration of caesium-137 in groundwater emerging into the biosphere
approximately one thousandth of   Dr Wogelius' DBLC.
</P>
<P>6.43 For this simplified containment model, the radioactive decay of the    
 caesium-137 in one thousand years accounts for  most of the reduction in the
concentration in the groundwater.  This gives a simplified example of the merits
of deep geological disposal of radioactive wastes.
</P>
<P>6.44 Dr Wogelius' statements on dilution are irrelevant because he has made
unjustified assumptions about the principles of deep  geological disposal both
of caesium-137 in particular and of radioactive wastes in general.
</P>
<P><B> Point ii:  RCF and Repository Sealing and Backfilling
</B>
</P>
<P>6.45 In his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/7), Dr Allison asserts that inadequate
attention has been given by Nirex to repository backfilling and sealing issues
in relation to:
</P>
<P> waste emplacement and backfilling tests to be carried out in the RCF 
(paragraphs 4.41 to 4.43 and paragraphs 4.69 to 4.80); 
</P>
<P> general principles of repository backfilling and sealing (paragraphs 5.1 to
5.10);
</P>

<P> &quot;<I>special seals</I>&quot; in the repository  (paragraphs 5.53 to
5.55).
</P>
<P>6.46 Given the wide range of Dr Allison's comments in these areas, it is not
appropriate to attempt to summarise my response  to each of his points at this
stage.  Rather, I deal with each of these areas in turn, and the detailed points
raised in relation to them below.
</P>
<P>6.47 In respect of the third bullet, Dr Salmon at paragraphs 4.20 to 4.26 of
his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/5) also raises issues concerned with the sealing
of the RCF and the potential impact on the repository safety case.  Dr Salmon
concerns are addressed, along with the response to Dr Allison's third bullet
point at paragraphs 6.56 to 6.61 below.</P>
<P> Waste Emplacement and Backfilling Tests in the RCF
</P>
<P>6.48 Considering waste emplacement and backfilling operations in paragraphs
4.41 to 4.43 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/7), Dr Allison concludes:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>A substantial programme of background generic research in this
area is required prior to the selection of best practical methods for
verification within an RCF.  Nirex gives no identification that this research
work has been carried out.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.49 I have already  described  in paragraph 6.27 of this Supplementary
Proof of Evidence the large-scale test work that has been carried out.   <I>Hooper

Development Programme, states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;<I>Initially TEL carried out a desk study, supported by bench-top
trials on ninety-six formulations covering combinations of OPC, lime, PFA,
ground granulated blast-furnace slag, sodium silicate, bentonite and filler

carried forward into a laboratory testing programme.</I>&quot;

<P> General Principles of Repository Backfilling and Sealing
</P>
<P>6.50 In paragraphs 5.1 to 5.10 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/7), Dr

out and deal with in turn below.

<P>6.51 In paragraph 5.4 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/7), Dr Allison
asserts that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> I have searched the reference (FOE/7/6) for evidence of a tacit assumption
but found no information to justify this proposal. 
</P>
<P>6.52 In paragraph  5.5 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/7), Dr Allison
states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;<I>The fact that safety assessment models may take no credit for
the physical contribution of backfilling and sealing systems to containment of
radionuclides within the 'active' zone, does not mean that this aspect may be
ignored [FOE/7/7].  Indeed, within the waste emplacement areas, the backfilling
and sealing system should seek to achieve</I>:
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>   <I>maximum delay to the  establishment of saturation conditions</I>; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>   <I>minimum rate of groundwater through-flow in order to limit the rate
of replenishment of corrosive  agents and the outflow of contaminated water; and
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>   <I>high levels of effectiveness in eliminating interface flow paths and
peripheral flow paths (see Figure 4.3).</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Dr Allison acknowledges that the benefit of meeting these requirements may
not be reflected in assessments of radionuclide containment.  I conclude that Dr
Allison's prescriptions are not shown to be relevant to affording radiological
protection.
</P>
<P>6.53 In paragraph 5.8 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/7), Dr Allison
proposes that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;<I>One of the fundamental objectives of Nirex's programme should be
to validate best practicable means of achieving the maximum containment of
radionuclides at or near to the point of burial, using engineered backfilling
and sealing systems</I>.&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> This is a different objective to that given by the regulatory authorities
in<I> the 1995 HMIP Consultation Draft</I>  (page 23, paragraph 6.15)
[HMIP/I/1]:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;<I>Requirement R3 - use of best practicable means
</I>
</P>
<P>  <I>The best practicable means shall be employed to ensure that any
radioactivity coming from a facility will be such that doses to members of the
public and risks to future populations are as low as reasonably achievable</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Nirex works to the objective of satisfying this requirement in respect of
best practicable means rather than to alternative prescriptions offered in this
instance, by Dr Allison, which therefore are not relevant.
</P>
<P>6.54 In paragraph 5.9 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/7), Dr Allison states
that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;<I>A pre-requisite for effective backfilling and sealing of
radioactive waste repositories is that there is demonstrable evidence of the
longevity of the materials used for this purpose [FOE/7/2, FOE/7/7, FOE7/10]. 
Considering the source term for the models described in Dr Hooper's evidence [<A
HREF="nrx15.htm"><B>PE/NRX/15</B></A>], 'near-field' barriers are presumed to
contribute to repository performance over a period of up to one million years
(albeit only as a geochemical barrier).  Backfilling and sealing systems within
'redundant' parts of the repository will be required to function as a physical
barrier over even longer periods if preferential flowpaths are to be permanently
eliminated</I>.&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> It was made clear in my Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para7.2">paragraph 7.2</A>) that shafts have been evaluated
as if sealed against the flow of groundwater to only a very low standard,
resulting in the calculation of no detrimental effect on transport of
radionuclides.  Therefore, there is no justification for the condition proposed
by Dr Allison.
</P>
<P>6.55 In paragraphs 5.10 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/7), Dr Allison
states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;...<I>Apart from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill, the proposals
in Nirex's evidence do not identify the various materials to be used for
backfilling and sealing, and have not provided evidence that the appropriate
longevity criteria will be met</I>.&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> I dealt with the issue of longevity in paragraph 6.32 of this Supplementary
 Proof of Evidence.  &quot;<I>Criteria</I>&quot; would be expected to be
developed  in relation  to a firm repository design proposal, which requires
inputs of information from the RCF.
</P>
<P> Sealing of Shafts and Infilling of Galleries
</P>
<P>6.56 In paragraphs 5.13 to 5.26 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/7), Dr
Allison sets out a number of general observations in relation to the sealing of
shafts and infilling of galleries.  I outlined the Nirex  work in relation to
these aspects in paragraphs 6.29 and 6.27 respectively of this Supplementary
Proof.
</P>
<P>6.57 At paragraphs 4.20 to 4.26 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/5), Dr
Salmon discusses the potential &quot;<I>Damage of the Repository Safety Case</I>&quot;
that could arise from construction of the RCF if the shafts were not
subsequently sealed adequately.  At paragraph 4.22 he refers to the scoping
studies of the impact of underground investigations on the performance of a
repository discussed at <A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para6.47">paragraph 6.47</A> of my
Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>).  At paragraph 4.20 Dr Salmon indicates, &quot;<I>No
details of these scoping studies or references are provided</I>&quot;.  
</P>
<P>6.58 At paragraph 4.24 of PE/FOE/5 Dr Salmon points to apparent
contradictions between Nirex witnesses in respect of the impact of the RCF, and
at paragraph 4.26 he concludes:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>It therefore appears that Nirex has prematurely dismissed the
possibility of the RCF damaging the repository PCPA, or at least has not
provided sufficient evidence for independent peer review</I>&quot;<I>.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.59 The scoping studies referred to at <A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para6.47">paragraph
6.47</A> (and also at
<A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para7.2">paragraph 7.2</A> and <A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para7.7">7.7</A>)
of my Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>) are described in
<I>Nirex Report 560</I> (the conclusions of this report comprise reference
(NRX/15/19).  This report has now been made available for reference at the
Greengarth Library of Nirex Science Programme reports, so meeting Dr Salmon's
concerns regarding the availability of details of the scoping studies. 
</P>
<P>6.60 The scoping studies described in <I>Nirex Report 560</I> (NRX/15/19)
considered the consequences for predicted post-closure radiological risk of
varying the performance (in effect, the permeability) of drift and shaft seals
for a repository in the PRZ at Sellafield which had incorporated the RCF shafts
as ventilation shafts.  The studies established that provided a seal
permeability 10<SUP>-14</SUP> m<SUP>2</SUP> could be achieved falling well
within the range of values expected for sandstones as shown in Table 2.2, page
29 of the textbook &quot;<I>Groundwater</I>&quot; by P A Freeze and J A Cherry
(FOE/4/5), then there was no significant difference in predicted risk compared
to the reference case in which the shafts and drifts were neglected.  It is
considered that this permeability should be achievable, although as recognised
by Dr Salmon at paragraph 4.25 of PE/FOE/5, the RCF has an important role in
demonstrating that seals of the appropriate quality can be emplaced.
</P>
<P>6.61 The scoping studies have provided us with confidence that the RCF
shafts should not compromise the repository safety case, but, as indicated at
<A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para7.1">paragraph 7.1</A> of my Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>),
this is ultimately a matter on which Nirex will have to satisfy the regulators
at the appropriate stage of an authorisation procedure under RSA 93.  That
safety case will be informed by tests in the RCF particularly in respect of the
nature of the excavation disturbance zone, the characteristics of the networks
of connected fractures, and the sealing tests.  There are no contradictions in
the evidence of the Nirex witnesses as claimed by Dr Salmon at paragraph 4.24 of
PE/FOE/5. We have not &quot;<I>prematurely dismissed the possibility of the RCF
damaging the repository PCPA</I>&quot; as claimed by Dr Salmon at paragraph 4.26
of PE/FOE/5.
</P>
<P> The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill
</P>
<P>6.62 In paragraph 5.32 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/7), Dr Allison sets
out a series of &quot;<I>areas of concern</I>&quot; which I shall deal with in
sequence below.  I shall also deal with the points he makes at paragraphs  5.34,
5.36 and 5.38.
</P>
<P>6.63 The concern that: &quot;<I>Reliance has been placed upon geochemical
conditioning  and sorption as the only contribution to be made by the backfill
to radionuclide retention</I>&quot; (PE/FOE/7, paragraph 5.32, point 1) is a
mis-leading generalisation which obscures the reductions in corrosion, gas
evolution and natural colloid stability that result from the use of a
cementitious backfill.  However, the result of the two contributions identified
by Dr Allison is exemplified by the chemical containment of the long-lived
radionuclide plutonium-239 given in my Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para5.25">paragraphs 5.25</A> and
<A HREF="nrx15.htm#Figure5.2">Figure 5.2</A>).  With the operation of the
backfill  just one part in two thousand of the initial disposal inventory of
plutonium-239 would be released from the repository near field.  The Nirex 
Reference Vault Backfill will afford a high level of radionuclide containment
and I conclude that Dr Allison's concern has no grounds.
</P>
<P>6.64 The concern that:  &quot;<I>it is assumed that homogeneous geochemical
conditions will be established within the backfill</I>&quot; (PE/FOE/7,
paragraph 5.32, point 2) is ill-founded since inhomogeneities in the repository
near field are considered explicitly in a section devoted to the subject in <I>Nirex
Report S/95/011</I> (Section 5, pages 53 to 58) [COR/529].
</P>
<P>6.65 The concern that:  &quot;<I>The use of permeable material for the
backfill would not impose significant delay to the saturation process and would
not make any contribution to the reduction of groundwater flow through the
repository</I>&quot; is  (PE/FOE/7, paragraph 5.32, point 3) not justified by
any evidence that Dr Allison presents with respect to the Nirex Reference Vault
Backfill.  The permeability of the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill is
approximately 10<SUP>-16</SUP> m<SUP>2</SUP>, which is not high in an absolute
sense.  A lower permeability material would not satisfy a number of the
requirements of the vault backfill given in my Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para5.18">paragraph 5.18</A>) that are important to the
eventual development of a safety case for a repository.  Furthermore, a
substantial  delay in saturation as proposed by Dr Allison would allow the
maintenance of aerobic conditions in the repository, which would be detrimental
to the corrosion-resistance of steel waste containers.  Therefore, I conclude
that Dr Allison would raise more concerns about repository safety if his
proposals were implemented.
</P>
<P>6.66 The concern that:  &quot;<I>Nirex has not identified any measures to
eliminate the interface flowpaths and peripheral flow paths</I>&quot; 
(PE/FOE/7, paragraph 5.32, point 4) does not recognise that the design concept
giving calculated risks below the risk target in <I>Nirex 95</I>, Volume 3
[COR/522] has an unfilled vault crown space.  I conclude on this basis that
elimination of the flow paths identified by Dr Allison is not a significant
issue in respect of  safety.
</P>
<P>6.67 The concern that: &quot;<I>cementitious materials are prone to shrink
rather than swell on setting</I>&quot; (PE/FOE/7, paragraph 4.32, point 5) is a
generalisation.  Information in <I>OECD/NEA International Stripa Project
1980-1992, Overview Volume III Engineered Barriers, January 1993 (</I>&quot;<I>the
Stripa Overview Report</I>&quot;) (pages 185 and 186) (NRX/15/8) shows that the
generalisation is not true of cementitious materials specified for sealing
purposes in contact with rock.
</P>
<P>6.68 The concern that there is:  &quot;<I>the lack of consideration of the
need to contribute to the support of the repository openings</I>&quot;
(PE/FOE/7, paragraph 4.32, point 6) is mis-directed  to consideration of the
Nirex Reference Vault Backfill. The support requirements are to be met by other
means as described in <I>Nirex Report  800</I> (pages 1.5 and 1.9) (FOE/5/16).
</P>
<P>6.69 The concern that:  &quot;<I>there is no clear evidence that the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill (which is not an analogue of a naturally-occurring
material) will retain its anticipated physical and chemical properties over the
timescales required.</I>&quot; (PE/FOE/7, paragraph 4.32, point 7) is not borne
out by the results of Nirex's long-term tests and natural analogue studies as
described in paragraph 6.32 of this Supplementary Proof of Evidence.
</P>
<P>6.70 The concern that:  &quot;<I>Nirex's patent for the Nirex Reference
Vault Backfill acknowledges that the method is contrary to the backfilling and
sealing concepts developed in other countries, where vault backfills are
intended to provide a physical as well as a geochemical barrier</I>.&quot;
(PE/FOE/7, paragraph 5.34) is ill-founded because it is not true of all other
countries, as described in paragraph 6.84 of this Supplementary Proof of
Evidence and it may be taken to imply that Nirex believes the intended results
will be obtained by others, whereas the Patent Application (page 2) (FOE/7/17)
notes:  
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> <I> &quot;However  in spite of proposals to backfill with impervious
material, there remain concerns with the possibility of groundwater ingress&quot;.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.71 The concerns that:  &quot;<I>It is clear that the Nirex Reference
Vault Backfill would make no contribution to the retention of the long-lived
radionuclides chlorine&#173;36 and iodine-129.  Enhanced physical  retention of
these radionuclides and/or research on other methods of sorption are therefore
warranted</I>.&quot;  (PE/FOE/7, paragraph 5.35) is not justified.  In
<A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para5.27">paragraph 5.27</A> of my Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>)
I state of chlorine-36 and iodine-129 that in experimental work to date they
have been found not to sorb strongly to cement phases.  However, taking this
into account in assessment studies, the risks contributed by the natural
discharge of these radionuclides are calculated to be below the risk target.
</P>
<P>6.72 The concern that:  &quot;<I>Furthermore, it is clear that there is a
relationship between the rate at which groundwater can flow through the
repository and the rate at which aggressive chemical species are replenished to
promote radionuclide release.  The Nirex proposals fail to recognise any
physical contribution which the vault backfill can make in this respect</I>.&quot;
 (PE/FOE/7, paragraph 5.36) is wrong.
</P>
<P> The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill is designed specifically to deal with
this issue, amongst others.  The nature of the &quot;<I>aggressive chemical
species</I>&quot; proposed by Dr Allison is unclear  but the major negatively
charged species in groundwater in the BVG will not complex significantly with
radionuclides provided that the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill buffers the water
at high pH conditions.
</P>
<P>6.73 The concern that:  &quot;...<I>there is no published evidence to
demonstrate that Nirex has validated its </I>[backfill]<I>model through
large-scale experiments or that it has completed a satisfactory programme of
research on alternatives</I>.&quot; (PE/FOE/7, paragraph 5.38) is wrong.  In
paragraph 6.27 of this Supplementary Proof I draw attention to the publication
of relevant elements of the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill Development
Programme. 
</P>
<P> Gas Generation in the Repository.
</P>
<P>6.74 In paragraph 5.39 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/7), Dr Allison
states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;<I>In evidence given by Dr Holmes and Dr Mellor [<A
HREF="nrx15.htm"><B>PE/NRX/15</B></A>,
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm"><B>PE/NRX/16</B></A>], the release of gases
(predominantly hydrogen and methane) is given as the reason why the vault
backfilling material should be relatively permeable.  It is suggested in their
evidence that if backfill permeability were to be low, gas overpressures could
be generated which could disrupt the backfill and the host rock, thus giving
rise to the concentrated release of gases and the creation of detrimental
groundwater pathways.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.75 Dr Allison's references are in error in this statement and it is not
clear from where he draws his material.  The correct position, as stated by Dr
Holmes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>) at
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para4.8">paragraph 4.8</A> is that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;<I>The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill  and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults</I>.&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Indeed, there is no link of the backfill permeability to disruption of the
host rock as proposed by Dr Allison.  The permeability to gas of the host rock
itself will determine its response to gas pressures. There is no reference to a
link to the concentrated release of gases.  Indeed, it is reasonable to envisage
that disruption of the rock mass could lead to a spreading of gas release rather
than a concentration.
</P>
<P>6.76 In paragraph 5.40 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/7), Dr Allison
states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;<I>In examining this proposition at a conceptual level, I contend
that it does not represent a well-engineered solution and that it presents Nirex
with fundamental difficulties which remain to be resolved</I>.&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> He then sets out a number of &quot;<I>issues</I>&quot; which he states are
&quot;<I>pertinent</I>&quot;, the importance of which I shall deal with in turn
below.  Some appear to derive from the mis-conception he states in paragraph
5.39 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/7).
</P>
<P>6.77 The issue that: &quot;<I>reduced permeability of the backfill would
reduce the flow of groundwater and hence would reduce the rate at which gas
generation is promoted; conversely, increased backfill permeability would
increase the rate  of gas generation</I>.&quot;  (PE/FOE/7, paragraph 5.40,
point 2) shows incorrect scientific reasoning.  In fact, the predominant
mechanism for the generation of gas is the corrosion of steels and resulting
release of hydrogen.  The corrosion and hence hydrogen gas generation is
dependent upon the presence of water at the corroding steel surface; as long as
the steel surface is in contact with a water-saturated medium, the corrosion
rate will be fixed for a given set of chemical conditions.  I am not aware of
any material that could be used as a vault backfill that would preclude the
contact between  the steel surface and water.  The Nirex Reference Vault
Backfill controls the chemical environment in the repository near field so that
corrosion is independent of the concentrations of salts dissolved in the
groundwaters in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield.  The use of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill controls the rate of corrosion of carbon steels in BVG
groundwater at a level some two orders of magnitude lower than for the rates
observed at neutral pH.  The permeability has been selected such that these
chemical conditions will be present reliably at the steel surfaces.  Therefore,
I conclude that the approach adopted by Nirex will result in a lower rate of gas
generation  than is likely to be obtained by the approach proposed by Dr
Allison.
</P>
<P>6.78 The issue that: &quot;<I>the creation of a highly permeable pathway
for gas release within the vault backfill would have significant potential  to
create groundwater pathways in the rock due to the resultant interconnection of
rock fractures</I>&quot;  (PE/FOE/7, paragraph 5.40, point 3) is not justified
by any scientific basis presented by Dr Allison or that I can identify
independently.  The creation of groundwater pathways would be dependent upon the
response of the rock mass to gas pressures and not upon transport processes
within the backfill which I discuss in the following paragraphs.
</P>
<P>6.79 The issue that:  &quot;<I>the pressure gradient which could drive any
generated gas outwards depends on the size of the excavation, the amount of
waste placed within it, and the relative permeabilities of the backfill and the
surrounding rock</I>&quot;  (PE/FOE/7, paragraph 5.40, point 4) has no
scientific basis of which I am aware.  Dr Allison does not define the points
between which the gradient, to which he refers, applies.  I assume that he is
referring to a pressure difference between the repository vault and hydrostatic
pressure at the repository depth.  When considering a relative overpressure
within the repository vault, the maximum value of this overpressure will be
determined by the ease with which gas can escape into the surrounding rock and
not by any of the factors listed by Dr Allison.  This is explained in <I>Nirex
Report S/94/003</I> (pages 13 to 17) [COR/509] which shows that for calculations
carried out on an initially unsaturated repository, the repository pressure does
not rise above the hydrostatic pressure at the repository depth.
</P>
<P>6.80 The issue that:  &quot;<I>the generation of a gas overpressure could
serve to prevent the ingress of groundwater</I>&quot; (PE/FOE/7, paragraph 5.40,
point 7) is rejected in paragraph 6.26 of this Supplementary Proof of Evidence.
</P>
<P>6.81 Summarising his identification of &quot;<I>pertinent issues</I>&quot;
in paragraph 5.41 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/7), Dr Allison states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;<I>Collectively, the above points present a paradox whereby the
Nirex proposals for promoting the release of gas from the backfilled repository
would also serve to promote the rate of gas generation and the creation of
groundwater pathways for radionuclide migration</I>&quot;.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> I present evidence in paragraphs 6.77 to 6.80, in dealing with these
issues, to show that there is no &quot;<I>paradox</I>&quot;.  The Nirex
repository concept reduces the rates of gas generation and does not &quot;<I>promote</I>&quot;
them and &quot;<I>the creation of</I> <I>groundwater pathways</I>&quot; is an
unsupported assertion by Dr Allison.
</P>
<P>6.82 Dr Allison continues in  paragraph 5.41 of his Proof of Evidence
(PE/FOE/7):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;<I>Furthermore, it would appear that the introduction of a
lime-rich backfill (in the form of the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill) would
serve to promote the generation of additional gases (predominantly carbon
dioxide) from the backfill itself</I>.&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Dr Allison is wrong in his assertion that gas generation would be &quot;<I>promoted</I>&quot;.
 &quot;<I>Lime water</I>&quot; (which has a composition similar to cement
porewater) extracts carbon dioxide from the gas phase.  In correcting this
erroneous statement I draw attention to the removal of carbon dioxide gas
generated from the wastes through reaction with the Nirex Reference Vault
Backfill.  The carbon dioxide would incorporate a part of the carbon-14
radionuclide inventory which would therefore be contained in the repository.</P>
<P>6.83 In  paragraph 5.42 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/7), Dr Allison
states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;<I>In effect, the geochemical model associated with the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill concept appears to ignore many factors associated with
the physicochemical environment that would arise within the repository</I>.&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> This appears to be an unsubstantiated assertion but importantly it fails to
recognise that the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill is designed to establish the
physico-chemical &quot;environment&quot; in the near field of the repository,
and that this position is supported by a large body of research most recently
summarised in <I>Nirex Report S/95/011</I> [COR/529] and many of the 112
documents cited therein.
</P>
<P>6.84 Dr Allison continues in paragraph 5.42 of his Proof of Evidence
(PE/FOE/7):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;<I>As previously noted, the concept of a permeable backfill is also
contrary to the principles generally embodied in backfilling and sealing
concepts which are being developed  by other countries</I>.&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In <I>Gas Generation and Release from Radioactive Waste Repositories,
Proceedings of a Workshop organised by NEA in co-operation with ANDRA,
Aix-en-Province, 23-26 September 1991</I> [NRX/15/9] there are the following
statements:
</P>
<P>  Concerning the operational Swedish Final Repository for Radioactive Waste
(SFR) on page 84:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>   &quot;<I>The waste packages emplaced in the compartments will be

<P>  Concerning the now-operational VLJ Repository in Finland on page 90:

<P> Dr Allison's claim to &quot;<I>have monitored closely the development of
international research programmes in this field</I>&quot;  (PE/FOE/7, paragraph
1.6) and presumably therefore to speak with authority does not appear to be
supported by this contradiction of his statement on backfilling and sealing
concepts which are being developed by other countries.
</P>
<P>6.85 Overall, therefore, my conclusion on the points made by Dr Allison in
relation to the issues he identifies in relation to gas generation and migration
are:

<P> Sealing &quot;<I>Peripheral Areas</I>&quot; of the Repository 
</P>
<P>6.86 In paragraph 5.50 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/7), Dr Allison
refers to two areas of concern in relation to Nirex's proposals for rock
grouting.
</P>
<P>6.87 The first concern is:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;<I>grouting materials used to achieve a high degree of penetration
into the finer rock fissures are typically non-particulate grouts of a chemical
formulation which seldom have a natural analogue - their longevity is therefore
open to question</I>.&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> This is in direct contradiction of the statement in <I>International
Stripa Project  Overview Report</I> (pages 198 and 199)  [NRX/15/8]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;<I>Archaeological and geological analogues examined gave no
indication that, if used appropriately, the clay - and cement-based sealants
would not persist  in repository settings.  The results of laboratory tests and
geochemical modelling coupled with experiments were consistent with this
finding.  The processing involved with the production of bentonites and cements
render the materials inherently thermodynamically unstable.  However, under the
low hydraulic gradients expected in the groundwater in a sealed repository site,
chemical transformation of the minerals in the groundwater in a sealed
repository site, chemical transformation of the minerals in the sealants can be
predicted, reasonable, to extend over tens of thousands of years to millions of
years. The predicted period depends on the porosity of the as-placed materials
and the ionic concentrations in the groundwater.  Understanding of the materials
and models for effecting the longevity calculations have been developed.  For
bentonite, longevity is primary controlled by the diffusion of K<SUP>+</SUP> in
the clay.  The extremely low hydraulic conductivity of  high-performance
cement-based materials (k&lt;10<SUP>-14</SUP> m/s) controls their longevity</I>.&quot;

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.88 The second concern in paragraph 5.50 of Dr Allison's Proof of Evidence
(PE/FOE/7) is:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;<I>grouting operations are highly operator-dependent, and it is not
possible to verify the results achieved other than by intrusive methods of
testing - thus, successful tests in the RCF will not provide full assurance that
grouting under different conditions will yield comparable results</I>&quot;.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> This &quot;<I>concern</I>&quot; about different conditions is intended to
be met by the RCF where the conditions are those that would pertain in a
repository that might subsequently be developed in the PRZ.  In my Proof of
Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, <A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para6.68">paragraphs 6.68</A>
and 6.69) referring to sealing, I state:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;<I>The achievement of the required properties relates strongly to
the interaction between the materials and the precise geological setting
specific to the site and location ..... The requirement is that this work should
be carried out in representative geological settings, and in particular in the
BVG at depth where the levels of in situ stress and rock quality will be
appropriate</I>.&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.89 In paragraph  5.51 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/7),  Dr Allison
asserts that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;...<I>sole reliance on grouting methods to rectify damage to the
peripheral rock mass is inadequate in a repository context.  Other techniques,
such as the use of cut-off collars, comprising high-integrity seals constructed
in carefully excavated enlargements are needed to interrupt the peripheral flow
zone at strategic locations[FOE/7/8].  Such methods are amenable to verification
as the seal placement operations are direct and not remote, as in the case of
grouting [FOE/7/3]</I>&quot;.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> I agree that the use of &quot;<I>cut-off collars</I>&quot; has the merits
described by Dr Allison.  Such seal designs are under active consideration by
Nirex.
</P>
<P>Special Seals in the Repository
</P>
<P>6.90 At paragraph 5.55 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/7), Dr Allison
states that:
</P>
<P>  &quot;<I>The materials and concepts for creating such [special and
composite] sealing systems are reported in the international literature
[FOE/7/7].  Yet the Nirex proposals for the RCF do not indicate what progress
has been made in evaluating these sealing systems and provide no information 
about validation tests to be performed either within the RCF or elsewhere before
submitting a planning application for a final repository</I>.&quot;
</P>
<P> I agree that the published proposals for the RCF give little indication of
our progress in evaluating sealing systems.  Our current work programme is not
scheduled to reach any firm conclusions until important geotechnical information
is synthesised in 1996.  However, I do not agree that no information about
validation tests has been provided since such information can be found in Dr
Mellor's Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/16</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#Para5.29">paragraphs 5.29</A> to 5.34).
</P>
<P> Quality Assurance of Waste Emplacement and Backfilling
</P>
<P>6.91 In Section 6 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/7), Dr Allison asserts
that inadequate attention is being applied to quality assurance aspects of waste
emplacement and backfilling operations and he develops a thesis of what he calls
&quot;<I>best practical methods&quot;</I>.</P>
<P>6.92 As I noted in paragraph 6.53 of this Supplementary Proof of Evidence,
this approach does not seem consistent with the best practicable means
promulgated by the regulatory authorities, where the means are linked to the
radiological protection to be afforded. 
</P>
<P>6.93 At paragraph 6.11 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/7), Dr Allison
states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;<I>At Sellafield it is appropriate that particularly high standards
(quality objectives) should be established for the backfilling and sealing
system to maximise its contribution to safety</I>&quot;. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Again, as I note in paragraph 6.53 respectively of this Supplementary Proof
there is no basis for this thesis which appears to be a contradiction of the
regulatory position as founded on radiological protection principles.
</P>
<P>6.94 The main conclusions drawn from this seemingly incorrect thesis are
that an iterative programme including large-scale tests should be conducted
prior to carrying out work in the RCF (paragraphs 6.11, 6.17 and 6.20).  I have
shown  that such a process has been followed to date.  There is no reason that
the process will not be followed in the future period of several years leading
up to validation testing in the RCF.
</P>
<P><B> Summary
</B>
</P>
<P>6.95 In summary, I conclude that the concerns raised by Dr Allison, Dr
Wogelius and Dr Salmon in respect of the performance of the Nirex repository
concept are not well founded.  I have presented further evidence to establish
that the engineered barriers of a repository at Sellafield should perform
consistently with meeting regulatory requirements for the post-closure
performance of a repository.  I have shown that issues identified by the
Objectors, have been, or will be addressed in the Nirex Science Programme.  The
RCF has an essential role in the forward Programme.</P>
<P><B>7. <A NAME="EFFECT">EFFECT OF GEOCHEMISTRY ON RADIONUCLIDE TRANSPORT</A>
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1 Sections 13 and 14 of Dr Haszeldine's Proof of Evidence (PE/GNP/3) and
Sections 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of Dr Wogelius' Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8) raise
points concerning the effect of geochemistry on radionuclide transport.  These
points are dealt with in this Section of my Supplementary Proof of Evidence.
</P>
<P>7.2 The points can be grouped within four topics:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the presence and effect of oxidising or reducing conditions in groundwater
(PE/GNP/3, Sections 13 and 14);

</LI></UL>
<P> These four topics are dealt with separately in this Section. First, I give
a breakdown of the major issues within each topic and an outline of my response

Groundwater - Summary of Points Raised 
</B>
</P>
<P>7.3 In paragraph 13.1 of his Proof of Evidence (and elsewhere in Section 13
of his Proof of Evidence), Dr Haszeldine (PE/GNP/3) asserts that:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD>the presence of hematite in the rocks of the Sellafield region indicates
oxidising conditions at depth, which are deleterious to repository performance.
Nirex's knowledge of the natural oxidation state of groundwater in the PRZ rests
upon the assumption that the mineral pyrite geochemically controls (buffers) the
groundwater redox state (Eh<SUB> </SUB>: a measure of the chemical oxidising
potential of a solution, which can influence which ions are stable in that
solution); and
</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>ii.</TD>
<TD> the oxidation state of the deep geological environment  is important
because it controls the solubility of uranium in the repository and because it
may lead to the corrosion of the steel waste containers (a point also made by Dr
Wogelius in paragraphs 5.4 to 5.6 of his Proof of Evidence, PE/FOE/8).
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>7.4 My detailed response to these points is given in paragraphs 7.11 to 7.39
of this Supplementary Proof. In summary, my response is:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD>Dr Haszeldine has misunderstood, or is unaware of, the fundamental
thermodynamic data defining the geochemical stability field of hematite and has,
consequently, reached an erroneous conclusion. Nirex has demonstrated the
presence of both hematite and pyrite, as well as other iron-rich minerals, in
the PRZ.  The in situ redox state is  buffered by a combination of these
minerals and dissolved sulphate in the groundwaters at a reducing value of Eh of
about -230 mV (page 33, paragraphs 6.7 to 6.9)[COR/525]. It is the <B>presence</B>
of a mineral, not the <B>amount</B> (as Dr Haszeldine implies), that is
important in establishing in situ geochemical equilibria.
</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>ii.</TD>
<TD>n any event, Dr Haszeldine has misunderstood the role of groundwater
flowing into the repository (i.e. the near field) in controlling the release of
uranium from the repository.  The redox conditions in the repository are
controlled by the components of the engineered structure (i.e. the waste and the
steel containers).  Geochemical modelling (<I>Nirex Report NSS/R398 &quot;Development
of a Methodology for Modelling the Redox Chemistry and Predicting the Redox
Potential of the Near Field of a &quot;Cementitious Radioactive Waste Repository&quot;</I>,
page 19, NRX/15/10) has shown that the  redox conditions in the near field are
not dependent on the redox conditions of the inflowing groundwaters for all
groundwaters with redox potentials  between  +400 mV and -400 mV.  This range
encompasses the values considered realistic by Nirex as well as the range
considered plausible by Dr Haszeldine.  </TD></TR></TABLE>

<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">

<TD WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD>Nirex has undertaken an extensive research programme since the 1980's to
identify the sources and effects of organic materials in the repository on the
performance of the near field.  The Nirex programme is a world leader in this
field.  This programme has identified that organic degradation products of
cellulose can, indeed, have a significant effect in reducing radionuclide
sorption and increasing radionuclide solubility.  However, this effect is being
taken into account by Nirex in its performance assessments. It has also been
shown that naturally-occurring  humic acids cited by Dr Wogelius, will not be
mobile in a cementitious near field, <I>Nirex Report S/95/011</I> (page
38)[COR/529].
</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>ii.</TD>
<TD>Nirex recognises that there are still uncertainties about the potential
role of colloidal material derived from the cementitious barriers in
transporting radionuclides. However, the nature and behaviour of colloids must
meet a number of criteria before they can be demonstrated to affect radionuclide
transport. There is a growing body of evidence from natural analogue and other
studies that colloid transport will not be a major contributor to radionuclide
releases from a repository, but it is essential to test some of the indications
by a combination of laboratory work and experiments and observations in the RCF.</TD></TR>

<TD></TD>

<TD>Dr Wogelius quotes the state of knowledge in this area in 1992 (review
cited as FOE/8/12) and has consequently not recognised the amount of new work
that has been carried out on the effects of ionic strength and temperature. In
addition, he overestimates the importance of the effect of ionic strength, as
the radionuclides to which he refers are known not to complex strongly with
chloride or sulphate, principal anionic constituents of the Sellafield
groundwaters.

experiments on rocks which already exhibit varying degrees and mechanisms of
alteration and ageing which reflect the past history of the site.  Dr Wogelius'
comments on surface chemistry changes, whilst geologically interesting, are not
of direct significance in safety assessment as the potential impacts are
accounted for by a combination of conservative assumptions and adequate ranges

results suggest that, in general, porosity of the rock will reduce as a result
of interaction with the high pH fluids.  In addition, experimental results

<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD>The data that are required in the areas of interest to Dr Wogelius would,
indeed, be obtained largely from laboratory experiments, albeit using
well-characterised geological samples of rock and groundwater taken from the
Sellafield site. The highest quality samples of some materials can only be
obtained from the RCF. The Nirex laboratory programme has been in progress for
many years already. Nirex believes that it is now essential to evaluate some of
the processes in situ, in the RCF.</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>ii.</TD>
<TD>Nirex has an integrated programme of sorption measurements and supporting
statistical and conceptual sorption modelling work which, together, use a
variety of complementary approaches for deriving sorption data. This allows the
incorporation of a simple, yet realistic conservative treatment of sorption into
safety assessment work. Dr Wogelius' attribution of errors seems to arise from
an inappropriate comparison of databases.</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>iii.</TD>
<TD> I disagree that there are deficiencies in the RCF experimental programme.
Dr Wogelius is concerned about issues such as  the spatial variability of the
system, uncertainties in interpretation of the results and working in a
perturbed environment. One of the main aims of the RCF programme is to test
predictions of models which address precisely these issues. Dr Wogelius has
underestimated the value of in situ experiments, in particular their ability to
address processes and systems which are simply inaccessible in laboratory
studies. They serve an essential role in the validation process which I discuss
in detail in Section 10 of this Supplementary Proof. Whilst agreeing that
timescales are limited, this has been taken into account in preparing an
integrated programme of field, laboratory and natural analogue studies of
geochemical processes. Each has its own role to play. The issue of contamination
will not be a problem, as discussed in <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14s1.htm#Para10.39">paragraph
10.39ii.</A> of Dr Chaplow's Supplementary Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14/S1</B>).</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P> <B>The Presence and Effect of Oxidising or Reducing Conditions in
Groundwater 
</B>
</P>
<P><B> </B>Point i: Hematite and  the Oxidation State of the Groundwater 
</P>
<P>7.11 <B>The Significance of Hematite:</B> Dr Haszeldine's thesis throughout
Section 13 of his Proof is that the presence of hematite indicates oxidising
conditions.  In paragraph 14.6 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/GNP/3), Dr
Haszeldine notes with respect to the &quot;<I>geochemical parameter Eh</I>&quot;:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Oxidising Eh has positive values, reducing Eh has negative values.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The standard geochemical text book, &quot;<I>Solutions, Minerals and
Equilibria</I>&quot; by Garrels and Christ, published by Freeman, Cooper and
Company, 1965 [NRX/15/11] shows, on Figure 7.23 (page 228), which is redrawn as
Figure 7.1 of this Supplementary Proof, that hematite can be in equilibrium with
'reducing conditions' (adopting the convention of Dr Haszeldine) when the pH of
the groundwater is at a pH greater than 6.2,  a condition that is always met by
groundwater samples taken from the BVG, as shown in <I>Nirex Report NSS/R397,
Groundwater Compositions for The Borrowdale Volcanic Group, Boreholes 2, 4 and
RCF3, Sellafield, Evaluated Using Thermodynamic Modelling</I>, 1995 (Tables 2, 9
and 13, pages 14, 21 and 25) [NRX/15/12].  
</P>
<P>7.12 Therefore, I conclude that Dr Haszeldine is incorrect in his assertion
that the presence of hematite indicates oxidising conditions in the BVG; it can
also exist in a stable state in reducing conditions. The following paragraphs
show how a proper evaluation of the minerals present in the PRZ should be used
to develop a thermodynamically correct understanding of in situ redox
conditions.
</P>
<P>7.13 <B>Evidence on the oxidation state of the groundwater: </B>In addition
to the incorrect arguments based on the presence of hematite<B>,
</B>Dr Haszeldine makes two further claims about evidence for the oxidation
state of the groundwater:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>that Nirex relies on assumptions that are inconsistent with the observed
mineralogy of the PRZ; and
</LI>
<LI>that the results of his own modelling indicate that oxidising waters will
exist in the PRZ.
</LI></UL>
<P>I deal with these below in paragraphs 7.14 to 7.22 and 7.23 to 7.24,
respectively of this Supplementary Proof.
</P>
<P>7.14 Dr Haszeldine states (PE/GNP/3, paragraph 13.1) that :
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex assume that the mineral pyrite (iron pyrites FeS<SUB>2</SUB>)
geochemically controls (buffers) the groundwater Eh system</I>&quot;<I>. 
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.15 This is a selective view of the information presented in
<I>Nirex Report S/95/008</I> [COR/525], which states (page 33, paragraph 6.8) :
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>These results are reasonably consistent with Eh buffering by
equilibria involving ferroan carbonate, pyrite and hematite.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and (page 35, paragraph 6.23) :
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The in-situ redox conditions in the groundwaters within the
Potential Repository Zone are uncertain, but the sulphur system with a
sulphate-pyrite-hematite buffer seems closest to representing in-situ redox
conditions, giving a calculated Eh of -232 mV.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.16 Thus, the true position is that Nirex has taken a proper,
thermodynamically correct geochemical approach to evaluating the redox state of
the system, based on knowledge of the mineralogy and hydrochemistry of the
rock/groundwater system.  
</P>
<P>7.17 Dr Haszeldine's misunderstanding of the geochemistry of the system is
further illustrated at paragraph 13.2 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/GNP/3) where
he states, of the visibly reddened parts of the BVG core :
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>It is very important to note that no sulphides are recorded in
such samples and so I interpret these to have been removed.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.18 Dr Haszeldine does not give any specific reference for this claim.
Instead he gives only a very general quote that &quot;<I>Nirex have made
detailed examinations of the mineralogy of the bulk BVG rock</I>&quot;
(PE/GNP/3, paragraph 13.2).  The interpretation is incorrect as pyrite is
ubiquitous in fractures in the BVG, even though the quantities are often small.
</P>
<P>7.19 Dr Haszeldine himself, in the following paragraph (PE/GNP/3, paragraph
13.3) cites <I>Nirex Report S/95/006</I> [COR/523] and notes the presence of &quot;<I>iron
pyrites or other metallic sulphides</I>&quot;.  He then goes on to discount
these as they &quot;<I>form less than 1% present by volume</I>&quot;.  This
suggests that Dr Haszeldine does not understand fully the geochemical
equilibrium established in this system.  The important fact for establishing the
geochemical redox control (buffer) is the presence of iron sulphide phases.  The
amount of mineral is only significant in determining how the buffer will respond
if the redox conditions in the system are disturbed; that is, if the redox of
the system is perturbed such that more oxidised iron is present in the
groundwater, pyrite will dissolve to re-establish the original balance.
</P>
<P>7.20 Dr Haszeldine makes the same mistake in paragraph 13.6 of his Proof of
Evidence (PE/GNP/3), in which he discusses mineralogy in flowing zones in the
PRZ.  Here he says &quot;<I>pyrite and siderite are mentioned as subordinate
minerals, but no data on mineral abundances or locations are given</I>&quot;<I>.</I>
 He fails to note that these samples show the presence of iron sulphide on the
surface of fractures in contact with present-day groundwater. 
</P>
<P>7.21 As noted in paragraph 7.11 of this Supplementary Proof, even in the
absence of sulphide minerals, the groundwaters need not be oxidising, as the
hematite stability field extends to negative Eh values in the pH range found in
BVG waters.
</P>
<P>7.22 I conclude, from the discussion in paragraphs 7.11 to 7.21 of this
Supplementary Proof, that Dr Haszeldine's statement at paragraph 13.18 of his
Proof of Evidence (PE/GNP/3):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>My</I> <I>basic message here is that no other piece of the
British landmass contains so much geological evidence of oxidised groundwater
chemistry.  This evidence is the alteration of BVG rock and vein minerals to
hematite, as well as the existence of Britain's largest iron oxide ore deposit. 
There<B> </B>are only minimal quantities of pyrite or other sulphides, even in
the minerals lining the youngest fractures.  The small quantities of such
sulphides make it difficult to envisage a geochemically reducing water in<B></B>the
past or today.  This may be one of most difficult parts of the UK in which</I>
<I>to build a Repository, which requires the maintenance of a geochemically
reducing groundwater for time periods which are very long even by geological
standards.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> is without foundation because his evaluation of the geochemistry of the
Sellafield region is fundamentally flawed. Nirex already has the requisite level
of understanding of redox conditions at the site for the present level of
investigations and Dr Haszeldine's requirement:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>to check these assertions of in-situ oxidising groundwater by
direct experiment before disturbing the waters by excavating an RCF</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> is, thus, not only difficult to understand (there is no description of what
is meant by 'experiments') but takes no account of the methodology used by Nirex
to evaluate redox conditions or the results of the existing Nirex evaluation of
the reducing potential of the repository near field (see paragraph 7.27 of this
Supplementary Proof). 
</P>
<P>7.23 In paragraphs 14.16 to 14.22 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/GNP/3), Dr
Haszeldine describes geochemical modelling work undertaken at Glasgow
University. I am unable to comment on the validity of the approach without more
detail, but there are two conclusions that I find important in paragraph 14.22:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In summary, I consider that the PRZ groundwater may be oxidising,
in contrast to the simulations of Nirex</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and in paragraph 14.19:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Implicitly, tiny amounts of pyrite can co-exist with a fluid
ranging from Eh +50 to -258 mV and need not be a mineral dominating and
controlling Eh in the real water.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.24 In this summary of his findings, Dr Haszeldine is providing evidence
that the groundwater could indeed be reducing and that the most oxidising Eh
consistent with his approach is +50 mV.  In a rigorous study of the redox
chemistry of the repository engineered barriers, <I>Nirex Report NSS/R398</I>
(figure 2)<I></I>[NRX/15/10], showed that groundwater at this Eh flowing into
the repository near field would be buffered to the reducing potential of -440 mV
by the repository contents (see also paragraph 7.27 of this Supplementary
Proof). I therefore conclude that Dr Haszeldine's conclusions about the
oxidising nature of the repository volume are wrong. </P>
<P><B> </B>Point ii: The Importance of Oxidising Conditions
</P>
<P>7.25 Dr Haszeldine (PE/GNP/3) claims that oxidising conditions within the
BVG groundwater will cause oxidising conditions to become established in the
repository (paragraph 13.13, page 44).  He goes on to state that there are two
adverse consequences of oxidising conditions in the repository from the point of
view of repository performance:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>enhanced solubility of uranium (paragraph 13.15); and
</LI>
<LI>oxidation of the steel waste containers  (paragraph 14.25).
</LI></UL>
<P>7.26 Dr Wogelius notes the importance of maintaining reducing conditions in
the repository at paragraphs 5.4 and 5.6 respectively of his Proof of Evidence
(PE/FOE/8) and, at paragraph 5.7, he too addresses the issue of container
corrosion, although from a somewhat different viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>7.27 Before addressing the specific points above, I wish to refute the
suggestion made by Dr Haszeldine in Section 14 of his Proof (PE/GNP/3), that the
hydrochemistry of the groundwater in the BVG can  affect the redox conditions
that will  be established in the repository. The redox conditions in the
repository are controlled by the components of the engineered structure (i.e.
the waste and the steel containers).  The redox conditions in the near field are
reducing, and the Eh is predicted to be approximately -440 mV,<I> Nirex Report
NSS/R398</I> (page 19) [NRX/15/10].  This value is not dependent on the redox
conditions in the surrounding geosphere for inflowing groundwaters with redox
potentials lying in the range between  +400 V and -400 mV.  This range
encompasses the values considered realistic by Nirex as well as the range
considered plausible by Dr Haszeldine.  Therefore, a detailed hydrochemical
understanding of the undisturbed BVG groundwaters is of limited relevance to the
repository Safety Case (see also Dr Chaplow's Supplementary Proof of Evidence at
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14s1.htm#Para10.30">paragraph 10.30</A>, <B>PE/NRX/14/S1</B>).
 The argument developed by Dr Haszeldine in Section 13 and 14 of his Proof of
Evidence (PE/GNP/3) is misconceived. 
</P>
<P>7.28 <B>The Oxidation State of Uranium in the Repository: </B>At paragraph
13.15 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/GNP/3), Dr Haszeldine states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>..it is also important to maintain Uranium in its reduced state of
U<SUP>4+</SUP> which is less soluble in water than U<SUP>6+</SUP>.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.29 I would agree that uranium (IV) [U<SUP>4+ </SUP>in the notation of the
above quotation] is generally less soluble than uranium (VI).  At high pH in the
repository near field, even under reducing conditions, the predicted oxidation
state of uranium is a mixture of U(IV) and U(VI).  The values of uranium
solubility in the near field used in the Nirex performance assessment reflect
this mix of oxidation states.  Furthermore, I note that the uranium solubilities
calculated by Dr Haszeldine range from 8 10<SUP>-12</SUP> M to 6.5 10<SUP>-8</SUP>
M (PE/GNP/3, paragraphs 14.21 to 14.24).  It is assumed in the performance
assessment reported in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522] that the solubility for
uranium in the repository lies in the range 1 10<SUP>-8</SUP> M to 1 10<SUP>-2</SUP>
M,  with a central value of 3 10<SUP>-6</SUP> M  (<I>Nirex 95</I>, Volume 3,
Table 6.6, page 6.27) [COR/522], where the solubilities are given in units of
mol m<SUP>-3</SUP>, equivalent to 1 10<SUP>3</SUP>M.  Thus, the uranium
solubilities assumed by Nirex are always significantly higher than those
calculated by Dr Haszeldine, and still produce calculations of risk below the
target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP> per annum to an individual (see
<A HREF="nrx15.htm#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A> of my Proof of Evidence, <B>PE/NRX/15</B>).

</P>
<P>7.30 <B>The Retardation of Uranium in the Geosphere: </B>In paragraph 13.17
of his Proof of Evidence (PE/GNP/3), Dr Haszeldine states: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>A possibility still exists that sorption of Uranium may occur
onto these iron oxides lining the fractures, and that this may retard Uranium
moving with the groundwater towards the surface.  Although such effects are
regarded as minor, this is speculation, as I know of no accepted values to
enable these to be quantitatively evaluated [e.g. COR/605 page l38].  Thus, I
doubt that the BVG rocks surrounding an engineered Repository will be adequate
to contain any leakage of Uranium from a Repository.  Consequently any leakage
of Uranium from an engineered Repository may have an unhindered path towards the
surface. Further work is still needed here, in particular the simulation of
fluid flow through these rocks, coupled to the geochemical evolution of such a
fluid.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.31 In dismissing sorption of uranium in the geosphere, Dr Haszeldine
ignores the extensive geochemical and radioactive waste research on this
subject. Indeed, Dr Haszeldine cites, in his support,
<I>The Royal Society Study Group Report</I> (page 138) [COR/605] even though
that Report does not substantiate the statement. I also note that there is a
difference  in interpretation of the importance of sorption in the geosphere
between Drs Haszeldine and Wogelius.  Whilst Dr Haszeldine states that evidence
for sorption of uranium is &quot;<I>speculation</I>&quot; (PE/GNP/3, paragraph
13.17), Dr Wogelius states that &quot;<I>Some minerals are extremely good at
adsorbing radionuclides</I>&quot; (PE/FOE/8, paragraph 6.2).  Reference FOE/8/20
 includes an extensive compilation of international studies of sorption relevant
to radioactive waste disposal.  Nirex has undertaken an extensive research
programme to measure sorption of uranium and other actinides onto rocks from the
Sellafield site (e.g. FOE/8/13). The results have been used in the derivation of
sorption values used in the recent Nirex assessment. 
</P>
<P>7.32 I treat the subject of sorption in more depth in paragraphs 7.71 to
7.87 of this Supplementary Proof.
</P>
<P>7.33 At paragraph 13.13 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/GNP/3), Dr Haszeldine
asserts that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>If oxidising conditions in groundwater remain similar today, then
this same chemical buffer will easily be able to oxidise the few hundred tons of
steel barrels proposed by Nirex to maintain their engineered Repository at<B></B>reducing
E<SUB>h</SUB>.  This will turn the steel to hematite (rust), and the Repository
will become oxidising.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.34 This argument is flawed for several reasons:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>it is geochemically flawed because the assumption concerning oxidising
conditions is incorrect (as noted in paragraph 7.27 of this Supplementary
Proof);
</LI>
<LI>it is chemically flawed as it assumes that the only reaction between the
steel containers and the groundwater is a thermodynamic one.  The
electrochemical reactions that control the corrosion of the steel are not
mentioned; and
</LI>
<LI>this statement also incorrectly gives the mass of iron that would be
present in the repository, underestimating it by three orders of magnitude. <I>Nirex
Report NSS/R398 </I>&quot;<I>Development of a Methodology for Modelling the
Redox Chemistry and Predicting the Redox Potential of the Near Field of a
</I>&quot;<I>Cementitious Radioactive Waste Repository</I>&quot; (Appendix 4
(e), page A4.5) [NRX/15/10] shows the amount for the inventory at that time to
be 2.89 x 10<SUP>9</SUP> moles, which equates to more than 100,000 tons.
</LI></UL>
<P>7.35 I thus conclude that Dr Haszeldine's statement about the ease with
which the repository volume would be oxidised is incorrect. The mass of iron
present in the repository, combined with the low calculated groundwater Eh, will
ensure that reducing conditions are maintained in the system. 
</P>
<P>7.36 In paragraph 5.7 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8, page 17), Dr
Wogelius states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;<I>The corrosion (oxidation) rate of ion is heavily dependent on
the concentration of the hydroxide iron because the oxidation rate of iron
depends on the hydroxide concentration raised to the second power. Thus if
oxidising conditions do occur, the corrosion rates of the primary waste drums 
will be  increased dramatically over currently assumed corrosion rates</I>&quot;<I>.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.37 I am unaware of the cited dependence of the oxidation rate of iron on
the hydroxide concentration and this is not substantiated.  This contradicts the
well-established role of the alkalinity in concrete which affords corrosion
protection to steel reinforcing bars against atmospheric oxygen and water.
</P>
<P>7.38 Corrosion rates of the steels used to fabricate waste containers have
been measured, not assumed.  Carbon and stainless steels were placed in contact
with cement pore water under both oxidising (aerobic) and reducing (anaerobic)
chemical conditions.  The results are reported in <I>Nirex Science Report
S/95/011</I> (Sub-Section 2.2.1, page 18) [COR/529]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>The most recent estimates for the rates of aerobic corrosion of
carbon steel under alkaline conditions are 0.08<FONT FACE="Symbol">m</FONT>m
per year at 30&#176;C and 1.6<FONT FACE="Symbol">m</FONT>m per year at 80&#176;C.
 For stainless steel, the estimated corrosion rates at these two temperatures
are 0.03<FONT FACE="Symbol">m</FONT>m per year and 0.5<FONT FACE="Symbol">m</FONT>m
per year respectively.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The symbol <FONT FACE="Symbol">m</FONT>m represents the micron unit of
measure - one thousandth of a millimetre.
</P>
<P>7.39 I conclude that the corrosion protection provided by the alkalinity
will dominate the corrosion behaviour of the steel containers and that these
corrosion rates are well-established. This was described at

<P><B> </B>Point i: The Role and Effects of Organic Chemicals
</P>
<P>7.40 In paragraphs 5.12 to 5.22 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8), Dr
Wogelius discusses the role of organic chemicals without reference to<I> Nirex
Report S/95/011</I> [COR/529].  This report was made available to Friends of the
Earth in July 1995. Organic chemicals are dealt with extensively in pages 33 to
52 of the report. Paragraphs 7.41 to 7.51 of this Supplementary Proof  address
Dr Wogelius' concerns about:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>naturally occurring organic compounds; and
</LI>
<LI>the presence and impact of organic degradation products.
</LI></UL>
<P>Naturally Occurring Organic Compounds
</P>
<P>7.41 At paragraph 5.12 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8), Dr Wogelius
states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>The presence of organic materials that are able to form stable
complexes with radionuclides can be the most important feature of a geochemical
system and can result in completely different behaviour from that expected from
consideration of inorganic reactions alone.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.42 At paragraph 5.17, he states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>These results are important because the strontium in the wastes
is a long-lived radionuclide </I>[sic: it is not long lived, having a half life
of only 29 years] <I>and because europium is a reasonable chemical proxy for
the radionuclides americium and plutonium.  Given the potential for reactions
with organic acids to significantly influence the concentration of radionuclides
in the groundwater, research prepared for the HMIP has concluded that there is a
</I>&quot;<I>pressing need</I>&quot;<I> for experiments to quantify the
importance of this effect. (Higgo 1992)[FOE/8/8].</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.43 However, Nirex's experimental work shows that these fears are
unfounded.  In particular, <I>Nirex Report S/95/011</I> [COR/529] states (page
38):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The high calcium concentration in the near-field porewater is
expected to destabilise natural colloids </I>(comment: such as humic acids)<I>migrating
into the repository and to compete with radionuclides for sorption onto colloids
generated from the backfill.  It was shown that naturally-occurring humic acids
will not be  mobile in a cementitious near field</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.44 Thus, in the engineered barriers of the repository, the high ionic
strength, calcium-rich waters will destabilise naturally occurring organic
compounds such as humic acids, which may be present as colloids, so that they do
not present a potential means of radionuclide complexation and transport. In
addition, it is anticipated that repository-derived organic compounds will
dominate the organic geochemistry of the near-field system for a considerable
period of time after closure of the repository. This is discussed at paragraphs
7.45 to 7.51 of this Supplementary Proof.
</P>
<P>The Presence and Impact of Organic Degradation Products
</P>
<P>7.45 At paragraph 5.18 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8), Dr Wogelius
states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition to naturally occurring organic products, organic
degradation products of the waste itself must also be accounted for.  During the
decomposition of the waste, cellulosic degradation products may be produced in
quite a high yield (Jefferies 1992)[FOE/8/9].  These organic chemicals may have
a marked effect on the concentration of radionuclides in the ground water.
(Barton
</I>[sic: Baston]<I>1994)[FOE/8/10]. However the chemical reactions that
produce this effect are not well understood.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.46 I agree that such products must be accounted for and, indeed, will
dominate the organic geochemistry of the near-field system. However, discussing
the role of the degradation products of cellulose in increasing the solubility
of plutonium in the repository, <I>Nirex Report S/95/011</I> [COR/529] states
(page 35) that recent treatments in preliminary performance assessments of the
degradation of cellulosic materials in the near field have taken account of this
behaviour. 
</P>
<P>7.47 As described in <I>Nirex Report S/95/011 </I>[COR/529] on pages 40 to
44, an extensive programme of work has led to a good understanding of the
potential impact of the degradation of cellulose on the concentrations of
radionuclides in groundwaters.
</P>
<P>7.48 In paragraphs 5.19 to 5.21 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8), Dr
Wogelius describes a chemical study carried out in order to investigate the
effect of organic chemicals on the amount of radionuclides that could be carried
by water surrounding the rock. At paragraph 5.21, he then states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... it is clear that organic species can strongly change the
behaviour of both of these radionuclides and potentially increase their
mobility.  Complexation reactions such as this must be fully understood in order
to be able to make accurate geochemical predictions.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.49 The last sentence overstates the importance of having a complete
understanding. <I>Nirex Report NSS/G118, NSARP Reference Document Radionuclide
Transport Through the Geosphere</I>, January 1992 [FOE/8/9], which Dr Wogelius
cites, deals with this issue on pages 59 and 60 by making conservative
assumptions, a practice common internationally in safety assessments in dealing
with issues where there are currently insufficient data.  The conservative
nature of the approach adopted by Nirex, in using &quot;<I>organic enhancement
factor</I>&quot;,  is explained and the likely reduction of the effects of
organic chemicals by degradation and dilution is identified. 
</P>
<P>7.50 In paragraph 5.22 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8), Dr Wogelius
raises the concern that :
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>an unaccounted-for organic agent may form a complex with a
radionuclide and bring it into solution in the groundwater</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.51 The report <I>DOE/RAS/92.012, UK Nirex Report No. 286, The Physical
and Chemical Characteristics of UK Radioactive Waste Sources</I>, November 1992,
referred to in my Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para5.3">paragraph 5.3</A>), ensures that the presence of
any major organic constituents of the wastes can be identified. These can then
be screened for significant effects upon radionuclide chemistry, as described in
<I>Nirex Report S/95/011 </I>[COR/529] on pages 43 and 44. In addition, as part
of the ongoing hydrochemical characterisation of the region, Nirex is carrying
out analyses of naturally occurring organic compounds in the groundwaters. 
</P>
<P><B> </B>Point ii: The Role of Colloids
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.52"></A>7.52 Dr Wogelius considers the adequacy of data on
colloids in paragraph 5.25 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However, if colloid formation does occur all transport
calculations involving solubility limits will be invalidated.  Completely new
measurements based on the chemistry and physics of the colloid will be needed in
order to accurately quantify the role of the geochemical barrier.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.53 The Nirex approach to colloid transport is outlined in <I>Nirex Report
S/95/011 </I>[COR/529] on pages 39 and 40. Nirex accepts that there are
uncertainties surrounding various aspects of colloids. However, as noted in this
report,  the need for studies of radionuclide association with colloids stems
from the potential for the generation of cementitious colloids in the near field
and in the alkaline groundwater that migrates into the surrounding rock. This is
the subject of ongoing studies at Nirex and of proposals for work in the RCF
(see my Proof of Evidence, <B>PE/NRX/15</B>, <A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para6.36">paragraphs
6.36</A> to 6.38) but, by itself, does not suggest that colloid transport of
radionuclides could be a significant factor in the Nirex safety case. Indeed,
the <I>Royal Society Study Group</I>
<I>Report</I> [COR/605] states (page 125) that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;...<I>current indications are that transport by colloidal attachment
will not be serious so long as high pH persists.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.54 In fact, there is a growing body of evidence that colloids will not
significantly increase calculated values of risk. This can be summarised briefly
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>In order for colloids demonstrably to be a problem in a safety assessment
(i.e. to transport significant quantities of radionuclides to the biosphere)
they have to overcome several &quot;hurdles&quot;:
</LI></UL>
<P>- they must be present in significant concentrations;
</P>
<P>- radionuclides must sorb irreversibly onto them; reversible sorption (when
radionuclides from solution attach &quot;temporarily&quot; to the surface of a
colloid before going back into solution) may become irreversible if colloids
aggregate (stick together) but, if they do, they are likely to become large
enough to sediment or be filtered out and irreversible sorption then becomes an
advantage because the radionuclides are immobilised;
</P>
<P>- they must be physically and chemically stable in all the hydrochemical
environments along the pathway to the biosphere; and
</P>
<P>- they must be able to move through the pore and fracture structure of  the
potential transport pathway.
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Preliminary evaluations of natural colloid populations in the groundwaters
at Sellafield (not yet published) suggest them to be low and comparable to other
sites and environments being studied internationally for deep disposal of
radioactive wastes. However, these measurements need to be verified by better
quality sampling that would only be facilitated by the access provided by the
RCF.
</LI>
<LI>From natural analogue studies (studies of natural geochemical systems
analogous to those found in a repository or at a repository site), the observed
association of uranium with natural colloids appears to be small. This has been
observed in the fractured granitic rocks of the El Berrocal site in Spain (<I>El
Berrocal Project: Summary Report on Phase 1, Rivas et al.; Report of the
European Commission, EUR 15908, 1995</I>, page 93, NRX/15/17) and of Grimsel in
Switzerland (<I>Nirex Report NSS/R165</I>, page i, NRX/15/18), in fractured
slates from Cornwall (<I>Nirex Report NSS/R165</I>, page i, NRX/15/18) and in
the highly alkaline groundwaters of the Maqarin site in Jordan (<I>Nagra
Technical Report 91-10</I>, page 76, NRX/15/13) which are analogous to those
which might transport radionuclides from the near-field.
</LI>
<LI>I know of no clear evidence for long-distance colloid mobility in low
conductivity fractured rocks at repository depths. It is believed that the
tortuosity of the pore and fracture system in the rock effectively filters
colloids out from flowing groundwater.
</LI></UL>
<P>7.55 There are clearly uncertainties which must be explored by a combination
of continued laboratory experiments, natural analogue studies and in situ
observations and experiments in the RCF. I consider the latter to be crucial to
a clearer resolution of the issue. Work in the RCF, both in the colloid
transport and the chemical disturbance experiments, which I outline in my Proof
of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, <A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para6.36">paragraphs 6.36</A>
to 6.38 and <A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para6.51">paragraphs 6.51</A> to 6.53
respectively) will be essential in studying each of the four points above.
</P>
<P><B> </B>Point iii: The Importance of Ionic Strength
</P>
<P>7.56 In paragraph 5.29 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8), Dr Wogelius sees
the statement :&quot;<I>the effects of increasing ionic strength and
temperature on radionuclide sorption, solubility and speciation have generally
not been considered</I>&quot;  as
<I>&quot;a tremendous problem&quot; </I>(PE/FOE/8, paragraph 5.30) in respect
of ionic strength.  
</P>
<P>7.57 A considerable amount of work has been carried out by Nirex since
material was compiled for the report referenced by Dr Wogelius as FOE/8/12 and
published in 1992. Experimental work has been carried out on the effects of
salinity and temperature in a repository environment. For example, <I>Nirex
Report NSS/R311</I>, (Figure 7) [NRX/15/14], shows data for U(VI). It shows that
salinity does not significantly affect the solubility of uranium.  This
observation is supported by geochemical modelling, which predicts that the
speciation of radionuclides is dominated by hydroxy complexes. There is no
indication that radionuclides complex significantly with the main ionic
components of Sellafield groundwater, chloride and sulphate, over the expected
chemical conditions and concentration ranges found in the rocks at Sellafield. 
It is therefore clear that ionic strength is not a key variable and that the &quot;<I>tremendous
problem&quot;</I> in paragraph 5.30 of Dr Wogelius' Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8)
is non-existent.
</P>
<P>7.58 In paragraph 7.3 of Dr Wogelius' Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8), the
effects of temperature are said not to have been considered in safety assessment
calculations in respect of the solubilities of plutonium, neptunium and
americium at elevated temperatures.   Again, this is justified by reference to
FOE/8/12.  Much work has, in fact, been carried out since the statements in that
report were formulated and the results are due to be reported in 1996. 
</P>
<P><B> Mineral Surface Chemistry
</B>
</P>
<P>7.59 At paragraph 6.2 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8), Dr Wogelius sets
out his general thesis that the precise nature of the mineral surface must be
known:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Some minerals are extremely good at adsorbing radionuclides.  For
example clays and amorphous iron-hydroxides have a strong tendency to adsorb a
number of radionuclides under certain conditions.  However many minerals, such
as quartz, are extremely poor sorbers.  Thus in order to extrapolate data from
experimental results for use in geochemical predictions the precise nature of
the mineral surface concerned must be known</I>&quot;<I>.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Again, the contrast between Dr Wogelius and Dr Haszeldine (at paragraph
13.17 of his Proof of Evidence, PE/GNP/3), in the assumed importance of
sorption, is noted.
</P>
<P>7.60 My overall response to this is that:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>I accept that mineral surfaces are important controls on the groundwater
chemistry and on sorption of radionuclides in the geosphere;
</LI>
<LI>however, the definition of &quot;<I>precise nature</I>&quot;<I></I>is not
given and I believe this is an elusive criterion; moreover  
</LI>
<LI>I believe the nature of geological mineral surfaces has only to be
understood to the extent necessary to demonstrate that adequate models and
parameters are used in performance assessment studies.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the remainder of this Section 7 of my Supplementary Proof I deal with
the specific concerns raised by Dr Wogelius in this general area.
</P>
<P><B> </B>Point i.  The Effect of Ageing
</P>
<P>7.61 In paragraphs 7.8 to 7.9 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8), Dr
Wogelius makes statements on how changes to mineral surfaces and sorption on
minerals might be of significance in performance assessment.  In summary he
states (paragraph 7.9):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> </I>&quot;<I>The ageing effects on mineral surfaces for the whole
range of pertinent chemical reactions is virtually unknown.  This is perhaps the
most important problem in terms of quantifying the geochemical safety case.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.62 Whilst accepting that there is sparse information on the ageing of
mineral surfaces, this appears to reflect a misconception concerning work by
Nirex on the role played by rock surfaces in assessments of long-term safety. 
Sorption data used in safety assessments are selected conservatively to provide
a range of possible values which reflect the whole spectrum of likely sorption
states of a particular radionuclide, encompassing all degrees of surface
characteristics of minerals. They are not based on some hypothetical 'clean'
state of a pure mineral. These data are obtained from field and laboratory
experiments on rocks which already exhibit varying degrees and mechanisms of
alteration and ageing which reflect the past history of the site. There is good
confidence that the far field fracture surface mineralogy (outside the influence
of the concentrated alkaline plume) will not change significantly in the
geologically short timescale of interest to repository performance unless there
are significant changes to deep hydrochemistry. Furthermore, any possible
perturbations are only likely to result in the same types of surface changes for
which there is already evidence in the samples used in experiments. 
</P>
<P>7.63 In paragraph 6.6 of Dr Wogelius' Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8) he cites
the work of Seitz (FOE/8/17) to support his conclusions about mineral surface
alteration, saying that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>....under conditions analogous to those expected in a waste
repository mineral surfaces can become significantly less able to sorb
radionuclides.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> It should be noted that the &quot;<I>conditions analogous to those
expected in a waste repository</I>&quot;<I> </I>in this work relate to the
hydrothermal alteration of basalt at 320<SUP>o</SUP>C [FOE/8/17, page 111].
Such high temperatures are of no relevance to the Nirex repository concept for
ILW and some LLW.
</P>
<P>7.64 I would also point out that the behaviour of radionuclides at the
Sellafield site over geological timescales is addressed through studies of the
geochemical behaviour of naturally-occurring radionuclides.  In<I> Nirex Report
NSS/G118</I> (page 22) [FOE/8/9] it is stated :
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> </I>&quot;<I>Many elements of interest in repository assessments occur
naturally.  Some of the radioactive fission and activation products are
radioisotopes of elements that have stable isotopes occurring in nature, such as
the halogens or the transition metals.  In addition, small quantities of the
members of the long-lived
<SUP>238</SUP>U, <SUP>235</SUP>U and <SUP>232</SUP>Th decay chains are found
in all rocks.  The distributions of all these isotopes within a given part of
the earth's crust are a function of changing hydrogeological and hydrochemical
conditions.  Therefore the current distributions of such radionuclides have the
potential to yield information on long term groundwater flow, geochemistry and
radionuclide transport.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.65<B> </B>In the near field, ageing or leaching of the cementitious Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill (NRVB) over long timescales may result in a reduction
in the sorption capacity of NRVB.  This ageing effect is incorporated in the
range of parameter values represented in probability density functions (PDFs) in
assessment models for radionuclide sorption onto NRVB (see <I>Nirex Science
Report S/95/011</I>, page 32)[COR/529]. 
</P>
<P>7.66 Nirex recognises that, over long timescales, radionuclides may become
irreversibly incorporated in minerals within the repository or surrounding
rocks.  This is a beneficial process that could lead to reductions in the
dissolved concentration of the radionuclide<B>.
</B> However<B>, </B>Nirex currently takes no account of this process in its
safety assessments and this is considered to be a conservative assumption.
Because Nirex uses a conservative, reversible sorption model, the potential for
release of irreversibly sorbed radionuclides as a result of mineral surface
ageing is not relevant. 
</P>
<P>7.67  I conclude that Dr Wogelius' comments on surface chemistry changes,
whilst scientifically interesting, are not of direct significance in safety
assessment as the potential impacts are accounted for by a combination of
conservative assumptions and adequate ranges of data derived from real materials
which reflect the range of likely states to be encountered in the geological
environment.
</P>
<P>Point ii. Groundwater Chemistry and Mineral Surface Reactions 
</P>
<P>7.68 At paragraph 6.19 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8), Dr Wogelius
asserts that a reliable quantification of how sorption changes as a function of
pH is critical for a reliable safety assessment. This is indeed of significance
and Nirex has addressed this by carrying out experiments on sorption over a
range of pH conditions from pH 6-12 (see FOE/8/10, page 521 and FOE/8/9, page
24).
</P>
<P>7.69 In paragraphs 6.21 and 6.22 of his Proof of Evidence, Dr Wogelius
discusses dissolution of minerals by alkaline fluids released from the
repository, proposing &quot;<I>possibly significant changes in the regional
hydrology.</I>&quot;
</P>
<P>7.70 The high pH of the groundwater derived from the repository is predicted
to be reduced to near-neutral pH (i.e. the chemical conditions of the
unperturbed BVG groundwaters)  through dilution and reaction of the alkaline
plume in the BVG before it reaches the sandstones discussed in Dr Wogelius'
paragraph 6.21.  Work conducted on this topic by Nirex using laboratory
experiments, natural analogue studies and geochemical modelling has shown that,
for the minerals present in both the BVG and the sandstones, the precipitation
of new minerals resulting from reaction with alkaline fluids generally causes a
reduction in porosity, and not an increase. These changes will be localised
around the repository and will not affect the regional hydrology, as Dr Wogelius
proposes. As described in Dr Mellor's Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/16</B>) at
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#Para5.22">paragraphs 5.22</A> and 5.23, Nirex
intends to carry out in situ experiments to support our ongoing programme of
laboratory and natural analogue studies of this process.
</P>
<P><B>Sorption Measurements and the Use of Experiments in the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>Point i:  Further Laboratory Studies
</P>
<P>7.71 In paragraph 8.1 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8), Dr Wogelius
states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> </I>&quot;<I>As discussed above, it is clear that many key pieces of
data remain to be acquired in order to enable a reliable chemical safety case
for nuclear waste disposal to be produced....it is advisable for many of the
fundamental chemical data to be measured under well-constrained laboratory
conditions before moving on to test hypotheses in the field</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.72 My broad response to this is that, although Dr Wogelius discusses some
interesting issues up to this point in his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8), it is
far from &quot;<I>clear that many key pieces of data remain to be acquired</I>&quot;.
 In particular, Dr Wogelius has failed to quantify the effects of  these issues
on a repository performance assessment.  Further, he has not recognised that
many of the uncertainties that he has raised are already encompassed in the
parameter ranges used as input to the performance assessment.    This suggests
that he has misunderstood the philosophy underlying a probabilistic safety
assessment namely that it is not necessary to have a complete understanding of
all processes (in a similar way that it is not necessary to have a complete
deterministic description of the system; see Dr Chaplow's Supplementary Proof of
Evidence, <B>PE/NRX/14/S1</B>, <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14s1.htm#Complexity">Section
5</A>). Rather, it is necessary that the possible effect of the process on the
parameter has been considered.  Nirex, in line with international practice,
deals with uncertainties by making conservative assumptions until such time as
these uncertainties can be better resolved. 
</P>
<P>7.73 The data that are required in the areas of interest to Dr Wogelius
would, indeed, be obtained largely from laboratory experiments, albeit using
well-characterised geological samples of rock and groundwater taken from the
Sellafield site. The RCF offers the opportunity to obtain the highest quality
samples of some materials to feed into this laboratory programme.  The <I>Royal
Society Study Group</I> <I>Report</I> [COR/605] noted (Section 1.3, pages 2-3)
that there were a number of areas where scientific understanding is not yet
sufficiently advanced to support the construction of detailed post-closure
performance assessments, whilst observing that these will be addressed in the
Nirex research programme. Referring to the chemical containment issues, the <I>Royal
Society Study Group</I> <I>Report</I> [COR/605] noted (Section 1.3.4, page 5)
that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;<I>Nirex are making progress with assessing these very complex
effects, and there is increasing international work on what was formerly a
predominantly UK interest.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.74 A substantial research programme has been underway since field samples
were first available from the site and is envisaged to continue up to, and
overlap with, Phases 2 and 3 of the RCF. Many of the areas addressed by Dr
Wogelius are already under study or will be studied in this period. I believe
that it is now essential to extend the laboratory study of important geochemical
processes into in situ conditions in the RCF. </P>
<P>Point ii: Alleged Discrepancies in Nirex's Sorption Data
</P>
<P>7.75 From statements made in paragraphs 8.5 to 8.15 of his Proof of Evidence
(PE/FOE/8), it appears that Dr Wogelius doubts the validity of the Nirex
sorption data.  He makes a number of specific points which I shall deal with
below in turn.
</P>
<P>7.76 In paragraph 8.5 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8), Dr Wogelius
states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> </I>&quot;<I>... the types and proportions of the organic chemicals
present in the 'authentic degradation products' may not have been the same in
the experiments ...</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.77 This conclusion is incorrectly attributed by Dr Wogelius as a finding
of <I>Jefferies (1992)</I> [FOE/8/9]. In any event, this statement is
incorrect.  In particular, in Nirex's work, the organic degradation products are
prepared by a standard method which is subject to quality assurance and the same
batch of material is used for a group of experiments which is going to be the
subject of comparative evaluation.
</P>
<P>7.78 In paragraph 8.7 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8), Dr Wogelius
states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> &quot;Discrepancies between these experimental results 'raise questions
over the applicability of batch data to in situ conditions' (Jefferies
1992)[FOE/8/9]. Clearly, extrapolations from these data sets to the long-term
geochemical safety case would contain significant errors.&quot;  
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.79 The report from which Dr Wogelius quotes is Nirex's own evaluation [<I>Nirex
Report NSS/G118</I>, FOE/8/9] of the adequacy of sorption data. The issue of 
the potential over-estimation of sorption by the batch technique has long been
recognised by Nirex.  In the annex of <I>Nirex Report NSS/G118</I>, page 103
[FOE/8/9], it was recognised that further work was required to build a robust
argument for correcting batch sorption data for use in assessment calculation. 
Dr Wogelius fails to note the treatment of this issue in the most recent
assessment, <I>Nirex 95</I> (Volume 3, page 6.8) [COR/522],  where a correction
factor was used to account for the potential lower sorption on intact rock
samples.
</P>
<P>7.80 In paragraph 8.9 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8), Dr Wogelius
states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>In contrast to the batch and diffusion experiments considered
above, studies with single mineral phases allow critical measurements to be made
concerning the rates and energetics of important reaction mechanisms.  Questions
about whether sorption or precipitation occurred are answered, the relative
importance of various phases in adsorbing contaminants are determined, and the
reversibility of the sorption reaction unambiguously measured.  </I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.81 Such work has been underway for several years in the Nirex research
programme and results will be reported in 1996.
</P>
<P>7.82 In paragraphs 8.11 to 8.15 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8), Dr
Wogelius seeks to undermine the use of bulk sorption coefficients by Nirex. In
particular, in paragraph 8.12, Dr Wogelius states: 
</P>
<P><I> </I>&quot;<I>Estimates of K<SUB>d</SUB> used in Nirex performance
assessments have exhibited errors of up to 10,000 fold. (Thomas 1993) [FOE/8/21]</I>&quot;.
</P>
<P>7.83 Nirex recognises that the treatment of radionuclide sorption in the
assessment is simple, in that it is treated as a reversible linear process
characterised by a distribution coefficient (K<SUB>d</SUB>) describing the
partitioning of radionuclide between the groundwater and the rock or mineral.
FOE/8/9 (page 17), states: <I>&quot;Although simple, the K<SUB>d</SUB>
approach can be shown to lead to conservative estimates of sorption behaviour
through carefully considered justification of the choices of K<SUB>d</SUB>
values for particular rock types and radioelements.&quot;</I>  A number of
approaches are adopted to obtain such conservative estimates of sorption:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>sorption measurements on intact rock samples in which the  natural rock
surfaces have not been disturbed by crushing the sample;
</LI>
<LI>application of surface analytical techniques to identify the important
sorbing minerals in the rock;
</LI>
<LI>batch sorption experiments using well-characterised single mineral phases,
to build confidence in the mechanisms of sorption;
</LI>
<LI>geochemical modelling to interpret solution data from experiments  and to
extrapolate results to a wider range of geochemical conditions; and
</LI>
<LI>observations of the behaviour of naturally occurring radionuclides in
geological systems (natural analogues).
</LI></UL>
<P>7.84 As to the assertion of 10,000 fold errors, I cannot find the statement
which Dr Wogelius quotes or evidence for that statement in the reference cited
[FOE/8/21].  The reference seeks a comparison of &quot;<I>Nirex Data</I>&quot;
with &quot;<I>Nagra Data</I>&quot; with respect to far field and near-field
sorption data.  There is only one written comment in FOE/8/21 that compares the
Nirex sorption data with the other published sorption data.  It is stated
[FOE/8/21, page 12] that &quot;<I>The majority of the sorption and solubility
values quoted by Nagra and SKB fall well within the ranges quoted by Nirex and
those provided for Phase 1 calculations from HMIP databases</I>&quot;.  There is
no comment to the effect that Nirex data have exhibited errors up to 10,000
fold, as implied by Dr Wogelius.  It is, therefore, unreasonable to say that &quot;<I>estimates
of K<SUB>d</SUB> used in Nirex performance assessments have exhibited errors</I>&quot;<I></I>let
alone &quot;<I>of up to 10,000 fold</I>&quot; (paragraph 8.12, PE/FOE/8). The
Nirex and Nagra/SKB data presented in FOE/8/21 are, simply, different; both sets
are appropriate for the rock types and experimental conditions.
</P>
<P>7.85 The Nagra data given in Tables A3 and A4 of FOE/8/21 are the same for &quot;<I>high
capacity rocks</I>&quot; (Table A3) and &quot;<I>low capacity rocks</I>&quot;
(Table A4).  On consulting the source reference, I have found that these data
are given for one rock type only, &quot;<I>marl.</I>&quot;  I am unable to
reconcile their use to describe the behaviour of two distinct rock types. 
</P>
<P>7.86 In paragraphs 8.14 and 8.15 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8), Dr
Wogelius questions the reliability of K<SUB>d</SUB> values for use in
performance assessments stating, at paragraph 8.14: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>... when rock samples as either powders or larger aggregates are
used to  determine the K<SUB>d</SUB> for an element, implicit in the result is
that the lithology is homogeneous with respect to the amounts of various mineral
components present. Thus K<SUB>d</SUB> values cannot be relied upon to provide
unequivocal data for use in reliable geochemical safety assessments.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.87 Dr Wogelius' concerns are unjustified. In particular, in reaching his
view he appears not to have considered the measures that Nirex has adopted to
build confidence that the data used in performance assessments are reliable, in
the sense that they do not lead to underestimates of risk.  These measures are
as follows (see <I>Jefferies, 1992</I>; FOE/8/9, Section 3.3.1): 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the use of probability density functions for K<SUB>d</SUB> values to
represent natural variability.  The Nirex sorption programme involves
measurements on a range of rocks from the Sellafield site using a range of
groundwater compositions in order to describe this variability;
</LI>
<LI>an extensive programme of work directed at understanding the mechanisms of
sorption so that geochemical modelling can be used to provide an interpretative
model consistent with experimental data; and,
</LI>
<LI>support for the conceptual model of sorption by observations of
mineralogical samples, single phase batch experiments and natural analogue data.
</LI></UL>
<P> I therefore conclude that a global K<SUB>d</SUB> may be inherently
inaccurate in an absolute sense, but if it is chosen conservatively, informed by
such work, it will allow a robust estimate to be made of the performance of the
repository.  It will not be &quot;<I>unreliable</I>&quot; in respect of its
purpose.
</P>
<P>Point iii: Geochemical Research Proposed for the RCF
</P>
<P>7.88 In Section 9 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8, pages 43 to 46), Dr
Wogelius criticises the geochemical research proposed for the RCF.
</P>
<P>7.89 In paragraph 9.2 (and effectively, again, in paragraph 9.6) Dr Wogelius
asserts that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> </I>&quot;<I>The rock matrix diffusion tests will be completed by
injecting sorbing and non-sorbing tracer chemicals into a portion of the site. 
Fluids will be collected at a distance from the injection point, and analysis of
the collected fluids will be used to determine how much of the chemical tracer
has been adsorbed.  This type of approach is simply a large scale K<SUB>d</SUB>
experiment.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.90 In this, Dr Wogelius seems not to appreciate the benefit of in situ
experiments in the RCF in that they allow processes to be studied under natural
geochemical conditions on a length scale greater than can be studied in the
laboratory.  Additionally, they allow experiments to be performed that address
groundwater flow and transport through fractures in the BVG.  Such experiments
are not possible in the laboratory, because of the changes to the hydraulic
properties of the fracture that inevitably occur when the fracture is removed
from the ground.
</P>
<P>7.91 The scope of the rock matrix diffusion experiment is wider than simply
measuring the sorption properties of selected radionuclides in the fracture. 
The experiment will address the geometry of the groundwater flow pathway and the
extent of rock matrix diffusion.  The results will be used to ensure that an
appropriate representation of channelling of flow and of rock matrix diffusion
is incorporated in performance assessments.
</P>
<P>7.92 In paragraph 9.3 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8), Dr Wogelius
states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> </I>&quot;<I>Nirex funded and other laboratory research has had great
difficulty understanding radionuclide sorption data even when the experiments
are fairly simple.  Conflicting results have been found in a number of studies,
due to problems with effective surface areas, slight shifts in chemical
equilibria and surface ageing effects</I>&quot;.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.93 In this, Dr Wogelius has correctly identified a problem if, as I
believe, he is saying that sorption is a complex process and it will be
difficult to understand in detail.  I agree, but I have outlined above why this
is not an issue.
</P>
<P>7.94 The value of the proposed experiments in the RCF is that they will
allow predictions, based on the treatment of uncertainty in sorption models and
parameter values derived from laboratory-scale experiments, to be tested.  The
extent of agreement between model prediction and experimental result will
demonstrate the degree of understanding of the process.  This is the process of
model validation described in detail in Section 10 of this Supplementary Proof
of Evidence and it is one of the key aspects of the experimental programme in
the RCF.
</P>
<P>7.95 In paragraph 9.5 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8), Dr Wogelius
states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Resolution of these problems is fundamental to understanding
radionuclide geochemistry  and making accurate predictions.  Large-scale field
tests however, will have difficulty contributing to the solution of these
problems for the following reasons:
</I>
</P>
<UL>
<LI><I>the time scale of the experiments will be limited and therefore it will
not be certain that the observed behaviour is not a transient phenomenon;</I>
</LI>
<LI><I>there will be uncertainty about the cause of the observed results;</I>
</LI>
<LI><I>such an approach does not account for possible inhomogeneities in the
host rock which can drastically change geochemical behaviour;</I>
</LI>
<LI><I>finally, the short-term chemical state of the site may be changed by
RCF construction, such that the measurements may be compromised by
contamination.</I>&quot;
</LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.96 My response to the bullet points he sets out is given in paragraphs
7.97 to 7.100 of this Supplementary Proof, respectively: 
</P>
<P>7.97 I agree that &quot;<I>the time scale of the experiments will be
limited.</I>&quot;  Therefore, only relatively rapid geochemical processes will
be addressed.  Neglect of long-timescale processes such as mineralisation of
radionuclides is a conservative assumption in performance assessment modelling. 
Nirex recognises that each of the three types of experimental methods to acquire
data - laboratory experiments, field experiments and natural analogues - has
advantages and disadvantages relative to the others.  The in situ experiments in
the RCF will be supported by a continuing laboratory scale programme and by
observations on the behaviour of naturally-occurring radionuclides in the
Sellafield groundwater system.
</P>
<P>7.98 I agree that there may be some &quot;<I>uncertainty about the cause of
the observed results</I>&quot; in terms of the detailed mechanisms.  However the
important test is whether an adequate understanding can be gained of the causes
and effects that are important to repository performance.  The integrated
modelling and testing will be designed to ensure that requirement is met. 
</P>
<P>7.99 I disagree that &quot;<I>such an approach does not account for
possible inhomogeneities in the host rock which can drastically change
geochemical behaviour</I>&quot;.  This is a major purpose of conducting large
scale, in-situ experiments.  A fracture will be selected for study to be
representative of water-conducting features in the BVG.  It is recognised that
the fracture under test may be heterogeneous.  Excavation of parts of the
fracture will address this mineralogical heterogeneity.  Heterogeneity is an
important aspect of the real system and the approaches taken to predict the
results of the experiment and to extrapolate the results for use in a
performance assessment will need to take this geochemical heterogeneity into
account.
</P>
<P>7.100 I disagree that &quot;<I>the short-term chemical state of the site
may be changed by RCF construction, such that the measurements may be
compromised by contamination.</I>&quot;  A small volume of rock surrounding the
excavation may be subject to such &quot;<I>contamination</I>&quot; but the
system will remain uncontaminated on the site scale.  Experiments will be
performed in boreholes drilled from the galleries in the RCF extending beyond
the zone of any significant stress relief and likely<I> </I>&quot;<I>contamination</I>&quot;.
 Since natural groundwater flow will be from the rocks towards the RCF, it is
unlikely that there will be &quot;<I>contamination</I>&quot; of the groundwater
in the fractures by the atmosphere in the RCF, as proposed in paragraph 9.7 of
Dr Wogelius' Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/8). I thus find no grounds to support the
statement in paragraph 9.8 of his Proof of Evidence  that:
</P>
<P>&quot;<I>These perturbation effects will directly effect the geochemical
equilibria under investigation.</I>&quot;
</P>
<P> Rather, the perturbation effects will be limited and the experiments will
be located to avoid these effects. 
</P>
<P><B>Summary
</B>
</P>
<P>7.101 The Objectors have raised a range of concerns about the geochemical
aspects of performance assessment. Many of these are generic to radioactive
waste disposal in its broadest sense or to the conceptual design of the proposed
Nirex repository. None of the concerns raises a new issue. Nirex is already
familiar with all the arguments raised and is, or has been, addressing them to
varying extents in its research and development programme for more than a
decade. 
</P>
<P>7.102 I have shown the statements made by Dr Haszeldine concerning the redox
state of the repository environment to be incorrect. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.103"></A>7.103 Dr Wogelius suggests that a more detailed,
mechanistic understanding is required for all the processes which he raises. 
However, he misunderstands the philosophy underlying a probabilistic safety
assessment.  A complete understanding of all processes is not required.  Rather,
it is necessary that the possible effect of the process on the parameter has
been considered.  The uncertainty in parameters must be encompassed fully in the
probability density function (PDF) of parameter values. Nirex, in common with
international practice, deals with uncertainties by making conservative
assumptions until such time as these uncertainties can be better resolved.  The
current and future Nirex programme is addressing many of the issues raised by Dr
Wogelius and the RCF will play a central role in their evaluation.
</P>
<P>7.104 It is my view that all of the issues raised by Dr Wogelius are best
treated by a programme of laboratory experiments and natural analogue studies
which runs in parallel with, and is eventually integrated with, in situ
experiments in the RCF. Such a programme of work has been in hand for many years
and, in most areas, is at a mature stage of development and has produced
high-quality information that has been used in safety assessment. A number of
issues, such as colloid transport and alkaline plume/rock interactions are ready
now to be evaluated using a parallel programme of underground experiments. In
fact, it is essential that in situ experiments in the RCF do take place. We do
not need to wait any longer before this integration takes place.</P>
<P><B>8. <A NAME="TREATMENTOF">TREATMENT OF THE BIOSPHERE IN PERFORMANCE
ASSESSMENTS</A>
</B>
</P>
<P>8.1 Dr Starmer's Proof of Evidence (PE/CCC/5, Sections 3, 4, 5 and 7) makes
a number of observations and criticisms regarding Nirex's treatment of the
biosphere in performance assessments which are dealt with in this Section of my
Supplementary Proof of Evidence.
</P>
<P>8.2 Dr Starmer's points fall into two groups which I consider in turn below:
</P>
<P> a series of claims that Nirex has omitted to consider (or at least to
present) a number of analyses and scenarios which would lead to worse risk
predictions than the scenarios actually presented; and
</P>
<P> specific criticisms of Nirex's &quot;<I>agricultural well</I>&quot;
analysis.
</P>
<P>8.3 Before dealing with Dr Starmer's specific concerns, I draw attention to
Nirex's approach to biosphere assessments as described in <I>Nirex Report
S/95/002</I>,<I> Post-closure Performance Assessment, Treatment of the
Biosphere, May 1995 </I>(Section 3.1, page 6) [COR/526]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>Nirex's overall approach to biosphere assessment modelling is
based on existing methods for simulating the behaviour of trace substances in
the environment, coupled with scientific knowledge and understanding obtained
from the NSARP [S/95/003]. However, whereas the NSARP provides an appropriate
level of understanding of the underlying processes of relevance to biosphere
assessments for deep geological disposal, it is clear that there is only limited
scope for validating research models describing the long-term evolution of the
biosphere.  This is also the case for models used to represent other
environmental processes of potential importance in the context of releases from
deep geological repositories, for direct use in the context of radiological
assessment.  This consideration, together with uncertainties associated with the
potential impact of future human activities, dictates that a pragmatic strategy
be adopted in performance assessment modelling.  The essence of this approach is
to make clear the underlying assumptions of the assessment, and to advance a
rational and self-consistent basis for evaluating possible radiological
exposures associated with future discharges from the disposal facility.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.4 Hence, my overall response to Dr Starmer's concern is that the declared
objectives of the Nirex approach to biosphere assessment modelling are
consistent with ensuring that there are no important omissions such as those
which he proposes.  The work programme (which has been underway for more than
seven years) has a declared framework, as given above, in which the underlying
assumptions are stated clearly and provide a rational and self-consistent basis
for evaluating repository post-closure performance.  The programme is managed
for Nirex by Dr Thorne of Electrowatt Engineering Services, an internationally
recognised scientist in this field.

<P> Point i: Climate Change and the Nirex Base Case
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.7"></A>8.7 Dr Starmer asserts that the Nirex base case may
well be non-conservative when it comes to dealing with the effects of climate
change (PE/CCC/5, paragraphs 5.1.1 and 7.1).
</P>
<P>8.8 He further notes that (PE/CCC/5, paragraph 5.1.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>HMIP has conducted a trial assessment of hypothetical LLW/ILW
repositories at Harwell in Oxfordshire in which a probabilistic model of climate
change has been developed and used to provide time-varying boundary conditions
to the groundwater flow and transport calculations (CCC/5/1).  A key result of
the study is that:
</I>
</P>
<P><I> </I>'<I>For the Harwell site, results indicate that the risk estimate
obtained by time-dependent simulation is about two order of magnitude greater
than that obtained by an equivalent simulation for constant (temperate)
environmental conditions.</I>'&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.9 This conclusion is taken from CCC/5/1, the overview report of the HMIP
study, and is based on Figure 4.25 (page 67).  However, this figure relates only
to iodine-129 in a geological system that bears no resemblance to Sellafield.
</P>
<P>8.10 On page 66 of CCC/5/1 the difference between the time-dependent and
constant conditions results is attributed to:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>the sharp dose peaks which are characteristic of the
time-dependent runs</I>&quot;.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.11 Page 66 and Figure 4.24 of CCC/5/1 show that these sharp dose peaks are
associated with springwater pathways in Devensian Glacial and Tundra periods
when near surface groundwater dilution was taken to be lowest. However, these
peaks are entirely an artefact of the modelling approach adopted. 
</P>
<P>8.12 These results are wholly conditioned by inappropriate critical group
assumptions.  Examination of the input data given for this exercise on page 65
of <I>DOE/HMIP/RR92.059: Dry Run 3</I>, Volume 5 shows that a very small
recharge area of 5.5 x 10<SUP>4 </SUP>m<SUP>2</SUP> was used.  This was based
on the concept of recharge to the surface only through a talik (put simply, a
break in the permafrost) and not via any runoff or interflow from ice sheets. 
</P>
<P>8.13 This area of 5.5 x 10<SUP>4</SUP> m<SUP>2 </SUP>(5.5 hectares)
appears to have been equated to the resource area for the critical group.  By
comparison, Nirex estimates the minimum resource area for a community of 30
people in Periglacial conditions to be 10<SUP>9</SUP> m<SUP>2</SUP> in <I>Nirex
Report S/95/002</I> (page 9, Box C) [COR/526].  This is 18,000 times greater
than the area used in
<I>Dry Run 3</I> (CCC/5/1).  The immediate implication is that the area used in
the latter report could not support a single person.  With the appropriate
resource area taken from <I>Nirex Report S/95/002</I> [COR/526] a surface water
flow rate, and hence dilution factor, about 10,000 times that calculated in <I>Dry
Run 3</I> (CCC/5/1) would be available to the critical group supported by the
minimum realistic area.  This would completely suppress the peak in risk
reported in Dry Run 3 (CCC/5/1) invalidating the main finding on the differences
between the case of constant Temperate conditions and the time-dependent
simulation.
</P>
<P>8.14 Dr Starmer seeks to gain authority for the importance of this
(incorrect) finding from <I>Dry Run 3,</I> (CCC/5/1) stating (PE/CCC/5,
paragraph 5.1.3):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>HMIP warns that direct transferral of the Harwell site results to
other sites because the travel times estimated for Harwell are &quot;.......
considerably greater than the time over which climate changes may occur, .......&quot;.
 The Sellafield travel times are also long compared to the predicted climate
change times .......</I>&quot;<I>.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> This is an important mis-quotation of the study report which should not be
interpreted to mean that the results are considered transferable.  The statement
on page 101 of Dry Run 3 (CCC/5/1) is:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>This result is not necessarily directly transferable to other
sites.  <B>For example</B>, </I>[my emphasis]<I> a significant feature of the
Harwell site is that estimated geosphere transit times are considerably greater
than the time over which climate changes may occur</I>&quot;.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.15 Finally, I draw attention to the comment on page 93 of CCC/5/1 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>The Project Team agreed that the potential bias associated with
the modelling approach in Dry Run 3 was not adequately assessed and therefore it
is not possible to confirm that the modelling approach has not introduced a
significant bias <B>on the quantitative results</B></I>&quot; [My emphasis].
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> It is therefore inappropriate to use these quantitative results to argue
that the quantitative results in <I>Nirex 95</I> Volume 3 [COR/522] are in
error.
</P>
<P>8.16 In conclusion, the result cited by Dr Starmer to justify his statement
on increase in risk due to climate change is an artefact of modelling error.  In
addition the result would not be transferable to the calculations of risk for a
repository at Sellafield, even if it were correct.
</P>
<P> Point ii: Base Case Radionuclide Flux
</P>
<P>8.17 Dr Starmer indicates that Nirex has input a constant base case
radionuclide flux into its modelling of climate controlled biospheres (PE/CCC/5,
paragraph 3.1.3). Further, at paragraph 5.1.6 of his Proof of Evidence
(PE/CCC/5) he states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>Nirex do not adjust the base case hydrology for climate
conditions.  The differences observed for the various climate state simulations
are due to changes in the biosphere model, such as changes in the crops grown by
the critical population group.  Increased infiltration in the highlands east of
the Sellafield site due to melting of permafrost has been cited by the RWMAC
(GOV/406).  Other climate controlled changes in the hydrologic flow regime
affect flow velocities and volumes.  Under both a Mediterranean and periglacial
climate scenario, for example, the infiltration of water might be reduced
leading to a change from advective flow to diffusive flow, and flow paths could
change at that point.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.18 Dr Starmer is correct in saying that Nirex does not adjust the base
case hydrology for climate conditions. However, the period to the onset of
Periglacial climate conditions will be characterised by a slowly cooling regime
in which only very limited  changes of flow pattern are expected.  The levels of
discharge to surface of the most significant radionuclides, chlorine-36 and
iodine&#173;129, should not at that time lead to unacceptable risks.
</P>
<P>8.19 Nirex has previously acknowledged and justified its use of constant
base case hydrology and considered more generally the potential effects of
transitions between states.  These potential effects are reviewed at Section 2.2
of <I>Nirex Report S/95/003</I> (pages 12 to 14) [COR/527].  This reports on a
study undertaken to determine whether any important processes or events had been
neglected because of the representation of climate change as a succession of
discrete climate states, which concluded:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Overall, the authors were unable to identify any major features of
transition periods which invalidate the treatment of future climate change as a
succession of discrete climate states.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Also, in evaluating the potential for increased risk from climate
transitions, the timing of the changes in relation to the peaks in risk (a
period of warming after the next ice age is likely to be after the peak
associated with chlorine&#173;36 and iodine&#173;129) and the lower risks
associated with Periglacial conditions due to lower agricultural productivity
(as shown in <I>Nirex 95, </I>Volume 3 (Figure 6.6) [COR/522]) need to be taken
into account.  Nevertheless, further studies are planned to consider transient
effects in more detail.
</P>
<P>8.20 The effects of climate change on the hydrogeology at depth is treated
in paragraphs 9.67 to 9.70 of my Supplementary Proof of Evidence.
</P>
<P> Point iii: The Effect of <I>&quot;Down-Cutting&quot;</I> of Streams in the
Boreal Climate
</P>
<P>8.21 Dr Starmer asserts that (PE/CCC/5, paragraph 5.1.8):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Boreal climate state is not yet adequately treated in Nirex's
analyses in terms of the effect of down-cutting of streams due to reduced sea
levels.  Whilst recognising this phenomena, Nirex does not at this point fully
incorporate the potential effects of down-cutting.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.22 In general terms, the presence of incised streams is advantageous, as
they provide a direct hydraulic connection between groundwaters and surface
water bodies.  Such a direct connection enhances the degree of subsurface
routing that will occur because it provides a pathway by which contamination can
enter surface waters without passing through the soil system.  This results in a
reduction of exposure to radioactivity and therefore lower risks. The
hypothetical catchment studies undertaken by Nirex include streams incised into
the associated catchments with channel depths and widths commensurate with the
water flows appropriate to those streams.  The degree of incision required to
accommodate the calculated water flows is very limited as shown in <I>Nirex
Report S/95/002</I> (Figure 6, page 16) [COR/526].  Thus, contrary to Dr
Starmer's assertion, incised rivers and streams are currently incorporated into
Nirex's assessments.  Furthermore, any increase in the degree of  incision would
tend to decrease rather than increase risk. 
</P>
<P> Point iv. Temperate Terrestrial Discharge Variants
</P>
<P>8.23 Dr Starmer asserts that Nirex does not (but should) present results
from variant groundwater flow models for a Temperate terrestrial discharge which
would show higher risks (PE/CCC/5, paragraph 3.2.19). 
</P>
<P>8.24 Dr Starmer is correct in stating that Nirex did not present results
from variant groundwater flow models for a Temperate terrestrial discharge in
<I>Nirex 95, </I>Volume 3 [COR/522].  However, the fact that the higher
productivity of the land surface in the Temperate terrestrial biosphere state
leads to a small increase in risk over that for the Boreal terrestrial biosphere
is clearly shown in <I>Nirex 95</I>, Volume 3 (Table 6.18, paragraph 6.36)
[COR/522].  Moreover, the biosphere pathways do not change as a consequence of
different groundwater flow models and the same relationship as shown in that
Table would be expected between calculated risks for Boreal and Temperate
climate states for the variant cases.  Hence, there would be virtually no
difference for the early peak due to chlorine-36 and a calculated risk higher by
a factor of approximately two for the peak occurring at about a million years in
the future due to uranium-238.  The Boreal terrestrial biosphere state is chosen
because:
</P>
<P>  the discharge of radionuclides would be 100% to land rather than the mix
of marine and terrestrial discharge appropriate to a Temperate climate; and
</P>
<P>  in the long term future the Boreal climate state will be prevalent over
the Temperate at the Sellafield location.
</P>
<P> Point v: Contaminated Marine Sediments
</P>
<P>8.25 Dr Starmer asserts that Nirex has not addressed the possibility that &quot;<I>up-welling</I>&quot;
of ground water offshore will result in contaminated sediments  which will
subsequently be exposed under Boreal climate conditions (PE/CCC/5, paragraph
5.1.7).
</P>
<P>8.26 This is not correct.  The approach adopted by Nirex is as described
below.
</P>
<P>8.27 Given the high chloride levels in the marine environment, very little
chlorine-36 would be expected to be sorbed to these sediments.  Thus, the
important case is the one used by Nirex, in which chlorine-36 enters and is
sorbed to the soils subsequently generated from the sediments in a terrestrial
environment.  For comparison, the K<SUB>d</SUB> value recommended by the
International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA), in <I>IAEA Technical Report
Series No. 247, Sediment K<SUB>d</SUB>s and Concentration Factors for
Radionuclides in the Marine Environment, 1985 </I>(<I>&quot;The IAEA K<SUB>d</SUB>s
Report&quot;</I>)<I> </I>(NRX/15/15, Table III, page 15) for coastal marine
sediments for chlorine-36 is 3 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP> m<SUP>3</SUP> kg<SUP>-1</SUP>,
whereas a value of 1m<SUP>3</SUP> kg<SUP>-1 </SUP>(some 30,000 times greater)
is used by Nirex for terrestrial soils Gleys, Peats and Spodosols) (<I>Nirex
95, </I>Volume 3, page 5.4) [COR/522].  A higher value of K<SUB>d</SUB> results
in a greater uptake of radioactivity in the food chain and hence a higher dose.
</P>
<P>8.28 In the case of iodine-129, modest concentrations could build up in
offshore marine sediments (the value given in the <I>IAEA K<SUB>d</SUB>s
Report</I> (NRX/15/15, page 17) is 0.02m<SUP>3</SUP> kg<SUP>-1</SUP>) but<SUP></SUP>
comparable K<SUB>d</SUB> values are adopted for Terrestrial soils by Nirex. 
<I>Nirex 95</I>, Volume 3 (page 5.4) [COR/522] gives values of 0.0065m<SUP>3</SUP>
kg<SUP>-1</SUP> for Brown Earths and Sands and 0.13m<SUP>3</SUP> kg<SUP>-1</SUP>
for Gleys, Peats and Spodosols.
</P>
<P>8.29 In conclusion, there is not strong sorption of significant
radionuclides to submerged marine sediments and the approach adopted by Nirex
does not lead to an underestimation of risk as proposed by Dr Starmer (PE/CCC/5,
page 33, paragraph 5.1.7).
</P>
<P><B> The Agricultural Well Scenario
</B>
</P>
<P>8.30 In summary, Dr Starmer makes the following assertions in his Proof of
Evidence (PE/CCC/5) concerning Nirex's agricultural well scenario:
</P>
<P>i. As a better picture of the site develops, it is likely that the
calculated risks in Nirex's analysis of the agricultural well scenario (which
already shows risks which are above the &quot;<I>risk limit</I>&quot;<I></I>[sic:

<P>8.31 I deal in detail with these assertions paragraph 8.32 to 8.49 but in

<P> Point i: The Effect of Further Information on the Calculated Risk
</P>
<P>8.32 Dr Starmer asserts that, as a better picture of the site develops, it
is likely that the calculation of the risk in Nirex's analysis of the
agricultural well scenario (which already shows risks which are above &quot;<I>the
risk limit</I>&quot;<I> </I>[sic: should be risk target]) will increase
(PE/CCC/5, paragraph 4.4.2).  This is because, so he states (PE/CCC/5, paragraph
4.4.1):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The details of the scenario are sketchy, but the well is only 50m
deep and is therefore, not likely to have been set at the maximum plume
concentrations available only about 50m deeper, around 100m, in the aquifer
(Figure 2.11 of COR/522 Vol. 3). The analysis only includes the radionuclides
Cl-36 and I-129  and uses the transient case for these...</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para8.33"></A>8.33 As described at pages 6.18 to 6.20 of Volume 3
of <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522] the risk calculations were based on average
concentrations at a depth of 50m bOD which, in terms of the West Cumbrian
coastal profile, involves depths of approximately 100m.  The case was chosen to
be conservative and samples the &quot;<I>maximum plume concentrations</I>&quot;
indicated by Dr Starmer.  He seems not to have recognised this.  It should
however be noted that the wells referred to are agricultural wells.  As
substantial volumes of water would be encountered in the regional aquifer at
depths above 50m bOD there would be no need to go deeper.
</P>
<P>8.34 I agree that there is a need to treat a wider range of radionuclides
and to provide a probabilistic treatment. This work is planned, as noted in <I>Nirex
95, </I>Volume 3 (page 6.19) [COR/522].  The radionuclides identified by Dr
tarmer as possibly adding to the peak are predicted to be strongly retarded in
the near field of the repository and the geosphere (tin [Sn]-126) or in the
geosphere (nickel [Ni]-59 and selenium [Se]-79) and would decay before
completing their transport to within 100m of the surface, as indicated in <I>Nirex
95, </I>Volume 3 (page 8.4) [COR/522].
</P>
<P>8.35 However, Dr Starmer has failed to mention an important factor that
would lead to a reduction in risk from the agricultural well pathway. This
factor is explicitly discussed in <I>Nirex 95, </I>Volume 3 (page 6.19)
[COR/522].  The relevant text is reproduced below: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> </I>&quot;<I>Radionuclide concentrations used in assessing risks to
critical groups utilising water from agricultural wells are those calculated for
the upper few tens of metres of the regional aquifer. Although such wells are
likely to be cased through the overlying Quaternary deposits, it is likely that
their yield will be a mixture of aquifer water and recent meteoric water. Since
the wells are not represented explicitly in the 2&#173;D cross section used for
radionuclide transport calculations (see subsection 2.3 of this volume), the
degree of dilution of aquifer radionuclide concentrations by recent meteoric
water may have been underestimated. Thus the radionuclide concentrations and
hence the associated risks are thought to have been overestimated in this
respect.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> The degree of possible overestimation will be investigated in the
future work programme, taking account of the structure of the superficial
sediments determined in the Site Characterisation Programme.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.36 Specifically, if there is effective mixing of recent meteoric water and
aquifer water, risks can be expected to decrease.
</P>
<P>8.37 It should also be pointed out that the assessed risk assumes all
irrigation, animal drinking and domestic supplies are drawn from the
agricultural well in <I>Nirex 95, </I>Volume 3 (page 13) [COR/522].  In
practice, a mix of well, local meteoric  and externally supplied waters is
likely to be used to resource one or more of these requirements, thereby
reducing risks further. 
</P>
<P>8.38 Hence, the assertion that, as a better picture of the site emerges, the
risks are likely to get higher, is unfounded.  The reverse is true as more
detail of the superficial deposits in particular will allow the current
conservatism in the treatment of near-surface mixing to be redressed.
</P>
<P> Point ii: Dilution and the Use of the &quot;Transient Case&quot; 
</P>
<P>8.39 Dr Starmer criticises Nirex for using the &quot;<I>transient case</I>&quot;<I></I>&quot;<I>invoking
in the process a factor of 2000 dilution, rather than the standard 600 for the
base case analysis</I>&quot; (PE/CCC/5, paragraph 4.4.1).
</P>
<P>8.40 The transient calculations referred to provide a more realistic
estimate of dilution for chlorine&#173;36 and iodine&#173;129 than do the steady
state calculations. Specifically, as stated in <I>Nirex 95, </I>Volume 3 (page
2.12) [COR/522], the steady state calculations neglect:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> </I>&quot;<I>the effects of the finite duration of the source term and
spreading in the geosphere, which would lead to a greater dilution</I>&quot;<I>.

</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.41 Therefore the transient calculations (the &quot;<I>transient
</I>case&quot;) should be used as they are more realistic; the steady state
calculations neglect these important effects on chlorine-36 and iodine-129
behaviour. 
</P>
<P> Point iii: The Effect of Climate Change on Water Usage
</P>
<P>8.42 At paragraph 5.1.5 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/CCC/5) Dr Starmer
states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>COR/522 asserts that the greenhouse effect is expected to last
for at least the next 10,000 years (page 6.10 of COR/522, Vol 3) and, further,
that the effect will push the local climate in the direction of a Mediterranean
climate similar to that experienced at Bordeaux in France.  This hotter, dryer
climate could change basic usage of water and increase reliance on groundwater
as a resource.  For example, the 50 mm of water assumed by Nirex for irrigation
of drought-sensitive crops (pages 5.13 and 5.14 of COR/522, Vol 3) might have to
be increased and the use of irrigation might be required for general
agricultural use.  For example, the drought this summer has severely stressed
the surface water supply and further stress could require increased reliance on
groundwater wells as a source of water for drinking and domestic use, livestock
and irrigation.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.43 Dr Starmer's assertion is not strictly correct in that <I>Nirex 95,
</I>Volume 3 (page 6.10) [COR/522] actually states:
</P>
<P> &quot;<I>the future climate might be either Mediterranean or Temperate for
the next 25,000 years</I>&quot;
</P>
<P>8.44<I> </I>However, this is largely irrelevant because, as examination of
<I>Nirex 95, </I>Volume 3 (Table 5.8, page 5.25) [COR/522] shows, the dominant
pathways are consumption of animal products for chlorine-36 and the ingestion of
drinking water for iodine-129.  Neither of these pathways is irrigation
dependent.  100% reliance on groundwater resources from the agricultural well is
already assumed for the assessment calculations, so the reliance cannot be
increased.
</P>
<P>8.45 Thus, even if the changes envisaged by Dr Starmer were to materialise,
they would not have the effect which he fears.
</P>
<P> Point iv: The Effect of Biosphere Exposure
</P>
<P>8.46 Dr Starmer asserts that the risk may be higher if well water use were
added to &quot;<I>exposure pathways using only biosphere models</I>&quot;
(PE/CCC/5, paragraph 4.4.4).
</P>
<P>8.47 I state in paragraph 8.44 of this Supplementary Proof of Evidence that
100% reliance on groundwater resources from the agricultural well is already
assumed for the assessment calculations.  Therefore, the proposal that risks
could be increased by adding the risks from the agricultural well scenario to
the risks from biosphere modelling is ill-founded and reflects a failure to
understand that the agricultural well scenario is an alternative and
conservative biosphere model.  The risks would decrease if all the water
requirements were not met by the agricultural well, as is likely to be the case
in reality.</P>
<P> <B>Summary
</B>
</P>
<P>8.48 In summary, I conclude that:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD>the alternative scenarios and analyses proposed by Dr Starmer are unlikely

have little impact; and

7.11, 9.8, 9.9 and 9.11) make a number of observations on, and criticisms of,
the results of the groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling
performed in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522] and on the approach to modelling adopted
in the analysis.  These comments fall into three groups of points related to:
</P>
<P>modelling approach: it is asserted that aspects of the modelling work are
inappropriate or in some way deficient;
</P>
<P>specific results of the modelling: it is asserted that the assessment models
do not deal appropriately with aspects of the behaviour of or structure of the
site; and
</P>
<P>features alleged to be excluded from the models: it is asserted that
certain, potentially important, physical processes have not been included in the
models.
</P>
<P>9.2 I will respond in detail to these points in paragraphs 9.3 to 9.71 of my
Supplementary Proof of Evidence but, in outline, my response to these points is,
respectively:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>that the modelling approach is appropriate and not deficient and that the
points raised generally indicate that important aspects of the Nirex approach
have not been recognised by the Objectors;
</LI>
<LI>that the models do deal appropriately with these aspects of the behaviour
of or structure of the site and that the criticisms generally indicate that the
basis for the results or the nature of the results has not been appreciated; and
</LI>
<LI>that the features or processes which the Objectors argue should be included
actually are included in the modelling, when they are realistic features or
processes.  When this is not the case it is because there are no sound physical
arguments for their inclusion.
</LI></UL>

<P>9.3 The Proofs of Evidence by Professor Mather (PE/CCC/4), Dr Starmer

comments on and criticisms of the approach to hydrogeological modelling used in
<I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522].  These criticisms fall into three groups, relating

9.33 of my Supplementary Proof of Evidence.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>9.4 It will be demonstrated in the following paragraphs that these
criticisms generally arise from a misunderstanding of the modelling approach
and, in particular, from a failure to appreciate the roles played by the various
models used in the performance analysis.  These topics are addressed in turn in
the following sections.  However, in order to set my responses in context it is
appropriate to make first a few preliminary comments on the overall modelling
approach that was adopted in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522].
</P>
<P>9.5 The first stage in the development of the models encompassed the
development of the conceptual model of the system and of parameters for that
model together with the derivation of the effective hydrogeological parameters
for regional-scale models.  This process is described in Volumes 1 and 2 of <I>Nirex
95</I> [COR/522].
</P>
<P>9.6 Numerical fracture-network models were used in the upscaling process to
derive the regional-scale effective hydrogeological parameters for the BVG. 
This is described in Section 5.1 (pages  5.2 to 5.10) of Volume 2 of <I>Nirex
95</I> [COR/522].  Fracture-network models were also used to model the flow and
transport in a region around the repository (Section 2.2, pages 2.6 to 2.9,
Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522]).  The results of these models were used
to develop the parameter distributions for the MASCOT submodels of radionuclide
transport in the BVG that were used in the calculation of risk.
</P>
<P>9.7 The NAPSAC fracture-network code that was used for this work is a widely
used computer program that was developed by AEA Technology.  Licenses for its
use have been purchased by several agencies with an interest in nuclear energy
and radioactive waste disposal such as the Nationale Genossenschaft fuer die
Lagerung radioaktiver Abfaelle (NAGRA) in Switzerland, the Nuclear Environment
Management Centre (NEMAC) in Korea and the Japanese Ministry (MITI) responsible
for these matters. NAPSAC was also available to and utilised by participants in
the Stripa project (see FOE/6/15 for a discussion of the Stripa project). 
Copies of NAPSAC have been obtained by VTT (Technical Research Centre of
Finland) and Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd.  Its use is also being considered by
the Gesellschaft fuer Anlagen und Reaktorsicherheit (GRS) in Germany.  A copy
has also been obtained by the University of Birmingham in the UK to explore the
possibility of using the advanced techniques developed within radioactive waste
disposal programmes in water resources analysis.
</P>
<P>9.8 NAPSAC has been well-verified (<I>Nirex Report S/94/004</I>, page 6)
[COR/510]), both by comparison against simple analytical cases and by comparison
with the results of other fracture-network programs.  This means that it has
been confirmed that the code produces correct results for a range of test cases
and is solving correctly the system of equations that are implemented in the
code.  A cross-code verification exercise was an inital stage of the modelling
work in the Stripa Project (NRX/16/2, page 47).  An overview of the successes of
the Stripa Project is given in paragraphs 9.24, 9.25 and 10.16 of my
Supplementary Proof of Evidence.
</P>
<P>9.9 In <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522], two-dimensional continuum porous medium
models of vertical cross-sections were used to calculate groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport on a regional scale.  A sensitivity analysis of the
results of the groundwater flow models was used to develop the parameter
distributions for the MASCOT submodels of radionuclide transport in the
sedimentary units.  The results of the radionuclide transport calculations were
used in the calculations performed for the agricultural well scenario.
</P>
<P>9.10 The NAMMU groundwater flow and transport code that was used for the
work described in paragraph 9.9 above is a well verified and widely used
computer program that was developed by AEA Technology.  Licenses for its use
have been purchased by several agencies with an interest in nuclear energy and
radioactive waste disposal such as the Nationale Genossenschaft fuer die
Lagerung radioaktiver Abfaelle (NAGRA) in Switzerland, the Nuclear Environment
Management Centre (NEMAC) in Korea, the Gesellschaft fuer Anlagen und
Reaktorsicherheit (GRS) in Germany and the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste
Management Company, SKB.  Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution (HMIP) also
owns a licence for NAMMU and it has been used by HMIP consultants.  A NAMMU User
Group, with participants from these and other countries meets regularly.  NAMMU
has also been well-verified (<I>Nirex Report S/94/004</I>, page 6) [COR/510],
both by comparison against simple analytical cases and by comparison with the
results of other groundwater flow programs in international intercomparison
exercise such as the HYDROCOIN Project.
</P>
<P> Point i:  Development of the Conceptual Model and Parameters
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">9.11 Criticisms in these areas were raised by
Professor Mather (PE/CCC/4) and Dr Salmon (PE/FOE/5).  The majority of these
points have been addressed in Dr Chaplow's Supplementary Proof of Evidence (<A
HREF="../nrx14/nrx14s1.htm#Para8.10">paragraphs 8.10</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14s1.htm#Para8.17">8.17</A> to 8.26 of <B>PE/NRX/14/S1</B>,
respectively).</FONT>
</P>
<P>9.12 Therefore, in my Supplementary Proof of Evidence I will only comment on
assertions made by Dr Salmon and Dr Hencher that are related to the elicitation
and modelling procedures followed in
<I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522].  Specifically, these assertions relate to the
elicitation procedures adopted in <I>Nirex 5</I> (PE/FOE/5, paragraph 3.17),
the process of upscaling (PE/FOE/5, paragraph 3.18) and the use of continuum
porous-medium models to represent flow and transport in fractured rock
(PE/FOE/6, paragraph 7.9).  These assertions are addressed in turn in paragraphs
9.13 to 9.17 of my Supplementary Proof of Evidence.
</P>
<P>9.13 In paragraph 3.17 (page 25) of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/5), Dr
Salmon comments on the elicitation procedures in <I>Nirex 95</I> and suggests
that
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>the apparent omission by Nirex to elicit the individuals estimates
of the CDFs by means of a questionnaire prior to the main elicitation meetings
may have artificially suppressed the range of possible CDFs identified</I>.&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In fact, experience of data elicitation indicates that precisely the
opposite is true.  It is important that participants should not be anchored to a
particular position (which may be biased).  The danger of anchoring on best
estimates is recognised in the elicitation procedure and discussion of extreme
outcomes is an important part of the process.  In addition, the careful
definition of the quantity to be elicited, in a way that is agreed by all
participants to be appropriate, is a vital part of the elicitation process and
can only be achieved when all the participants can interact (<I>Nirex Report
S/94/002,</I> page 9, Box D) [COR/508].  The approach suggested by Dr Salmon
would result in the definition being pre-judged by the person formulating the
questionnaire, leading to potential ambiguities in interpretation.
</P>
<P>9.14 In paragraph 3.18 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/5), Dr Salmon states
that
</P>
<P>&quot;<I>The process of scaling up the hydraulic CDFs and PDFs from the
individual fracture to the effective parameter scale introduces additional
uncertainties.</I>&quot;
</P>
<P> He does not indicate the supposed source of these &quot;<I>additional
uncertainties</I>&quot;.  In any event, his statement is incorrect.  The process
of upscaling does not, in itself, give rise to additional uncertainty.  Rather
it is important to ensure that the uncertainties in the properties identified in
the smaller scale models are quantified and carried through the upscaling
analysis so that the calculated effective properties take account of these
uncertainties.  As described in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Section 5.1.8, page 5.10 of
Volume 2) [COR/522], this is what was done in the Nirex 95 analysis.
</P>
<P>9.15 In paragraph 7.9, page 20 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/6) Dr
Hencher gives the following quotation from <I>Geier 1992</I> (FOE/6/4):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>even a set  of 5 packer tests, all near the centre of a block,
gives very little information about the block conductivity on a 40m scale.  This
means &quot;conditional&quot; SC [Stochastic Continuum] models based on such
data may not be &quot;well conditioned&quot;.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> and states that this:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>reaffirms the difficulties in using a continuum model to represent
a heterogeneous, fractured rock mass</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> However, it is clear from the content of the quotation itself that Geier is
not addressing the general issue of the use of continuum models to represent
fractured rock, but is making a much more restricted specific point about the
difficulty of conditioning a particular type of stochastic continuum model using
a particular type of data (which is not expected to be suitable for that
particular purpose (FOE/6/4, page 86).  Thus the quotation does not support the
point made by Dr Hencher.
</P>
<P>9.16 In addition, Dr Hencher's assertion concerning the difficulties of
using a continuum model are not supported by the following quotation, also taken
from <I>Geier 1992</I> (FOE/6/4).  It is stated (page 189) in connection with
the outcome of the project (which used Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) models)
that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>A major result has been the development and demonstration of a DFN
methodology to interpret packer tests in terms of fracture network properties
and predict relationships between packer test results and block scale properties</I>&quot;<I>.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Thus, the authors conclude that the study has demonstrated a methodology to
predict relationships between test results and block scale properties and
indicate that this methodology is based on the use of discrete fracture-network
models.  This methodology is, therefore, similar to the approach used in <I>Nirex
95
</I>[COR/522].  Thus, the work in <I>Geier 1992</I> (FOE/6/4) actually provides
support for the methodology adopted in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522].
</P>
<P>9.17 In any event, I am aware of the advantages and disadvantages of both
continuum porous medium models and fracture-network models.  It is, of course,
important that continuum models of fractured rock should only be used in regimes
in which the continuum approximation is appropriate and that the effective
parameter values for continuum models should be carefully calculated.  This is
precisely the approach that has been adopted in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522], in
which continuum models of the fractured host rock were used where appropriate
and the parameter values for the continuum model were obtained by a careful
process of upscaling (Section 5.1, pages 5.2 to 5.10 of Volume 2 of <I>Nirex 95</I>)
[COR/522].  However, fracture-network models were also used for the region of
host rock around the repository, in order to allow explicit representation of
the fracture system in this domain.
</P>
<P> Point ii: Fracture network modelling
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.18"></A>9.18 In their Proofs of Evidence Dr Salmon
(PE/FOE/5) and Dr Hencher (PE/FOE/6) make a number of assertions related to the
modelling of fractured rocks in general and in Nirex 95 in particular.  It is
suggested that fracture-network models (also called &quot;<I>discontinuum
models</I>&quot; by Dr Hencher) have an unproved track record (PE/FOE/6,
paragraphs 7.11 and 9.11), that the results of projects which sought to validate
such models were not encouraging (PE/FOE/6, paragraphs 9.8 and 9.9) and that the
treatment of travel times in fractured rock in Nirex 95 was inadequate
(PE/FOE/5, paragraph 3.24).  These points are refuted in paragraphs 9.19 to 9.27
and 10.16 of my Supplementary Proof of Evidence.
</P>
<P>9.19 In his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/6, paragraphs 7.11 and 9.11) Dr
Hencher suggests that fracture-network models (also called discontinuum models
by Dr Hencher) have an &quot;<I>unproved track record</I>&quot;.  However, this
view is not supported by the fact that fracture-network modelling is widely
recognised as being an appropriate technique for modelling groundwater flow and
transport in low-permeability fractured rocks such as the BVG, in which the flow
is predominantly within the fractures.  Fracture-network modelling is used
within the Swedish, US, Swiss, Finnish, and Japanese national radioactive waste
disposal programmes, and of course the UK programme.
</P>
<P>9.20 Dr Hencher's view that fracture-network models have an unproved track
record contrasts with that expressed by Olsson and Gale in a reference which Dr
Hencher himself quotes (FOE/6/15).  These authors state that in connection with
the Stripa Site Characterisation and Validation Project (SCV) that (page S29):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>During the course of the SCV project, the 3D discrete fracture
flow codes evolved from being research tools to practical tools capable of
representing flow through physically realistic fracture systems.  Application of
these codes to the SCV site demonstrated that the discrete fracture flow models
can be constructed  from field data normally obtained during a comprehensive
site investigation programme.  In addition, using the discrete codes to generate
the properties for large-scale porous medium models provides a tool for bridging
a range of scales while retaining much of the inherent variability in the flow
and transport properties of fractured rock masses.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> It should be noted that this comment refers to the Stripa project which
ended in 1992.  This view, by acknowledged experts on fracture flow systems, in
a publication to which Dr Hencher himself refers, together with the widespread
use of fracture-network models, would suggest that Dr Hencher's view is not
widely supported.
</P>
<P>9.21 Continuing with the theme of the limitations of fracture-network
models, in paragraph 7.11 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/6), Dr Hencher states
that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Geier (1992) [FOE/6/4] reports that discrete fracture models rely
on the geotechnical model being &quot;statistically homogeneous&quot; which may
limit their application.  For example Kulatilake (1990)[FOE/6/7], in his work at
Stripa, found the largest &quot;statistically homogeneous&quot; region to be 10m
long.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> No precise reference is given for the reference from <I>Geier 1992</I>,
but it may be that Dr Hencher is referring to the passage on page 39, which
states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>Strictly speaking</B>, valid DFN models are restricted to the
simulation of regions composed of domains within which the fracture population
is statistically homogeneous.  Most theoretical developments and applications to
date have defined statistical homogeneity in very strict terms of spatially
uniform distributions of fracture properties, either univariate (e.g. size) or
bivariate (e.g. orientation).  When this narrow definition of statistical
homogeneity is applied, field studies suggest that fracture populations are
often not &quot;statistically homogeneous&quot; over any practical modelling
scale.  For example, in a recent study of a 36m section of tunnel in the Stripa
mine (Kutilake et al 1990), the largest &quot;statistically homogeneous&quot;
region found was 10m long.</I>&quot;<I></I>(My emphasis) 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The very next paragraph on page 39 of <I>Geier 1992</I> puts the matter in
a rather different perspective.  It states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Practical DFN modelling requires a broader definition of
statistical homogeneity, based on a statistical description of heterogeneity in
the fracture population.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The rest of the paragraph is concerned with a description of several models
that are used to represent the fracture intensities in practice.  It is also
stated that four of these models are included in the FracMan fracture-network
model which Dr Hencher indicates that he uses in his current research (PE/FOE/6,
paragraph 1.2).
</P>
<P>9.22 Dr Hencher also states (PE/FOE/6, paragraph 9.11) that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Most of the available software has only recently been developed</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> As indicated on page 1 of FOE/5/8, the original version of the NAPSAC
fracture-network code, for example, was written in 1985.  Formal releases of the
software have been made since 1988.  Of course, the capabilities of NAPSAC are
continuously being extended, but it is not the case that the fracture-network
modelling software used by Nirex has the very recent origin suggested by Dr
Hencher.
</P>
<P>9.23 In paragraphs 9.8 and 9.9 of his Proof (PE/FOE/6, page 26), Dr Hencher
implies that the results of studies that sought to validate fracture network
codes have not been encouraging and, in particular, in connection with a
particular component of the Stripa calibration and validation (SCV) experiment
known as the inflow validation tests that (PE/FOE/6, paragraph 9.9) that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The failure of this inflow validation test of the NAPSAC model
which is used by Nirex, clearly has significant implications for the RCF
proposal</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> This comment is extremely misleading and is presented out of context with
the background from the SCV experiment.  The test that he refers to was not a
test of the ability of the NAPSAC code itself to model groundwater flow, but a
test of a particular hypothesis (FOE/6/15) concerning the effects of stress
redistribution following excavation on the hydraulic properties of fracture
networks in a gallery wall.  It is this particular hypothesis that failed the
test, not the capability of NAPSAC to model flow.  The successes of the Stripa
project can be clearly appreciated by considering the brief account given below
of some of the different experiments performed at Stripa.
</P>
<P>9.24 The tone of the account given by Dr Hencher of the Stripa project
contrasts significantly with the positive comments by Olsson &amp; Gale that
were quoted in paragraph 9.20 of my Supplementary Proof of Evidence, and were
taken from a reference which Dr Hencher himself quotes (FOE/6/15).  The account
of the &quot;<I>significant achievements</I>&quot; of the Stripa project given
in pages 55 to 57 of the Executive Summary of the <I>Overview Report of the
Stripa Project </I>(NRX/16/2) is also more positive than Dr Hencher's account. 
On page 57 of NRX/16/2 one of the &quot;<I>significant achievements</I>&quot;
of the Stripa project is listed as: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Demonstration of the applicability of the fracture flow modelling
for simulating groundwater flow and solute transport</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Thus it is clear that Dr Hencher's view is not supported.
</P>
<P>9.25 Inflows to the D-hole experiment at Stripa were predicted using a
NAPSAC model and other fracture-network models.  It was found that the results
of all the models were in reasonable agreement with observations (NRX/16/2, page
49, Section 4.5.4).  The various fracture-network models were also used to
predict tracer movement.  It was found that once it had been calibrated against
the flow (clearly a necessary stage in any transport modelling), the NAPSAC
model was able to predict the movement of tracer (FOE/6/15, Figure 11).  The
observed dispersion of the tracer was explained simply in terms of the
dispersive effects of the fracture-network geometry.  Taken together, the
validation studies carried out for the Stripa project build confidence in our
ability to characterise and explain groundwater flow and the movement of tracers
in fractured rocks.  The use of progressive cycles of validation work in the
Nirex Programme and, in particular, the role of the RCF in this process, is
described in Section 10 of my Supplementary Proof of Evidence. 
</P>
<P>9.26 In paragraph 3.24 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/5), Dr Salmon makes
several related criticisms of the calculation of travel times in fractured rock
performed in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522].  His argument is that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>the <I>Royal Society Study Group Report
</I>[COR/605] has expressed concern that Nirex is not exploring the scale-up
problems sufficiently;
</LI>
<LI>the impact of this on calculated travel times used in the performance
assessment could be considerable, because potential pathways from the repository
to the surface could be overlooked and because calculated flow velocities may
not be adequately &quot;<I>corrected</I>&quot; to take account of relatively
rapid groundwater flow through larger fractures; and
</LI>
<LI>travel times in fractured rock are obtained by scaling results obtained
using a matrix porosity and that the scaling may be inadequate.
</LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.27 My response to these three points is as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Dr Salmon refers to <I>The Royal Society Study Group Report </I>[COR/605].
 The relevant paragraph (page 135) starts:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>A further concern relates to the scaling up of parameters</I>&quot;<I>.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This paragraph is referring to a study conducted in early 1993, based on
limited data (see <B>PE/NRX/14/S1</B>, <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14s1.htm#Para8.25">paragraph
8.25</A>, page 65 for more information on this).  Concerning the procedure in
the 1993 study, the paragraph in [COR/605] subsequently continues:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Ideally it would be largely replaced by one of scale-up
calculations based on extensive field data.  However, because Nirex cannot
compromise the integrity of the site by drilling a large number of boreholes,
the field data available will always be limited, both in absolute terms and
relative to some other applications of groundwater flow modelling.  The RCF
should help in this respect.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This is the approach being adopted by Nirex and used in <I>Nirex 95</I>
(see Section 5.1 (pages 5.2 to 5.10) of Volume 2 of <I>Nirex 95</I>) [COR/522].
 Data obtained from the RCF will indeed enable this approach to be pursued
further (see  <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14s1.htm#Para5.8">paragraphs 5.8</A> to
5.10, pages 36 to 38, of Dr Chaplow's Supplementary Proof of Evidence, <B>PE/NRX/14/S1</B>).
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Dr Salmon is incorrect in asserting that, because upscaling of properties
for the fractured rock has not been treated appropriately, important pathways
could be neglected and travel times underestimated.  This is because the
upscaled effective properties (which are in any case appropriate) were not used
in the calculation of the pathways and travel times in the fractured BVG in <I>Nirex
95</I>.  These quantities are calculated directly using the NAPSAC discrete
fracture-network code (as is made clear in Section 2.2 (pages 2.6 to 2.9) of
Volume 3 of COR/522).
</LI>
<LI>Again, Dr Salmon is incorrect because the travel times in the fractured
rock are obtained directly using NAPSAC and not by the scaling approach that he
suggests.  In any case, his comment on the inadequacy of the scaling approach
for individual fractures is not relevant to transport through a large network of
fractures, providing that the effective properties of the network have been
calculated appropriately.
</LI></UL>
<P> Point iii: Regional flow modelling
</P>
<P>9.28 When discussing the regional scale continuum porous medium modelling
performed in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522], Dr Starmer and Dr Salmon make the
following two assertions:
</P>
<P>  that no sensitivity analysis was performed as part of the study (PE/FOE/5,
paragraph 3.22); and
</P>
<P>  that results from earlier models of this type were difficult to believe
and that the results from the <I>Nirex 95</I> model show modified behaviour
(PE/CCC/5, paragraphs 5.2.2 and 5.2.3).
</P>
<P> These assertions are refuted in turn in paragraphs 9.29 to 9.33 of my
Supplementary Proof of Evidence.
</P>
<P>9.29 When discussing the results of the NAMMU regional-scale flow models Dr
Salmon states that (PE/FOE/5, paragraph 3.22):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex has not even reported the results of any sensitivity
analysis</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> This statement is incorrect.  In the course of <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522]
many groundwater flow calculations were performed in which parameter values were
systematically changed from those used in the base case.  These calculations
were used to explore the sensitivity of results of interest (e.g. travel times)
to the input values of the hydrogeological parameters.  This is discussed in
Section 2.4.2 of Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95</I> and the sensitivities of the
travel times are given in Table 2.6 of that document.  This procedure is used to
ensure that the uncertainties in the hydrogeological parameters are taken
account of appropriately in the PSA calculations of risk.  The probability
density functions for the groundwater flow parameters that are used in the
MASCOT calculations of risk are based on the sensitivities derived from the set
of groundwater flow calculations with changed parameter values (see Section
2.4.2 and Figure 2.13 of Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95</I>).  I would therefore agree
with Dr Salmon (PE/FOE/5, paragraph 3.22) that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Sensitivity analysis is standard modelling practice when trying to
represent such complex hydrogeological conditions, and would assist in
quantifying the uncertainties associated with the model results</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The results of the NAMMU sensitivity analysis are used in precisely this
way.
</P>
<P>9.30 In paragraph 5.2.2 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/CCC/5, page 35), Dr
Starmer states that
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Early model results presented by Nirex (in Nirex Report No. 525 -
COR/525) were frankly difficult to believe.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In support of this statement Dr Starmer refers to the <I>Fourteenth Annual
Report of RWMAC</I> (page 16) [GOV/406] which stated (referring to a flow path
shown in Figure 2 of GOV/406) that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>This modelled flow path is inconsistent with the totality of field
observations.  As noted in paragraph 3.18b, there is an upward hydraulic
gradient within the SSG immediately to the west of the repository and it would
be expected that the flow path would remain in the upper part of the SSG (Calder
Sandstone). Indeed, the Nirex observations (3.18b) demonstrate discharge from
the top of the SSG above and to the west of the repository zone.  Further, the
modelled flow path takes a lower density fresh water downwards into a higher
density brine.  It is difficult to conceive a natural process, in these overall
circumstances, which could draw the pathline downwards so deeply within the
Seascale Fault Zone.  Nirex explains this situation as resulting from the input
into the model of a higher hydraulic conductivity for the Seascale Fault Zone. 
A possibly more plausible hydrogeological flow pathline, consistent with all the
available field data, tracks upwards, over a distance of just over a kilometre
from the repository zone in the BVG into the SSG to discharge from the SSG into
the drift or to the ground surface west of the repository.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.31 By quoting this passage in his paragraph 5.2.2 (PE/CCC/5, page 35) in
support of his point that early model results were &quot;<I>difficult to
believe</I>&quot;, Dr Starmer appears to endorse the following propositions that
are contained in the quotation:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>that the modelled flow path takes lower density fresh water downwards into a
higher density brine;
</P>
<P> that it is &quot;<I>difficult to conceive</I>&quot; why the flow path
should behave as it does in the Seascale Fault Zone; and
</P>
<P>that a more reasonable flow path, that would be consistent with field
observations, would discharge just west of the repository zone.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.32 My response to these points is as follows:
</P>
<P> The first point is a misunderstanding which arises from the fact that in
Figure 2 (page 15) of GOV/406 (<I>Fourteenth Annual Report of the RWMAC</I>),
pathlines derived by Nirex from a NAMMU numerical groundwater flow model of one
geological cross-section (<I>Nirex Report 525</I>, Figure 17, page 36)
[COR/505] are superimposed onto a conceptual view of the groundwater flow system
given on a different cross-section (<I>Nirex Report 525</I>, Figure 13, page
21).  This is clearly demonstrated by Figure 9.1 of my Supplementary Proof of
Evidence which shows both the position of the NAMMU cross-section on which the
pathlines were calculated, (red line) and the line of the geological
cross-section on which the conceptual view of the system was presented (blue
line).  The two cross-sections contain different geological features, in
particular, one intersects the Seascale Fault Zone, whereas the other does not. 
It is, therefore, invalid to draw conclusions from the superposition of these
two sets of information.  The model did not show pathlines penetrating deeply
into the highly saline brines, as incorrectly concluded from this superposition.
 Instead, it showed some mixing between fresh and saline waters, as may be
expected in the transition zone between freshwater and more saline water.
</P>
<P>The behaviour of the pathline in the Seascale Fault Zone follows the
predicted direction of groundwater flow which was calculated by solving the
standard equations for groundwater flow in conjunction with information on rock
properties.  The model reflects the physically realistic behaviour of flow in
the aquifer moving down a fault zone represented, in this case, as being more
permeable than the surrounding rock (see<I> Nirex Report S/94/004</I>, Box H,
pages 14 and 15) [COR/510].
</P>
<P>There is no evidence for a near-vertical groundwater path of the type
implied.  It would not be consistent with the observations of the site, in
particular that the sandstone formations carry significant horizontal flows.  As
discussed in <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14s1.htm#Para8.53">paragraphs 8.53</A> to
8.59 of the Supplementary Proof of Evidence of Dr Chaplow (<B>PE/NRX/14/S1</B>)
observed terrestrial discharges of groundwater are consistent with the
predictions of the current groundwater flow models (see also paragraphs 9.37 to
9.39 and 9.49 below).
</P>
<P>9.33 I would also note that differences between the results of the models
reported in <I>Nirex Report 525</I> [COR/505] and <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522]
reflect the fact that considerably more site data, particularly on the
distribution of salinity, were available when the Nirex 95 models were
developed.  Thus, the modified behaviour to which Dr Starmer refers (PE/CCC/5,
page 36, paragraph 5.2.3) is not an indication that the earlier models did not
behave in a physically reasonable fashion, but indicates the incorporation of
increased knowledge of the site into the modelling process.
</P>
<P><B> Specific Results of the Modelling</B>
</P>
<P>9.34 Two related results of the modelling work are criticised in the Proofs
by Dr Starmer (PE/CCC/5, paragraphs 4.2.1 to 4.2.5, 5.1.9 and 5.2.3) and
Professor Mather (PE/CCC/4, paragraphs 1.30 and 6.6.5).  These are:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD>the locations of the groundwater and radionuclide discharges.  It is

<TD></TD>
<TD>ii.</TD>
<TD>the location and geometry of the radionuclide plume.  It is asserted that &quot;<I>up-welling</I>&quot;

performance analysis.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P> I will demonstrate in paragraphs 9.35 to 9.49 of my Supplementary Proof of
Evidence that neither of these assertions is correct.
</P>
<P> Point i: Marine Discharge
</P>
<P>9.35 In his Section 4.2 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/CCC/5), Dr Starmer
makes a number of claims that relate to the location of radionuclide discharge. 
Dr Starmer asserts that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  the &quot;<I>Nirex safety case</I>&quot; assumes that there will be
marine discharge of radionuclides for the Temperate (current) case and ignores
evidence of discharge of groundwater inland or at the coast (paragraphs 4.2.1,
4.2.2, 4.2.3 and 5.1.9);
</P>
<P>  the assumption of marine discharge is important to the &quot;<I>safety
case</I>&quot; (paragraph 4.2.2);
</P>
<P>  a &quot;<I>more reasonable approach</I>&quot; is to accept that
radionuclide discharge is along the shore or further inland (paragraph 4.2.5);
and
</P>
<P>  such an approach would make the well use scenario more important,
(paragraph 4.2.5).
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.36 My detailed rebuttal of these points is given in paragraphs 9.37 to
9.41 of my Supplementary Proof of Evidence.  In summary, my response is that:
</P>
<P>  marine discharge of radionuclides in Temperate (current) conditions is not
assumed, it is a result of models that are based on the physics of the system. 
Evidence of discharge of groundwater inland is consistent with these results;
</P>
<P>  marine discharge is not crucial to the &quot;<I>safety case</I>&quot; and
terrestrial discharge is also considered;
</P>
<P>  a predominantly terrestrial discharge of radionuclides in present day
conditions (the &quot;<I>more reasonable approach</I>&quot; proposed) is not
consistent with knowledge of the groundwater flow system; and
</P>
<P>  a well calculation for an unrealistic situation is not relevant.
</P>
<P>9.37 The suggestion that marine discharge of radionuclides is an assumption
was also raised by Professor Mather (PE/CCC/4, page vii, paragraph 1.30, and
page 39, paragraph 6.6.5) to whom Dr Starmer refers.  The Supplementary Proof of
Evidence by Dr Chaplow (<B>PE/NRX/14/S1</B>) gives a detailed response to this
point at <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14s1.htm#Para8.53">paragraphs 8.53</A> to 8.59
(pages 74 and 75).  Dr Chaplow points out that the locations of groundwater and
radionuclide discharges are predicted as an output from the modelling and are
not arbitrary assumptions.  The models are based on an understanding of the site
hydrogeology in current (Temperate) conditions, and indicate that, although the
main region of groundwater discharge extends to about 100m offshore, the main
region of radionuclide discharge extends from about a hundred metres offshore to
about a kilometre offshore (see page 2.12 of Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95</I>)
[COR/522].  The models used in <I>Nirex 95</I> do predict some level of
terrestrial discharge of groundwater and radionuclides under the groundwater and
sea level conditions in a Temperate (present day) climate (see Figure 2.6b of
Volume 3 of
<I>Nirex 95</I>).  As will be explained in paragraph 9.40, this is taken into
account in the assessment. 
</P>
<P>9.38 As explained by Dr Chaplow in his original Proof of Evidence (<A
HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm"><B>PE/NRX/14</B></A>), the behaviour predicted by
the models is entirely consistent with the pattern of observations made at the
site which suggest that
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>the upper 150 to 200 metres of the Sherwood Sandstone Group is an
active aquifer system receiving recharge in the higher ground (Borehole 8) and
containing coastward and upward moving freshwater for much of the area where
ground level is below about 100 metres aOD.</I>&quot; (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>, page
41, <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para6.55">paragraphs 6.55</A>paragraph 6.55).
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Dr Chaplow explains in his Supplementary Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14/S1</B>,
pages 74 and 75, <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14s1.htm#Para8.53">paragraphs 8.53</A> to
8.59) that the predictions of the models are also consistent with the
observations quoted by Professor Mather.  As explained in paragraph 9.39 of my
Supplementary Proof of Evidence, this behaviour is also what would be expected
on the basis of the physics of the system.
</P>
<P>9.39 The radionuclides are carried into the upper sandstones by a weak flux
of groundwater from the lower rocks.  The upward flux is much weaker than the
much larger nearly-horizontal flux in the upper sandstones.  This is because the
upward flux is controlled by the effective permeability of the BVG, whereas the
nearly horizontal flux in the upper sandstones is controlled by the effective
permeability of the upper sandstones, which is much larger than the effective
permeability of the BVG.  The pathlines originating from the repository are,
therefore, effectively refracted to lie close to the base of the upper
sandstones and the paths discharge at the outer edge of the groundwater
discharge region.  The radionuclides follow the general route of the pathlines
and spread about this as a result of dispersion.
</P>
<P>9.40 In any case, the condition of marine discharge of radionuclides is not &quot;<I>important
to the Nirex safety case</I>&quot; (PE/CCC/5, paragraph 4.2.2).  In <I>Nirex 5</I>,
Volume 3 [COR/522] no claim for marine discharge is made.  Indeed, the concept
of a fully marine discharge is explicitly discounted in Sections 6.4(a) and 9.1
(pages 6.11 and 9.2, respectively) of that reference.  For example the relevant
text (items (g) and (h)) from page 9.2 is reproduced in full below:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>(g) For discharge of all radionuclides to the marine environment,
risks would be at least three orders of magnitude below the regulatory target
(see Section 6).  However, in the Temperate climate state, groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport calculations show that it is likely there would be a
certain proportion of terrestrial discharge of radionuclides.  The risks in the
Temperate climate state would then be given to a good approximation by the
Temperate terrestrial risk multiplied by the proportion of the discharge that is
terrestrial.  For instance, the peak risk from
<SUP>36</SUP>Cl for a case in which 25% of the discharge of radionuclides is to
a Temperate terrestrial environment would be 3 10<SUP>-8</SUP>.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> (h) The Boreal climate state will be associated with a lower sea level
than the current sea level.  Discharge is therefore likely to be terrestrial. 
The peak risks in the Boreal terrestrial state are 1.1 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at
20,000 years after closure and 3.3 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at 4 million years after
closure.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.41 Therefore, the statement that a marine discharge is assumed and is
relied on, is unjustified.  However, the validity of the prediction of a largely
marine discharge of radionuclides under Temperate climate conditions is
established in paragraphs 9.37 to 9.39 above.  Thus, a predominantly terrestrial
discharge of radionuclides in present day conditions (the &quot;<I>more
reasonable approach</I>&quot; proposed by Dr Starmer, (PE/CCC/5, paragraph
4.2.5)) is not consistent with knowledge of the groundwater flow system and
hence is not more reasonable.  The effect of an unrealistic scenario on the well
calculation is, by definition, not relevant.  That a certain proportion of the
radionuclide discharge in temperate conditions will be terrestrial is accounted
for in the calculations performed in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522].
</P>
<P> Point ii: Plume Location and Geometry
</P>
<P>9.42 In his Proof of Evidence (PE/CCC/5, paragraphs 4.3.1 and 4.3.2, pages
24 and 25, Section 4.4, pages 25 to 27), Dr Starmer discusses a number of issues
related to the location, geometry and concentration of the radionuclide plume. 
In particular he asserts in PE/CCC/5 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>up-welling</I>&quot; associated with the Fleming Hall Fault Zone
is not addressed in the <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522] analysis (paragraph 4.3.1);
</P>
<P> water could move up preferential pathways associated with the Fleming Hall
Fault Zone and &quot;<I>short circuit</I>&quot; the plume (paragraph 4.3.1);
</P>
<P> the Seascale Fault Zone has been identified as a low permeability barrier
and could force the plume closer to the surface (paragraph 4.3.2);
</P>
<P> these effects could increase predicted risk dramatically (paragraph 4.3.2);
</P>
<P> more realistic well calculations are likely to lead to higher risks
(paragraph 4.4.2); and
</P>
<P> evidence exists for a regime of significant groundwater upflow that could
bring &quot;<I>contaminants</I>&quot; to the surface (or near the surface) in
the vicinity of the repository (paragraph 4.3.2).
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.43 My response to these points is given in detail in paragraphs 9.44 to
9.49 of my Supplementary Proof of Evidence.  In brief my response is that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  upflow in the Fleming Hall Fault Zone is actually accounted for in <I>Nirex
95</I> [COR/522];
</P>
<P>   the inclusion of this upflow may be a conservatism in the <I>Nirex 95</I>
models.  Dr Starmer suggests no mechanism to &quot;<I>short circuit</I>&quot;
the plume;
</P>
<P>  although the evidence quoted by Dr Starmer (PE/CCC/5, paragraph 4.3.2) for
the Seascale Fault Zone being a barrier does not support the proposition, the
possibility of reduced permeability across this zone is also accounted for in
<I>Nirex 95</I>;
</P>
<P>   there is therefore no support for the dramatic increase in risk suggested
by Dr Starmer;
</P>
<P>  there is no evidence for this proposition, current risks are thought to
have been overestimated; and
</P>
<P>  there is no evidence to support the regime of groundwater upflow suggested
by Dr Starmer.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.44 It is difficult to understand why Dr Starmer should suggest that upflow
in the Fleming Hall Fault Zone is not addressed in
<I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522], given that his quoted evidence for the effect is
Figures 2.6a and 2.11 of Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95</I>.  These Figures show,
respectively, the groundwater flow field of the base-case groundwater flow model
and the calculated radionuclide plume used in the agricultural well calculation.
 A submodel representing flow and transport in the Fleming Hall Fault Zone is
explicitly included in the MASCOT model (see <I>Nirex 95</I>, Volume 3, page
2.15).  The development of the radionuclide plume calculated in <I>Nirex 95</I>
(see <I>Nirex 95</I>, Figure 2.12 of Volume 3) clearly shows the effect of
upflow in the Fleming Hall Fault Zone carrying radionuclides towards the
surface.  Thus the effects of &quot;<I>up-welling</I>&quot; in the Fleming Hall
Fault Zone is explicitly included in the performance analysis.
</P>
<P>9.45 As noted in paragraph 9.44 of my Supplementary Proof of Evidence, the
performance analysis does take account of movement up the preferential pathway
associated with the Fleming Hall Fault Zone.  It is worth noting that inclusion
of this pathway may be a pessimism in the current assessment, as the Fleming
Hall Fault Zone may well not behave as a high permeability feature, as was
assumed in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522].  This would lead to lower risks from the
agricultural well as the plume would not be preferentially carried up the flow
path associated with the fault zone.
</P>
<P>9.46 Dr Starmer also suggests (PE/CCC/5, paragraph 4.3.1) that water may &quot;<I>short
circuit even the plume</I>&quot;.  Clearly, for this to happen there would have
to be a physical mechanism to move the radionuclide.  The movement of the plume
is the result of groundwater flow and dispersive and diffusive processes.  Thus,
if the plume is to be short-circuited, a physical mechanism in addition to those
listed in the last sentence must operate.  However, Dr Starmer does not suggest
any physical mechanism to produce the &quot;<I>short circuit</I>&quot; that he
suggests.  I would draw attention to the fact that the agricultural well is a
mechanism to produce such a &quot;<I>short circuit</I>&quot; and that this
effect is included in the <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522] analysis.
</P>
<P>9.47 The suggestion that the Seascale Fault Zone is a &quot;<I>low
permeability barrier</I>&quot; (PE/CCC/5, paragraph 4.3.2) refers to the Proof
of Evidence of Professor Mather (PE/CCC/4) but does not give a precise
reference.  The intended reference may be at paragraph 6.4.11, page 28 of
PE/CCC/4 which states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>For example, the representation of head contours across the
Seascale Fault Zone in Nirex Report No. 524 Vol. 3 (COR/517) interprets the
fault as a barrier or a low hydraulic feature.....</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Again, the reference is not precise but the intended passage may be that on
page 4&#173;8 of Volume 3 of <I>Nirex Report 524</I> [COR/517] in which Figure
4.5 of that Volume is discussed.  This Figure shows head contours on an
approximately north-south cross-section.  The text on page 4-8 discusses a
stepped increase in head of 60m observed across the top part of the Brockram in
Borehole 11.  The relevant statement from page 4-8 of <I>Report 524</I>
[COR/517] is:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>This representation of the head contours interprets the Seascale
Faults and Brockram as low hydraulic conductivity features which confine the
underlying heads.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> It is clear that the reference is to a low permeability capping feature
which confines head values below the level of the Brockram.  Thus, there is no
reference to low permeability barriers, in the sense of features that could
drive flow upwards within the sandstone units nearer the surface, which would be
the region relevant to the discussion by Dr Starmer.  However, on the
recommendation of the expert group that developed the conceptual model for <I>Nirex
95</I> [COR/522], a reduction in permeability across the Seascale Fault Zone was
actually included in <I>Nirex 95</I> (Figure 5.1 of Volume 2).  In the
<I>Nirex 95</I> calculations of radionuclide transport the highest near-surface
concentrations in the plume at early times lie between the Seascale and Fleming
Hall Fault Zones (<I>Nirex 95</I>, Figure 2.12 of Volume 3), carried by the
flow in the high permeability zone associated with the Fleming Hall Fault Zone. 
As noted in paragraph 9.45 above this representation of the Fleming Hall Fault
Zone may be conservative.  Dr Starmer suggests (PE/CCC/5, paragraph 4.3.2) that
if the effects of the fault zones discussed above, (i.e. the Seascale Fault Zone
being a low permeability barrier and upflow occurring in the Fleming Hall Fault
Zone) were incorporated into the risk calculations, risk could increase
dramatically.  It has been demonstrated in paragraphs 9.44 to 9.47 that these
effects are already accounted for in the assessment.  Thus, there is no argument
on this basis for a dramatic increase in risk.
</P>
<P>9.48 In his Proof of Evidence (PE/CCC/5, Section 4.4), Dr Starmer makes
several comments on the well scenario.  In particular, Dr Starmer states
(PE/CCC/5, page 26, paragraph 4.4.3) that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  &quot;<I>The results of the variant calculations presented in Chapter 7
of COR/522, Vol 3 indicate that radionuclide concentrations in groundwater may
be higher than base case concentrations and could easily increase risk by an
order of magnitude (Figures 7.23-7.26 of COR/522, Vol 3).</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> It is difficult to understand the basis for this statement.  Table 7.7 of
Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522] presents the deterministic peak risk for
the base case and variant calculations.  It can be seen that in those cases in
which there is an increase in risk, the increase is a factor of about 2 to 3. 
In some variants the risk is actually lower than in the base case.  Therefore,
calculations for the well scenario performed on the basis of the variant
groundwater flow calculations could either slightly decrease or slightly
increase the calculated risk.  When considering possible well calculations, it
is important to bear in mind that the current well calculation may contain
several pessimisms.  As noted in paragraphs 8.35 and 8.36 of my Supplementary
Proof of Evidence, the radionuclide concentrations and hence the associated
risks are thought to have been overestimated, because the degree of dilution of
radionuclide concentrations by recent meteoric water may have been
underestimated (Section 6.7, page 6.19, Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95</I>).  In
addition, as noted in paragraph 9.45 of my Supplementary Proof of Evidence, the
treatment of the Fleming Hall Fault Zone as a high permeability feature may be a
pessimism in the current assessment.  Thus, the contention by Dr Starmer
(PE/CCC/5, page 26, paragraph 4.4.2) that the risk &quot;<I>is likely to move
to higher risks rather than lower risks as a better and more realistic picture
of the site emerges.</I>&quot; is not justified.
</P>
<P>9.49 Dr Starmer also suggests (PE/CCC/5, paragraph 4.3.2) that there is
evidence of an upward flow and transport regime that could bring contaminants to
the surface in the vicinity of the repository.  This general topic has already
been discussed in paragraphs 9.32 and 9.37 to 9.39 of my Supplementary Proof of
Evidence.  In paragraph 4.3.1 (page 24) of PE/CCC/5, Dr Starmer refers to the
suggestions in the <I>Fourteenth Annual Report of RWMAC</I> (paragraph 3.23,
page 16 of GOV/406) that were discussed in paragraphs 9.30 to 9.33 of my
Supplementary Proof of Evidence.  As indicated in those paragraphs, there is no
evidence for the flow paths suggested in that report [GOV/406].  In paragraph
4.3.2 (page 25) of PE/CCC/5, Dr Starmer refers to conclusions drawn by Professor
Mather regarding upward flow paths (no precise reference is given but Dr Starmer
may be referring to paragraphs 6.5.5 and 6.5.6, page 31 of PE/CCC/4).  A
detailed response to Professor Mather's comments in paragraph 6.5.5 (page 31) of
PE/CCC/4 is given in Dr Chaplow's Supplementary Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14/S1</B>,
pages 95 to 98, <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14s1.htm#Para9.11">paragraphs 9.11</A> to
9.20).  Dr Chaplow concludes that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>it is inappropriate for Professor Mather to conclude that the
observed salinity profiles are indicators of significant upward flow.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Thus there is no support for the type of flow regime suggested by Dr
Starmer.

<P> I will demonstrate in the following paragraphs that these assertions are
not valid.
</P>
<P> Point i: Short Paths and Rock Matrix Diffusion
</P>
<P>9.51 In Section 4.5, pages 27 to 29 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/CCC/5), Dr
Starmer discusses various issues which he suggests are not treated appropriately
in the modelling presented in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522].  He suggests that if
these issues were taken into account, the calculated risk would be considerably
increased.  The main points made by Dr Starmer appear to be:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>shorter flow paths result in shorter travel times (PE/CCC/5, pages 27 and
28, paragraphs 4.5.1 and 4.5.4);
</LI>
<LI>flow paths derived from NAPSAC may overestimate travel times because they
are longer than the straight line distance between points (PE/CCC/5, page 28,
paragraph 4.5.3);
</LI>
<LI>the choice of parameter distributions unreasonably screens out extreme
values and fast paths (PE/CCC/5, page 28, paragraph 4.5.3);
</LI>
<LI>maximum benefit from matrix diffusion is assumed (PE/CCC/5, page 28,
paragraph 4.5.3);
</LI>
<LI>fracture flow models give earlier breakthrough than equivalent porous
medium models, and the resulting fast paths could increase risk (PE/CCC/5, page
28, paragraph 4.5.4); and
</LI>
<LI>putting all of these effects together could give a considerable increase in
risk (PE/CCC/5, page 29, paragraph 4.5.5).
</LI></UL>
<P> In paragraphs 9.52 to 9.59 of my Supplementary Proof of Evidence I will
rebut each of these points in turn and thus demonstrate that, as the steps in Dr
Starmer's argument are invalid, his conclusion is not valid.
</P>
<P>9.52 Dr Starmer states (PE/CCC/5, page 27, paragraph 4.5.1) that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The length of the flow path is an important factor in determining
the length of time for radionuclides released from the repository to reach the
surface.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> and (PE/CCC/5, page 28, paragraph 4.5.4) that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Short flow paths lead to shorter travel times due to distance,</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.53 The second statement is wrong.  A shorter path does not automatically
imply a shorter travel time.  Both the path length and the travel time are
determined by the groundwater velocities along the path that is followed.  These
determine where the path goes.  The groundwater velocities will, in turn, depend
on the properties of the hydrogeological units that are encountered along the
path and the forces driving the flow.  It is the physics of the flow system that
determines the travel time and path length, not simply the geometry of the path.
</P>
<P>9.54 In connection with the flow paths derived from NAPSAC, Dr Starmer
states (PE/CCC/5, page 28, paragraph 4.5.3) that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The flow paths derived from NAPSAC runs are likely to be longer
than the &quot;straight line&quot; distance from point to point.</I>&quot;<I></I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> This is not disputed.  It simply reflects the fact that the flow and
transport takes place in the network of transmissive features.  The NAPSAC
calculations will tend to find the easiest way through the system, but will also
explore the potential variability around these preferred routes.  The categories
of path obtained from the NAPSAC calculations are described on page 2.8 of
Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522].  However, Dr Starmer seems to be
suggesting that there are shorter &quot;<I>straight line</I>&quot; paths, which
will be faster because they are shorter and which should be considered.  This
argument is not valid for two reasons.  First, as noted above, the idea that a
shorter path will necessarily be faster is not valid.  Second, the
fracture-network models have been constructed to represent current understanding
of the site, based on the data from the site investigation.  Thus, high
permeability features will appear in the models at a frequency consistent with
current understanding of the site.  There are no scientific grounds for adding
arbitrary extra paths to the models.  To do so would be an unwarranted
assumption, with no basis in the site data.  Investigation of alternative
conceptual models of the fracture system and the evalution of these models by
comparison with site data is part of the ongoing programme of scientific work at
the site.  The RCF will play an important role in the development of these
models.
</P>
<P>9.55 Dr Starmer suggests (PE/CCC/5, page 28, paragraph 4.5.3) that because
the probability density functions for effective permeability used in <I>Nirex
95</I> [COR/522] are log-triangular, extreme values of permeability have &quot;<I>much
less chance of being picked</I>&quot;.  The probability density functions used
represented the uncertainty about the corresponding parameter values.  The fact
that values of, for example, effective permeability away from the centre of its
distribution are less probable than values at the centre is to be expected.  It
reflects the fact that values near the centre were considered to be more likely,
the extent to which they were more likely being quantified by the probability
density function.  The probability density functions were derived by a process
of structured data elicitation (see <I>Nirex Report S/94/002</I>, page 9,Box D)
[COR/508] and Appendix 1 of Volume 1 of <I>Nirex 95</I> or by analysis of the
available data and appropriate upscaling procedures (see Volume 2 of <I>Nirex
95</I>).  In the latter case, in particular, the fact that the probability
density function decreases towards its tails reflects the fact that parameter
values far from the central values are less likely to be consistent with the
experimental measurements of permeability from which the distributions were
determined, than values near the centre of the distribution.
</P>
<P>9.56 Log-triangular probability density functions were considered to be
reasonable approximations to the actual distributions of the individual
parameters considered in isolation.  It is worth noting that the fact that the
probability density functions used decrease towards their tails is not just a
property of the log-triangular distributions used.  Similar behaviour would be
shown by other realistic possible forms of distribution, such as log-normal
probability density functions.
</P>
<P>9.57 In connection with <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522], Dr Starmer states that &quot;<I>Matrix
diffusion is used at a maximum value by Nirex</I>&quot; (PE/CCC/5, page 28,
paragraph 4.5.3).  This is not the case.  In the MASCOT calculations of risk,
the process of diffusion into the rock matrix away from fractures is modelled
explicitly in those hydrogeological units in which groundwater flow was
considered to occur predominantly in fractures (see Section 2.1.3 (page 2.6) and
Sections 4.2 and 4.4 (pages 4.3 to 4.7) of Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95</I>). 
Therefore, the extent to which radionuclides diffuse into the matrix is
determined during the MASCOT calculations, and depends on the probabilistically
selected values of the parameters that control rock-matrix diffusion, such as
the intrinsic diffusivity.  The distributions of values used for these
parameters were based on experimental data from the Nirex Safety Assessment
Research Programme (see Section 5.12.2, pages 5.20 and 5.21 of Volume 2 of <I>Nirex
95</I>).  Exclusion processes were taken into account; the effects of
channelling within fractures were also taken into account using a conservative
treatment (see Section 4.2, page 4.5 of Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95</I>).
</P>
<P>9.58 Dr Starmer states (PE/CCC/5, paragraph 4.5.4) that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>flow along fractures also yields earlier breakthrough than the
equivalent porous medium model</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> His argument would appear to be that the <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522] 
analysis will be predicting travel times that are unrealistically long because
of this effect.  Dr Starmer's point is not relevant to the <I>Nirex 95</I>
analysis in which, for example, the travel times in the BVG were obtained from
the NAPSAC model which explicitly represents the network of transmissive
features in the BVG (see Section 2.2.2, pages 2.7 to 2.9 of Volume 3 of <I>Nirex
95</I>).
</P>
<P>9.59 I have demonstrated that the steps of Dr Starmer's argument are not
valid. Dr Starmer's conclusion that putting all these effects together could
give a considerable increase in risk is therefore unsustainable.
</P>
<P> Point ii: Processes That Could Reduce Dilution
</P>
<P>9.60 In Section 4.6 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/CCC/5, pages 29 and 30) Dr
Starmer notes the analysis of dilution factors that is performed in <I>Nirex 95</I>
[COR/522].  In connection with these, he asserts that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>the lower end of the range of the dilution factors (which he implies has
been eliminated in <I>Nirex 95</I>) could &quot;<I>readily reduce the
beneficial effect of dilution incorporated into the risk calculations</I>&quot;;
and
</P>
<P>various phenomena could reduce the dilution factor and give rise to greater
calculated risks.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> My response to these points is given in detail in paragraphs 9.61 to 9.64
of my Supplementary Proof of Evidence.  In outline, my response to the first
point is that, the lower end of the dilution range is not actually eliminated
and to the second that, on the whole, the phenomena suggested are already
included in the assessment.
</P>
<P>9.61 Dr Starmer's paragraph 4.6.2 (PE/CCC/5, page 29) suggests that he
believes that the range of dilution factors of 4 to 100,000 stated by Nirex was
actually used in the calculations of risk reported in Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95</I>
[COR/522], but that the lower end of the range had been eliminated.  This is not
the case.  The quoted range of dilution factors was derived from an analytical
calculation performed to aid understanding and only took account of uncertainty
in one of the effective hydrogeological parameters.  As the MASCOT realisations
take account of the uncertainty in many more parameters, the range of effective
dilution factors included in the MASCOT risk calculations is potentially wider
than than quoted above.  It is likely that the MASCOT calculations will include
cases with dilution factors that are too small to be compatible with the site
data.  Considerations of the validity of the extremes of the quoted range
therefore have no impact on the risk calculations.  This is a potential
conservatism in the calculations of risk.
</P>
<P>9.62 Dr Starmer suggests (PE/CCC/5, page 29, paragraph 4.6.2) that flow
along preferential pathways, short circuits to the surface, a reduced release
area, or vertical movement along the Fleming Hall Fault Zone could considerably
reduce dilution.  This is a similar point to that made in his paragraphs 4.3.1
and 4.3.2 and the reply is thus similar to that given in paragraphs 9.43 to 9.49
of my Supplementary Proof of Evidence.  Many of these phenomena are already
included in the <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522] models, so that there is little basis
for the arbitrary numerical factors suggested by Dr Starmer to increase risk
further.
</P>
<P>9.63 Figures 2.6a and 2.11 of Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522]  show,
respectively, the groundwater flow field of the base-case groundwater flow model
and the calculated radionuclide plume used in the agricultural well calculation.
 Flow up the preferential pathway associated with the Fleming Hall Fault Zone
can be seen  in Figure 2.6a.  The development of the radionuclide plume
calculated in <I>Nirex 95</I> (see Figure 2.12 of Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95</I>)
clearly shows the effect of this upflow in the Fleming Hall Fault Zone carrying
radionuclides towards the surface.  Thus preferential flow along the Fleming
Hall Fault Zone is explicitly included in the performance analysis.  Inclusion
of this pathway may be a pessimism in the current assessment (see paragraph 9.45
of my Supplementary Proof of Evidence).
</P>
<P>9.64 As noted in paragraph 9.46 of my Supplementary Proof of Evidence, if
there is to be a &quot;<I>short circuit</I>&quot; there must be a physical
mechanism to move the radionuclide.  However, Dr Starmer again does not suggest
any physical mechanism to produce the short circuit that he suggests.  I note
that the agricultural well is a mechanism to produce such a short circuit and
that this effect is included in the <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522] analysis. 
Similarly, the predicted release area offshore is obtained from a model that
incorporates the physics of the system.  A suggestion that this area might be an
overestimate should be based on a physical argument.  As it stands, paragraph
4.6.2 (PE/CCC/5) is speculation, with no basis in a physical description of the
system.
</P>
<P> Point iii: Screening of the Radionuclide Inventory
</P>
<P>9.65 Dr Starmer's comments in Section 5.3 (PE/CCC/5, pages 37 and 38)
indicate a fundamental misunderstanding of the treatment of the radionuclide
inventory in <I>Nirex 95</I>[COR/522].  He states in paragraph 5.3.1 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> &quot;<I>the <B>screening</B> of radionuclides left the suite Cl-36,
Tc-99, I-129 and (U-238) as the important radionuclides.  An important point is
that this <B>selection</B> has been predicated by assumptions that have not
been fully tested</I>&quot; [my emphases]<I>.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Thus he appears to believe that only these four radionuclides were
considered in the risk calculations.  This is not the case.  The wide range of
radionuclides used in the MASCOT calculation of risk is given in Table 6.1 of
Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522].  Of these, only the four discussed by Dr
Starmer were found to make a significant contribution to risk in the various
Biosphere states.
</P>
<P> Dr Starmer refers to page 8.4 of Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95</I> in connection
with the &quot;<I>selection</I>&quot; of the radionuclides and does not seem to
have appreciated that the purpose of Section 8 of Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95</I>
is only to aid understanding of system performance.  The calculations of risk
reported in Section 6 of Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95</I> were not carried out using
this description, rather they aided its development.  The same misunderstanding
seems to have arisen concerning the dilution analysis discussed in Sections 2
and 8 of Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95</I> (see paragraph 9.61 of my Supplementary
Proof of Evidence).
</P>
<P>9.66 That this misunderstanding of the inventory that is included in <I>Nirex
95</I> [COR/522] has indeed occured is confirmed by the comment that Dr Starmer
makes in ( PE/CCC/5, page 38, paragraph 5.3.3) that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>it is notable that Tc-99 shows up in the Boreal terrestrial and
Temperate marine analysis but<B> is not included </B></I>[my emphasis]<I>in
the analysis of the Temperate terrestrial or periglacial analyses (Table 6.18 in
COR/522)</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The Table referred to (in Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95</I>) shows the
radionuclides which were found from the results of the MASCOT calculations to
make a significant contribution to risk in the various Biosphere states.  Thus,
Dr Starmer's comments are based on a misconception of the work that was
performed.
</P>
<P> Point iv: Effects of Climate Change
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.67"></A>9.67 The Proof of Evidence by Dr Starmer (PE/CCC/5)
contain discussions of the potential effects of climate change.  Several of
these are addressed in Section 8 of my Supplementary Proof of Evidence. 
However, two further effects relating to the groundwater flow regime are
addressed in this Section.  First, the suggestion that melting of permafrost
would give rise to increased infiltration (PE/CCC/5, paragraph 5.1.6).  Second,
that a period of a diffusion dominated transport could lead to changes in flow
paths and in repository performance (PE/CCC/5, paragraphs 5.1.4 and 5.1.6).
</P>
<P>9.68 In paragraph 5.1.6 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/CCC/5) Dr Starmer
refers to the <I>Fourteenth Annual Report of the RWMAC</I> (page 19, paragraph
3.30) [GOV/406] and claims that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>increased infiltration in the highlands east of the Sellafield
site due to the melting of permafrost has been cited by RWMAC</I>&quot;<I>.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> However, the RWMAC reference (page 19, paragraph 3.30) [GOV/406] is not
arguing for increased infiltration associated with melting but decreased
infiltration associated with permafrost, followed by a return to present day
infiltration conditions.  This can be seen from the statements in the same
paragraph that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>during the Pleistocene Ice Age and the following period, when
frozen ground tundra conditions existed, there would have been little fresh
water infiltration into the BVG </I>......... <I>only when the ice melted and
the ground thawed, ten thousand years ago or so, would infiltration of fresh
water, through rainfall have started.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Thus the argument for increased infiltration is not supported.
</P>
<P>9.69 Dr Starmer suggests (PE/CCC/5, page 32, paragraph 5.1.4) a number of
possible effects of a period of diffusion dominated transport.  He suggests
that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>A period of slow diffusion of radionuclides to the flow system in
the repository during reduced flow conditions followed by increased flow driven
by increased fresh water infiltration in the highlands, as appears to be the
case now, could lead to flushing a pulse of more concentrated pore water from
the repository than is now considered under the base case or variants.  This
could change the overall conceptual model of repository evolution and
performance in the ice ages timeframe (10e4 to 10e5 years).</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The scenario suggested by Dr Starmer would lead to a reduction in
calculated risk.  This can be seen from the simple understanding of system
performance given in Sections 8.2.2 and 8.2.3 (pages 8.6 to 8.12)  of Volume 3
of <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522].  This discussion demonstrates that the important
factors influencing performance are the geosphere and source term spreading
times.  The source term spreading time for a radionuclide is a measure of the
timescale for release of the radionuclide from the repository.  The geosphere
spreading time is a measure of the timescale for radionuclide transport through
the geosphere.  It can be seen from Figure 8.8 of Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95</I>
that a significant increase in the source term spreading time leads to a
reduction in the risk arising from chlorine&#173;36, which is the most
significant radionuclide in the timescale that Dr Starmer discusses.  Dr
Starmer's scenario of a period of low flow would lead to a significant increase
in the source term spreading time and hence to a reduction in risk.  I also note
that the time frame which he proposes for the period of &quot;<I>slow diffusion</I>&quot;
roughly coincides with the time of the early risk peak (largely due to chlorine&#173;36)
in the base case calculation (Figure 6.6 of Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95</I>).  A
period of low flow would delay the arrival of this peak.  With the combination
of these effects, Dr Starmer's scenario could lead to a significant reduction in
predicted peak risk.
</P>
<P>9.70 A related suggestion by Dr Starmer (PE/CCC/5, paragraph 5.1.6) is that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>under both a mediterranean and periglacial climate scenario, for
example, the infiltration of water might be reduced, leading to a change from
advective flow to diffusive flow, and flow paths could change at that point</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> It is certainly true that a change to diffusion dominated transport would
lead to different transport pathways, because of the differences between
advective and diffusive transport.  However, such a change would also lead to a
much smaller rate of removal of radionuclides from the repository and a much
slower rate of transfer of radionuclides to the biosphere, that is a significant
increase in both the geosphere and source-term spreading times discussed in
paragraph 9.69.  As can be seen from Figure 8.8 of Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95</I>
[COR/522], such a scenario would lead to lower risks.  In suggesting that these
scenarios are worthy of consideration, Dr Starmer is effectively suggesting that
the analysis presented in Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522] could have
significantly overestimated risk, not underestimated it.

<P>10.1 Several of the Objectors' Proofs of Evidence raise the issue of
'validation'.  The purpose of this section of my Supplementary Proof of Evidence
is to explain the accepted definition and approach to validation in the context
of radioactive waste safety assessment and to explain how Nirex is addressing
the issue, in particular with respect to the RCF work programme.  The passages

<P>10.2 In the next four paragraphs of this Section I summarise the argument
put forward by each Objector in turn along with my summary response.  I will
then set out, at paragraphs 10.8 to 10.26 in more general terms, an explanation
of the role of validation in radioactive waste safety assessment followed by an
outline of the process of validation in the Nirex programme. An outline of the 
validation cycles for groundwater flow models which Nirex has performed and is
undertaking is presented. Future validation cycles, both prior to and during the
course of  Phase 1 RCF are set out in the Appendix to this Supplementary Proof

<TD>At paragraph 3.28 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/5), Dr Salmon asserts
that &quot;<I>there is an urgent need to further validate  the model</I>&quot;
(NAMMU) and states that Nirex has ignored opportunities to do this. In
particular, he identifies work associated with the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test and
the impact of the RCF shafts as missed opportunities. I explain at paragraph
10.18 of my Supplementary Proof why Dr Salmon is mistaken in these assertions
and that such work is already underway or is planned. Dr Salmon asserts, in
paragraph 3.92, that &quot;<I>I nevertheless remain doubtful that an adequate
validation can be achieved....</I>&quot;. I explain in paragraphs 10.17  to

(paragraph 4.28) that the authors of  GOV/610 were &quot;<I>....led to believe
that modelling of the expected influence of the RCF....would be undertaken
before shaft construction proceeds</I>&quot;<I>.</I>  I describe at paragraph

that we are currently following a validation process incorporating appropriate
peer review.

<TD WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD>At paragraph 3.6 of his Proof  of Evidence (PE/FOE/6), Dr Hencher concludes
that &quot;<I>...to proceed to the RCF stage of repository development prior to
satisfactory completion of underlying generic research work and validation of
numerical models would be premature and ill-conceived</I>.&quot; I believe that
this shows a misunderstanding of the process of validation, as set out below at
paragraphs 10.8 to 10.16. It also fails to appreciate the essential role that
the RCF itself is designed to play in the validation process, which is explained
below;</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>ii.</TD>
<TD>At paragraph 8.5 of his Proof of Evidence, Dr Hencher quotes
<I>Dr Long</I> (FOE/6/11) on the modelling of fractured rock hydrogeology. 
That quotation  can be taken as strong support for the need to validate flow
modelling approaches. <I>Dr Long </I>(FOE/6/11) also says that &quot;<I>Probably
the most important progress will be made simply by trying to create predictive
models for an increasing number of sites.</I>&quot;  (Section 11.10, page 292).
The work which we propose for the RCF (as described in the remainder of this
Section of my Supplementary Proof), may be seen as a key contribution to the
progress which she envisages;</TD></TR>

<TD>At paragraph 9.4 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/6), Dr Hencher asserts
that &quot;<I>Reported success rates of such validation tests are not high</I>&quot;
(referring to flow in fractured rocks) and goes on to quote a number of examples
which he asserts illustrate that (PE/FOE/6, paragraph 9.11)<I></I>&quot;<I>...processes
of model validation for flow through fracture networks is at an early stage.</I>&quot;
 He also states (paragraph 11.6) that &quot;<I>... the simple answer is that
discrete fracture flow models have not yet been validated in the fields.</I>&quot;
I disagree with Dr Hencher and address this issue of the success or otherwise of
previous validation exercises at paragraph 10.16 below; and</TD></TR>

<TD>In Section 10 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/6), Dr Hencher appears to be
saying that validation work is only appropriate to an underground research
laboratory (URL) and not an RCF, which he describes (paragraph 10.5) as &quot;<I>merely
the confirmatory underground stage of geological investigation</I>&quot;<I></I>(for
a repository). This, together with his assertion (paragraph 11.2) that &quot;<I>the
emphasis given by Nirex is on confirmation rather than experimentation or
validation</I>&quot; again displays a lack of understanding of the process of
validation and the way in which it is an integral part of Nirex's RCF programme.
This is discussed further in paragraph 10.10 of my Supplementary Proof. His
assertion (paragraph 11.7) that &quot;.<I>..the prognosis of  Nirex achieving
validation during the sinking of shafts is not good</I>&quot; is subjective and
unjustified.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><B> Dr Mackay (PE/GNP/2)</B>
</P>
<P>10.6 In paragraphs 2.18 to 2.22 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/GNP/2), Dr
Mackay raises a number of issues concerning the extent to which validation of
flow models will be achieved in Phase 1 of the RCF programme and whether
acceptance criteria have been developed for use in the validation process. I
discuss these matters in detail below at paragraphs 10.11, and in Sections A2
and A3 of the Appendix to my Supplementary Proof of Evidence and explain that
work is underway or planned which will answer Dr Mackay's concerns.

and paragraphs 10.17 to 10.26 then outline of the process of validation in the
Nirex programme. 
</P>
<P><B>  The Validation Process
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para10.8"></A>10.8 In radioactive waste safety assessment,
validation is the term applied to the iterative process of building confidence
in the fitness for purpose of models used in developing a performance assessment
for a repository and in the predictions they make. As discussed in
<A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para6.11">paragraph 6.11</A> of my Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>),
the validation process can be used to discriminate between alternative
conceptual models, to refine a given conceptual model and to confirm that a
conceptual model is fit for the purpose for which it is intended.  The process
of validation involves testing model predictions against independent
observations and evaluating them against a set of performance measures within a
peer review framework. 
</P>
<P>10.9 The International Atomic Energy Agency defines validation as [COR/519],
(page 11):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>..... a process carried out by comparison of model predictions
with independent field observations and experimental measurements. A model
cannot be considered validated until sufficient testing has been performed to
ensure an acceptable level of predictive accuracy. (Note that the acceptable
level of accuracy is judgmental and will vary depending on the specific problem
or question to be addressed by the model).</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para10.10"></A>10.10 Nirex has addressed the process of validation
within a formal framework which, for any given process or mechanism of interest
in an assessment, will involve a series of steps, undertaken in an iterative
manner. The completion of the sequence of steps comprises a 'validation cycle'
and successive validation cycles should result in a gradual and demonstrable
improvement in important models underpinning the performance assessment. A
validation cycle comprises the following steps:

<P>10.11 The performance  measures, which will enable assessment of the
acceptability of a model,  should be set in advance of the tests. These measures
must be defined on a model specific basis and with knowledge of the model's
intended use.  The measures must also take account of a range of possible
uncertainties which may arise from: measurement uncertainty; conceptual
uncertainty; the simplifications imposed by the manner in which the numerical
modelling code abstracts a specific problem; and   parameter uncertainty. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para10.12"></A>10.12 Predictions may be made prior to, during or
after independent data are gathered. If made during or after data acquisition
then special care must be taken to ensure that independence is not compromised.
The most powerful technique in terms of building confidence is that of making
forward predictions prior to data gathering. In this case, the actual
observations against which predictions are being made may be kept from the
modelling group(s), who are only supplied with sufficient information to make
the predictions, in a 'knowledge environment' similar to that in which they may
be using the models to make predictions in a safety assessment. This technique
is known as 'blind predictive modelling', and is used by Nirex. 
</P>
<P>10.13 These steps are repeated in a cyclical fashion to accommodate
improvements in understanding, in the scope and descriptive capability of the
models (e.g. their ability to predict behaviour at different scales) and in the
quantity and quality of site investigation and other data available to them. It
is important to appreciate that validation is not intended to produce an
absolute result, but rather to achieve an acceptable level of predictive
accuracy (<I>Glossary of Scientific Terms, </I>       page 11) [COR/519]. 
Improvements to conceptual models are always possible, but it is important to
have confidence that the models used are fit for the purpose which they are
required.  Such confidence can be enhanced by exposing the validation process 
to peer review.
</P>
<P>10.14 A key aspect in validation is the progressive identification and,
where possible, reduction of uncertainties about the models and their
predictions. <I>Dr Long </I>(FOE/6/11) discusses the need for this cyclical
approach as a means of identifying and reducing uncertainties at page 290:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>There are never enough data and the conceptual model can always be
questioned. Consequently, it is not possible to construct a unique model of
fracture flow. Given this situation, it is probably better to view the data as
determining a series of possible models from which a series of predictions can
be made..............With a series of models, it is possible to quantify the
error associated with using the models to make a prediction. This means that the
model is judged by its ability to predict the system response
accurately.........The more numerous and diverse types of predictions that can
be included in the estimate of prediction error, the more confidence is
generated in the model........This is the essence of the iterative approach:
cycles of measurement and prediction are repeated until the addition of new data
does little for the ability to make predictions.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> As discussed in the following paragraphs of this Supplementary Proof, this
is the approach currently being used by Nirex.
</P>
<P>10.15 Some of the Objectors, for example Dr Hencher, (PE/FOE/6, paragraph
3.6)  appear to believe that modelling approaches have to be completely &quot;<I>pre-validated</I>&quot;
in a generic sense before Nirex uses them at the Sellafield site.  The essence
of validation is to quantify uncertainties until the modelling approach is fit
its for purpose when required.  International experience, as recently focused in
the INTRAVAL project (see <I>Royal Society Study Group Report</I>, page 88)
[COR/605] in which Nirex was actively involved, has identified a general
agreement that models cannot be validated generically and that it is thus
necessary to demonstrate that models are applicable to a specific site of
interest. In other words, validation cannot be divorced from the site to which
it is intended to apply the models. 
</P>
<P>10.16 Statements in Dr Hencher's Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/6, paragraphs
9.4, 9.11 and 11.6) assert that the process of validating fracture network
models is at an early stage and that such models have not been validated in the
field. This issue is discussed in more detail in Section 9 of this Supplementary
Proof, but I reiterate that Dr Hencher has presented examples from the Stripa
Site Characterisation and Validation Programme out of context, and has,
consequently, misrepresented the conclusions of Olsson and Gale (FOE/6/15).
Indeed, the Overview Document published by the OECD/NEA International Stripa
Project (NRX/16/2), concludes (page 57) that one of the significant achievements
of the Site Characterisation and Validation Project, of which the inflow tests
quoted by Dr Hencher formed a part was the<I> </I>&quot;<I>demonstration of
the applicability of the fracture flow modelling for simulating groundwater flow
and solute transport&quot;.
</I>
</P>
<P><B> Validation In The Nirex Programme</B>
</P>
<P> Validation Cycles 
</P>
<P>10.17 Validation cycles as described in paragraph 10.10 of my Supplementary
Proof have already been implemented by Nirex. The cycles have been  designed to
build on the understanding established following the drilling of the regional
boreholes.  This understanding is described in <I>Nirex Report 524</I>
[COR/517].  An initial validation cycle was conducted around the Borehole 2/4
crosshole testing programme (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>, Appendix A,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14a1.htm#TA8">Table A8</A>). This initial validation cycle
tested qualitatively a range of conceptual models. This work has been described
in a paper presented  to a European Commission Workshop held in Brussels, 12-13
January 1995 (NRX/15/16) .
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para10.18"></A>10.18 Nirex envisages completing two more main 
validation cycles for these models of groundwater flow by the time  RCF Phase 1
is completed. These two cycles will be centred around the Borehole RCF3 Pump
Test and the shaft drawdown experiment respectively. The Borehole RCF3 Pump Test
cycle, and the initial predictions for the shaft drawdown cycle will be
completed prior to commencement of shaft excavation.  Further cycles are
planned, which may commence during Phase 1 of the RCF, and extend into Phases 2
and 3.
</P>
<P>10.19 Within each main cycle, there may be the opportunity for repeated
testing of specific aspects of some of the model, adding further to the
iterative validation process. In addition, as discussed at paragraph 10.10
above, peer review is an important part of the process.  It is intended to use a
panel of independent experts in the field of groundwater flow modelling to
assist with the development of performance measures and to review the
performance of models against them.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para10.20"></A>10.20 As noted in my Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>)
at <A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para6.3">paragraph 6.3</A> to 6.5, the shaft sinking
phase of the RCF is anticipated to allow the model validation required to
underpin a preliminary decision on the repository depth (and RCF gallery depth).
 It is expected that sufficient confidence in the groundwater flow models could
be gained by  the validation cycles completed by the end of Phase 1 of the RCF
to permit a decision on whether to propose repository development.  The work
involved in the groundwater flow model validation cycles leading to this
decision point is described in the Appendix to this Supplementary Proof.

<P>10.21 In this Supplementary Proof I concentrate on describing the Nirex
approach to validation of groundwater flow models as an example of how the Nirex
strategy will be applied using the RCF. A similar process to that described in
the remainder of this section is applied in other parts of the Nirex programme
such as modelling gas generation (<I>Nirex Report S/94/003</I>, page 5)
[COR/509].
</P>
<P>10.22 <A HREF="nrx15.htm#Para6.3">Paragraph 6.3</A> of my Proof of Evidence
(<B>PE/NRX/15</B>) outlined a requirement to build confidence in key models
used in assessments of repository post-closure performance and to enable
confident extrapolation of descriptions of the rock mass and groundwater systems
across the PRZ for use in developing the repository design.
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">Paragraph 6.26</A> of Dr Holmes' Proof of
Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>) identifies the shaft sinking phase of the RCF as
playing a major part in the validation process, providing the first opportunity
to test groundwater flow models on a large scale. Dr Mellor (<B>PE/NRX/16</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#Para7.11">paragraphs 7.11</A> and 7.12) describes
how the programme of forward predictions relate to the Sector Test Plans which
will form the basis of measurements to be made in the RCF and that will form the
basis of validation exercises using the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para10.23"></A>10.23 Forward predictions during the excavation
phase of the RCF will allow the validation process to be applied to a variety of
contributing conceptual models relevant to developing the necessary
understanding of the behaviour of the site, including:

<P>10.24 The simultaneous and complementary validation of all these models
during Phase 1 of the RCF will provide a powerful approach to building
confidence in key models and in post-closure performance assessment. The aim is
to develop a demonstrable understanding of the geometry of the flow system,  the
physics controlling the flow system and the volume of flow occurring through the
system, in order to predict groundwater flow through the geosphere barrier. 
This requires a wide range of information to be obtained from the RCF in order
to test predictions from these models.  The range of information that will arise
during Phase 1 of the RCF is described by Dr Mellor in
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#Para4.3">paragraphs 4.3</A> to 4.14 of his Proof of
Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/16</B>).  
</P>
<P>10.25 The RCF provides the opportunity for the direct observation of
features which have not been observable from surface boreholes. In addition, it
will extend the length scales over which tests are performed. As such, it will
provide independent and new data against which to validate models developed from
the surface investigation programme. The differing nature of this information to
that obtainable from surface boreholes will assist in increasing confidence in
the models which perform well against the performance measures for the
comparison of predictions with observations.
</P>
<P>10.26  The RCF shaft drawdown has been accepted as one of two potential
major contributors to the successor programme within the international DECOVALEX
validation exercise, aimed at evaluating coupled models of rock stress and
hydrogeology in fractured rocks. This programme is intended to  expose models
applied by several independent international groups to extensive testing against
data from the RCF.  Like its sister projects, INTRAVAL and the early phase of
DECOVALEX, this exercise will form a major contribution to the international
scientific community working on the issue of validation and to the peer review
of the Nirex programme of validation.
</P>
<P> <B>Conclusion On Validation
</B>
</P>
<P>10.27 My overall conclusion in respect of the matters raised on validation
by the Objectors is that Nirex has both a well developed approach to validation
and an extensive programme of validation exercises completed, underway and
planned for the RCF itself. Nirex is involved in international validation
exercises and is committed to ensuring that its validation work is thoroughly
peer reviewed. Conceptual models used to support  safety assessments submitted
to the regulators  will have to be shown to be acceptable and to be fit for
purpose. As a consequence, the concerns raised by the Objectors are considered
to be ill founded and to be addressed by work which Nirex already has in hand. 
The RCF is an essential component of this work.

<P> <B><A NAME="APPENDIX:">APPENDIX:</A>  VALIDATION CYCLES  FOR THE
GROUNDWATER FLOW MODELS (SECTION 10) 
</B>
</P>
<P><B>A.1. Crosshole Testing Between Boreholes 2 and 4
</B>
</P>
<P>A.1.1 This initial cycle of validation was completed by Nirex in 1994,  and 
was conducted around the Borehole 2/4 crosshole testing programme (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
Appendix A, <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14a1.htm#TA8">Table A8</A>). This cycle tested
qualitatively a range of conceptual models of groundwater flow in the BVG by
considering their compatibility with observations of crosshole and single
borehole responses to six pumping tests performed in Borehole 2. This work has
been described in a paper presented  to a European Commission Workshop held in
Brussels, 12-13 January 1995 (NRX/15/16) .
</P>
<P><B>A.2. The Borehole RCF3 Pump Test
</B>
</P>
<P>A.2.1 Nirex is carrying out a major experimental exercise focused on flow
model validation in the PRZ rocks by means of the Borehole 'RCF3 Pump Test'.  
This exercise is a smaller scale version of the type of exercise which would be 
possible during RCF shaft construction. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ParaA.2.2"></A>A.2.2 One of the principal aims is to assist in the
characterisation of the flow system in the BVG and overlying strata by
distinguishing between alternative conceptual models of flow in the PRZ and
assessing the applicability of available models to that system. In particular,
the applicability of fracture network models to the fracture data from the BVG
is being studied. To this end, six alternative conceptual models of flow within
fractured rock were developed and compared. These models described the rock
using various combinations of deterministic and stochastic properties. Numerical
simulation of the models was achieved using four, internationally well-tested
and verified computer codes (NAMMU, NAPSAC, FracMan/MAFIC and ECLipse) designed
to evaluate flow in fractured and porous rocks, set up in different ways and in
different combinations. 
</P>
<P>A.2.3 The test (which is now completed) involved pumping groundwater from
Borehole RCF3 and monitoring the hydraulic response of selected zones in 15
boreholes in the vicinity of the PRZ. Modelling utilised results from 120
monitoring points within 600m of Borehole RCF3 in all formations.  A modelling
and prediction protocol was drawn up in advance to specify exactly what was to
be predicted and how the predictions were to be presented.  Three classes of
predictions were defined for the Borehole RCF Pump Tests: 
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD><B> Class A</B> 'predictions' were carried out 'blind' before the pump
test itself, and, by using clearly independent data, have the greatest potential

<TD></TD>
<TD>ii.</TD>
<TD><B>Class B</B> 'predictions' were carried out after the start of the pump
test, but without knowledge of the outcomes gained to date.  Class B predictions
were not as rigorous for validation as Class A predictions.  These predictions
were needed owing to the practical need for modifications to the pump test
during its implementation.
</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>iii.</TD>
<TD><B>Class C</B> 'predictions' are currently underway and have been made
after the event.  While of less value than forward predictions, this part of the
process is important as it permits the development of understanding arising from
the predictions, and allows any necessary refinements to the model.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><A NAME="ParaA.2.4"></A>A.2.4 These predictions were tested against both
'direct' (where direct comparison could be made with a measured parameter) and
'interpreted' (which require interpretation of field results to produce a
derived parameter or other factor)  performance measures.  The measures used
take account of the stochastic nature of flow in fracture networks (discussed by
Dr Chaplow at
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14s1.htm#Para5.8">paragraph 5.8</A> in his Supplementary
Proof of Evidence, (<B>PE/NRX/14/S1</B>)) and include assessment of modes,
trends, ranges and distributions of predictions as well as actual values. Seven
direct and four interpreted performance measures were used, including hydraulic
response locations, magnitudes and times, drawdowns and drawdowns versus
distances and interpretations of flow magnitudes and flow dimensionality.</P>
<P>A.2.5 The stochastic nature of the flow regime means that the performance
measures were, of necessity, probabilistic. Statistical 'scores' will, on the
basis of the assessment of the test be attributed to each prediction based on
their correspondence with measurements. Correspondence is being  gauged by:

<P><A NAME="ParaA.2.6"></A>A.2.6 For the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, which is
part of an evolving process of validation it was not considered appropriate to
develop quantitative criteria  whereby a model could be accepted or rejected
based on its performance with respect to the statistical tests described above.
Qualitative judgements will be used to assess the model predictions against the
established performance measures. 
</P>
<P>A.2.7 The test itself was designed to provide the data, required at an
adequate density and frequency, to allow predicted values from the computer
codes for each model to be compared with the performance measures. Experimental
design is thus a critical step in the validation cycle. The tests involved
pumping from four intervals in Borehole RCF3, two in the Sherwood Sandstone
Group, one in the Brockram and one in the BVG, results from the latter being the
main focus of the exercise and involving a drawdown period of 90 days.  The
upper sandstone test, performed above the North Head Member was introduced at
the end of the test programme .
</P>
<P>A.2.8 The predictions of the responses is an important step in a full
validation cycle as described at paragraph 10.10 of my Supplementary Proof of
Evidence. The results are still being analysed and it is not yet possible to
present our conclusions.  However, the differences between the predictions will
help to distinguish the most appropriate conceptual models.
</P>
<P><A NAME="ParaA.2.9"></A>A.2.9 The whole exercise is the subject of a peer
review process, involving the appointment of an independent referee or 'banker'
(John Lloyd, Professor of Hydrogeology at the University of Birmingham) who
holds the forward prediction results and who will review the comparison of
results with the performance measures.
</P>
<P><B>A.3. The RCF Shaft Drawdown Experiments
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="ParaA.3.1"></A>A.3.1 The Borehole RCF3 Pump Test looks to have
provided a firm basis on which to build subsequent validation cycles for flow
models of the rocks within the PRZ. It will provide (as described above) initial
discrimination between alternative conceptual models of flow in the BVG and
confirmation that one or more of the models may be fit for the purposes of
future safety assessment calculations. These models will be refined and carried
forward in readiness for the next validation cycle, the RCF shaft drawdown.
</P>
<P>A.3.2 Like the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, the RCF shaft drawdown cycle will
use hydraulic response data from the network of monitoring points. Hydraulic
pressure changes will be induced in the monitoring network during the course of
shaft excavation, as described at <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#Para4.7">paragraph
4.7</A> of Dr Mellor's Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/16</B>). These effects are
termed the shaft drawdown effects, and they will be used in the next main cycle
of validation. The use of excavation drawdowns for model validation has been 
tested in Canada at the Underground Research Laboratory of AECL between 1980 and
1986, as discussed by Mr Reeves (PE/FOE/4, paragraphs 6.13 to 6.15) and
described in more detail in Davison  (PE/FOE/4) (FOE/4/5). 
</P>
<P>A.3.3 The Canadian experience showed the utility of using large-scale
borehole pumping tests (similar in concept to the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test
described above) combined with piezometric pressure monitoring records to
calibrate the models which were subsequently tested during shaft excavation. The
Nirex activities go well beyond this simple pre-calibration and testing of the
models because, as described above, two full validation cycles will have taken
place to compare alternative models prior to the shaft drawdown experiment. In
addition, the range and sophistication of models available and the consequent
extent and variety of performance measures go far beyond what was available to
AECL in the early 1980's. 
</P>
<P>A.3.4 The RCF shaft drawdown exercise will proceed in a similar manner to
the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test and following the steps outlined in paragraph 10.10
of my Supplementary Proof.  Our forward programme, between now and the
commencement of excavation, will consist of the following steps:

<P>A3.5 It is our intention to release hydrogeological data as the RCF proceeds
and the whole process of validation using the shaft drawdown experiment will be
carried out under an appropriate peer review regime. However, the requirements
to make 'blind' predictions, as discussed above, mean that data flow must be
strictly controlled during the whole of this exercise, if it is to have proper
validation significance.
</P>
<P>A.3.6 An additional aspect of the shaft drawdown experiment will be the
ability to link the testing of hydraulic models to regional scale models of
hydrochemistry and to models of rock stress in the excavation damaged zone (EDZ)
around the shaft. Limited studies of the hydrochemical effects of the Borehole
RCF3 Pump Test have been done, and these are being used to confirm Nirex's
concepts of groundwater regimes and mixing relationships (<B>PE/NRX/14/S1</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14s1.htm#Para8.33">paragraph 8.33</A>).  The proposed
injection of tracers into the rock mass surrounding the shaft,  and the
associated monitoring of tracer entries into the shaft during shaft sinking will
permit the simultaneous validation of coupled flow and transport models to take
place. 
</P>
<P><B>A.4. Subsequent Validation Cycles: Work Within the RCF</B>
</P>
<P>A.4.1 When access to the BVG is gained it will be possible to make detailed
refinements to the stochastic descriptions of spatial variability in fracture
densities and properties, using direct observations from fracture mapping,
initially on the shaft walls.   It will be possible to use these refinements to
make and test revised predictions for the final stages of the shaft drawdown
experiment during the 9&#173;12 months between first entering the BVG and
reaching the shaft bottom.   In addition, further validation cycles can
commence, centred on other RCF data acquisitions activities.
</P>
<P>A.4.2 The main part of these subsequent validation cycles for the selected
conceptual models of flow in the BVG would involve: 
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD>further refinement of the models based on additional fracture data from
mapping the shaft connection adit and the galleries to be constructed in Phases
2 and 3 of the RCF. In particular, these cycles will have the benefit of direct
observational testing of the conceptual models of 'flowing feature' types; and</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>ii.</TD>
<TD>input from cross-hole hydraulic tests in various regions of the BVG to
evaluate in detail  the properties of the fracture network and the behaviour of
different flowing features.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>A.4.3 The types of validation experiments performed in Phases 2 and 3 of the
RCF are envisaged to build on experience drawn from the Stripa SCV Project in
particular, as outlined in Dr Mellor's description of the proposed RCF-SCD test
at <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#Para5.7">paragraphs 5.7</A> and 5.8 of his Proof
of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/16</B>). A central aim will be to test the ability to
apply the, by then, preferred conceptual models of the BVG at various scales.
The techniques for 'upscaling' were described by Dr Chaplow at
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14s1.htm#Para5.8">paragraphs 5.8</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14s1.htm#Para7.19">7.19</A> to 7.27 of his Supplementary
Proof (<B>PE/NRX/14/S1</B>).
</P>
<P>A.4.4 Validation cycles will also be applied to models which simulate
radionuclide transport. 
</P>
<P><B>A.5. Input to Safety Assessment
</B>
</P>
<P>A.5.1 Validation cycles completed by the end of  Phase 1 of the RCF will
permit:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>definition of the most appropriate models to apply to flow in each of the
formations and selection of preferred models for assessment purposes;
</LI>
<LI>definition of tried and tested upscaling rules for the preferred models;
and
</LI>
<LI>definition of an updated flow model for use in the safety assessment work.
</LI></UL>
<P>A.5.2 The decision at the end of RCF Phase 1 as to whether to propose
development of a repository will depend on the outcome of this work. The safety
assessments supporting such a decision will  build on <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522]
and will utilise updated conceptual models of groundwater flow derived from the
validation cycles described in this Section of my Supplementary  Proof.

<P><B>DR. ALAN JAMES HOOPER will say;</B></P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Manager for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex')
having joined the Company in September 1988 on secondment from the former
Central Electricity Generating Board ('CEGB').  I am responsible for evaluations
of long-term repository safety performance of the Sellafield site and for 
advising the Director for Science on co-ordination of the programmes of site
characterisation, research and safety assessment.</P>
<P>1.2 I have been a UK delegate to the Co-ordinating Group for Site Evaluation
and Design of Experiments for Radioactive Waste Disposal of the Radioactive
Waste Management Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development Nuclear Energy Agency since its formation in 1990.  I was elected
its chairman in 1992.
</P>
<P>1.3 I have been a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee to the Swedish
&Auml;sp&ouml; Hard Rock Laboratory programme since 1992.  This committee
consists of senior scientists from academic institutions in Sweden and from the
international waste agencies which are participating in the &Auml;sp&ouml;
programme and is responsible for peer review of the results and planned
experiments.
</P>
<P>1.4 I hold a first-class honours degree in Chemistry from Nottingham
University and a PhD in Inorganic Chemistry, also from Nottingham University.</P>
<P>1.5 Prior to my secondment and subsequent appointment at Nirex, I was
employed by the CEGB.  Between 1971 and 1980 I worked on projects to evaluate
the transport of radioactive materials within power reactor circuits and the
radiological consequences of such transport for workers and public.  Between
1980 and 1985 I supported the CEGB Nuclear Decommissioning Project by
contributing to evaluations of the radiological safety of alternative strategies
for decommissioning CEGB Magnox Reactors.  Between 1985 and 1988 I was
responsible for the design and implementation of the research programme to
support the strategy for the eventual disposal of the CEGB's intermediate-level
radioactive wastes.</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P> <B>Repository Performance at Sellafield</B></P>
<P>2.1 A preliminary assessment, based on results so far, of the post-closure
performance of a repository located in the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at
Sellafield confirms the good promise of the Sellafield site as a potentially
suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater pathway is central to our
considerations of repository safety and requires to be well understood.  If
resolution of identified uncertainties confirms our current understanding of the
groundwater system at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks ('BVG') of the PRZ which would meet
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.2 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield would
result in the physical and chemical containment in the repository of all but a
small fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just
three radionuclides: chlorine&#173;36, iodine-129 and uranium-238 are calculated
to be released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the
peak risk either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>2.3 The assessment presented in my evidence emphasises the understanding
that has been developed of the contribution of the various barriers in the
repository system to the containment of radioactivity in a repository located in
the PRZ at Sellafield.  The evidence identifies the contribution to containment
performance by the engineered and geological barriers.</P>
<P>2.4 Physical containment is afforded in particular by the waste containers
which prevent ready access of groundwater to the wastes.  The results obtained
so far on the corrosion of steels under the conditions that would apply in a
repository at Sellafield show that the rates of corrosion would be expected to
be low and that the steel containers would remain sufficiently intact to result
in containment within the repository of short-lived radionuclides accounting for
the major part (about 99%) of radioactivity in the repository inventory.</P>
<P>2.5 In order to establish and maintain appropriate chemical conditions in a
repository, the space in the vaults around the waste containers will be
backfilled with a cement-based grout developed for the purpose, and known as
Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  On the basis of results obtained so far of test
work and modelling on the performance of this grout, concerning the suppression
of the solubilities of radionuclides in groundwater and sorption of dissolved
radionuclides onto cement surfaces, the chemical conditions established in a
repository at Sellafield would result in the containment in the repository of
most of the long-lived radionuclides in the disposal inventory.  Over 99% of the
residual 1% of long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which
chemical containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH,
is maintained.</P>
<P>2.6 My evidence identifies three important radionuclides that because of
their chemical properties or very long radioactive decay half-lives are not
physically or chemically contained in the repository until they have decayed to
insignificant levels.  These are chlorine-36 and iodine-129, which are
considered to be highly soluble and not subject to a high degree of sorption in
the near field of the repository, and uranium-238 which has a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years.</P>
<P>2.7 Groundwater flow models predict that the path taken by groundwater
leaving the potential repository location leads to a discharge predominantly
into the sediments currently off the coast below the Irish Sea.  In this event
the additional considerable dilution afforded by the sea leads to assessed risks
to an individual at least three orders of magnitude below the target of 10<SUP>-6
</SUP>per year.  However, the extended timescales of thousands of years before
the groundwater returns to the surface may be sufficient for a change in climate
to cause the sea level to drop and the discharge to be to a terrestrial
environment.</P>
<P>2.8 The concentrations in which the radionuclides chlorine-36 and iodine-129
may reach the surface environment are determined by the flow of groundwater
through the repository near field and by the extent of  subsequent dilution of
this volume of water by groundwater in the surrounding host rock and overlying
sedimentary formations.  It is shown that on the basis of results obtained so
far the combination of low groundwater flow in the BVG at Sellafield and the
dilution and dispersion afforded by the flow of groundwater in the overlying
sedimentary formations is likely to give rise to concentrations of these
radionuclides in the surface terrestrial environment consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.9 In the case of uranium-238 the peak in risk from this radionuclide is
considered to occur more than a million years after repository closure and to
result from a daughter radionuclide, radium-226, produced by its radioactive
decay.  On the basis of the results obtained so far, both on the groundwater
system and on the containment afforded to uranium-238 by the engineered barriers
of the repository, the performance of the repository system is likely to give
rise to concentrations of radium-226 in the surface environment consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements. </P>
<P>2.10 On the basis of these results my evidence identifies the key
uncertainties which remain and which need to be addressed to inform two key
decision points in the development of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.11 It is shown that the Rock Characterisation Facility ('RCF') is needed
to provide information to address uncertainties in three main areas:</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P><B> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport</B></P>
<P>2.12 The flow of groundwater into the near field of the repository is highly
dependent upon the description of the networks of connected fractures in the
BVG.  My evidence describes how the integrated activities of observation,
monitoring and testing over extended length scales and in three dimensions only
afforded in the RCF are needed to build sufficient confidence in the calculation
of the flow rate to meet regulatory requirements with respect to post-closure
safety.</P>
<P>2.13 The calculated dilution of the radionuclides transported away from the
repository in groundwater is dependent upon the properties of the flow channels
in key geological formations.  My evidence describes how these flow channels can
be identified and characterised by the integrated activities over extended
length scales and in three dimensions only afforded in the RCF.</P>
<P>2.14 Further key uncertainties are identified in relation to groundwater
flow and radionuclide transport, namely:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the nature and extent of rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> My evidence identifies the unique attributes of the RCF for addressing
these matters.</P>
<P><B> Natural and Induced Changes</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 The key uncertainties that need to be addressed in respect of natural
and induced changes to the geological barrier are identified as :</P>
<UL>
<LI>validation of the stability of the hydrogeological system over extended
timescales;
</LI>
<LI>the effect of excavation disturbance; and
</LI>
<LI>the effect of chemical disturbance (by alkaline near-field groundwater).
</LI></UL>
<P>2.16 Detailed examination in the RCF of the fractures that are components of
the networks of connected fractures should allow the geological history of flow
patterns to be established, particularly by dating the mineralisation that has
occurred in association with flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then
be compared with the present day flow patterns to test whether significant
changes have occurred in the past and may therefore occur in the future.</P>
<P>2.17 The RCF is needed, in advance of the decision whether or not to propose
development of a repository, to validate that the site characteristics are such
that excavation disturbance would not significantly impair the containment
performance of the natural geological barrier.  Excavation of the RCF itself is
the only means by which a measurable disturbance can be created to allow
extrapolation in time and space of the consequences in the post-closure period
of a repository.</P>
<P>2.18 The access to specific features in the rock in the RCF allows testing
of the effects of alkaline near-field groundwater (derived from the cements in
the repository) on groundwater flow and radionuclide transport in the
surrounding host rock.</P>
<P><B> Design and Construction of the Repository</B></P>
<P>2.19 The way in which the RCF permits identification of geological and
hydrogeological features that must be taken into account in refining the
repository design in terms of depth, location, layout and orientation of vaults
within the PRZ is described.</P>
<P>2.20 It is also described how the confidence that various underground
features can be sealed adequately to satisfy regulatory requirements on
post-closure safety is only obtainable by access to representative features and
excavations in the rock mass as afforded by the RCF.
</P>
<P><B> Impact of the RCF</B></P>
<P>2.21 Finally, my evidence notes that the performance of the geosphere
barrier is unlikely to be impaired by the impact of the RCF and that this issue
will require to be considered as an element of any application to the regulatory
authorities for authorisation under RSA93.</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE</B></P>
<P>3.1 The purpose of my evidence is :</P>
<UL>
<LI>to describe the Nirex approach to post-closure performance assessment
(Section 4); 
</LI>
<LI>to present a preliminary analysis of post-closure performance of a
repository at Sellafield (Section 5);
</LI>
<LI>to describe the essential information required from the Rock
Characterisation Facility ('RCF') to resolve remaining uncertainties  in respect
of that performance (Section 6); and
</LI>
<LI>to describe the impact that the RCF may have upon the containment
performance of the geosphere (Section 7).
</LI></UL>
<P>3.2 In Section 5, I describe the current understanding of the performance of
a repository located at Sellafield.  The role of the geosphere, both in ensuring
the successful long-term containment properties of the engineered system and in
diluting residual radionuclides dissolved in groundwater emerging from the
engineered system, is described.</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence in Section 5 reflects the results obtained up to early 1994
on the geology and hydrogeology of the Sellafield site that are important to the
movement of groundwater which could contain radionuclides released from the
repository.  The possible implications for repository performance of the results
that have been obtained since early 1994, as presented in Dr. Chaplow's evidence
(<B>PE/NRX/14</B>, <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">Section 6</A>),
are also considered in Section 5.  This evidence shows why Nirex considers the
Sellafield site as offering good promise as a potentially suitable location for
a repository and, therefore, why it is justified to secure further information
on the site through investigations in the RCF.</P>
<P>3.4 My evidence shows that although the good promise of the site can be
established, there remain key uncertainties which require to be addressed in the
RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether or not to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield.</P>
<P>3.5 The evidence in Section 6 specifies the further information required to
address these key uncertainties which can only be acquired from the RCF.  Dr.
Mellor's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/16</B>, <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE1">Sections
4</A> and <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE2">5</A>) describes how the RCF
needs to be developed and operated to deliver this information.</P>
<P>3.6 My evidence in Section 7 considers the potential for the excavation of
the RCF, and of its shafts in particular, to impact upon the performance of a
repository subsequently located within the Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks
('BVG') of the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at Sellafield.  It shows that
there is a sound basis for the proposed location of the shafts and excavation
methods.</P>
<P><A NAME="Approach"></A><B>4. APPROACH TO POST-CLOSURE PERFORMANCE
ASSESSMENT</B></P>
<P>4.1 This Section describes the approach under development by Nirex to assess
the post-closure performance of a deep geological repository at Sellafield.  The
term 'post-closure' refers to the period from the end of repository operations
when, all the repository vaults having been filled with packaged wastes, the
accesses to the repository are backfilled and sealed.  'Assessment' is the
identification and modelling of the processes and pathways by which
radionuclides from the repository may subsequently return to the biosphere and
to people.</P>
<P>4.2 Performance assessment makes extensive use of models.  Development of
assessment models has been built around three major pathways for the possible
return of radionuclides to the biosphere and to people :</P>
<UL>
<LI>transport of radionuclides in groundwater;
</LI>
<LI>migration of radionuclides in gases; and
</LI>
<LI>return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of natural
disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.
</LI></UL>
<P> For a repository at Sellafield the most important pathway, in radiological
terms, is the groundwater pathway.  This is because each of the various
radionuclides in the wastes might be transported in groundwater whereas only a
small number could be transported as a gas.  Also the transport of radionuclides
by the groundwater pathway generally provides the framework for considering the
effect of natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion, except in
the low probability scenarios of direct return of the contents of the repository
by such means.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterPathway"></A><B> Groundwater Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 When the repository is first closed, it will
contain air (for example in the pores of the cements used to immobilise the
wastes, and in any unfilled spaces within the repository) which will, in time,
be displaced by inflowing groundwater.  Thereafter, subject to the performance
of the engineered barriers of the repository, radionuclides will eventually
dissolve or disperse in the water and be available to move into the surrounding
rock.  The extent to which the radionuclides come into contact with water, the
extent to which they dissolve and their ability to move with the groundwater
will each be controlled by the physical and chemical conditions in the
engineered barriers of the repository.</P>
<P>4.4 The engineered barriers are designed to contain as much of the
radioactivity as is reasonably practicable.  This is achieved by providing
physical containment barriers to movement of radionuclides, which are expected
to operate for at least one thousand years after repository closure in respect
of waste packages containing most of the radioactivity, and chemical
containment, operating over a period of around one million years, which will
limit the solubilities, and provide sorption, of radionuclides in groundwater
moving through the repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.5"></A>4.5 The levels of the radiological effects of any
radionuclides that are not contained by the engineered barriers and which reach
the surface in groundwater will be determined largely by the concentrations of
the radionuclides in solution.  The limitation of radionuclide solubilities and
the slow release of groundwater from the repository are of great importance
because they determine the extent to which further reductions in concentrations
must occur, through processes of retardation, spreading and dilution in the
geosphere, for the repository system to be acceptably safe.</P>
<P>4.6 Once the radionuclides in the groundwater have passed from the
repository into the successive layers of surrounding rocks, their rates of
transport to the surface will be determined by the path taken by groundwater
flow through the rocks, the time taken for water to travel along this path, and
by various physical and chemical processes that lead to retardation and
spreading.  The groundwater from the repository will mix with groundwater in the
surrounding rocks leading to dilution of the dissolved levels of radionuclides. 
The extent of dilution will not be determined solely by the amount of
groundwater flowing through the overlying rocks, relative to that flowing
through the repository.  The spreading in space and time of the transport of
repository-derived radionuclides in groundwater through each rock layer will
increase the dilution afforded by their mixing with larger volumes of water in
the succeeding rock layer.</P>
<P>4.7 Eventually groundwater containing repository-derived radionuclides will
reach shallow regions of the rock, which may be considered to be at the boundary
with the biosphere.  On crossing this boundary and entering the biosphere
further dilution, retardation or dispersion can occur by mixing with surface
water (streams, lakes and the sea) or soils.  Radionuclides could become
available for uptake by people by their entering the food-chain, by their
consumption in drinking water or by their inhalation in dust particles.</P>
<P>4.8 The concentrations of radionuclides, both in the groundwater pathway at
its various stages of returning radionuclides to the surface and in the
components of the biosphere, can be calculated on the basis of an understanding
of the controlling physical, chemical and biological processes.  The need is to
calculate the potential uptake of radionuclides by people, living now or in the
future, as a function of time.  From a knowledge of the uptake of radionuclides
through the various potential routes available, a total radiological annual
'dose' to hypothetical individuals can be calculated. This is subsequently
converted to 'annual individual risk' using a dose to risk conversion factor of
0.06 per Sievert.
</P>
<P>4.9 The times of the emergence of radionuclides in the biosphere and their
concentrations will vary according to the controlling physical and chemical
processes relevant to each radionuclide.  The maximum concentrations of
individual radionuclides returning to the biosphere will not coincide in time
unless they have very similar physical and chemical properties.  The total risk
and the contributions of individual radionuclides are typically presented in
graphs of annual radiological risk to an individual through time.  The peak
values shown on these graphs may be compared with the radiological risk target
announced by the Government in its
<I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, Final Conclusions, Cm 2919,
July 1995</I> (<I>&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)
</I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208].  At the current stage of the project,
calculations of risk are viewed as the best means of informing a judgment about
the safety of a facility, in line with the statement in <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I>.  However, it is recognised that in the future other technical
factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature, will also need to be
considered in arriving at the decision.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentModels"></A><B>Assessment Models</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.10"></A>4.10 The top-level tool used by Nirex for
calculating radiological risk from the groundwater pathway is the computer
program called MASCOT and its associated output processor MOP.  MASCOT has been
developed to carry out probabilistic safety assessments, in line with practice
in other countries, for evaluating the safety of radioactive waste disposal
systems.  It takes proper account of the uncertainties associated with the
values of important parameters which influence system performance.  It employs
the 'Monte Carlo' method in which repeated calculations of system behaviour are
made using random sampling from specified probability density functions of the
model parameters which are subject to uncertainty.  The results provide
estimates of the mean and distribution of calculated doses and associated risks.</P>
<P>4.11 MASCOT comprises sub-models describing the behaviour of the sub-systems
of the overall repository system.  These are designed to model the various
processes involved in release of radionuclides from waste packages, their
mobilisation and migration from repository vaults, transport through the
geosphere and biosphere and consequent doses and risks to individuals.  Input
information for sub-models is derived from a variety of sources, including the
output from more detailed models of the system, as described below.</P>
<P> Source Term Model</P>
<P>4.12 The &quot;source term&quot; model describes the behaviour of
radionuclides in the repository vaults and calculates the rate of  their release
as solutes in flowing groundwater. Sub-models are used to represent different
sections of the repository with different characteristics.  The key processes
considered are physical containment by the waste package, radioactive decay and
ingrowth of decay products, solubility limitation, and sorption onto the vault
backfill.  The source term model is supported by a number of research models,
such as RARECAN, CRACK 2, CHEQMATE and HARPHRQ, which address the key physical
and chemical processes in more detail.  The MASCOT source term  model calculates
the concentration of radionuclides in solution in the near-field groundwater as
a function of time.  (The near field of the repository is the part of the system
comprising the waste packages, the backfill surrounding the packages and the
seals used to close off the vaults.  The near-field groundwater is the water
within the porous structure of the backfill.)  The near-field groundwater is
available for transport into the geosphere at a rate dependent on the
groundwater flow through the repository.  (This is usually measured as the
volume in m<SUP>3</SUP> per year of groundwater flowing through the repository
volume.)</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport Through the Geosphere
</P>
<P>4.13 The geosphere sub-models describe the behaviour of radionuclides as
they are transported in groundwater flowing through the geosphere.  The primary
groundwater flow system through fractured rock, such as the BVG, comprises a
network of connected fractures which can be represented on a number of scales.
On the regional  scale - tens of square kilometres - effective properties of the
BVG and surrounding rocks are modelled using a continuum approximation to the
flow system utilising the program NAMMU.  At a repository local scale - of order
ten square kilometres - a more detailed fracture flow model, NAPSAC, is
employed.</P>
<P>4.14 Both NAMMU and NAPSAC permit multi-dimensional groundwater flow
calculations and are used to provide values of the flow of groundwater through
the repository, and of the groundwater flow path lengths and transit times
across each of the hydrogeological units in the flow path.  The groundwater flow
through the repository is measured in cubic metres per year through the full
volume of the engineered repository openings of approximately one million cubic
metres.  It must be assessed reliably because it is an important input to the
source term sub-model in MASCOT.  In addition, geosphere flow-path lengths and
water transit times are required for the geosphere transport sub-models in
MASCOT.</P>
<P>4.15 The transport sub-models within MASCOT calculate radionuclide transport
through different parts of the geosphere taking account of radionuclide decay
and ingrowth, advection, diffusion, hydrodynamic dispersion, and retardation by
sorption.  In addition, radionuclide transport can be retarded by diffusing into
the pore space in the rock matrix.</P>
<P> Biosphere</P>
<P>4.16 The biosphere sub-models of MASCOT are essentially a series of
flux-to-dose rate conversion factors which enable the geosphere calculations of
time-dependent radionuclide fluxes into the biosphere to be converted into doses
and risks to individuals.  For most radionuclides a compartment model, BIOS,
developed by the National Radiological Protection Board, is used to simulate the
processes contributing to radionuclide transport and accumulation in terrestrial
and marine environments.  However, for some key radionuclides  (chlorine-36,
iodine-129 and uranium-238 and its daughters) a heterogeneous resource area
model has been developed to permit a more detailed representation of the
behaviour of the radionuclides in the biosphere.  The development of this model
has been guided by a more physically realistic catchment model generated by the
computer code SHETRAN-UK which has been developed by Nirex, in conjunction with
the Water Resources Systems Research Unit at the University of Newcastle.  An
integral part of the biosphere modelling is definition of critical groups. 
These are defined as being representative of those members of the assumed future
communities that incur the largest annual Effective Dose from radionuclides
present in the environment.  The calculations of Effective Dose make use of
models developed through the International Commission on Radiological Protection
so that potential health risks to individuals can be calculated.  Given the
timescale over which releases are calculated to occur, significant changes in
the climate are projected to arise as a result of glacial cycling:  sea levels
and human behaviour are predicted to change accordingly.  Critical group
behaviour is defined on the basis of the behaviour of existing communities in
regions of the world which currently have analogous climate states.  Many
potential exposure routes are addressed, ranging from human consumption of
contaminated water through to complex food-chain pathways.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentCycels"></A><B> Assessment Cycles</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.17"></A>4.17 The key steps in assessment of the post-closure
performance of a repository will be repeated several times before a decision is
sought from the regulatory authorities to approve the start of disposal
operations in a repository, following its construction and commissioning.  This
iterative process is known as the 'assessment cycle' as described in <I>Nirex
Report 525, Scientific Update 1993, December 1993 </I>(sub-section 5.2, pages 30
to 31) [COR/505].
</P>
<P>4.18 One important function of an assessment is to calculate system
performance for comparison with regulatory requirements to judge whether or not
the system under assessment has the potential to meet them.  A major,
complementary output is a clearer understanding of the issues that are important
to system performance.  Identification of those issues helps to identify
priorities for further data acquisition, on waste or site characteristics for
example, for model development, and for refinement of repository design.</P>
<P>4.19 The presentation, in Section 5 of my evidence, of preliminary results
on the post-closure performance of a repository located in the PRZ at Sellafield
is intended to show our current understanding of the important issues.  This
understanding will develop and become more complete as assessment cycles are
conducted in the future.</P>
<P><A NAME="RepositoryPerformance"></A><B>5. REPOSITORY PERFORMANCE AT
SELLAFIELD</B></P>
<P>5.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the calculated
performance of the engineered and natural barriers to radionuclide transport
afforded by a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield.  The
natural barrier provided by the rocks surrounding the repository is of
particular importance as this must ensure that the required chemical conditions
can be maintained in the near field of the repository to contain most of the
radioactivity, and that any residual long-lived radionuclides that are not
contained in this way do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.
</P>
<P>5.2 My evidence identifies the key characteristics of the Sellafield site
which bear on assessment of the post-closure performance of the repository
system.  It is shown that the information and results from the Science Programme
so far suggest the Sellafield site holds good promise as a potentially suitable
location for a repository, but there are uncertainties which need to be
addressed before a decision is taken on whether to propose development of a
repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="DisposalInventory"></A><B>Disposal Inventory</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 The current planning basis for the repository is
that it will receive for disposal 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid, packaged
intermediate-level radioactive wastes and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid,
packaged low-level radioactive wastes up to the year 2060.  The radionuclide
content of this total volume of 400,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of wastes is referred to
as the &quot;disposal inventory&quot; and information on this content and the
content of associated materials that may affect repository performance is taken
from information compiled jointly by the Department of the Environment and Nirex
on radioactive waste arising in the UK (<I>DOE/RAS/92.010, UK Nirex Report No.
284, The United Kingdom Radioactive Waste Inventory, November 1992 (&quot;the
1991 National Inventory&quot;</I>) [COR/520].) (See also:<I> DOE/RAS/92.011, UK
Nirex Report No. 285, The Radionuclide Content of UK Radioactive Wastes,
November 1992; and DOE/RAS/92.012, UK Nirex Report No. 286, The Physical and
Chemical Characteristics of UK Radioactive Wastes, November 1992, </I>which are
referred to as sources of information.)</P>
<P>5.4 The disposal inventory may be sub-divided into two broad categories of
radionuclides according to their radioactive decay half-lives.  Much of the
disposal inventory is comprised of relatively short-lived 'fission products'
such as strontium-90 and caesium-137 or 'neutron activation products' such as 
nickel-63, having radioactive decay half-lives of around 100 years or less. 
(Fission products are the result of the nuclear fission of elements such as
uranium or plutonium, as used in the fuels of nuclear reactors.  Neutron
activation products result most commonly from the capture of neutrons by stable
atomic nuclei, to create unstable nuclei which subsequently undergo radioactive
decay). </P>
<P>5.5 The second category comprises radionuclides having radioactive decay
half-lives from hundreds to millions of years.  Many of these are heavy metal
elements such as plutonium, which are very insoluble in the alkaline and
chemically reducing ('low Eh') near-field conditions.  These long-lived
radionuclides include three having radioactive decay half-lives, of hundreds of
thousands of years or more, which prove to be of great importance to the
calculated performance of the deep repository.  These are chlorine-36 with a
half-life of 300,000 years; iodine-129 with a half-life of over 15 million
years; and uranium-238 with a half-life approaching 4,500 million years.  In
order to understand the results of risk calculations reported in this Proof of
Evidence, it is helpful to note that a 'daughter' radionuclide, radium-226,
produced by the decay of the uranium-238 'parent' is of much greater
radiological significance than the uranium-238 itself.</P>
<P> Key Radionuclides</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.6"></A>5.6 The more important radionuclides in terms of
their radioactivity content and relevance to the safety of disposal are listed
in order of atomic number and according to radioactive decay half-life in
<A HREF="#Table5.1">Table 5.1</A>.  The sources of the three radionuclides
found to be of greatest importance are outlined in rather more detail in the
following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.7 Chlorine-36 derives principally from neutron activation of naturally
occurring chlorine, which is present as a trace impurity in various materials in
nuclear reactors.   Accordingly it is likely to be present in small quantities
in many waste streams.  Seven waste streams have been identified as the main
sources of the radionuclide.  They contribute about 65% of the total 16.6 TBq of
chlorine-36 in the disposal inventory and have a volume of about 50,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.
 Because of the significance of this radionuclide in evaluations of repository
post-closure performance, it is considered important to take account of
uncertainties in the quantities present in the disposal inventory, as reported
in <I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table 6.3, page 6.25) [COR/522].  The value of
16.6 TBq is the central case determined for that exercise.</P>
<P>5.8 Iodine-129 derives from nuclear fission and it will be present in small
quantities in a wide range of wastes.  However, four waste streams contribute
about 50% of the projected total of 0.92 TBq, having a total volume of about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.9 Uranium-238 is a major constituent of reactor fuel and will be present
in small quantities in a wide range of wastes.  Seven waste streams contribute
about 55% of the total 36 TBq, having a total volume of about 37,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P> Packaging</P>
<P>5.10 Intermediate-level wastes intended for disposal will be immobilised
within packages to produce the 'wasteform'.  Most intermediate-level wastes will
be packaged as unshielded wasteforms.  Standard unshielded intermediate-level
waste containers are predominantly drums or boxes fabricated from stainless
steel, or in some cases carbon steel.  The 0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> capacity drum is
the most commonly used container and larger drums or boxes typically have a
capacity of 3 m<SUP>3</SUP>.  The waste is immobilised within the container,
typically using a cement-based grout to produce a solid wasteform.  The
principal waste packages for shielded intermediate-level wasteforms are concrete
boxes, having a length of approximately four metres, in which the waste is again
immobilised  in a cement-based grout.</P>
<P>5.11 Low-level wastes make a very small contribution to the radioactivity
content in the disposal inventory (less than one part in 10,000).  Typically
they will be packaged into carbon steel boxes, having a length of approximately
four metres.  It is currently envisaged that the waste will not be immobilised
within the container.</P>
<P><A NAME="PhysicalContainment"></A><B>Physical Containment</B></P>
<P>5.12 Physical containment features include the initial prevention of access
of groundwater to the radionuclides in the wastes and subsequent limitation of
the movement of groundwater containing dissolved radionuclides away from them. 
The principal factor contributing to physical containment is the integrity of
the waste containers.  Other contributions are obtained from the inaccessibility
of radionuclides in the wastes themselves, for example where their release
requires the complete corrosion of large steel components, and from the
limitation of movement of dissolved radionuclides by diffusion through the
immobilising grout inside the containers.
</P>
<P>5.13 More than 99% of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory will be
present in the unshielded wasteforms contained in drums or boxes made of
stainless or carbon steel.  The resistance of these steel containers to
corrosion under repository conditions is therefore important to the physical
containment of radionuclides.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.14"></A>5.14 The general corrosion of steels is reduced by
the presence of an alkaline water chemistry.  This is an important benefit of
surrounding the waste containers by Nirex Reference Vault Backfill which is
designed to maintain water in its pores at a high pH (where high pH is an
alkaline condition, low pH an acid condition). Corrosion is also very slow under
the anaerobic conditions that will prevail in the repository after the initial
volume of air has been displaced by inflowing groundwater and any residual
oxygen in the water has been consumed by aerobic corrosion.</P>
<P>5.15 Under anaerobic conditions, steels are subject to corrosion which
affects the entire surface of the metal, rather than at localised points. 
Typical results obtained from long-term research work carried out under
deliberately extreme conditions of temperature (up to the maximum of 80C that
might be reached for a short period of time in the repository) and
representative conditions of water chemistry in the engineered barrier system of
a repository at Sellafield show that the corrosion rate will be less than one
micron per year.  Using these and other data obtained from the research
programme the average time for a metal container to be corroded through has been
calculated to range from 9,000 to 16,000 years for the case of a stainless steel
0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> drum, as reported in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/011, Nirex
Safety Assessment Research Programme, Nirex Near-Field Research: Report on
Current Status in 1994, July 1995 </I>(Sub-section &quot;Container Lifetime
Assessment&quot;, page 16)<I> </I>[NRX/15/1].</P>
<P>5.16 Research has been carried out to determine the effects on physical
containment of the engineered gas vent in some designs of waste container and of
localised corrosion which can affect carbon steels under the initially aerobic
conditions in the repository.  In these cases, there is no significant loss of
containment even if saturation by water were established through the resulting
small penetrations of the container.  The release of radionuclides from the
wasteform to the backfill outside the container is limited by the low rates of
diffusion through the immobilising grout surrounding the waste.</P>
<P>5.17 The decay of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory is shown as a
function of time in <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.  This shows that more
than 95% of the radioactivity would be decayed after 300 years.  It also shows
that if physical containment is conservatively assumed to operate for one
thousand years, the major part of the radioactivity (about 99%) would decay
while contained within the physical barriers afforded by a repository under the
conditions found at Sellafield.  The major contribution to this containment is
the corrosion resistance of the steel containers in the water chemistry of
Sellafield groundwater conditioned to high pH in the pores of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill.</P>
<P> <A NAME="ChemicalContainment"></A><B>Chemical Containment</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.18"></A>5.18 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill surrounding
the emplaced waste containers in the disposal vaults has been carefully
specified to fulfil a number of requirements, namely :</P>
<UL>
<LI>long term maintenance of alkaline porewater chemistry in order to maintain
low dissolved concentrations of key radionuclides under the prevailing
conditions of groundwater flow and geochemistry;
</LI>
<LI>long-term maintenance of a high active-surface-area for sorption of key
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>relatively high permeability and porosity both to ensure homogeneous
performance (so that localised concentrations of materials in wastes do not
exhaust the desired chemical conditioning and thereby locally reduce the
containment performance) and to permit the escape of gas generated by chemical
reactions in the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.19 Two important effects to be taken into account in assessing the
performance at Sellafield of the chemical barrier provided by the backfill are :</P>
<UL>
<LI>leaching of reactive components by groundwater flow; and
</LI>
<LI>reactions with groundwater constituents
</LI></UL>
<P>These are each discussed in the following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.20 Under the chemically reducing ('low Eh') conditions of the repository,
the solubilities in water of several important radioelements such as plutonium
can be reduced to extremely low values (10<SUP>-7</SUP> mols m <SUP>-3</SUP>
in the case of plutonium) at pH values of between 9 and 10. The solubilities
typically remain at these low levels at any higher pH values that may be
realised in the repository.  Accordingly, the chemical conditioning performance
sought from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill in respect of reduction of
solubility is to maintain a pH above 10 for the period of time during which the
relevant radionuclides will decay to insignificant levels.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.21"></A>5.21 The maintenance of the porewater of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill at a pH value above 10 is achieved by the dissolving
into the groundwater of calcium hydroxide which is present in the cement and
lime constituents of the backfill.  The required pH will be maintained until
this supply of calcium hydroxide has been exhausted.   For a given length of
flow path through a repository vault, containing a given amount of backfill, the
rate of removal of calcium hydroxide is determined by the groundwater flow.  For
the proposed volume of about 80,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of backfill in a typical
repository vault having dimensions 550 metres long, 23.5 metres wide and a waste
stack height of 12 metres, and for a groundwater flow through the repository of
140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year    - as calculated in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3,
Sub-Section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522] from the hydrogeological data for the
Sellafield site - simple calculation shows that the pH would be maintained at a
value of greater than 10 for many millions of years.</P>
<P>5.22 It is important to understand whether the pH could be reduced more
rapidly than implied by this simple calculation.  This could occur in parts of
the repository by concentration of groundwater flows through localised
conductive features in the rock, leaving other parts of the repository with a
correspondingly longer period at high pH.  From the information presented on
groundwater compositions in <I>Nirex Report 524, The Geology and Hydrogeology
of the Sellafield Area : Interim Assessment : December 1993 </I>(Volume 3,
Tables 3.4, 3.5 and 3.7) [COR/517], it is also possible to identify a number of
dissolved chemicals present at depth in the PRZ at Sellafield which are reactive
towards cements.  All of these are taken into account, alongside similar
reactive chemicals in the wastes themselves or which would result from their
eventual breakdown, in calculating the period of time for which a high pH would
be maintained.  The results obtained so far allow us to assume conservatively
that the required pH value of 10 or more would be maintained throughout the
repository for one million years.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.23"></A>5.23 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill was designed
to afford a large surface area in its pore structure for the sorption of
radionuclides from solution in the groundwater.  The value measured for pore
surface area of 2.8 x 10<SUP>4</SUP> m<SUP>2</SUP> per kilogram of material is
highly favourable in this respect.  It is recognised that some chemical
reactions could block off parts of the porous structure of the backfill material
or that cracks could develop in the backfill and the crack surfaces become
altered to give less sorption.  None of the experimental work carried out using
synthesised Sellafield groundwater and related modelling work has indicated any
significant adverse effects.  However, in current safety assessment studies, the
sorption capacity has been reduced from the high values observed in experiments,
to take account of uncertainties in this respect.</P>
<P>5.24 A convenient way of reflecting the physical and chemical containment
afforded by the engineered barriers in the repository concept is to draw a graph
of the &quot;fractional release&quot; of a radionuclide of interest as a
function of time.  The fractional release is that fraction of the total amount
of the radionuclide in the initial disposal inventory that would be found in the
geosphere at a given time.  Its calculation takes account of release of the
radionuclide from the engineered system of the repository and also of depletion
of the radionuclide by radioactive decay.  Low values of fractional release
indicate a good containment performance by the engineered barriers.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.25"></A>5.25 <A HREF="#Figure5.2">Figure 5.2</A> shows the
benefit of chemical containment by reduction of solubility, by sorption and by
the combination of the two processes in the near field in terms of the
fractional release to the geosphere from the disposal inventory of
plutonium-239.  It can be seen that the chemical containment performance that
would be afforded by the action of the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill within the
groundwater system in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield is calculated to limit
the fractional release of plutonium-239 to approximately one part in two
thousand.  This explains why, in assessment studies of the post-closure
performance of the total repository system,  plutonium-239 is found to return to
the surface environment in such low concentrations as to make no significant
contribution to radiological risk, as shown in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table
6.18, page 6.36)<I> </I>[COR/522].</P>
<P>5.26 Calculations of fractional releases for longer-lived radionuclides than
plutonium-239 show that the chemical containment significantly limits their
fractional release for very long periods of time (beyond one million years in
the case of uranium-238.)  A period of one million years, conservatively taken
as the duration for the operation of chemical containment in a repository
located in the PRZ at Sellafield, is marked on <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.
 This shows that over 99% of the residual 1% of radioactivity present in
long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which chemical
containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH, is
maintained.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalBarrier"></A><B> Natural Barrier</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.27"></A>5.27 On the basis of the evidence that I have
presented thus far, the natural barrier afforded by the BVG rocks in the PRZ at
Sellafield would ensure a low fractional release, that is radiologically
insignificant, of all but a small number of the longest-lived radionuclides, as
a result of the physical and chemical containment by the engineered barriers of
the repository in that location.  In the case of uranium-238, having a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years,  the release to the geosphere would be limited
for over a million years by the low solubility in the high pH water in the
repository and sorption onto cement phases.  However, two long-lived
radionuclides, chlorine-36 and iodine-129, do not have the metallic character in
their solution behaviour that leads to reduction of solubility in alkali
solution, and in experimental work to date have been found not to sorb strongly
to cement phases or geological minerals.  Accordingly the behaviour of these
radionuclides is modelled by assuming high solubilities and no retardation by
sorption in the flow of groundwater from depth to the surface.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.28"></A>5.28 The further important role of the natural
barrier, identified at the start of this section of my Proof of Evidence is to
ensure that residual long-lived radionuclides that are not physically and
chemically contained by the engineered barriers, representing around 0.01% of
the initial radioactivity, do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.  This requires that the dissolved levels of radionuclides will be
sufficiently diluted to low concentrations in the groundwater eventually
carrying them to the surface.</P>
<P>5.29 The extent of dilution is determined by :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the quantity of water flowing in the near-surface rocks, into which
groundwater bearing radionuclides from the repository moves;
</LI>
<LI>the area of near-surface rocks into which groundwater bearing radionuclides
moves : the greater the area the larger the volume of water for dilution
(spreading in space); and
</LI>
<LI>the time over which the radionuclides are released into the near-surface
groundwater system.  The spreading in time arises from the rate at which they
are released from the repository (determined by flow of groundwater through the
repository and the repository porewater concentrations determined by the
physical and chemical barriers) and spreading in time during passage through the
geosphere due to processes such as dispersion, sorption and rock matrix
diffusion.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.30 A further dilution is afforded if the discharge of groundwater from the
geosphere occurs into surface water in the biosphere - in the form of streams,
lakes or the sea - before becoming accessible to people.</P>
<P>5.31 For a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, the
release from the repository of radionuclides such as uranium-238 can extend to
over a million years as a result of solubility and sorption control in the
engineered barriers and of the relatively low groundwater flow through the
repository of 140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year, as given at paragraph 5.21 of my
evidence.  Even for those radionuclides such as chlorine-36 and iodine-129 that
may not be subject to solubility and sorption control, it would take more than a
thousand years to flush the radionuclides out of the repository in a flow of 140
m<SUP>3</SUP> per year.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.32"></A>5.32 The principal source of dilution by mixing of
repository-derived groundwater with groundwater in overlying rocks is provided
at Sellafield by the Calder Sandstone.  A simple calculation is carried out in<I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3,<I> </I>Sub&#173;section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522].  It shows<I></I>that
dilution by a factor of about 600 would be achieved by assuming direct mixing of
the flow of groundwater through the repository with the flow of groundwater
discharging through an area equivalent to the plan area of the repository to
surface from the Calder Sandstone.  For the radionuclides chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 the spreading in time resulting from the short duration of the source
term compared to the geosphere travel time gives a greater dilution factor of
about 2,000.</P>
<P>5.33 As concluded in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 9.1, page 9.2)
[COR/522] the groundwater flow models used in the reported assessment studies
predict that groundwater flow from a repository located in the PRZ to the
surface environment will emerge predominantly at the bed of the eastern edge of
the Irish Sea.  If sea levels were to remain as at present, the discharge at
this location would be subject to a further and considerable dilution by sea
water.  As a consequence of these successive dilutions, the annual radiological
risk to an individual for discharge of all radionuclides to the marine
environment is assessed to be at least three orders of magnitude below the
target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>.
</P>
<P>5.34 This annual risk to an individual is an output from the models that I
described in Section 4 of my evidence.  The computed mean value of risk is
plotted on a graph as a function of time.  It is a mean value because of the use
of probabilistic safety assessment methods in which the calculations are
repeated a number of times, corresponding to the sampling of the allowed ranges
of values for input parameters, and an arithmetic mean is taken of the resulting
values for risk.  The appropriate graph showing the base-case calculation of
risk from marine discharge in a Temperate (as current) climate is produced as
<A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>,  after<I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Figure
6.6) [COR/522].</P>
<P>5.35 Under present conditions at Sellafield, a small proportion of the
discharge might occur to the terrestrial environment in association with incised
river beds.  Furthermore, the time taken for emergence into the sea bed would be
such that the sea level could possibly be lower as a consequence of climate
change, possibly placing the whole of the discharge in a terrestrial
environment.
</P>
<P>5.36 Three further curves are presented in <A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>
for a terrestrial discharge under three different biosphere states,
corresponding to Temperate, Periglacial and Boreal climates.  On the basis of
current understanding of global climate patterns, Temperate or warmer conditions
are expected to persist at Sellafield for several thousand years.  Beyond that
time period, colder Boreal or Periglacial conditions need to be considered.  For
the purpose of model calculations, each climate state is assumed to persist over
the full period evaluated.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.37"></A>5.37 The Boreal climate state will be associated
with a lower sea level than the current sea level.  Discharge is therefore
likely to be terrestrial.  The peak annual  individual risks in the Boreal
terrestrial state are 1.1 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at twenty thousand years after
repository closure and 3.3 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at four million years after
closure.  In all calculations for discharges to a terrestrial environment, the
maximum of the risk curve occurring at about twenty thousand years is
attributable mainly to chlorine-36 (with iodine-129 making a contribution of
around 4%), and that after more than a million years is attributable to the
daughter radionuclides of uranium-238, in particular radium-226.  Chlorine-36 is
effectively transported to the surface at the same rate as the water in which it
is dissolved and the peak at about twenty thousand years corresponds to the most
probable value of calculated groundwater return time.  The most significant
component of the calculated risk is from radionuclides entering the food chain,
particularly through milk derived from pasture-grazing cows.</P>
<P>5.38 Simple scoping studies were carried out to allow calculations of risk
for 'agricultural wells' in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 6.7, pages
6.18 to 6.20) [COR/522].  The preliminary estimate of peak annual individual
risk is 1.7 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP> on the basis of an assessment for chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 only : these radionuclides are expected to dominate risk in the
period before 10<SUP>5</SUP> years.  It is found that iodine-129 is the major
contributor.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.39"></A>5.39 As noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522], further
refinement of the assessment methodology will produce a better view of risk from
agricultural wells.  As for all the results in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522], the
calculations for agricultural wells reflect a reference repository design rather
than an optimised system.  If necessary, there is scope for taking specific
waste emplacement and repository design measures to reduce the risks as part of
the optimisation process which ensures that releases are as low as reasonably
practicable.  In the case of iodine-129, which is the main contributor to the
risk, 50% of the inventory is contained in a limited volume of waste, about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>, as stated in paragraph 5.8.  For such relatively small volumes
of waste, there is flexibility to develop specific measures, which might be
impractical for larger volumes of waste.</P>
<P>5.40. A number of variant calculations were reported in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume
3, Section 7, pages 7.1 to 7.18) [COR/522].  These showed that the risks
calculated to arise from a repository at Sellafield were not greatly changed as
a result of changes in the spreading time for radionuclide transport in the
geosphere if the duration of their release from the repository remains constant
(that duration is inversely proportional to the groundwater flow through the
repository.)  Similarly, the system is robust to changes in the duration of the
release if the spreading time in the geosphere remains constant.  It is only if
the duration of the release and the spreading time in the geosphere both have
values significantly lower than currently calculated that annual individual
radiological risks in excess of the target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP> were calculated
in <I>Nirex 95</I> (Volume 3, Figure 8.8) [COR/522] to arise from natural
discharges to the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="GasPathway"></A><B>Gas Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.41"></A>5.41 The gas pathway refers to the migration of
radionuclides in gaseous form from the repository to the surface environment. 
The most radiologically significant processes have been calculated to involve
the incorporation of carbon-14 from the disposal inventory in methane generated
from microbiological degradation of wastes in the repository and the subsequent
entry of this methane into the food chain, as noted in <I>Nirex Science Report
S/94/003, Post-closure Performance Assessment: Gas Generation and Migration,
November 1994 (&quot;Nirex Report S/94/003&quot;) </I>(Section 4.1, page 20)
[COR/509].
</P>
<P>5.42 The carbon-14 inventory of 2,600 TBq represents less than 0.1% of the
total disposal inventory.  Scoping calculations have been carried out making the
following simplifications that are believed to be highly conservative :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>all the carbon-14 in wastes that contain biodegradable material is
converted to gas;
</LI>
<LI>maximum rates of methane generation are achieved simultaneously in waste
packages throughout the repository;
</LI>
<LI>all the gas generated in the repository is transported instantaneously from
the repository to the surface and therefore no radioactive decay occurs; and
</LI>
<LI>the gas does not spread out in the geosphere to emerge in the surface soils
over a larger area than the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> This leads to fluxes of carbon-14 in methane entering the biosphere that
are equivalent to annual risks to an individual of about 10<SUP>-7</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.43 Work is also under way in the Nirex Safety Assessment Research
Programme ('NSARP') to study the possible significance of gas-water interactions
on radionuclide transport.  As noted in <I>Nirex Report S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section
3.3, page 16) [COR/509] much of the required information is now available but
the RCF is intended to enable some of the required site-specific data to be
acquired.
</P>
<P><A NAME="DisruptiveEvents"></A><B>Natural Disruptive Events and
Inadvertent Human Intrusion
</B></P>
<P>5.44 As discussed in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/004, Post-closure
Performance Assessment, Human Intrusion and Natural Disruptive Events, July 1995
(&quot;Nirex Report S/95/004&quot;) </I>(Sub-section 3.2, pages 12 and 13;
Section 5, page 16) [NRX/15/2], the location of a repository in the BVG at
Sellafield is likely<I></I>to afford a high level of isolation of the wastes
from the effects of natural disruptive events, such as erosion and seismicity,
and inadvertent human intrusion.</P>
<P>5.45 The principal form of inadvertent human intrusion considered to date
has involved the radiological exposure of geotechnical workers or surface
inhabitants as a result of inadvertent drilling of boreholes into the repository
at some time in the future, when records of its existence may no longer exist. 
In terms of the relevant characteristics - the dimensions of a repository vault
cross-section and the inventory of heavy metal radionuclides - the current
repository concept correlates quite closely with that assessed for the human
intrusion scenario for a repository in the PRZ at Sellafield in <I>PERA </I>(paragraphs
5.6.11 to 5.6.14, pages 36 and 37) [COR/501].  A peak annual individual risk
from intrusion of less than 10<SUP>-8</SUP> was given in Table 5.2 of that
report.  <I>Nirex Report S/95/004 </I>(Sub-section 3.1, pages 9 to 12)
[NRX/15/2]<I>  </I>updates the information on mineral resources in the
Sellafield location on the basis of the extensive investigations carried out by
Nirex.  There has been no finding of a significant new resource that would
suggest a higher incidence of drilling than assumed in <I>PERA</I> [COR/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="PotentialSuitabiltiy"></A><B>Potential Suitability of Sellafield
as a Location for a Repository
</B></P>
<P>5.46 The analysis I have presented above confirms the good promise of
Sellafield as a potentially suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater
pathway is central to our considerations of repository safety and therefore
requires to be well understood.  If resolution of uncertainties, as identified
in Section 6 below, confirms our current understanding of the groundwater system
at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the BVG rocks of the PRZ
which would meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>5.47 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield are
consistent with the physical and chemical containment of all but a small
fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just three
radionuclides, chlorine-36, iodine-129 and uranium-238, are calculated to be
released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the peak risk
either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>5.48 If conditions at the Sellafield site were to remain as at present,
resulting in predicted discharge predominantly to a marine environment, these
releases would have small consequences when compared with the risk target.  For
release of chlorine-36 to a terrestrial environment - and of iodine-129 in the
case of agricultural wells - the groundwater system needs to provide dilution of
levels of radionuclides in repository-derived groundwater sufficient to lead to
calculated risks consistent with regulatory requirements.  On the basis of the
calculations carried out, it is judged that such dilution will be afforded by
the hydrogeological system at Sellafield.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.49"></A>5.49 The strong chemical containment that will be
afforded to uranium by the Nirex repository concept ensures that any significant
migration to the surface of  uranium-238 and its daughter radionuclides only
occurs at times beyond about one hundred thousand years after repository
closure, as shown in <I>Nirex 95
</I>(Volume 3, Section 6.4, pages 6.10 to 6.12) [COR/522].  The very long
radioactive decay half-life of uranium-238,  approaching 4,500 million years,
means that it will return to the surface eventually unless a process of
mineralisation leads to its permanent incorporation in the constituents of the
cement-based backfill or the host rocks.  There is evidence that this may happen
but Nirex is not yet sufficiently confident in the evidence to incorporate the
process in safety assessments.  It is of course this long half-life that
accounts for the abundant natural occurrence of uranium-238 on the planet. 
Given the considerable uncertainties associated with numerical assessments over
timescales of the order of a million years, a comparison with naturally
occurring radioactivity is considered to represent a more effective way of
demonstrating the containment performance of the system with respect to this
nuclide,  This approach is under development for use in future assessment
studies.  Nevertheless, the extension of the numerical assessments to times
beyond one million years has produced a calculated annual individual risk of 3.3
x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> for a Boreal climate state.</P>
<P>5.50 The presentation in my evidence of the containment performance of the
barriers in a repository located at Sellafield enables the identification of
aspects of the site where Nirex must be confident that the underlying judgments
are correct and that the range of uncertainty has been narrowed sufficiently. 
These are :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the groundwater flow into the near field of the repository, which
determines the duration of chemical containment and the rates of release of
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>the dilution, during transport in the geosphere, of the dissolved
radionuclides in the groundwater released from the repository, which determines
the concentrations of radionuclides in groundwater reaching the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para5.51"></A>5.51 The most probable value for the groundwater
flow into the near field of the repository is predicted to be  140 m<SUP>3
</SUP>per year as stated in paragraph 5.21.  This value is consistent with
maintenance of chemical containment in the engineered barriers of the repository
for a million years and limits the release of uranium-238 to levels consistent
with risks meeting regulatory requirements.  This value is also consistent with
sufficient spreading in time of the release of chlorine-36 from the repository
to ensure its subsequent dilution to levels that are also consistent with risks
meeting regulatory requirements.  However, groundwater flows greater than this
cannot be ruled out.  It is noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 2.3,
page 2.13) [COR/522] that on the basis of the current judgments about the
networks of connected fractures in the BVG used to calculate the flow, a small
probability exists that the flow could be 150 times greater (or indeed smaller).
 If it were found that the description of the networks of connected fractures
giving a flow 150 times greater is a better representation of the fractures in
the BVG, then a repository would probably not meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.52"></A>5.52 Similarly, the most probable value currently
predicted for the dilution of radionuclides in the geosphere is consistent with
a repository performance meeting regulatory requirements.  This dilution is
highly dependent upon the path taken by groundwater from the repository to the
surface environment.  The modelled path is determined by the judgments
concerning networks of connected fractures in both the BVG and the overlying
sedimentary formations and we must be confident that these are correct also.</P>
<P>5.53 The relevant information on the geology and hydrogeology of Sellafield,
available in most part by early 1994, was used in the calculations of risk
reported in Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95
</I>[COR/522].  Dr. Chaplow presents in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) the further information which
has become available since then.</P>
<P>5.54 This further information has added to confidence that the site at
Sellafield offers a stable geological setting which will provide a low
groundwater flow through a repository located in the BVG and high dilution in
the overlying rocks for radionuclides released from repository vaults.  It
includes information on groundwater chemistry indicating long residence times
for the groundwater in the BVG, and results from the cross-hole testing and
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test.  These tests have provided information on the limited
nature of the connections over extended length scales in the fracture systems in
the BVG and have indicated little connection between the BVG and overlying
sandstones.  While models of the groundwater system have not yet been updated
and implications for risk calculated, I consider that this later information
broadly supports the basis of <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522] with some indications
that the modelling in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522]  may have been conservative in
its representation of networks of connected fractures in the BVG and overlying
sandstones.</P>
<P>5.55 In Section 6 of my evidence, I describe the information needed from the
RCF to build further confidence in our judgments before key decisions can be
made in the deep repository development programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="InformationRequired"></A><B>6. INFORMATION REQUIRED FROM THE RCF</B></P>
<P>6.1 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">paragraph 6.21</A>) notes that for
present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the development of
a repository:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under
RSA93; and
</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.
</LI></UL>
<P> Nirex will prepare assessments of the post-closure safety performance of
the repository for each of these decision points.  That prepared for the first
decision point will necessarily be preliminary and will be filled out and
finalised to enable the regulatory authorities to take a decision on approval of
the start of disposal operations.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.2"></A>6.2 As described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of
Evidence, (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.22">paragraphs 6.22</A> to 6.24), the
information requirements for the different stages of post-closure safety
performance assessment are somewhat different in character.  This leads to the
identification of two separate categories of information required.  These have
different timescales for delivery that are related to the two decision points
identified above.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The RCF programme, comprising 3 phases, has been
developed to deliver the information that is needed in accordance with these
timescales.  It is expected that Phase 1 of the RCF programme could deliver the
information required in relation to a decision to propose development of a
repository.  In particular, as will be explained in the following paragraphs in
this Section of my evidence, we need to obtain sufficient information to build
confidence in key models used in assessments of repository post-closure
performance and to enable confident extrapolation of descriptions of the rock
mass and groundwater system across the PRZ for use in developing the repository
design.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.4"></A>6.4 The confidence achieved by the end of Phase 1 of
the RCF programme will be dependent upon the amount and nature of information
that has been obtained at that stage.  The information available will determine
the extent to which models and extrapolations can be put to the test.  The
adequacy of this testing will be subject to rigorous review as part of informing
a decision on whether to  propose development of a repository.  In the event
that it is found inadequate,  further information will be sought from one or
both of the subsequent phases of the RCF programme.  A possible scenario is that
more information will be required on geological and hydrogeological
characteristics accessible to an extent that is too limited in Phase 1 as a
result of their orientation or spacing in relation to the shafts and connecting
galleries.  In that case the subsequent extension of the horizontal galleries of
the RCF, and drilling out from those galleries, will be designed to overcome
this limitation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.5"></A>6.5 The first category of information, required to
inform a decision on whether to propose development of a repository, relates to
those factors which are most important in determining the suitability of the
site as a location for a repository.  These factors are our predictions of
groundwater flow and dilution, the potential for natural or induced changes to
create significant new pathways for groundwater flow, and repository design. 
The position that the Company considers it necessary to achieve in respect of
each of these factors for the first decision point is as follows :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution and that
these predictions are consistent with meeting regulatory requirements;
</LI>
<LI>confidence that construction of a repository at the site, or future
naturally induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which
would significantly impair repository performance; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence in the basis for optimisation of repository depth, location,
layout and orientation, and consequent confidence in cost estimates for
repository construction.
</LI></UL>
<P> The safety assessment to be prepared in relation to this decision point
will be required to take account of the alternative scenarios for long-term
evolution of the repository system and information on naturally induced changes
will be important to establish the appropriate framework for such an analysis.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 In the second category of information, required
in relation to a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether to approve
the start of disposal operations, are those factors which will have been
addressed in the laboratory or at other research sites, but where it is likely
that the regulatory authorities will require an in situ demonstration that the
results are applicable to the repository site.  Such information requirements
are currently considered to relate to the following :</P>
<UL>
<LI>processes that can influence the transport of radionuclides in groundwater
in the geosphere;  
</LI>
<LI>quantifications of long-term effects of the interaction of the repository
system with the localised flows in the surrounding rocks; and
</LI>
<LI>finalisation of detailed design, including repository sealing measures.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 Our work has indicated that the factors for which information is sought
in this second category are not likely to determine the basic suitability of a
site as a location for a repository.  Repository safety is calculated to be less
sensitive to the ranges of assumptions that can reasonably be made about these
factors.  However, the demonstration that these factors have been taken into
account in a realistic manner is considered to be a necessary element of a
finalised assessment of post-closure safety performance needed to inform a
decision by the regulatory authorities on approval of the start of disposal
operations.  It is also considered that the second category of information will
include that required to fill out the information supplied in the safety
assessment, prepared at the first key decision point, and that this will be
achieved through a process of further systematic validation.</P>
<P>6.8 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need to
address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of the
repository, but will identify specific remaining uncertainties and the steps
that will be taken to resolve them.  If a robust evaluation can be achieved by
the end of Phase 1 of the RCF programme, then the further work in Phase 2 and
Phase 3 of the RCF programme would continue to address remaining uncertainties,
probably within the framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities,
for the progressive supply of information leading to a decision on approval to
start disposal of wastes in the repository.  </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 The calculations that we have carried out in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 9, pages 9.1 to 9.4) [COR/522] indicate that a
repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield could be developed
which would meet regulatory requirements.  This is conditional on the basis that
judgments about the rock characteristics, leading to predictions of groundwater
flow, are correct.  The risk calculations are based on a conceptual model which
contains a particular description of the networks of connected fractures
controlling flow in the BVG.  Uncertainties in the values of parameters
describing the networks have been recognised by ascribing a range of values
having different probabilities about a central value for each parameter.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Limitations on surface-based observations mean
that we cannot measure the parameters of interest directly.  Expert judgment has
been used in developing the conceptual model and associated ranges of parameter
values.  It is recognised by Nirex and the experts involved in this exercise
that different judgments could be arrived at, leading to different conceptual
models with different ranges of parameter values around different central
values.  Some of these alternative models, albeit improbable, could lead to the
prediction of high values for the flow of groundwater into the repository or low
values for its dilution in the overlying rocks that would not be consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements for post-closure safety of a repository. </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The remedy is to subject these conceptual
models to a process of validation involving forward predictions, using the
outputs of these models, and testing these predictions against field
observations. This process of validation can be used to achieve the following
objectives :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>discrimination between alternative conceptual models of the same system
using tests to measure directly some aspect of the system for which different
predictions are given by the alternative models;
</LI>
<LI>refinement of a conceptual model where there is some uncertainty about one
or more components of the model, or about the parameters associated with the
model, and the predictions can be compared with test results to reduce or remove
the uncertainty; and
</LI>
<LI>confirmation of a conceptual model as fit for its intended purpose in
post-closure performance assessment studies through testing of the adequacy of
its predictions.
</LI></UL>
<P> This process is intrinsic to the Nirex programme of hydrogeological
investigations, where modelling has been carried out to design the more
extensive hydrogeological tests and to establish criteria for their successful
implementation, and will be developed further for application in the RCF. </P>
<P>6.12 In developing the approach to model validation for the RCF programme,
it is recognised that predictions of the parameters that largely determine
overall system performance, such as groundwater flow through the repository and
dilution of levels of dissolved radionuclides in the geosphere, cannot be tested
directly.  The validation testing of the component conceptual models that are
combined to create the description of the overall system performance must be
sufficiently rigorous, therefore, to build confidence in their application. 
This implies requirements for testing over a range of length scales and for
acquiring sufficient test data to satisfy scientific opinion as to the adequacy
of the process.
</P>
<P>6.13 The RCF overcomes limitations of surface-based or laboratory
investigations for validation in the following ways :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the RCF would permit tests and observations in three dimensions and at a
scale more directly comparable to that of the repository;
</LI>
<LI>specialised tests could be performed in situ, directly on specific features
of relevance to repository performance and under geotechnical and
hydrogeotechnical  conditions which are closely comparable to those of the
repository; and
</LI>
<LI>the RCF would allow direct, in situ, observation and measurement of the
response to excavation of the potential repository host rocks and groundwater
system on a scale, at a depth, and in a location which would provide information
which can be directly related to the performance of a repository within the PRZ.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.14 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.6">paragraph 6.6</A>) has identified that the
information that the RCF will provide can be considered to address uncertainties
in three main areas :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> The nature of the key uncertainties will be explained under these headings
in the following paragraphs.  The information required to address them will be
identified in terms of its categorisation in relation to the future developments
of post-closure performance assessments to support the two decision points as
discussed above.  It will be explained why the information required can only be
obtained through the underground access to the rock mass which will be afforded
by the RCF.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterFlow"></A><B>Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide
Transport</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.15"></A>6.15 The performance of the engineered barriers of
the repository in affording physical and chemical containment is dependent upon
the flow and composition of the groundwater in the repository.  The overall
performance will determine the rate of transfer of dissolved radionuclides in
groundwater out of the near-field of the repository into the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.16 The transport of radionuclides by the groundwater in the geosphere is
dependent upon the characteristics of the rock that control groundwater flow and
the physical and chemical processes that operate within the rock.  The combined
characteristics of the repository host rock and overlying rocks will determine
the pathways taken by radionuclides to return to the surface and the
concentrations at which they will emerge in the biosphere.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.17"></A>6.17 The first category of information required
before a decision is made to propose development of a repository is to test
assumptions made about the characteristics of the site in relation to :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository; and
</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>the spreading in the geosphere of residual mobile or long-lived
radionuclides from the repository in groundwater that reaches the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.18"></A>6.18 The second category of information, required to
be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision on
whether to approve the start of disposal operations is to test that evaluations
of processes having the potential to affect the transport of radionuclides have
realistically estimated the effects on post-closure performance.  Currently,
three potentially important processes are identified where information is needed
from the RCF:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> In addition, the second category of information will include that required
to fill out the information supplied on groundwater flow and on spreading and
dilution in the geosphere in the safety assessment prepared at the first key
decision point.</P>
<P>6.19 The information required on each of the identified subjects is
described under separate headings in the following paragraphs.
</P>
<P>Calculation of Groundwater Flow through the Repository</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.20"></A>6.20 The calculation of groundwater flow through the
repository is carried out on the basis of descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, as given in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.2, pages 5.6 to 5.10) [COR/522].  It is
considered that groundwater flow occurs predominantly in fractures existing in
hard rocks such as the BVG.   Further, it is considered that fractures are not
uniformly distributed through the rock but that, as a result of natural
processes in the geological evolution of the rock formation, several individual
fractures can have developed together in connected networks.  These networks
would extend over greater distances than their component individual fractures
and are therefore likely to be more significant in controlling groundwater flow
through the rock.</P>
<P>6.21 The flow of groundwater through such a network of connected fractures
is controlled by factors such as its overall length, the aperture of the
individual fractures in the network, the ways in which they are connected
together and the variability of these characteristics within the overall
network.  The flow of groundwater through a repository will be determined by the
properties of these networks of connected fractures, by the number of them
intersected by the disposal vaults and by the hydraulic pressure gradients
driving water along them.  The locations of the networks and the spacings
between them are therefore also important information, as is the distribution of
hydraulic pressures within the networks.
</P>
<P>6.22 As described in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.1.2, pages
5.3 to 5.5) [COR/522], the results of hydrogeological tests carried out in
boreholes have been interpreted in terms of assumed intersections of the
networks of connected fractures by the boreholes.  Where such an intersection is
assumed, the properties of the fracture network are inferred from the
hydrogeological measurements.  The maximum lengths of these features are put at
many hundreds of metres and so an individual borehole having a diameter of about
150 mm would be intersecting only a small part of the overall system.  This
introduces considerable uncertainties which are recognised by Nirex in assigning
a wide range of possible descriptions to the network of connected fractures and
an associated wide range of values for the important properties.</P>
<P>6.23 The networks of connected fractures can be investigated over a greater
lengthscale by means of cross-hole testing between different boreholes.  Nirex
has carried out such tests, culminating in the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, as
described by Dr Chaplow in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para6.36">paragraphs 6.36</A> to 6.40).  These
tests have involved the generation of different possible descriptions of the
networks of connected fractures, in the forms of alternative conceptual models. 
By comparing the predictions of these models with the results of testing,
uncertainties concerning groundwater flows can be resolved to some extent and as
noted in paragraph 5.54 the outcomes appear encouraging.  However, the principal
uncertainty, concerning the range of possible descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures, will remain in the absence of direct observations and
complementary testing of the networks.
</P>
<P>6.24 The information required from the RCF is a description of the networks
of connected fractures as the main groundwater flow channels in the BVG, and the
range of values that should be assigned to the key properties of these features,
based upon physical observations.  Furthermore, the information obtained must be
capable of extrapolation both in space, throughout the volume of the BVG rocks
in the PRZ, and also in time, to validate the application of the resulting
models in assessments of repository post-closure performance at long times into
the future.</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF will allow such information to be obtained because it will
afford the opportunity to carry out complementary activities in parallel. 
Direct observations can be made on the way in which individual fractures are
connected to form extended networks.  The properties of the individual fractures
can be measured in parallel with the measurement of the properties of the
connected system as described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.11">paragraph 6.11</A>).</P>
<P>6.26 The access to a large volume of rock containing the networks of
connected fractures will allow observations to be made of their locations and of
any association with other geological features such as faults.  Relationships
with recognisable geological structures and information on trends in the
orientation and spacing of the features would allow the testing of this
information against further observations and would attach greater confidence to
the extrapolation through the rock volume.</P>
<P>6.27 Our current groundwater flow models do not fully reproduce the
hydraulic pressure field that is deduced from borehole measurements.  A
significant factor in the current differences between observation and prediction
may be the way in which the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures
are used to calculate hydrogeological properties on a regional scale.  A further
model development is planned, possibly incorporating relationships between the
depth and location of the networks and their hydrogeological properties, to
address this issue. Sinking of the RCF shafts will provide information to test
the validity of such models.</P>
<P> Spreading in the Geosphere</P>
<P>6.28 As described in paragraphs 5.28 and 5.29 of my evidence, the
concentrations at which radionuclides will be present in groundwater reaching
the surface environment will be determined by a number of factors including
their rate of release from the repository and their spreading in time and space
during passage through the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.29 The rate of release from the repository is largely determined by the
groundwater flow through the near field of the repository (taking account of the
containment afforded by the engineered barriers), where the RCF is intended to
provide essential information.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 The RCF is intended to provide information for
use in determining the spreading in time and space of the transport of
radionuclides in the BVG rocks and the overlying sedimentary formations.  The
spreading of radionuclide transport will be highly dependent upon the properties
of the main groundwater flow channels in the geological formation. Thus, the
information on groundwater flow channels in the BVG rocks sought from the RCF in
relation to calculations of groundwater flow through the repository would be
required for this second purpose also.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.31"></A>6.31 The other geological formation which is
important in this context is the St. Bees Sandstone.  A wide range of
conceptualisations of the flow channels in this formation remains possible on
the basis of the results obtained so far.  At one extreme, this range includes
approximately vertical connected fracture networks extending over large
distances and possibly connected with fracture networks in the BVG.  At the
other extreme of the range is the possibility that horizontal bedding
structures, produced by the sedimentation processes that created the sandstones,
would force the groundwater flow in a horizontal direction.</P>
<P>6.32 The RCF will afford the direct observation of the structural
characteristics of the St. Bees Sandstone, as exposed in the RCF shafts.  The
correlation of the observed large scale geological structures with observations
of groundwater flow and hydrogeological responses in the monitoring boreholes
nearby should enable us to distinguish between the possible descriptions.  A
description based upon physical observations could then be used to calculate the
spreading in time and space for radionuclide transport through this rock
formation.</P>
<P> Rock Matrix Diffusion</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.33"></A>6.33 Radionuclides transported in groundwater along
flow channels in rocks, may diffuse into the surrounding bulk rock matrix.  This
would have the effect of retarding the transport of radionuclides and also
result in some spreading in the geosphere of the initial radionuclide release
from the repository.  The consequent access to sorption sites in the surrounding
bulk rock matrix affords additional retardation to radionuclide transport.  The
nature and extent of the operation of rock matrix diffusion and sorption affects
the calculated radiological consequences of the release of metallic
radionuclides such as uranium-238 in particular.</P>
<P>6.34 Particularly in the BVG there are uncertainties as to the extent to
which this beneficial process will operate. The uncertainties arise from
uncertainties about the networks of connected fractures, the internal structures
of the fractures themselves and the in situ diffusivity of the rock matrix.</P>
<P>6.35 The requirement for this information is placed in the second category, 
to be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision
on whether to approve the start of disposal operations.  Information on the
process of rock matrix diffusion has been obtained from laboratory measurements
and experiments on rock core samples.  However, for the results of this research
to be used with confidence it must be ensured that the measurements were
applicable to the main flow channels and that important properties of the rock
were not modified by their removal from the bulk rock at depth to a laboratory. 
The RCF is required to give direct access to, and measurements in, fractures
identified on the basis of their groundwater flow properties, and to make these
measurements in situ with relatively little disturbance of the rocks.</P>
<P> Colloid Transport</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.36"></A>6.36 Colloids are small particles of matter which
remain suspended in groundwater because they do not settle under gravity.  If
colloidal particles are present in sufficiently large concentrations and remain
stable for a sufficient length of time they have the potential to cause an
increase in the effective transport of radionuclides in groundwater by
incorporating radionuclides from the near field.  No conclusive evidence has
been found to suggest that colloids would exist at significant concentrations in
a repository at Sellafield.  However, because of the known difficulties of
taking undisturbed samples of groundwater to analyse for colloids, robust
arguments are not available to demonstrate that colloids will not be present. 
The key uncertainties relate to the quantities of colloids present in Sellafield
groundwaters and the transport of colloids in fractures in the rocks at
Sellafield.</P>
<P>6.37 Considerable efforts are being made to collect good groundwater samples
from the boreholes at Sellafield for colloid analysis including the drilling of
boreholes without the use of drilling muds.  Whereas the practical difficulties
have been overcome successfully for the analysis of species in solution in
groundwater, the ability to obtain reliable samples and analyses of the colloid
population is hampered by the introduction of relatively large quantities of
particulate matter from the materials of the sampling equipment and the fluids
necessarily used to drill, test and sample the boreholes.  The immediate
accessibility of the rocks at depth in the RCF affords the opportunity to take
undisturbed samples of known origins.  This is because more specialised sampling
equipment, including provisions for stabilising existing conditions, can be
located precisely within a feature of interest.  This benefit of working within
the RCF is extended to more general geochemical sampling where a higher spatial
coverage of sampling can be achieved than through the use of boreholes drilled
from the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.38"></A>6.38 Nirex will seek to generate relatively simple
empirically based models of colloid transport based on experiments conducted
using flow rates and fracture properties of interest.  Given the requirements
for direct access to the fracture system in conjunction with the need for a high
level of control of the experimental conditions there is a particular necessity
to carry out such experiments in the RCF.  It is envisaged that these
experiments would characterise the transport of different colloids relative to a
conservative tracer (a substance that is readily identified and remains
dissolved in water as a trace on its movement) within a single fracture that had
previously been characterised.</P>
<P>Gas Migration</P>
<P>6.39 Our current understanding of processes relevant to gas migration
through the geosphere has been developed through the NSARP experimental
programme at Reskajeage Quarry in Cornwall.  The experimental results have been
used to develop and refine the modelling approach described in <I>Nirex Report
S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section 3.3, pages 13 to 16) [COR/509].  There are two aspects
of gas migration for which in situ testing is needed to confirm understanding
and validate models in order to increase confidence both in the evaluation of
the gas pathway itself and in the assessment of the effect of gas migration on
groundwater flow :</P>
<UL>
<LI>the entry of the gas into the water-saturated fracture network, since it is
necessary to be able to predict the maximum overpressuring that will be
generated in the repository as a result of gas production, in order to estimate
the potential for gas-induced fracturing of the repository or the surrounding
rock; and
</LI>
<LI>the migration of gas through the disturbed zone around the repository and
through the geosphere where issues to be considered are the mechanisms for gas
migration and the associated potential for coupled gas-water flow, the gas
pathways through the fracture network and the time taken for the gas to return
to the biosphere.  (This information is needed to identify the period over which
gas enters the biosphere and to assess whether enhanced migration of
contaminated groundwater is likely to occur.)
</LI></UL>
<P>6.40 The requisite experiments concerned with gas entry pressures and gas
migration in the BVG can only be carried out in the RCF because horizontal
boreholes are required to intersect identified and characterised fractures and
to examine some of the issues relating to the transport of the buoyant gas
through the water-filled fracture network.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalandInduced"></A><B>Natural and Induced Changes to the
Geological Barrier</B></P>
<P>6.41 It is recognised that the site characterisation programme carried out
by Nirex yields information on the present day geology and hydrogeology.  The
current regulatory requirements for a repository apply at any time in the
future.  Consideration must therefore be given to future changes to the
geosphere barrier as a result both of natural processes, including tectonic and
climatic processes, and of repository construction itself.  The information
required from the RCF again falls into the two categories determined by the
decision point against which it is generated.</P>
<P>6.42 In order to inform a decision whether to propose development of a
repository, information is required on the type and extent of natural changes
that could occur at the site to confirm that these will not significantly impair
the performance of the geosphere barrier in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport.  Similar information is required on the disturbance to
the rock that will be caused by excavating the repository itself, which is
termed 'excavation disturbance'.</P>
<P>6.43 In order to inform a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether
to approve the start of disposal operations, information is needed from testing
underground of the chemical disturbance in rocks surrounding the repository
caused by contact with alkaline pore water from the cement-based backfill. 
Every effort will have been made to assess the extent and nature of this change
to the rocks surrounding the repository in a conservative manner, using
information obtained from laboratory and field experiments and from
desk-studies.  However, the complex and site-specific nature of the interaction
requires validation to be obtained that its treatment in assessment studies is
appropriate and does not lead to underestimates of the transport of
radionuclides.</P>
<P> Natural Changes</P>
<P>6.44 Dr. Chaplow presents evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para7.6">paragraphs 7.6</A> to 7.26) that the
system of flowing fractures in the BVG has remained stable for a long period of
time.  In particular, no evidence has been obtained for the creation of new flow
paths at depth as a result of any seismic activity during the last several
million years and the groundwater system at depth shows evidence that there have
been no extensive changes as a result of climate-related events such as
glaciation for over a million years.  However, the RCF will be needed to
validate this evidence by means of direct observations of associations of
groundwater flows, mineral formation and geological structures at depth. 
Detailed examination of the fractures that are components of the main flow
channels should allow the geological history of flow patterns to be established,
particularly by dating the mineralisation that has occurred in association with
flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then be compared with the present
day flow patterns to test whether significant changes have occurred in the past
and may therefore occur in the future.  On the basis of information obtained
from borehole testing, this does not appear to be the case, but such a
conclusion would only be reliable when greater confidence is obtained in the
descriptions of the networks of connected fractures themselves through
observations and measurements in the RCF.</P>
<P> Excavation Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.45"></A>6.45 The information that can only be obtained from
carrying out work underground in the RCF relates to the disturbance of the
geology and hydrogeology that will result from excavation itself.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.46"></A>6.46 Creating an excavation in rock at depth by any
method removes material which was previously bearing some of the load of the
adjacent and overlying rocks.  Removal of this material therefore causes a
redistribution of the stresses around the excavation.  This redistribution may
be accompanied by some physical movement of the rocks around the excavation,
including movements on existing fractures and the creation of new fractures. 
This phenomenon is termed excavation disturbance.   The excavation disturbance
is confined to a volume, or zone, of rock which surrounds the excavation.  This
disturbed zone of rock surrounding shafts and drifts might provide additional
paths for transport in groundwater of radionuclides from the repository.  The
issues are the hydraulic conductivity of the excavation disturbed zone and how
far the zone extends from the excavation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.47"></A>6.47 Currently, views as to the extent and nature of
the excavation disturbed zone are based on past precedent of excavation projects
at other sites and a knowledge of the in situ stresses and rock quality measured
in Boreholes.  On this basis, it is assumed that the hydraulic conductivity of
the rock surrounding an excavation may increase by a factor of up to a hundred
over a distance equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation.  This is
believed to be a conservative description of the hydraulic characteristics and
extent of the excavation disturbed zone.  Scoping studies have shown that
disturbance on this scale is unlikely to impair the performance of the
repository and the effects of disturbance have not been included in assessment
models on this basis.  The information which is needed from the RCF is
measurement of the hydraulic and mechanical characteristics of the excavation
disturbed zone in the sandstones, Brockram and BVG to test the validity of this
assumption.</P>
<P>6.48 It is found that the potentially important effects of excavation
disturbance on groundwater flow characteristics are specific to the geological
and hydrogeological setting and to the nature of the excavation itself.  They
are likely to vary as a function of depth and location because of the different
mechanical loadings that will exist through the rock mass in three dimensions. 
Furthermore the effects, particularly in the long-term, are dependent upon a
number of interacting processes.</P>
<P>6.49 The benefit of the RCF is that it will allow direct measurement and
monitoring of excavation disturbance in the sandstones, Brockram and the
potential repository host rock.  In particular the important geological and
hydrogeological properties of the rock surrounding the excavation can be
determined before and after the excavation has been carried out and can be
observed as a function of time in the post-excavation period.  The monitoring is
particularly important to build confidence in our understanding of the evolution
of the excavation disturbed zone over time.  To enable extrapolation over
timescales of interest, the trends in further development of the disturbance
will be determined.  The response of the disturbed rock to mechanical loading
such as borehole testing will be particularly helpful in this respect.</P>
<P>6.50 The disturbance caused by the excavation will provide a significant
test of the understanding of changes that might result from natural processes. 
The stress redistribution that will occur during shaft sinking will be a useful
analogue for natural events such as glaciation that might place a cycle of
mechanical loading on the rock mass.  The response of the groundwater flow
system can be monitored to test the effects on the hydrogeological system of
such an event.
</P>
<P> Chemical Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.51"></A>6.51 A chemical disturbance will be produced in a
volume of rock, or  zone, around the repository by the alkaline fluid emanating
from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  This chemical disturbance has the
potential to modify the surfaces of fractures in the rock.
</P>
<P>6.52 Information on this subject is currently obtained by conducting
laboratory experiments on rock samples from Sellafield, by constructing
mathematical models that couple groundwater flow and chemical reaction and by
building confidence in the results of this work from comparison with
observations on naturally occurring alkaline groundwater systems.</P>
<P>6.53 The essential role of the RCF is to provide the opportunity for
calibration and validation of the mathematical models developed from the current
programme  to give the information required on the key issues listed.  The RCF
allows the detailed characterisation of identified flowing fractures to
determine their structure and mineralogy, the variability of these properties
and the precise compositions of groundwater in contact with the flow-wetted
surfaces in the fractures.  Once the fractures were characterised in this way,
their accessibility in the RCF would allow the conduct of well-controlled
validation experiments.  The principal reactions involved are believed to be
relatively slow and the experiments would build confidence in the trends of
changes to the rock properties rather than determining the long-term
characteristics of the disturbed zone by direct measurement.</P>
<P><A NAME="DesignandConstruction"></A><B>Design and Construction of the
Repository</B></P>
<P>6.54 The information required from the RCF on design and construction of the
repository can again be placed in two categories determined by the decision
point against which it is generated.  In this area in particular, the
information acquired for the decision to propose development of a repository
will be refined for subsequent development of a finalised safety assessment.</P>
<P>6.55 In order to take a decision to propose development of a repository, the
repository design must be developed sufficiently to provide a basis for the
optimisation of repository depth. location, layout and orientation.  This would
allow decisions to be taken on these parameters, albeit allowing for
finalisation of details in light of further investigations underground,
including those associated with repository construction.</P>
<P>6.56 There is little doubt that a repository could be constructed and
operated safely: the key issue is whether it will provide the long-term
isolation and containment of radionuclides in radioactive wastes once it is
closed.  A sound basis for assessment of the post-closure performance requires
that key aspects of the design related to transport of radionuclides can be
defined.  This responds to the requirement most recently restated in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208] that best practicable
means should be adopted to limit risk.  For a deep geological repository this is
taken to mean that, where there are options concerning the depth, location,
layout and orientation of the disposal vaults within the host rock, the
decisions taken must be justified.</P>
<P>6.57 It will be important to work within a framework, which has been
discussed with the regulatory authorities, that establishes the basis for making
these decisions and does not foreclose options by inappropriate developments.</P>
<P>6.58 The RCF is particularly valuable in allowing us to proceed in a
step-wise fashion of investigation in the potential host rock to finalise the
repository design.  Dr. Chaplow describes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para8.13">paragraphs 8.13</A> to 8.16) a
three-dimensional representational model of the PRZ rock mass that is currently
under development.  This will provide the framework of testing our understanding
by each successive step of excavation and associated investigations represented
by the phases of the RCF programme.  Each step in developing the RCF and
investigating the surrounding rock mass will be designed to create the minimum
site disturbance required to gain the required justification for fixing an
aspect of design through testing the rock mass model against the resulting
observations.  Thus any exploration by development of galleries in a horizontal
direction out from the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound
justification for the depth at which this will occur from confirmation of the
modelled rock characteristics.  Further extensions of investigations away from
the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound justification for the
eventual location and orientation of a repository.  Care will also be taken that
the nature of the investigations to fix these aspects of repository design would
not compromise our ability to fine tune these aspects at the final stages of
development of a repository itself.</P>
<P>6.59 Before seeking the approval of the regulatory authorities for the start
of disposal operations, information must be obtained, for use in a finalised
safety assessment, with respect to the methods of placing engineered seals,
developed in laboratory facilities, in the required settings.</P>
<P> Repository Depth, Location, Layout and Orientation</P>
<P>6.60 Currently judgments concerning repository design are based upon
interpretations of the rock mass and hydrogeology of the PRZ from information
obtained from the programme of site characterisation.  These interpretations do
not yet enable us to take a firm view on the benefits to be obtained from
particular depths, locations, layouts or orientations of the repository vaults
within the PRZ.
</P>
<P>6.61 Repository design (in particular depth, location, layout and
orientation) would affect factors identified previously : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository;
</LI>
<LI>the calculated spreading time for radionuclide transport in the BVG; and
</LI>
<LI>the mechanical and hydraulic characteristics of the excavation disturbed
zone.</LI></UL>
<P> The information required is to develop an understanding of how these
factors will vary as a function of interactions of different processes at
different locations throughout the PRZ.  In particular information is required
that enables the extrapolation throughout the BVG rocks in the PRZ of the
distribution of networks of connected fractures.</P>
<P>6.62 It might be envisaged, for example, that the repository could be
located at a depth at which there were relatively few or even no networks of
connected fractures sufficiently long to act as groundwater flow channels from
the repository depth to the overlying sedimentary formations.  Alternatively,
the spacing and orientation of the networks of connected fractures might allow a
layout of the repository vaults that minimised or wholly avoided intersections
with them.</P>
<P>6.63 It is intended that the main RCF galleries will be created at the same
horizon as the repository vaults.  The RCF shafts are required to give access to
these galleries and their depth will be determined by consideration of the
following factors : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the sufficiency of information available on taking the shaft to a certain
depth through its intersections with an adequate number and type of geological
and hydrogeological features of interest; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence that, taking remaining uncertainties into account, a repository
could be developed at the selected horizon that would meet regulatory
requirements.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.64 The RCF shaft sinking provides for the validation of the prior
understanding and associated models which will be developed to underpin the
preliminary view on repository depth, currently put at 650 metres below Ordnance
Datum ('bOD').  Those models will predict the information that will become
available to test this view.  The shaft sinking phase will have programmed into
it a decision point at which the results to date will be evaluated to establish
whether the understanding and models are confirmed.  If so, the RCF galleries
will be developed at the depth previously identified.</P>
<P>6.65 That decision point will provide for an updating of the understanding
and modelling.  The updating could indicate that further information is required
to meet the scientific objectives of adequately validating the models or that a
greater depth is appropriate for the optimisation of the repository.  If so, the
RCF shafts will be developed to the necessary depths.  The maximum depth
currently under consideration for the repository is 900 metres bOD and the
shafts of the RCF would have to be sunk to a depth of 935 metres bOD (to provide
for a sump) if this were found to be the optimised depth of the repository.  The
shafts might also be sunk to investigate depths of up to 900 metres bOD to
provide sufficient information for model validation and a decision on repository
(and hence gallery) horizon which could be at a lesser depth.</P>
<P>6.66 Given the intention to minimise the disturbance of the rock in making
these investigations, it will not be practicable to carry out detailed
investigations from the RCF throughout the PRZ.  Instead, the investigations
must be sufficient, in terms of the representative sampling of the rock mass, to
give a firm understanding of the variability of key geological and
hydrogeological characteristics of the rock mass.  The understanding that is
sought of the variations within the rock mass is to enable the variable
characteristics to be predicted throughout the PRZ on the basis of other
measurements from boreholes and various surveys.  This will allow the required
extrapolation across the rock mass to inform  decisions on repository depth,
location, layout and orientation.
</P>
<P>6.67 An essential role of the RCF in providing this information is to allow
the testing of our ability to carry out the required extrapolation.  This would
involve making predictions of the expected geological and hydrogeological
characteristics on the basis both of previous investigations from the surface
and of targeted drilling underground and then carrying out excavations to test
these predictions.  The finalised location of the repository vaults in the rock
mass would be determined by interpreting the results of targeted drilling from
the RCF.  It is essential to gain confidence from such work in the RCF that, in
any subsequent excavation of a repository, the information from prior
investigations could be utilised successfully to confirm the important
properties of the blocks of rock selected.
</P>
<P> Sealing</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.68"></A>6.68 The sealing requirements for the repository
will be established in an iterative manner by assessment studies.  This process
allows the long-term performance requirement to be established for seals placed
in various features of the repository system.  This in turn translates to the
required properties such as fluidity, durability or hydraulic conductivity (in
set condition) at the time of placing seals.  The achievement of the required
properties relates strongly to the interaction between the materials and the
precise geological setting specific to the site and location.  The features that
are currently considered are as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>flowing fractures intersecting repository vaults (which are assumed not to
be sealed in current models);
</LI>
<LI>large openings such as vaults, tunnels, drifts and shafts;
</LI>
<LI>disturbed zones surrounding excavated openings; and
</LI>
<LI>underground boreholes drilled from the proposed RCF itself.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.69 The requirement is that this work should be carried out in
representative geological settings, and in particular in the BVG at depth where
the levels of in situ stress and rock quality will be appropriate.  Furthermore
the requirement is to allow a long lead-time for the seals to set and to
establish an initial equilibrium in advance of using the results in support of a
performance assessment.  Therefore the validation that sealing requirements can
be met can only be achieved by carrying out work underground in the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="ImpactofRCF"></A><B>7. IMPACT OF THE RCF</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.1"></A>7.1 In taking the decision to apply to develop the
RCF, Nirex has given careful consideration to the potential of the RCF shafts in
particular to affect the post-closure performance of a repository subsequently
located within the PRZ because this is clearly a matter on which Nirex will have
to satisfy the regulators at the appropriate stage of an authorisation procedure
under RSA 93.  Two issues are of particular relevance to these considerations: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the location of the shafts relative to the eventual development of the
repository vaults and accesses; and
</LI>
<LI>the method of excavation and the associated disturbance of the surrounding
rock and hence of its hydrogeological properties.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para7.2"></A>7.2 For both these issues, the potential for effects
on post-closure performance only exists if sealing materials cannot be placed in
the openings and disturbances caused by the excavations to restrict groundwater
flow and to maintain this barrier over long timescales.  This is believed to be
achievable but, because of the site-specific nature of sealing requirements, it
is intended that suitable designs and specifications of seals will be
demonstrated at a later stage of the programme. In order to progress to that
stage, information will be used from a number of sources, including work that is
currently under way in the Nirex Science Programme, relevant work previously
carried out in other international programmes, and work that is proposed to be
undertaken in the RCF.  In the absence of this information the shafts have been
evaluated in scoping studies as if sealed against the flow of groundwater to
only a very low standard, equivalent to a compacted aggregate material.  The
results of these studies have shown no detrimental effect on transport of
radionuclides and on this basis seals have to date not been included in
assessment models.</P>
<P><A NAME="ShaftLocation"></A><B>Location of the Shafts</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.3"></A>7.3 The key concern in respect of the location of the
shafts is the possibility that they would provide a preferential pathway for
groundwater flow that compromises the containment performance of the geosphere. 
Consideration has been given to various issues in this respect :</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">

<TD WIDTH="50">iv.</TD>
<TD>the potential for a U-tube groundwater flow system with the shafts
conducting water into the repository and this subsequently being discharged into
the inclined drift tunnels envisaged as the principal accesses to a repository
at Sellafield.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>7.4 Consideration of the hydrogeological conditions in the PRZ showed that
the consequences of realising ii. or iii. would not be significantly affected by
the choice of shaft locations.  A pragmatic design solution is available to
address iv. whereby there is sufficient flexibility in the routing of the
inclined drifts that these could be arranged to arrive at the repository in
close proximity to the shaft locations.</P>
<P>7.5 When the RCF was proposed in 1992, a good database was available for
conditions at depth in the vicinity of the cluster of the boreholes into the
PRZ, represented by Boreholes 2, 4 and 5.  This gave no indications of a major
flow channel that might connect with a shaft located at Longlands Farm and
therefore gave confidence that the possibility at i. above was unlikely.  The
drilling of several further boreholes in this location and the interpretation of
more detailed geophysical surveys, as reported by Dr Chaplow in his evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para4.6">paragraphs 4.6</A>), have confirmed this
prognosis.</P>
<P>7.6 The location of the shafts was determined to be in the north-eastern
quadrant of the PRZ because this was interpreted to be upstream in relation to
the overall direction of flow in that location, as reflected by the choice of
cross-section for groundwater flow modelling reported in <I>Nirex 95</I>
(Volume 3, Section 2.1.1, pages 2.2 to 2.3) [COR/522].  The location of the
shafts at Longlands Farm, within the north-eastern quadrant of the PRZ, would
allow sufficient horizontal distance between that location and the north-eastern
boundary of the PRZ, for the inclined drift access envisaged for a repository to
be brought around the shaft location to approach from upstream without going
outside the PRZ. </P>
<P><A NAME="ExcavationMethods"></A><B>Excavation Methods</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.7"></A>7.7 The main concern in respect of the excavation
methods chosen to develop the RCF is that these will disturb the rock in such a
way as to develop preferential pathways for groundwater flow. The effect of
excavation disturbance on groundwater flows is an important area of study
proposed for the RCF.  At this stage pragmatic assumptions have been made as to
the effects, whereby the hydraulic conductivity of the rock is increased by two
orders of magnitude to a distance into the rock surrounding the excavation
equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation. These are thought to be
conservative assumptions.  Moreover, as I noted in paragraph 6.47 of my
evidence, scoping studies have shown that disturbance on this scale would be
unlikely to impair the performance of the repository and the effects of
disturbance have not been included in assessment models on this basis.</P>
<P>7.8 There is a good body of evidence from previous practice concerning the
extent of excavation disturbance of rocks of different qualities as a function
of key variables such as the diameter of the excavation and the excavation
methods chosen on which to base these assumptions.  When the assumed extent of
the disturbance is combined with the chosen values for the increased hydraulic
conductivity of the BVG within this disturbed zone there is calculated to be no
significant effect on the movement of groundwater from depth to the surface. 
This analysis takes no benefit from any measures that might be taken to reduce
excavation disturbance effects or to seal the disturbed zone subsequently.</P>
<P>7.9 It was originally envisaged that the shaft excavation would require the
freezing of some part or all of the sandstone formations overlying the BVG. 
This would have required the introduction of a large number of drill holes
around the shaft and possible disruption of the rock by freeze-thaw cycling. 
The replacement of this method by one where groundwater control is achieved by
the preferred method of grouting would introduce a major reduction in the
mechanical disturbance that would be caused, albeit that no significant impact
upon groundwater flow was calculated to result.</P>

<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P> <B>Repository Performance at Sellafield</B></P>
<P>2.1 A preliminary assessment, based on results so far, of the post-closure
performance of a repository located in the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at
Sellafield confirms the good promise of the Sellafield site as a potentially
suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater pathway is central to our
considerations of repository safety and requires to be well understood.  If
resolution of identified uncertainties confirms our current understanding of the
groundwater system at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks ('BVG') of the PRZ which would meet
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.2 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield would
result in the physical and chemical containment in the repository of all but a
small fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just
three radionuclides: chlorine&#173;36, iodine-129 and uranium-238 are calculated
to be released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the
peak risk either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>2.3 The assessment presented in my evidence emphasises the understanding
that has been developed of the contribution of the various barriers in the
repository system to the containment of radioactivity in a repository located in
the PRZ at Sellafield.  The evidence identifies the contribution to containment
performance by the engineered and geological barriers.</P>
<P>2.4 Physical containment is afforded in particular by the waste containers
which prevent ready access of groundwater to the wastes.  The results obtained
so far on the corrosion of steels under the conditions that would apply in a
repository at Sellafield show that the rates of corrosion would be expected to
be low and that the steel containers would remain sufficiently intact to result
in containment within the repository of short-lived radionuclides accounting for
the major part (about 99%) of radioactivity in the repository inventory.</P>
<P>2.5 In order to establish and maintain appropriate chemical conditions in a
repository, the space in the vaults around the waste containers will be
backfilled with a cement-based grout developed for the purpose, and known as
Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  On the basis of results obtained so far of test
work and modelling on the performance of this grout, concerning the suppression
of the solubilities of radionuclides in groundwater and sorption of dissolved
radionuclides onto cement surfaces, the chemical conditions established in a
repository at Sellafield would result in the containment in the repository of
most of the long-lived radionuclides in the disposal inventory.  Over 99% of the
residual 1% of long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which
chemical containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH,
is maintained.</P>
<P>2.6 My evidence identifies three important radionuclides that because of
their chemical properties or very long radioactive decay half-lives are not
physically or chemically contained in the repository until they have decayed to
insignificant levels.  These are chlorine-36 and iodine-129, which are
considered to be highly soluble and not subject to a high degree of sorption in
the near field of the repository, and uranium-238 which has a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years.</P>
<P>2.7 Groundwater flow models predict that the path taken by groundwater
leaving the potential repository location leads to a discharge predominantly
into the sediments currently off the coast below the Irish Sea.  In this event
the additional considerable dilution afforded by the sea leads to assessed risks
to an individual at least three orders of magnitude below the target of 10<SUP>-6
</SUP>per year.  However, the extended timescales of thousands of years before
the groundwater returns to the surface may be sufficient for a change in climate
to cause the sea level to drop and the discharge to be to a terrestrial
environment.</P>
<P>2.8 The concentrations in which the radionuclides chlorine-36 and iodine-129
may reach the surface environment are determined by the flow of groundwater
through the repository near field and by the extent of  subsequent dilution of
this volume of water by groundwater in the surrounding host rock and overlying
sedimentary formations.  It is shown that on the basis of results obtained so
far the combination of low groundwater flow in the BVG at Sellafield and the
dilution and dispersion afforded by the flow of groundwater in the overlying
sedimentary formations is likely to give rise to concentrations of these
radionuclides in the surface terrestrial environment consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.9 In the case of uranium-238 the peak in risk from this radionuclide is
considered to occur more than a million years after repository closure and to
result from a daughter radionuclide, radium-226, produced by its radioactive
decay.  On the basis of the results obtained so far, both on the groundwater
system and on the containment afforded to uranium-238 by the engineered barriers
of the repository, the performance of the repository system is likely to give
rise to concentrations of radium-226 in the surface environment consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements. </P>
<P>2.10 On the basis of these results my evidence identifies the key
uncertainties which remain and which need to be addressed to inform two key
decision points in the development of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.11 It is shown that the Rock Characterisation Facility ('RCF') is needed
to provide information to address uncertainties in three main areas:</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P><B> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport</B></P>
<P>2.12 The flow of groundwater into the near field of the repository is highly
dependent upon the description of the networks of connected fractures in the
BVG.  My evidence describes how the integrated activities of observation,
monitoring and testing over extended length scales and in three dimensions only
afforded in the RCF are needed to build sufficient confidence in the calculation
of the flow rate to meet regulatory requirements with respect to post-closure
safety.</P>
<P>2.13 The calculated dilution of the radionuclides transported away from the
repository in groundwater is dependent upon the properties of the flow channels
in key geological formations.  My evidence describes how these flow channels can
be identified and characterised by the integrated activities over extended
length scales and in three dimensions only afforded in the RCF.</P>
<P>2.14 Further key uncertainties are identified in relation to groundwater
flow and radionuclide transport, namely:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the nature and extent of rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> My evidence identifies the unique attributes of the RCF for addressing
these matters.</P>
<P><B> Natural and Induced Changes</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 The key uncertainties that need to be addressed in respect of natural
and induced changes to the geological barrier are identified as :</P>
<UL>
<LI>validation of the stability of the hydrogeological system over extended
timescales;
</LI>
<LI>the effect of excavation disturbance; and
</LI>
<LI>the effect of chemical disturbance (by alkaline near-field groundwater).
</LI></UL>
<P>2.16 Detailed examination in the RCF of the fractures that are components of
the networks of connected fractures should allow the geological history of flow
patterns to be established, particularly by dating the mineralisation that has
occurred in association with flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then
be compared with the present day flow patterns to test whether significant
changes have occurred in the past and may therefore occur in the future.</P>
<P>2.17 The RCF is needed, in advance of the decision whether or not to propose
development of a repository, to validate that the site characteristics are such
that excavation disturbance would not significantly impair the containment
performance of the natural geological barrier.  Excavation of the RCF itself is
the only means by which a measurable disturbance can be created to allow
extrapolation in time and space of the consequences in the post-closure period
of a repository.</P>
<P>2.18 The access to specific features in the rock in the RCF allows testing
of the effects of alkaline near-field groundwater (derived from the cements in
the repository) on groundwater flow and radionuclide transport in the
surrounding host rock.</P>
<P><B> Design and Construction of the Repository</B></P>
<P>2.19 The way in which the RCF permits identification of geological and
hydrogeological features that must be taken into account in refining the
repository design in terms of depth, location, layout and orientation of vaults
within the PRZ is described.</P>
<P>2.20 It is also described how the confidence that various underground
features can be sealed adequately to satisfy regulatory requirements on
post-closure safety is only obtainable by access to representative features and
excavations in the rock mass as afforded by the RCF.
</P>
<P><B> Impact of the RCF</B></P>
<P>2.21 Finally, my evidence notes that the performance of the geosphere
barrier is unlikely to be impaired by the impact of the RCF and that this issue
will require to be considered as an element of any application to the regulatory
authorities for authorisation under RSA93.</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE</B></P>
<P>3.1 The purpose of my evidence is :</P>
<UL>
<LI>to describe the Nirex approach to post-closure performance assessment
(Section 4); 
</LI>
<LI>to present a preliminary analysis of post-closure performance of a
repository at Sellafield (Section 5);
</LI>
<LI>to describe the essential information required from the Rock
Characterisation Facility ('RCF') to resolve remaining uncertainties  in respect
of that performance (Section 6); and
</LI>
<LI>to describe the impact that the RCF may have upon the containment
performance of the geosphere (Section 7).
</LI></UL>
<P>3.2 In Section 5, I describe the current understanding of the performance of
a repository located at Sellafield.  The role of the geosphere, both in ensuring
the successful long-term containment properties of the engineered system and in
diluting residual radionuclides dissolved in groundwater emerging from the
engineered system, is described.</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence in Section 5 reflects the results obtained up to early 1994
on the geology and hydrogeology of the Sellafield site that are important to the
movement of groundwater which could contain radionuclides released from the
repository.  The possible implications for repository performance of the results
that have been obtained since early 1994, as presented in Dr. Chaplow's evidence
(<B>PE/NRX/14</B>, <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">Section 6</A>),
are also considered in Section 5.  This evidence shows why Nirex considers the
Sellafield site as offering good promise as a potentially suitable location for
a repository and, therefore, why it is justified to secure further information
on the site through investigations in the RCF.</P>
<P>3.4 My evidence shows that although the good promise of the site can be
established, there remain key uncertainties which require to be addressed in the
RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether or not to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield.</P>
<P>3.5 The evidence in Section 6 specifies the further information required to
address these key uncertainties which can only be acquired from the RCF.  Dr.
Mellor's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/16</B>, <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE1">Sections
4</A> and <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE2">5</A>) describes how the RCF
needs to be developed and operated to deliver this information.</P>
<P>3.6 My evidence in Section 7 considers the potential for the excavation of
the RCF, and of its shafts in particular, to impact upon the performance of a
repository subsequently located within the Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks
('BVG') of the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at Sellafield.  It shows that
there is a sound basis for the proposed location of the shafts and excavation
methods.</P>
<P><A NAME="Approach"></A><B>4. APPROACH TO POST-CLOSURE PERFORMANCE
ASSESSMENT</B></P>
<P>4.1 This Section describes the approach under development by Nirex to assess
the post-closure performance of a deep geological repository at Sellafield.  The
term 'post-closure' refers to the period from the end of repository operations
when, all the repository vaults having been filled with packaged wastes, the
accesses to the repository are backfilled and sealed.  'Assessment' is the
identification and modelling of the processes and pathways by which
radionuclides from the repository may subsequently return to the biosphere and
to people.</P>
<P>4.2 Performance assessment makes extensive use of models.  Development of
assessment models has been built around three major pathways for the possible
return of radionuclides to the biosphere and to people :</P>
<UL>
<LI>transport of radionuclides in groundwater;
</LI>
<LI>migration of radionuclides in gases; and
</LI>
<LI>return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of natural
disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.
</LI></UL>
<P> For a repository at Sellafield the most important pathway, in radiological
terms, is the groundwater pathway.  This is because each of the various
radionuclides in the wastes might be transported in groundwater whereas only a
small number could be transported as a gas.  Also the transport of radionuclides
by the groundwater pathway generally provides the framework for considering the
effect of natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion, except in
the low probability scenarios of direct return of the contents of the repository
by such means.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterPathway"></A><B> Groundwater Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 When the repository is first closed, it will
contain air (for example in the pores of the cements used to immobilise the
wastes, and in any unfilled spaces within the repository) which will, in time,
be displaced by inflowing groundwater.  Thereafter, subject to the performance
of the engineered barriers of the repository, radionuclides will eventually
dissolve or disperse in the water and be available to move into the surrounding
rock.  The extent to which the radionuclides come into contact with water, the
extent to which they dissolve and their ability to move with the groundwater
will each be controlled by the physical and chemical conditions in the
engineered barriers of the repository.</P>
<P>4.4 The engineered barriers are designed to contain as much of the
radioactivity as is reasonably practicable.  This is achieved by providing
physical containment barriers to movement of radionuclides, which are expected
to operate for at least one thousand years after repository closure in respect
of waste packages containing most of the radioactivity, and chemical
containment, operating over a period of around one million years, which will
limit the solubilities, and provide sorption, of radionuclides in groundwater
moving through the repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.5"></A>4.5 The levels of the radiological effects of any
radionuclides that are not contained by the engineered barriers and which reach
the surface in groundwater will be determined largely by the concentrations of
the radionuclides in solution.  The limitation of radionuclide solubilities and
the slow release of groundwater from the repository are of great importance
because they determine the extent to which further reductions in concentrations
must occur, through processes of retardation, spreading and dilution in the
geosphere, for the repository system to be acceptably safe.</P>
<P>4.6 Once the radionuclides in the groundwater have passed from the
repository into the successive layers of surrounding rocks, their rates of
transport to the surface will be determined by the path taken by groundwater
flow through the rocks, the time taken for water to travel along this path, and
by various physical and chemical processes that lead to retardation and
spreading.  The groundwater from the repository will mix with groundwater in the
surrounding rocks leading to dilution of the dissolved levels of radionuclides. 
The extent of dilution will not be determined solely by the amount of
groundwater flowing through the overlying rocks, relative to that flowing
through the repository.  The spreading in space and time of the transport of
repository-derived radionuclides in groundwater through each rock layer will
increase the dilution afforded by their mixing with larger volumes of water in
the succeeding rock layer.</P>
<P>4.7 Eventually groundwater containing repository-derived radionuclides will
reach shallow regions of the rock, which may be considered to be at the boundary
with the biosphere.  On crossing this boundary and entering the biosphere
further dilution, retardation or dispersion can occur by mixing with surface
water (streams, lakes and the sea) or soils.  Radionuclides could become
available for uptake by people by their entering the food-chain, by their
consumption in drinking water or by their inhalation in dust particles.</P>
<P>4.8 The concentrations of radionuclides, both in the groundwater pathway at
its various stages of returning radionuclides to the surface and in the
components of the biosphere, can be calculated on the basis of an understanding
of the controlling physical, chemical and biological processes.  The need is to
calculate the potential uptake of radionuclides by people, living now or in the
future, as a function of time.  From a knowledge of the uptake of radionuclides
through the various potential routes available, a total radiological annual
'dose' to hypothetical individuals can be calculated. This is subsequently
converted to 'annual individual risk' using a dose to risk conversion factor of
0.06 per Sievert.
</P>
<P>4.9 The times of the emergence of radionuclides in the biosphere and their
concentrations will vary according to the controlling physical and chemical
processes relevant to each radionuclide.  The maximum concentrations of
individual radionuclides returning to the biosphere will not coincide in time
unless they have very similar physical and chemical properties.  The total risk
and the contributions of individual radionuclides are typically presented in
graphs of annual radiological risk to an individual through time.  The peak
values shown on these graphs may be compared with the radiological risk target
announced by the Government in its
<I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, Final Conclusions, Cm 2919,
July 1995</I> (<I>&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)
</I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208].  At the current stage of the project,
calculations of risk are viewed as the best means of informing a judgment about
the safety of a facility, in line with the statement in <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I>.  However, it is recognised that in the future other technical
factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature, will also need to be
considered in arriving at the decision.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentModels"></A><B>Assessment Models</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.10"></A>4.10 The top-level tool used by Nirex for
calculating radiological risk from the groundwater pathway is the computer
program called MASCOT and its associated output processor MOP.  MASCOT has been
developed to carry out probabilistic safety assessments, in line with practice
in other countries, for evaluating the safety of radioactive waste disposal
systems.  It takes proper account of the uncertainties associated with the
values of important parameters which influence system performance.  It employs
the 'Monte Carlo' method in which repeated calculations of system behaviour are
made using random sampling from specified probability density functions of the
model parameters which are subject to uncertainty.  The results provide
estimates of the mean and distribution of calculated doses and associated risks.</P>
<P>4.11 MASCOT comprises sub-models describing the behaviour of the sub-systems
of the overall repository system.  These are designed to model the various
processes involved in release of radionuclides from waste packages, their
mobilisation and migration from repository vaults, transport through the
geosphere and biosphere and consequent doses and risks to individuals.  Input
information for sub-models is derived from a variety of sources, including the
output from more detailed models of the system, as described below.</P>
<P> Source Term Model</P>
<P>4.12 The &quot;source term&quot; model describes the behaviour of
radionuclides in the repository vaults and calculates the rate of  their release
as solutes in flowing groundwater. Sub-models are used to represent different
sections of the repository with different characteristics.  The key processes
considered are physical containment by the waste package, radioactive decay and
ingrowth of decay products, solubility limitation, and sorption onto the vault
backfill.  The source term model is supported by a number of research models,
such as RARECAN, CRACK 2, CHEQMATE and HARPHRQ, which address the key physical
and chemical processes in more detail.  The MASCOT source term  model calculates
the concentration of radionuclides in solution in the near-field groundwater as
a function of time.  (The near field of the repository is the part of the system
comprising the waste packages, the backfill surrounding the packages and the
seals used to close off the vaults.  The near-field groundwater is the water
within the porous structure of the backfill.)  The near-field groundwater is
available for transport into the geosphere at a rate dependent on the
groundwater flow through the repository.  (This is usually measured as the
volume in m<SUP>3</SUP> per year of groundwater flowing through the repository
volume.)</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport Through the Geosphere
</P>
<P>4.13 The geosphere sub-models describe the behaviour of radionuclides as
they are transported in groundwater flowing through the geosphere.  The primary
groundwater flow system through fractured rock, such as the BVG, comprises a
network of connected fractures which can be represented on a number of scales.
On the regional  scale - tens of square kilometres - effective properties of the
BVG and surrounding rocks are modelled using a continuum approximation to the
flow system utilising the program NAMMU.  At a repository local scale - of order
ten square kilometres - a more detailed fracture flow model, NAPSAC, is
employed.</P>
<P>4.14 Both NAMMU and NAPSAC permit multi-dimensional groundwater flow
calculations and are used to provide values of the flow of groundwater through
the repository, and of the groundwater flow path lengths and transit times
across each of the hydrogeological units in the flow path.  The groundwater flow
through the repository is measured in cubic metres per year through the full
volume of the engineered repository openings of approximately one million cubic
metres.  It must be assessed reliably because it is an important input to the
source term sub-model in MASCOT.  In addition, geosphere flow-path lengths and
water transit times are required for the geosphere transport sub-models in
MASCOT.</P>
<P>4.15 The transport sub-models within MASCOT calculate radionuclide transport
through different parts of the geosphere taking account of radionuclide decay
and ingrowth, advection, diffusion, hydrodynamic dispersion, and retardation by
sorption.  In addition, radionuclide transport can be retarded by diffusing into
the pore space in the rock matrix.</P>
<P> Biosphere</P>
<P>4.16 The biosphere sub-models of MASCOT are essentially a series of
flux-to-dose rate conversion factors which enable the geosphere calculations of
time-dependent radionuclide fluxes into the biosphere to be converted into doses
and risks to individuals.  For most radionuclides a compartment model, BIOS,
developed by the National Radiological Protection Board, is used to simulate the
processes contributing to radionuclide transport and accumulation in terrestrial
and marine environments.  However, for some key radionuclides  (chlorine-36,
iodine-129 and uranium-238 and its daughters) a heterogeneous resource area
model has been developed to permit a more detailed representation of the
behaviour of the radionuclides in the biosphere.  The development of this model
has been guided by a more physically realistic catchment model generated by the
computer code SHETRAN-UK which has been developed by Nirex, in conjunction with
the Water Resources Systems Research Unit at the University of Newcastle.  An
integral part of the biosphere modelling is definition of critical groups. 
These are defined as being representative of those members of the assumed future
communities that incur the largest annual Effective Dose from radionuclides
present in the environment.  The calculations of Effective Dose make use of
models developed through the International Commission on Radiological Protection
so that potential health risks to individuals can be calculated.  Given the
timescale over which releases are calculated to occur, significant changes in
the climate are projected to arise as a result of glacial cycling:  sea levels
and human behaviour are predicted to change accordingly.  Critical group
behaviour is defined on the basis of the behaviour of existing communities in
regions of the world which currently have analogous climate states.  Many
potential exposure routes are addressed, ranging from human consumption of
contaminated water through to complex food-chain pathways.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentCycels"></A><B> Assessment Cycles</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.17"></A>4.17 The key steps in assessment of the post-closure
performance of a repository will be repeated several times before a decision is
sought from the regulatory authorities to approve the start of disposal
operations in a repository, following its construction and commissioning.  This
iterative process is known as the 'assessment cycle' as described in <I>Nirex
Report 525, Scientific Update 1993, December 1993 </I>(sub-section 5.2, pages 30
to 31) [COR/505].
</P>
<P>4.18 One important function of an assessment is to calculate system
performance for comparison with regulatory requirements to judge whether or not
the system under assessment has the potential to meet them.  A major,
complementary output is a clearer understanding of the issues that are important
to system performance.  Identification of those issues helps to identify
priorities for further data acquisition, on waste or site characteristics for
example, for model development, and for refinement of repository design.</P>
<P>4.19 The presentation, in Section 5 of my evidence, of preliminary results
on the post-closure performance of a repository located in the PRZ at Sellafield
is intended to show our current understanding of the important issues.  This
understanding will develop and become more complete as assessment cycles are
conducted in the future.</P>
<P><A NAME="RepositoryPerformance"></A><B>5. REPOSITORY PERFORMANCE AT
SELLAFIELD</B></P>
<P>5.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the calculated
performance of the engineered and natural barriers to radionuclide transport
afforded by a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield.  The
natural barrier provided by the rocks surrounding the repository is of
particular importance as this must ensure that the required chemical conditions
can be maintained in the near field of the repository to contain most of the
radioactivity, and that any residual long-lived radionuclides that are not
contained in this way do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.
</P>
<P>5.2 My evidence identifies the key characteristics of the Sellafield site
which bear on assessment of the post-closure performance of the repository
system.  It is shown that the information and results from the Science Programme
so far suggest the Sellafield site holds good promise as a potentially suitable
location for a repository, but there are uncertainties which need to be
addressed before a decision is taken on whether to propose development of a
repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="DisposalInventory"></A><B>Disposal Inventory</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 The current planning basis for the repository is
that it will receive for disposal 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid, packaged
intermediate-level radioactive wastes and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid,
packaged low-level radioactive wastes up to the year 2060.  The radionuclide
content of this total volume of 400,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of wastes is referred to
as the &quot;disposal inventory&quot; and information on this content and the
content of associated materials that may affect repository performance is taken
from information compiled jointly by the Department of the Environment and Nirex
on radioactive waste arising in the UK (<I>DOE/RAS/92.010, UK Nirex Report No.
284, The United Kingdom Radioactive Waste Inventory, November 1992 (&quot;the
1991 National Inventory&quot;</I>) [COR/520].) (See also:<I> DOE/RAS/92.011, UK
Nirex Report No. 285, The Radionuclide Content of UK Radioactive Wastes,
November 1992; and DOE/RAS/92.012, UK Nirex Report No. 286, The Physical and
Chemical Characteristics of UK Radioactive Wastes, November 1992, </I>which are
referred to as sources of information.)</P>
<P>5.4 The disposal inventory may be sub-divided into two broad categories of
radionuclides according to their radioactive decay half-lives.  Much of the
disposal inventory is comprised of relatively short-lived 'fission products'
such as strontium-90 and caesium-137 or 'neutron activation products' such as 
nickel-63, having radioactive decay half-lives of around 100 years or less. 
(Fission products are the result of the nuclear fission of elements such as
uranium or plutonium, as used in the fuels of nuclear reactors.  Neutron
activation products result most commonly from the capture of neutrons by stable
atomic nuclei, to create unstable nuclei which subsequently undergo radioactive
decay). </P>
<P>5.5 The second category comprises radionuclides having radioactive decay
half-lives from hundreds to millions of years.  Many of these are heavy metal
elements such as plutonium, which are very insoluble in the alkaline and
chemically reducing ('low Eh') near-field conditions.  These long-lived
radionuclides include three having radioactive decay half-lives, of hundreds of
thousands of years or more, which prove to be of great importance to the
calculated performance of the deep repository.  These are chlorine-36 with a
half-life of 300,000 years; iodine-129 with a half-life of over 15 million
years; and uranium-238 with a half-life approaching 4,500 million years.  In
order to understand the results of risk calculations reported in this Proof of
Evidence, it is helpful to note that a 'daughter' radionuclide, radium-226,
produced by the decay of the uranium-238 'parent' is of much greater
radiological significance than the uranium-238 itself.</P>
<P> Key Radionuclides</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.6"></A>5.6 The more important radionuclides in terms of
their radioactivity content and relevance to the safety of disposal are listed
in order of atomic number and according to radioactive decay half-life in
<A HREF="#Table5.1">Table 5.1</A>.  The sources of the three radionuclides
found to be of greatest importance are outlined in rather more detail in the
following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.7 Chlorine-36 derives principally from neutron activation of naturally
occurring chlorine, which is present as a trace impurity in various materials in
nuclear reactors.   Accordingly it is likely to be present in small quantities
in many waste streams.  Seven waste streams have been identified as the main
sources of the radionuclide.  They contribute about 65% of the total 16.6 TBq of
chlorine-36 in the disposal inventory and have a volume of about 50,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.
 Because of the significance of this radionuclide in evaluations of repository
post-closure performance, it is considered important to take account of
uncertainties in the quantities present in the disposal inventory, as reported
in <I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table 6.3, page 6.25) [COR/522].  The value of
16.6 TBq is the central case determined for that exercise.</P>
<P>5.8 Iodine-129 derives from nuclear fission and it will be present in small
quantities in a wide range of wastes.  However, four waste streams contribute
about 50% of the projected total of 0.92 TBq, having a total volume of about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.9 Uranium-238 is a major constituent of reactor fuel and will be present
in small quantities in a wide range of wastes.  Seven waste streams contribute
about 55% of the total 36 TBq, having a total volume of about 37,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P> Packaging</P>
<P>5.10 Intermediate-level wastes intended for disposal will be immobilised
within packages to produce the 'wasteform'.  Most intermediate-level wastes will
be packaged as unshielded wasteforms.  Standard unshielded intermediate-level
waste containers are predominantly drums or boxes fabricated from stainless
steel, or in some cases carbon steel.  The 0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> capacity drum is
the most commonly used container and larger drums or boxes typically have a
capacity of 3 m<SUP>3</SUP>.  The waste is immobilised within the container,
typically using a cement-based grout to produce a solid wasteform.  The
principal waste packages for shielded intermediate-level wasteforms are concrete
boxes, having a length of approximately four metres, in which the waste is again
immobilised  in a cement-based grout.</P>
<P>5.11 Low-level wastes make a very small contribution to the radioactivity
content in the disposal inventory (less than one part in 10,000).  Typically
they will be packaged into carbon steel boxes, having a length of approximately
four metres.  It is currently envisaged that the waste will not be immobilised
within the container.</P>
<P><A NAME="PhysicalContainment"></A><B>Physical Containment</B></P>
<P>5.12 Physical containment features include the initial prevention of access
of groundwater to the radionuclides in the wastes and subsequent limitation of
the movement of groundwater containing dissolved radionuclides away from them. 
The principal factor contributing to physical containment is the integrity of
the waste containers.  Other contributions are obtained from the inaccessibility
of radionuclides in the wastes themselves, for example where their release
requires the complete corrosion of large steel components, and from the
limitation of movement of dissolved radionuclides by diffusion through the
immobilising grout inside the containers.
</P>
<P>5.13 More than 99% of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory will be
present in the unshielded wasteforms contained in drums or boxes made of
stainless or carbon steel.  The resistance of these steel containers to
corrosion under repository conditions is therefore important to the physical
containment of radionuclides.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.14"></A>5.14 The general corrosion of steels is reduced by
the presence of an alkaline water chemistry.  This is an important benefit of
surrounding the waste containers by Nirex Reference Vault Backfill which is
designed to maintain water in its pores at a high pH (where high pH is an
alkaline condition, low pH an acid condition). Corrosion is also very slow under
the anaerobic conditions that will prevail in the repository after the initial
volume of air has been displaced by inflowing groundwater and any residual
oxygen in the water has been consumed by aerobic corrosion.</P>
<P>5.15 Under anaerobic conditions, steels are subject to corrosion which
affects the entire surface of the metal, rather than at localised points. 
Typical results obtained from long-term research work carried out under
deliberately extreme conditions of temperature (up to the maximum of 80C that
might be reached for a short period of time in the repository) and
representative conditions of water chemistry in the engineered barrier system of
a repository at Sellafield show that the corrosion rate will be less than one
micron per year.  Using these and other data obtained from the research
programme the average time for a metal container to be corroded through has been
calculated to range from 9,000 to 16,000 years for the case of a stainless steel
0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> drum, as reported in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/011, Nirex
Safety Assessment Research Programme, Nirex Near-Field Research: Report on
Current Status in 1994, July 1995 </I>(Sub-section &quot;Container Lifetime
Assessment&quot;, page 16)<I> </I>[NRX/15/1].</P>
<P>5.16 Research has been carried out to determine the effects on physical
containment of the engineered gas vent in some designs of waste container and of
localised corrosion which can affect carbon steels under the initially aerobic
conditions in the repository.  In these cases, there is no significant loss of
containment even if saturation by water were established through the resulting
small penetrations of the container.  The release of radionuclides from the
wasteform to the backfill outside the container is limited by the low rates of
diffusion through the immobilising grout surrounding the waste.</P>
<P>5.17 The decay of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory is shown as a
function of time in <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.  This shows that more
than 95% of the radioactivity would be decayed after 300 years.  It also shows
that if physical containment is conservatively assumed to operate for one
thousand years, the major part of the radioactivity (about 99%) would decay
while contained within the physical barriers afforded by a repository under the
conditions found at Sellafield.  The major contribution to this containment is
the corrosion resistance of the steel containers in the water chemistry of
Sellafield groundwater conditioned to high pH in the pores of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill.</P>
<P> <A NAME="ChemicalContainment"></A><B>Chemical Containment</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.18"></A>5.18 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill surrounding
the emplaced waste containers in the disposal vaults has been carefully
specified to fulfil a number of requirements, namely :</P>
<UL>
<LI>long term maintenance of alkaline porewater chemistry in order to maintain
low dissolved concentrations of key radionuclides under the prevailing
conditions of groundwater flow and geochemistry;
</LI>
<LI>long-term maintenance of a high active-surface-area for sorption of key
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>relatively high permeability and porosity both to ensure homogeneous
performance (so that localised concentrations of materials in wastes do not
exhaust the desired chemical conditioning and thereby locally reduce the
containment performance) and to permit the escape of gas generated by chemical
reactions in the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.19 Two important effects to be taken into account in assessing the
performance at Sellafield of the chemical barrier provided by the backfill are :</P>
<UL>
<LI>leaching of reactive components by groundwater flow; and
</LI>
<LI>reactions with groundwater constituents
</LI></UL>
<P>These are each discussed in the following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.20 Under the chemically reducing ('low Eh') conditions of the repository,
the solubilities in water of several important radioelements such as plutonium
can be reduced to extremely low values (10<SUP>-7</SUP> mols m <SUP>-3</SUP>
in the case of plutonium) at pH values of between 9 and 10. The solubilities
typically remain at these low levels at any higher pH values that may be
realised in the repository.  Accordingly, the chemical conditioning performance
sought from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill in respect of reduction of
solubility is to maintain a pH above 10 for the period of time during which the
relevant radionuclides will decay to insignificant levels.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.21"></A>5.21 The maintenance of the porewater of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill at a pH value above 10 is achieved by the dissolving
into the groundwater of calcium hydroxide which is present in the cement and
lime constituents of the backfill.  The required pH will be maintained until
this supply of calcium hydroxide has been exhausted.   For a given length of
flow path through a repository vault, containing a given amount of backfill, the
rate of removal of calcium hydroxide is determined by the groundwater flow.  For
the proposed volume of about 80,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of backfill in a typical
repository vault having dimensions 550 metres long, 23.5 metres wide and a waste
stack height of 12 metres, and for a groundwater flow through the repository of
140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year    - as calculated in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3,
Sub-Section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522] from the hydrogeological data for the
Sellafield site - simple calculation shows that the pH would be maintained at a
value of greater than 10 for many millions of years.</P>
<P>5.22 It is important to understand whether the pH could be reduced more
rapidly than implied by this simple calculation.  This could occur in parts of
the repository by concentration of groundwater flows through localised
conductive features in the rock, leaving other parts of the repository with a
correspondingly longer period at high pH.  From the information presented on
groundwater compositions in <I>Nirex Report 524, The Geology and Hydrogeology
of the Sellafield Area : Interim Assessment : December 1993 </I>(Volume 3,
Tables 3.4, 3.5 and 3.7) [COR/517], it is also possible to identify a number of
dissolved chemicals present at depth in the PRZ at Sellafield which are reactive
towards cements.  All of these are taken into account, alongside similar
reactive chemicals in the wastes themselves or which would result from their
eventual breakdown, in calculating the period of time for which a high pH would
be maintained.  The results obtained so far allow us to assume conservatively
that the required pH value of 10 or more would be maintained throughout the
repository for one million years.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.23"></A>5.23 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill was designed
to afford a large surface area in its pore structure for the sorption of
radionuclides from solution in the groundwater.  The value measured for pore
surface area of 2.8 x 10<SUP>4</SUP> m<SUP>2</SUP> per kilogram of material is
highly favourable in this respect.  It is recognised that some chemical
reactions could block off parts of the porous structure of the backfill material
or that cracks could develop in the backfill and the crack surfaces become
altered to give less sorption.  None of the experimental work carried out using
synthesised Sellafield groundwater and related modelling work has indicated any
significant adverse effects.  However, in current safety assessment studies, the
sorption capacity has been reduced from the high values observed in experiments,
to take account of uncertainties in this respect.</P>
<P>5.24 A convenient way of reflecting the physical and chemical containment
afforded by the engineered barriers in the repository concept is to draw a graph
of the &quot;fractional release&quot; of a radionuclide of interest as a
function of time.  The fractional release is that fraction of the total amount
of the radionuclide in the initial disposal inventory that would be found in the
geosphere at a given time.  Its calculation takes account of release of the
radionuclide from the engineered system of the repository and also of depletion
of the radionuclide by radioactive decay.  Low values of fractional release
indicate a good containment performance by the engineered barriers.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.25"></A>5.25 <A HREF="#Figure5.2">Figure 5.2</A> shows the
benefit of chemical containment by reduction of solubility, by sorption and by
the combination of the two processes in the near field in terms of the
fractional release to the geosphere from the disposal inventory of
plutonium-239.  It can be seen that the chemical containment performance that
would be afforded by the action of the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill within the
groundwater system in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield is calculated to limit
the fractional release of plutonium-239 to approximately one part in two
thousand.  This explains why, in assessment studies of the post-closure
performance of the total repository system,  plutonium-239 is found to return to
the surface environment in such low concentrations as to make no significant
contribution to radiological risk, as shown in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table
6.18, page 6.36)<I> </I>[COR/522].</P>
<P>5.26 Calculations of fractional releases for longer-lived radionuclides than
plutonium-239 show that the chemical containment significantly limits their
fractional release for very long periods of time (beyond one million years in
the case of uranium-238.)  A period of one million years, conservatively taken
as the duration for the operation of chemical containment in a repository
located in the PRZ at Sellafield, is marked on <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.
 This shows that over 99% of the residual 1% of radioactivity present in
long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which chemical
containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH, is
maintained.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalBarrier"></A><B> Natural Barrier</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.27"></A>5.27 On the basis of the evidence that I have
presented thus far, the natural barrier afforded by the BVG rocks in the PRZ at
Sellafield would ensure a low fractional release, that is radiologically
insignificant, of all but a small number of the longest-lived radionuclides, as
a result of the physical and chemical containment by the engineered barriers of
the repository in that location.  In the case of uranium-238, having a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years,  the release to the geosphere would be limited
for over a million years by the low solubility in the high pH water in the
repository and sorption onto cement phases.  However, two long-lived
radionuclides, chlorine-36 and iodine-129, do not have the metallic character in
their solution behaviour that leads to reduction of solubility in alkali
solution, and in experimental work to date have been found not to sorb strongly
to cement phases or geological minerals.  Accordingly the behaviour of these
radionuclides is modelled by assuming high solubilities and no retardation by
sorption in the flow of groundwater from depth to the surface.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.28"></A>5.28 The further important role of the natural
barrier, identified at the start of this section of my Proof of Evidence is to
ensure that residual long-lived radionuclides that are not physically and
chemically contained by the engineered barriers, representing around 0.01% of
the initial radioactivity, do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.  This requires that the dissolved levels of radionuclides will be
sufficiently diluted to low concentrations in the groundwater eventually
carrying them to the surface.</P>
<P>5.29 The extent of dilution is determined by :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the quantity of water flowing in the near-surface rocks, into which
groundwater bearing radionuclides from the repository moves;
</LI>
<LI>the area of near-surface rocks into which groundwater bearing radionuclides
moves : the greater the area the larger the volume of water for dilution
(spreading in space); and
</LI>
<LI>the time over which the radionuclides are released into the near-surface
groundwater system.  The spreading in time arises from the rate at which they
are released from the repository (determined by flow of groundwater through the
repository and the repository porewater concentrations determined by the
physical and chemical barriers) and spreading in time during passage through the
geosphere due to processes such as dispersion, sorption and rock matrix
diffusion.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.30 A further dilution is afforded if the discharge of groundwater from the
geosphere occurs into surface water in the biosphere - in the form of streams,
lakes or the sea - before becoming accessible to people.</P>
<P>5.31 For a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, the
release from the repository of radionuclides such as uranium-238 can extend to
over a million years as a result of solubility and sorption control in the
engineered barriers and of the relatively low groundwater flow through the
repository of 140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year, as given at paragraph 5.21 of my
evidence.  Even for those radionuclides such as chlorine-36 and iodine-129 that
may not be subject to solubility and sorption control, it would take more than a
thousand years to flush the radionuclides out of the repository in a flow of 140
m<SUP>3</SUP> per year.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.32"></A>5.32 The principal source of dilution by mixing of
repository-derived groundwater with groundwater in overlying rocks is provided
at Sellafield by the Calder Sandstone.  A simple calculation is carried out in<I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3,<I> </I>Sub&#173;section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522].  It shows<I></I>that
dilution by a factor of about 600 would be achieved by assuming direct mixing of
the flow of groundwater through the repository with the flow of groundwater
discharging through an area equivalent to the plan area of the repository to
surface from the Calder Sandstone.  For the radionuclides chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 the spreading in time resulting from the short duration of the source
term compared to the geosphere travel time gives a greater dilution factor of
about 2,000.</P>
<P>5.33 As concluded in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 9.1, page 9.2)
[COR/522] the groundwater flow models used in the reported assessment studies
predict that groundwater flow from a repository located in the PRZ to the
surface environment will emerge predominantly at the bed of the eastern edge of
the Irish Sea.  If sea levels were to remain as at present, the discharge at
this location would be subject to a further and considerable dilution by sea
water.  As a consequence of these successive dilutions, the annual radiological
risk to an individual for discharge of all radionuclides to the marine
environment is assessed to be at least three orders of magnitude below the
target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>.
</P>
<P>5.34 This annual risk to an individual is an output from the models that I
described in Section 4 of my evidence.  The computed mean value of risk is
plotted on a graph as a function of time.  It is a mean value because of the use
of probabilistic safety assessment methods in which the calculations are
repeated a number of times, corresponding to the sampling of the allowed ranges
of values for input parameters, and an arithmetic mean is taken of the resulting
values for risk.  The appropriate graph showing the base-case calculation of
risk from marine discharge in a Temperate (as current) climate is produced as
<A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>,  after<I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Figure
6.6) [COR/522].</P>
<P>5.35 Under present conditions at Sellafield, a small proportion of the
discharge might occur to the terrestrial environment in association with incised
river beds.  Furthermore, the time taken for emergence into the sea bed would be
such that the sea level could possibly be lower as a consequence of climate
change, possibly placing the whole of the discharge in a terrestrial
environment.
</P>
<P>5.36 Three further curves are presented in <A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>
for a terrestrial discharge under three different biosphere states,
corresponding to Temperate, Periglacial and Boreal climates.  On the basis of
current understanding of global climate patterns, Temperate or warmer conditions
are expected to persist at Sellafield for several thousand years.  Beyond that
time period, colder Boreal or Periglacial conditions need to be considered.  For
the purpose of model calculations, each climate state is assumed to persist over
the full period evaluated.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.37"></A>5.37 The Boreal climate state will be associated
with a lower sea level than the current sea level.  Discharge is therefore
likely to be terrestrial.  The peak annual  individual risks in the Boreal
terrestrial state are 1.1 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at twenty thousand years after
repository closure and 3.3 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at four million years after
closure.  In all calculations for discharges to a terrestrial environment, the
maximum of the risk curve occurring at about twenty thousand years is
attributable mainly to chlorine-36 (with iodine-129 making a contribution of
around 4%), and that after more than a million years is attributable to the
daughter radionuclides of uranium-238, in particular radium-226.  Chlorine-36 is
effectively transported to the surface at the same rate as the water in which it
is dissolved and the peak at about twenty thousand years corresponds to the most
probable value of calculated groundwater return time.  The most significant
component of the calculated risk is from radionuclides entering the food chain,
particularly through milk derived from pasture-grazing cows.</P>
<P>5.38 Simple scoping studies were carried out to allow calculations of risk
for 'agricultural wells' in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 6.7, pages
6.18 to 6.20) [COR/522].  The preliminary estimate of peak annual individual
risk is 1.7 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP> on the basis of an assessment for chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 only : these radionuclides are expected to dominate risk in the
period before 10<SUP>5</SUP> years.  It is found that iodine-129 is the major
contributor.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.39"></A>5.39 As noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522], further
refinement of the assessment methodology will produce a better view of risk from
agricultural wells.  As for all the results in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522], the
calculations for agricultural wells reflect a reference repository design rather
than an optimised system.  If necessary, there is scope for taking specific
waste emplacement and repository design measures to reduce the risks as part of
the optimisation process which ensures that releases are as low as reasonably
practicable.  In the case of iodine-129, which is the main contributor to the
risk, 50% of the inventory is contained in a limited volume of waste, about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>, as stated in paragraph 5.8.  For such relatively small volumes
of waste, there is flexibility to develop specific measures, which might be
impractical for larger volumes of waste.</P>
<P>5.40. A number of variant calculations were reported in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume
3, Section 7, pages 7.1 to 7.18) [COR/522].  These showed that the risks
calculated to arise from a repository at Sellafield were not greatly changed as
a result of changes in the spreading time for radionuclide transport in the
geosphere if the duration of their release from the repository remains constant
(that duration is inversely proportional to the groundwater flow through the
repository.)  Similarly, the system is robust to changes in the duration of the
release if the spreading time in the geosphere remains constant.  It is only if
the duration of the release and the spreading time in the geosphere both have
values significantly lower than currently calculated that annual individual
radiological risks in excess of the target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP> were calculated
in <I>Nirex 95</I> (Volume 3, Figure 8.8) [COR/522] to arise from natural
discharges to the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="GasPathway"></A><B>Gas Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.41"></A>5.41 The gas pathway refers to the migration of
radionuclides in gaseous form from the repository to the surface environment. 
The most radiologically significant processes have been calculated to involve
the incorporation of carbon-14 from the disposal inventory in methane generated
from microbiological degradation of wastes in the repository and the subsequent
entry of this methane into the food chain, as noted in <I>Nirex Science Report
S/94/003, Post-closure Performance Assessment: Gas Generation and Migration,
November 1994 (&quot;Nirex Report S/94/003&quot;) </I>(Section 4.1, page 20)
[COR/509].
</P>
<P>5.42 The carbon-14 inventory of 2,600 TBq represents less than 0.1% of the
total disposal inventory.  Scoping calculations have been carried out making the
following simplifications that are believed to be highly conservative :

<P>5.43 Work is also under way in the Nirex Safety Assessment Research
Programme ('NSARP') to study the possible significance of gas-water interactions
on radionuclide transport.  As noted in <I>Nirex Report S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section

the RCF is intended to enable some of the required site-specific data to be

<P>5.44 As discussed in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/004, Post-closure
Performance Assessment, Human Intrusion and Natural Disruptive Events, July 1995
(&quot;Nirex Report S/95/004&quot;) </I>(Sub-section 3.2, pages 12 and 13;
Section 5, page 16) [NRX/15/2], the location of a repository in the BVG at
Sellafield is likely<I></I>to afford a high level of isolation of the wastes
from the effects of natural disruptive events, such as erosion and seismicity,
and inadvertent human intrusion.</P>
<P>5.45 The principal form of inadvertent human intrusion considered to date
has involved the radiological exposure of geotechnical workers or surface
inhabitants as a result of inadvertent drilling of boreholes into the repository
at some time in the future, when records of its existence may no longer exist. 
In terms of the relevant characteristics - the dimensions of a repository vault
cross-section and the inventory of heavy metal radionuclides - the current
repository concept correlates quite closely with that assessed for the human
intrusion scenario for a repository in the PRZ at Sellafield in <I>PERA </I>(paragraphs
5.6.11 to 5.6.14, pages 36 and 37) [COR/501].  A peak annual individual risk
from intrusion of less than 10<SUP>-8</SUP> was given in Table 5.2 of that
report.  <I>Nirex Report S/95/004 </I>(Sub-section 3.1, pages 9 to 12)
[NRX/15/2]<I>  </I>updates the information on mineral resources in the
Sellafield location on the basis of the extensive investigations carried out by
Nirex.  There has been no finding of a significant new resource that would
suggest a higher incidence of drilling than assumed in <I>PERA</I> [COR/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="PotentialSuitabiltiy"></A><B>Potential Suitability of Sellafield
as a Location for a Repository
</B></P>
<P>5.46 The analysis I have presented above confirms the good promise of
Sellafield as a potentially suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater
pathway is central to our considerations of repository safety and therefore
requires to be well understood.  If resolution of uncertainties, as identified
in Section 6 below, confirms our current understanding of the groundwater system
at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the BVG rocks of the PRZ
which would meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>5.47 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield are
consistent with the physical and chemical containment of all but a small
fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just three
radionuclides, chlorine-36, iodine-129 and uranium-238, are calculated to be
released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the peak risk
either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>5.48 If conditions at the Sellafield site were to remain as at present,
resulting in predicted discharge predominantly to a marine environment, these
releases would have small consequences when compared with the risk target.  For
release of chlorine-36 to a terrestrial environment - and of iodine-129 in the
case of agricultural wells - the groundwater system needs to provide dilution of
levels of radionuclides in repository-derived groundwater sufficient to lead to
calculated risks consistent with regulatory requirements.  On the basis of the
calculations carried out, it is judged that such dilution will be afforded by
the hydrogeological system at Sellafield.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.49"></A>5.49 The strong chemical containment that will be
afforded to uranium by the Nirex repository concept ensures that any significant
migration to the surface of  uranium-238 and its daughter radionuclides only
occurs at times beyond about one hundred thousand years after repository
closure, as shown in <I>Nirex 95
</I>(Volume 3, Section 6.4, pages 6.10 to 6.12) [COR/522].  The very long
radioactive decay half-life of uranium-238,  approaching 4,500 million years,
means that it will return to the surface eventually unless a process of
mineralisation leads to its permanent incorporation in the constituents of the
cement-based backfill or the host rocks.  There is evidence that this may happen
but Nirex is not yet sufficiently confident in the evidence to incorporate the
process in safety assessments.  It is of course this long half-life that
accounts for the abundant natural occurrence of uranium-238 on the planet. 
Given the considerable uncertainties associated with numerical assessments over
timescales of the order of a million years, a comparison with naturally
occurring radioactivity is considered to represent a more effective way of
demonstrating the containment performance of the system with respect to this
nuclide,  This approach is under development for use in future assessment
studies.  Nevertheless, the extension of the numerical assessments to times
beyond one million years has produced a calculated annual individual risk of 3.3
x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> for a Boreal climate state.</P>
<P>5.50 The presentation in my evidence of the containment performance of the
barriers in a repository located at Sellafield enables the identification of
aspects of the site where Nirex must be confident that the underlying judgments
are correct and that the range of uncertainty has been narrowed sufficiently. 
These are :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the groundwater flow into the near field of the repository, which
determines the duration of chemical containment and the rates of release of
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>the dilution, during transport in the geosphere, of the dissolved
radionuclides in the groundwater released from the repository, which determines
the concentrations of radionuclides in groundwater reaching the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para5.51"></A>5.51 The most probable value for the groundwater
flow into the near field of the repository is predicted to be  140 m<SUP>3
</SUP>per year as stated in paragraph 5.21.  This value is consistent with
maintenance of chemical containment in the engineered barriers of the repository
for a million years and limits the release of uranium-238 to levels consistent
with risks meeting regulatory requirements.  This value is also consistent with
sufficient spreading in time of the release of chlorine-36 from the repository
to ensure its subsequent dilution to levels that are also consistent with risks
meeting regulatory requirements.  However, groundwater flows greater than this
cannot be ruled out.  It is noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 2.3,
page 2.13) [COR/522] that on the basis of the current judgments about the
networks of connected fractures in the BVG used to calculate the flow, a small
probability exists that the flow could be 150 times greater (or indeed smaller).
 If it were found that the description of the networks of connected fractures
giving a flow 150 times greater is a better representation of the fractures in
the BVG, then a repository would probably not meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.52"></A>5.52 Similarly, the most probable value currently
predicted for the dilution of radionuclides in the geosphere is consistent with
a repository performance meeting regulatory requirements.  This dilution is
highly dependent upon the path taken by groundwater from the repository to the
surface environment.  The modelled path is determined by the judgments
concerning networks of connected fractures in both the BVG and the overlying
sedimentary formations and we must be confident that these are correct also.</P>
<P>5.53 The relevant information on the geology and hydrogeology of Sellafield,
available in most part by early 1994, was used in the calculations of risk
reported in Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95
</I>[COR/522].  Dr. Chaplow presents in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) the further information which
has become available since then.</P>
<P>5.54 This further information has added to confidence that the site at
Sellafield offers a stable geological setting which will provide a low
groundwater flow through a repository located in the BVG and high dilution in
the overlying rocks for radionuclides released from repository vaults.  It
includes information on groundwater chemistry indicating long residence times
for the groundwater in the BVG, and results from the cross-hole testing and
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test.  These tests have provided information on the limited
nature of the connections over extended length scales in the fracture systems in
the BVG and have indicated little connection between the BVG and overlying
sandstones.  While models of the groundwater system have not yet been updated
and implications for risk calculated, I consider that this later information
broadly supports the basis of <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522] with some indications
that the modelling in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522]  may have been conservative in
its representation of networks of connected fractures in the BVG and overlying
sandstones.</P>
<P>5.55 In Section 6 of my evidence, I describe the information needed from the
RCF to build further confidence in our judgments before key decisions can be
made in the deep repository development programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="InformationRequired"></A><B>6. INFORMATION REQUIRED FROM THE RCF</B></P>
<P>6.1 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">paragraph 6.21</A>) notes that for
present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the development of
a repository:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under
RSA93; and
</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.
</LI></UL>
<P> Nirex will prepare assessments of the post-closure safety performance of
the repository for each of these decision points.  That prepared for the first
decision point will necessarily be preliminary and will be filled out and
finalised to enable the regulatory authorities to take a decision on approval of
the start of disposal operations.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.2"></A>6.2 As described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of
Evidence, (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.22">paragraphs 6.22</A> to 6.24), the
information requirements for the different stages of post-closure safety
performance assessment are somewhat different in character.  This leads to the
identification of two separate categories of information required.  These have
different timescales for delivery that are related to the two decision points
identified above.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The RCF programme, comprising 3 phases, has been
developed to deliver the information that is needed in accordance with these
timescales.  It is expected that Phase 1 of the RCF programme could deliver the
information required in relation to a decision to propose development of a
repository.  In particular, as will be explained in the following paragraphs in
this Section of my evidence, we need to obtain sufficient information to build
confidence in key models used in assessments of repository post-closure
performance and to enable confident extrapolation of descriptions of the rock
mass and groundwater system across the PRZ for use in developing the repository
design.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.4"></A>6.4 The confidence achieved by the end of Phase 1 of
the RCF programme will be dependent upon the amount and nature of information
that has been obtained at that stage.  The information available will determine
the extent to which models and extrapolations can be put to the test.  The
adequacy of this testing will be subject to rigorous review as part of informing
a decision on whether to  propose development of a repository.  In the event
that it is found inadequate,  further information will be sought from one or
both of the subsequent phases of the RCF programme.  A possible scenario is that
more information will be required on geological and hydrogeological
characteristics accessible to an extent that is too limited in Phase 1 as a
result of their orientation or spacing in relation to the shafts and connecting
galleries.  In that case the subsequent extension of the horizontal galleries of
the RCF, and drilling out from those galleries, will be designed to overcome
this limitation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.5"></A>6.5 The first category of information, required to
inform a decision on whether to propose development of a repository, relates to
those factors which are most important in determining the suitability of the
site as a location for a repository.  These factors are our predictions of
groundwater flow and dilution, the potential for natural or induced changes to
create significant new pathways for groundwater flow, and repository design. 
The position that the Company considers it necessary to achieve in respect of
each of these factors for the first decision point is as follows :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution and that
these predictions are consistent with meeting regulatory requirements;
</LI>
<LI>confidence that construction of a repository at the site, or future
naturally induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which
would significantly impair repository performance; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence in the basis for optimisation of repository depth, location,
layout and orientation, and consequent confidence in cost estimates for
repository construction.
</LI></UL>
<P> The safety assessment to be prepared in relation to this decision point
will be required to take account of the alternative scenarios for long-term
evolution of the repository system and information on naturally induced changes
will be important to establish the appropriate framework for such an analysis.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 In the second category of information, required
in relation to a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether to approve
the start of disposal operations, are those factors which will have been
addressed in the laboratory or at other research sites, but where it is likely
that the regulatory authorities will require an in situ demonstration that the
results are applicable to the repository site.  Such information requirements
are currently considered to relate to the following :</P>
<UL>
<LI>processes that can influence the transport of radionuclides in groundwater
in the geosphere;  
</LI>
<LI>quantifications of long-term effects of the interaction of the repository
system with the localised flows in the surrounding rocks; and
</LI>
<LI>finalisation of detailed design, including repository sealing measures.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 Our work has indicated that the factors for which information is sought
in this second category are not likely to determine the basic suitability of a
site as a location for a repository.  Repository safety is calculated to be less
sensitive to the ranges of assumptions that can reasonably be made about these
factors.  However, the demonstration that these factors have been taken into
account in a realistic manner is considered to be a necessary element of a
finalised assessment of post-closure safety performance needed to inform a
decision by the regulatory authorities on approval of the start of disposal
operations.  It is also considered that the second category of information will
include that required to fill out the information supplied in the safety
assessment, prepared at the first key decision point, and that this will be
achieved through a process of further systematic validation.</P>
<P>6.8 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need to
address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of the
repository, but will identify specific remaining uncertainties and the steps
that will be taken to resolve them.  If a robust evaluation can be achieved by
the end of Phase 1 of the RCF programme, then the further work in Phase 2 and
Phase 3 of the RCF programme would continue to address remaining uncertainties,
probably within the framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities,
for the progressive supply of information leading to a decision on approval to
start disposal of wastes in the repository.  </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 The calculations that we have carried out in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 9, pages 9.1 to 9.4) [COR/522] indicate that a
repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield could be developed
which would meet regulatory requirements.  This is conditional on the basis that
judgments about the rock characteristics, leading to predictions of groundwater
flow, are correct.  The risk calculations are based on a conceptual model which
contains a particular description of the networks of connected fractures
controlling flow in the BVG.  Uncertainties in the values of parameters
describing the networks have been recognised by ascribing a range of values
having different probabilities about a central value for each parameter.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Limitations on surface-based observations mean
that we cannot measure the parameters of interest directly.  Expert judgment has
been used in developing the conceptual model and associated ranges of parameter
values.  It is recognised by Nirex and the experts involved in this exercise
that different judgments could be arrived at, leading to different conceptual
models with different ranges of parameter values around different central
values.  Some of these alternative models, albeit improbable, could lead to the
prediction of high values for the flow of groundwater into the repository or low
values for its dilution in the overlying rocks that would not be consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements for post-closure safety of a repository. </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The remedy is to subject these conceptual
models to a process of validation involving forward predictions, using the
outputs of these models, and testing these predictions against field
observations. This process of validation can be used to achieve the following
objectives :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>discrimination between alternative conceptual models of the same system
using tests to measure directly some aspect of the system for which different
predictions are given by the alternative models;
</LI>
<LI>refinement of a conceptual model where there is some uncertainty about one
or more components of the model, or about the parameters associated with the
model, and the predictions can be compared with test results to reduce or remove
the uncertainty; and
</LI>
<LI>confirmation of a conceptual model as fit for its intended purpose in
post-closure performance assessment studies through testing of the adequacy of
its predictions.
</LI></UL>
<P> This process is intrinsic to the Nirex programme of hydrogeological
investigations, where modelling has been carried out to design the more
extensive hydrogeological tests and to establish criteria for their successful
implementation, and will be developed further for application in the RCF. </P>
<P>6.12 In developing the approach to model validation for the RCF programme,
it is recognised that predictions of the parameters that largely determine
overall system performance, such as groundwater flow through the repository and
dilution of levels of dissolved radionuclides in the geosphere, cannot be tested
directly.  The validation testing of the component conceptual models that are
combined to create the description of the overall system performance must be
sufficiently rigorous, therefore, to build confidence in their application. 
This implies requirements for testing over a range of length scales and for
acquiring sufficient test data to satisfy scientific opinion as to the adequacy
of the process.
</P>
<P>6.13 The RCF overcomes limitations of surface-based or laboratory
investigations for validation in the following ways :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the RCF would permit tests and observations in three dimensions and at a
scale more directly comparable to that of the repository;
</LI>
<LI>specialised tests could be performed in situ, directly on specific features
of relevance to repository performance and under geotechnical and
hydrogeotechnical  conditions which are closely comparable to those of the
repository; and
</LI>
<LI>the RCF would allow direct, in situ, observation and measurement of the
response to excavation of the potential repository host rocks and groundwater
system on a scale, at a depth, and in a location which would provide information
which can be directly related to the performance of a repository within the PRZ.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.14 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.6">paragraph 6.6</A>) has identified that the
information that the RCF will provide can be considered to address uncertainties
in three main areas :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> The nature of the key uncertainties will be explained under these headings
in the following paragraphs.  The information required to address them will be
identified in terms of its categorisation in relation to the future developments
of post-closure performance assessments to support the two decision points as
discussed above.  It will be explained why the information required can only be
obtained through the underground access to the rock mass which will be afforded
by the RCF.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterFlow"></A><B>Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide
Transport</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.15"></A>6.15 The performance of the engineered barriers of
the repository in affording physical and chemical containment is dependent upon
the flow and composition of the groundwater in the repository.  The overall
performance will determine the rate of transfer of dissolved radionuclides in
groundwater out of the near-field of the repository into the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.16 The transport of radionuclides by the groundwater in the geosphere is
dependent upon the characteristics of the rock that control groundwater flow and
the physical and chemical processes that operate within the rock.  The combined
characteristics of the repository host rock and overlying rocks will determine
the pathways taken by radionuclides to return to the surface and the
concentrations at which they will emerge in the biosphere.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.17"></A>6.17 The first category of information required
before a decision is made to propose development of a repository is to test
assumptions made about the characteristics of the site in relation to :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository; and
</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>the spreading in the geosphere of residual mobile or long-lived
radionuclides from the repository in groundwater that reaches the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.18"></A>6.18 The second category of information, required to
be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision on
whether to approve the start of disposal operations is to test that evaluations
of processes having the potential to affect the transport of radionuclides have
realistically estimated the effects on post-closure performance.  Currently,
three potentially important processes are identified where information is needed
from the RCF:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> In addition, the second category of information will include that required
to fill out the information supplied on groundwater flow and on spreading and
dilution in the geosphere in the safety assessment prepared at the first key
decision point.</P>
<P>6.19 The information required on each of the identified subjects is
described under separate headings in the following paragraphs.
</P>
<P>Calculation of Groundwater Flow through the Repository</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.20"></A>6.20 The calculation of groundwater flow through the
repository is carried out on the basis of descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, as given in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.2, pages 5.6 to 5.10) [COR/522].  It is
considered that groundwater flow occurs predominantly in fractures existing in
hard rocks such as the BVG.   Further, it is considered that fractures are not
uniformly distributed through the rock but that, as a result of natural
processes in the geological evolution of the rock formation, several individual
fractures can have developed together in connected networks.  These networks
would extend over greater distances than their component individual fractures
and are therefore likely to be more significant in controlling groundwater flow
through the rock.</P>
<P>6.21 The flow of groundwater through such a network of connected fractures
is controlled by factors such as its overall length, the aperture of the
individual fractures in the network, the ways in which they are connected
together and the variability of these characteristics within the overall
network.  The flow of groundwater through a repository will be determined by the
properties of these networks of connected fractures, by the number of them
intersected by the disposal vaults and by the hydraulic pressure gradients
driving water along them.  The locations of the networks and the spacings
between them are therefore also important information, as is the distribution of
hydraulic pressures within the networks.
</P>
<P>6.22 As described in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.1.2, pages
5.3 to 5.5) [COR/522], the results of hydrogeological tests carried out in
boreholes have been interpreted in terms of assumed intersections of the
networks of connected fractures by the boreholes.  Where such an intersection is
assumed, the properties of the fracture network are inferred from the
hydrogeological measurements.  The maximum lengths of these features are put at
many hundreds of metres and so an individual borehole having a diameter of about
150 mm would be intersecting only a small part of the overall system.  This
introduces considerable uncertainties which are recognised by Nirex in assigning
a wide range of possible descriptions to the network of connected fractures and
an associated wide range of values for the important properties.</P>
<P>6.23 The networks of connected fractures can be investigated over a greater
lengthscale by means of cross-hole testing between different boreholes.  Nirex
has carried out such tests, culminating in the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, as
described by Dr Chaplow in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para6.36">paragraphs 6.36</A> to 6.40).  These
tests have involved the generation of different possible descriptions of the
networks of connected fractures, in the forms of alternative conceptual models. 
By comparing the predictions of these models with the results of testing,
uncertainties concerning groundwater flows can be resolved to some extent and as
noted in paragraph 5.54 the outcomes appear encouraging.  However, the principal
uncertainty, concerning the range of possible descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures, will remain in the absence of direct observations and
complementary testing of the networks.
</P>
<P>6.24 The information required from the RCF is a description of the networks
of connected fractures as the main groundwater flow channels in the BVG, and the
range of values that should be assigned to the key properties of these features,
based upon physical observations.  Furthermore, the information obtained must be
capable of extrapolation both in space, throughout the volume of the BVG rocks
in the PRZ, and also in time, to validate the application of the resulting
models in assessments of repository post-closure performance at long times into
the future.</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF will allow such information to be obtained because it will
afford the opportunity to carry out complementary activities in parallel. 
Direct observations can be made on the way in which individual fractures are
connected to form extended networks.  The properties of the individual fractures
can be measured in parallel with the measurement of the properties of the
connected system as described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.11">paragraph 6.11</A>).</P>
<P>6.26 The access to a large volume of rock containing the networks of
connected fractures will allow observations to be made of their locations and of
any association with other geological features such as faults.  Relationships
with recognisable geological structures and information on trends in the
orientation and spacing of the features would allow the testing of this
information against further observations and would attach greater confidence to
the extrapolation through the rock volume.</P>
<P>6.27 Our current groundwater flow models do not fully reproduce the
hydraulic pressure field that is deduced from borehole measurements.  A
significant factor in the current differences between observation and prediction
may be the way in which the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures
are used to calculate hydrogeological properties on a regional scale.  A further
model development is planned, possibly incorporating relationships between the
depth and location of the networks and their hydrogeological properties, to
address this issue. Sinking of the RCF shafts will provide information to test
the validity of such models.</P>
<P> Spreading in the Geosphere</P>
<P>6.28 As described in paragraphs 5.28 and 5.29 of my evidence, the
concentrations at which radionuclides will be present in groundwater reaching
the surface environment will be determined by a number of factors including
their rate of release from the repository and their spreading in time and space
during passage through the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.29 The rate of release from the repository is largely determined by the
groundwater flow through the near field of the repository (taking account of the
containment afforded by the engineered barriers), where the RCF is intended to
provide essential information.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 The RCF is intended to provide information for
use in determining the spreading in time and space of the transport of
radionuclides in the BVG rocks and the overlying sedimentary formations.  The
spreading of radionuclide transport will be highly dependent upon the properties
of the main groundwater flow channels in the geological formation. Thus, the
information on groundwater flow channels in the BVG rocks sought from the RCF in
relation to calculations of groundwater flow through the repository would be
required for this second purpose also.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.31"></A>6.31 The other geological formation which is
important in this context is the St. Bees Sandstone.  A wide range of
conceptualisations of the flow channels in this formation remains possible on
the basis of the results obtained so far.  At one extreme, this range includes
approximately vertical connected fracture networks extending over large
distances and possibly connected with fracture networks in the BVG.  At the
other extreme of the range is the possibility that horizontal bedding
structures, produced by the sedimentation processes that created the sandstones,
would force the groundwater flow in a horizontal direction.</P>
<P>6.32 The RCF will afford the direct observation of the structural
characteristics of the St. Bees Sandstone, as exposed in the RCF shafts.  The
correlation of the observed large scale geological structures with observations
of groundwater flow and hydrogeological responses in the monitoring boreholes
nearby should enable us to distinguish between the possible descriptions.  A
description based upon physical observations could then be used to calculate the
spreading in time and space for radionuclide transport through this rock
formation.</P>
<P> Rock Matrix Diffusion</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.33"></A>6.33 Radionuclides transported in groundwater along
flow channels in rocks, may diffuse into the surrounding bulk rock matrix.  This
would have the effect of retarding the transport of radionuclides and also
result in some spreading in the geosphere of the initial radionuclide release
from the repository.  The consequent access to sorption sites in the surrounding
bulk rock matrix affords additional retardation to radionuclide transport.  The
nature and extent of the operation of rock matrix diffusion and sorption affects
the calculated radiological consequences of the release of metallic
radionuclides such as uranium-238 in particular.</P>
<P>6.34 Particularly in the BVG there are uncertainties as to the extent to
which this beneficial process will operate. The uncertainties arise from
uncertainties about the networks of connected fractures, the internal structures
of the fractures themselves and the in situ diffusivity of the rock matrix.</P>
<P>6.35 The requirement for this information is placed in the second category, 
to be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision
on whether to approve the start of disposal operations.  Information on the
process of rock matrix diffusion has been obtained from laboratory measurements
and experiments on rock core samples.  However, for the results of this research
to be used with confidence it must be ensured that the measurements were
applicable to the main flow channels and that important properties of the rock
were not modified by their removal from the bulk rock at depth to a laboratory. 
The RCF is required to give direct access to, and measurements in, fractures
identified on the basis of their groundwater flow properties, and to make these
measurements in situ with relatively little disturbance of the rocks.</P>
<P> Colloid Transport</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.36"></A>6.36 Colloids are small particles of matter which
remain suspended in groundwater because they do not settle under gravity.  If
colloidal particles are present in sufficiently large concentrations and remain
stable for a sufficient length of time they have the potential to cause an
increase in the effective transport of radionuclides in groundwater by
incorporating radionuclides from the near field.  No conclusive evidence has
been found to suggest that colloids would exist at significant concentrations in
a repository at Sellafield.  However, because of the known difficulties of
taking undisturbed samples of groundwater to analyse for colloids, robust
arguments are not available to demonstrate that colloids will not be present. 
The key uncertainties relate to the quantities of colloids present in Sellafield
groundwaters and the transport of colloids in fractures in the rocks at
Sellafield.</P>
<P>6.37 Considerable efforts are being made to collect good groundwater samples
from the boreholes at Sellafield for colloid analysis including the drilling of
boreholes without the use of drilling muds.  Whereas the practical difficulties
have been overcome successfully for the analysis of species in solution in
groundwater, the ability to obtain reliable samples and analyses of the colloid
population is hampered by the introduction of relatively large quantities of
particulate matter from the materials of the sampling equipment and the fluids
necessarily used to drill, test and sample the boreholes.  The immediate
accessibility of the rocks at depth in the RCF affords the opportunity to take
undisturbed samples of known origins.  This is because more specialised sampling
equipment, including provisions for stabilising existing conditions, can be
located precisely within a feature of interest.  This benefit of working within
the RCF is extended to more general geochemical sampling where a higher spatial
coverage of sampling can be achieved than through the use of boreholes drilled
from the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.38"></A>6.38 Nirex will seek to generate relatively simple
empirically based models of colloid transport based on experiments conducted
using flow rates and fracture properties of interest.  Given the requirements
for direct access to the fracture system in conjunction with the need for a high
level of control of the experimental conditions there is a particular necessity
to carry out such experiments in the RCF.  It is envisaged that these
experiments would characterise the transport of different colloids relative to a
conservative tracer (a substance that is readily identified and remains
dissolved in water as a trace on its movement) within a single fracture that had
previously been characterised.</P>
<P>Gas Migration</P>
<P>6.39 Our current understanding of processes relevant to gas migration
through the geosphere has been developed through the NSARP experimental
programme at Reskajeage Quarry in Cornwall.  The experimental results have been
used to develop and refine the modelling approach described in <I>Nirex Report
S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section 3.3, pages 13 to 16) [COR/509].  There are two aspects
of gas migration for which in situ testing is needed to confirm understanding
and validate models in order to increase confidence both in the evaluation of
the gas pathway itself and in the assessment of the effect of gas migration on
groundwater flow :</P>
<UL>
<LI>the entry of the gas into the water-saturated fracture network, since it is
necessary to be able to predict the maximum overpressuring that will be
generated in the repository as a result of gas production, in order to estimate
the potential for gas-induced fracturing of the repository or the surrounding
rock; and
</LI>
<LI>the migration of gas through the disturbed zone around the repository and
through the geosphere where issues to be considered are the mechanisms for gas
migration and the associated potential for coupled gas-water flow, the gas
pathways through the fracture network and the time taken for the gas to return
to the biosphere.  (This information is needed to identify the period over which
gas enters the biosphere and to assess whether enhanced migration of
contaminated groundwater is likely to occur.)
</LI></UL>
<P>6.40 The requisite experiments concerned with gas entry pressures and gas
migration in the BVG can only be carried out in the RCF because horizontal
boreholes are required to intersect identified and characterised fractures and
to examine some of the issues relating to the transport of the buoyant gas
through the water-filled fracture network.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalandInduced"></A><B>Natural and Induced Changes to the
Geological Barrier</B></P>
<P>6.41 It is recognised that the site characterisation programme carried out
by Nirex yields information on the present day geology and hydrogeology.  The
current regulatory requirements for a repository apply at any time in the
future.  Consideration must therefore be given to future changes to the
geosphere barrier as a result both of natural processes, including tectonic and
climatic processes, and of repository construction itself.  The information
required from the RCF again falls into the two categories determined by the
decision point against which it is generated.</P>
<P>6.42 In order to inform a decision whether to propose development of a
repository, information is required on the type and extent of natural changes
that could occur at the site to confirm that these will not significantly impair
the performance of the geosphere barrier in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport.  Similar information is required on the disturbance to
the rock that will be caused by excavating the repository itself, which is
termed 'excavation disturbance'.</P>
<P>6.43 In order to inform a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether
to approve the start of disposal operations, information is needed from testing
underground of the chemical disturbance in rocks surrounding the repository
caused by contact with alkaline pore water from the cement-based backfill. 
Every effort will have been made to assess the extent and nature of this change
to the rocks surrounding the repository in a conservative manner, using
information obtained from laboratory and field experiments and from
desk-studies.  However, the complex and site-specific nature of the interaction
requires validation to be obtained that its treatment in assessment studies is
appropriate and does not lead to underestimates of the transport of
radionuclides.</P>
<P> Natural Changes</P>
<P>6.44 Dr. Chaplow presents evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para7.6">paragraphs 7.6</A> to 7.26) that the
system of flowing fractures in the BVG has remained stable for a long period of
time.  In particular, no evidence has been obtained for the creation of new flow
paths at depth as a result of any seismic activity during the last several
million years and the groundwater system at depth shows evidence that there have
been no extensive changes as a result of climate-related events such as
glaciation for over a million years.  However, the RCF will be needed to
validate this evidence by means of direct observations of associations of
groundwater flows, mineral formation and geological structures at depth. 
Detailed examination of the fractures that are components of the main flow
channels should allow the geological history of flow patterns to be established,
particularly by dating the mineralisation that has occurred in association with
flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then be compared with the present
day flow patterns to test whether significant changes have occurred in the past
and may therefore occur in the future.  On the basis of information obtained
from borehole testing, this does not appear to be the case, but such a
conclusion would only be reliable when greater confidence is obtained in the
descriptions of the networks of connected fractures themselves through
observations and measurements in the RCF.</P>
<P> Excavation Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.45"></A>6.45 The information that can only be obtained from
carrying out work underground in the RCF relates to the disturbance of the
geology and hydrogeology that will result from excavation itself.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.46"></A>6.46 Creating an excavation in rock at depth by any
method removes material which was previously bearing some of the load of the
adjacent and overlying rocks.  Removal of this material therefore causes a
redistribution of the stresses around the excavation.  This redistribution may
be accompanied by some physical movement of the rocks around the excavation,
including movements on existing fractures and the creation of new fractures. 
This phenomenon is termed excavation disturbance.   The excavation disturbance
is confined to a volume, or zone, of rock which surrounds the excavation.  This
disturbed zone of rock surrounding shafts and drifts might provide additional
paths for transport in groundwater of radionuclides from the repository.  The
issues are the hydraulic conductivity of the excavation disturbed zone and how
far the zone extends from the excavation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.47"></A>6.47 Currently, views as to the extent and nature of
the excavation disturbed zone are based on past precedent of excavation projects
at other sites and a knowledge of the in situ stresses and rock quality measured
in Boreholes.  On this basis, it is assumed that the hydraulic conductivity of
the rock surrounding an excavation may increase by a factor of up to a hundred
over a distance equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation.  This is
believed to be a conservative description of the hydraulic characteristics and
extent of the excavation disturbed zone.  Scoping studies have shown that
disturbance on this scale is unlikely to impair the performance of the
repository and the effects of disturbance have not been included in assessment
models on this basis.  The information which is needed from the RCF is
measurement of the hydraulic and mechanical characteristics of the excavation
disturbed zone in the sandstones, Brockram and BVG to test the validity of this
assumption.</P>
<P>6.48 It is found that the potentially important effects of excavation
disturbance on groundwater flow characteristics are specific to the geological
and hydrogeological setting and to the nature of the excavation itself.  They
are likely to vary as a function of depth and location because of the different
mechanical loadings that will exist through the rock mass in three dimensions. 
Furthermore the effects, particularly in the long-term, are dependent upon a
number of interacting processes.</P>
<P>6.49 The benefit of the RCF is that it will allow direct measurement and
monitoring of excavation disturbance in the sandstones, Brockram and the
potential repository host rock.  In particular the important geological and
hydrogeological properties of the rock surrounding the excavation can be
determined before and after the excavation has been carried out and can be
observed as a function of time in the post-excavation period.  The monitoring is
particularly important to build confidence in our understanding of the evolution
of the excavation disturbed zone over time.  To enable extrapolation over
timescales of interest, the trends in further development of the disturbance
will be determined.  The response of the disturbed rock to mechanical loading
such as borehole testing will be particularly helpful in this respect.</P>
<P>6.50 The disturbance caused by the excavation will provide a significant
test of the understanding of changes that might result from natural processes. 
The stress redistribution that will occur during shaft sinking will be a useful
analogue for natural events such as glaciation that might place a cycle of
mechanical loading on the rock mass.  The response of the groundwater flow
system can be monitored to test the effects on the hydrogeological system of
such an event.
</P>
<P> Chemical Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.51"></A>6.51 A chemical disturbance will be produced in a
volume of rock, or  zone, around the repository by the alkaline fluid emanating
from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  This chemical disturbance has the
potential to modify the surfaces of fractures in the rock.
</P>
<P>6.52 Information on this subject is currently obtained by conducting
laboratory experiments on rock samples from Sellafield, by constructing
mathematical models that couple groundwater flow and chemical reaction and by
building confidence in the results of this work from comparison with
observations on naturally occurring alkaline groundwater systems.</P>
<P>6.53 The essential role of the RCF is to provide the opportunity for
calibration and validation of the mathematical models developed from the current
programme  to give the information required on the key issues listed.  The RCF
allows the detailed characterisation of identified flowing fractures to
determine their structure and mineralogy, the variability of these properties
and the precise compositions of groundwater in contact with the flow-wetted
surfaces in the fractures.  Once the fractures were characterised in this way,
their accessibility in the RCF would allow the conduct of well-controlled
validation experiments.  The principal reactions involved are believed to be
relatively slow and the experiments would build confidence in the trends of
changes to the rock properties rather than determining the long-term
characteristics of the disturbed zone by direct measurement.</P>
<P><A NAME="DesignandConstruction"></A><B>Design and Construction of the
Repository</B></P>
<P>6.54 The information required from the RCF on design and construction of the
repository can again be placed in two categories determined by the decision
point against which it is generated.  In this area in particular, the
information acquired for the decision to propose development of a repository
will be refined for subsequent development of a finalised safety assessment.</P>
<P>6.55 In order to take a decision to propose development of a repository, the
repository design must be developed sufficiently to provide a basis for the
optimisation of repository depth. location, layout and orientation.  This would
allow decisions to be taken on these parameters, albeit allowing for
finalisation of details in light of further investigations underground,
including those associated with repository construction.</P>
<P>6.56 There is little doubt that a repository could be constructed and
operated safely: the key issue is whether it will provide the long-term
isolation and containment of radionuclides in radioactive wastes once it is
closed.  A sound basis for assessment of the post-closure performance requires
that key aspects of the design related to transport of radionuclides can be
defined.  This responds to the requirement most recently restated in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208] that best practicable
means should be adopted to limit risk.  For a deep geological repository this is
taken to mean that, where there are options concerning the depth, location,
layout and orientation of the disposal vaults within the host rock, the
decisions taken must be justified.</P>
<P>6.57 It will be important to work within a framework, which has been
discussed with the regulatory authorities, that establishes the basis for making
these decisions and does not foreclose options by inappropriate developments.</P>
<P>6.58 The RCF is particularly valuable in allowing us to proceed in a
step-wise fashion of investigation in the potential host rock to finalise the
repository design.  Dr. Chaplow describes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para8.13">paragraphs 8.13</A> to 8.16) a
three-dimensional representational model of the PRZ rock mass that is currently
under development.  This will provide the framework of testing our understanding
by each successive step of excavation and associated investigations represented
by the phases of the RCF programme.  Each step in developing the RCF and
investigating the surrounding rock mass will be designed to create the minimum
site disturbance required to gain the required justification for fixing an
aspect of design through testing the rock mass model against the resulting
observations.  Thus any exploration by development of galleries in a horizontal
direction out from the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound
justification for the depth at which this will occur from confirmation of the
modelled rock characteristics.  Further extensions of investigations away from
the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound justification for the
eventual location and orientation of a repository.  Care will also be taken that
the nature of the investigations to fix these aspects of repository design would
not compromise our ability to fine tune these aspects at the final stages of
development of a repository itself.</P>
<P>6.59 Before seeking the approval of the regulatory authorities for the start
of disposal operations, information must be obtained, for use in a finalised
safety assessment, with respect to the methods of placing engineered seals,
developed in laboratory facilities, in the required settings.</P>
<P> Repository Depth, Location, Layout and Orientation</P>
<P>6.60 Currently judgments concerning repository design are based upon
interpretations of the rock mass and hydrogeology of the PRZ from information
obtained from the programme of site characterisation.  These interpretations do
not yet enable us to take a firm view on the benefits to be obtained from
particular depths, locations, layouts or orientations of the repository vaults
within the PRZ.
</P>
<P>6.61 Repository design (in particular depth, location, layout and
orientation) would affect factors identified previously : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository;
</LI>
<LI>the calculated spreading time for radionuclide transport in the BVG; and
</LI>
<LI>the mechanical and hydraulic characteristics of the excavation disturbed
zone.</LI></UL>
<P> The information required is to develop an understanding of how these
factors will vary as a function of interactions of different processes at
different locations throughout the PRZ.  In particular information is required
that enables the extrapolation throughout the BVG rocks in the PRZ of the
distribution of networks of connected fractures.</P>
<P>6.62 It might be envisaged, for example, that the repository could be
located at a depth at which there were relatively few or even no networks of
connected fractures sufficiently long to act as groundwater flow channels from
the repository depth to the overlying sedimentary formations.  Alternatively,
the spacing and orientation of the networks of connected fractures might allow a
layout of the repository vaults that minimised or wholly avoided intersections
with them.</P>
<P>6.63 It is intended that the main RCF galleries will be created at the same
horizon as the repository vaults.  The RCF shafts are required to give access to
these galleries and their depth will be determined by consideration of the
following factors : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the sufficiency of information available on taking the shaft to a certain
depth through its intersections with an adequate number and type of geological
and hydrogeological features of interest; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence that, taking remaining uncertainties into account, a repository
could be developed at the selected horizon that would meet regulatory
requirements.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.64 The RCF shaft sinking provides for the validation of the prior
understanding and associated models which will be developed to underpin the
preliminary view on repository depth, currently put at 650 metres below Ordnance
Datum ('bOD').  Those models will predict the information that will become
available to test this view.  The shaft sinking phase will have programmed into
it a decision point at which the results to date will be evaluated to establish
whether the understanding and models are confirmed.  If so, the RCF galleries
will be developed at the depth previously identified.</P>
<P>6.65 That decision point will provide for an updating of the understanding
and modelling.  The updating could indicate that further information is required
to meet the scientific objectives of adequately validating the models or that a
greater depth is appropriate for the optimisation of the repository.  If so, the
RCF shafts will be developed to the necessary depths.  The maximum depth
currently under consideration for the repository is 900 metres bOD and the
shafts of the RCF would have to be sunk to a depth of 935 metres bOD (to provide
for a sump) if this were found to be the optimised depth of the repository.  The
shafts might also be sunk to investigate depths of up to 900 metres bOD to
provide sufficient information for model validation and a decision on repository
(and hence gallery) horizon which could be at a lesser depth.</P>
<P>6.66 Given the intention to minimise the disturbance of the rock in making
these investigations, it will not be practicable to carry out detailed
investigations from the RCF throughout the PRZ.  Instead, the investigations
must be sufficient, in terms of the representative sampling of the rock mass, to
give a firm understanding of the variability of key geological and
hydrogeological characteristics of the rock mass.  The understanding that is
sought of the variations within the rock mass is to enable the variable
characteristics to be predicted throughout the PRZ on the basis of other
measurements from boreholes and various surveys.  This will allow the required
extrapolation across the rock mass to inform  decisions on repository depth,
location, layout and orientation.
</P>
<P>6.67 An essential role of the RCF in providing this information is to allow
the testing of our ability to carry out the required extrapolation.  This would
involve making predictions of the expected geological and hydrogeological
characteristics on the basis both of previous investigations from the surface
and of targeted drilling underground and then carrying out excavations to test
these predictions.  The finalised location of the repository vaults in the rock
mass would be determined by interpreting the results of targeted drilling from
the RCF.  It is essential to gain confidence from such work in the RCF that, in
any subsequent excavation of a repository, the information from prior
investigations could be utilised successfully to confirm the important
properties of the blocks of rock selected.
</P>
<P> Sealing</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.68"></A>6.68 The sealing requirements for the repository
will be established in an iterative manner by assessment studies.  This process
allows the long-term performance requirement to be established for seals placed
in various features of the repository system.  This in turn translates to the
required properties such as fluidity, durability or hydraulic conductivity (in
set condition) at the time of placing seals.  The achievement of the required
properties relates strongly to the interaction between the materials and the
precise geological setting specific to the site and location.  The features that
are currently considered are as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>flowing fractures intersecting repository vaults (which are assumed not to
be sealed in current models);
</LI>
<LI>large openings such as vaults, tunnels, drifts and shafts;
</LI>
<LI>disturbed zones surrounding excavated openings; and
</LI>
<LI>underground boreholes drilled from the proposed RCF itself.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.69 The requirement is that this work should be carried out in
representative geological settings, and in particular in the BVG at depth where
the levels of in situ stress and rock quality will be appropriate.  Furthermore
the requirement is to allow a long lead-time for the seals to set and to
establish an initial equilibrium in advance of using the results in support of a
performance assessment.  Therefore the validation that sealing requirements can
be met can only be achieved by carrying out work underground in the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="ImpactofRCF"></A><B>7. IMPACT OF THE RCF</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.1"></A>7.1 In taking the decision to apply to develop the
RCF, Nirex has given careful consideration to the potential of the RCF shafts in
particular to affect the post-closure performance of a repository subsequently
located within the PRZ because this is clearly a matter on which Nirex will have
to satisfy the regulators at the appropriate stage of an authorisation procedure
under RSA 93.  Two issues are of particular relevance to these considerations: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the location of the shafts relative to the eventual development of the
repository vaults and accesses; and
</LI>
<LI>the method of excavation and the associated disturbance of the surrounding
rock and hence of its hydrogeological properties.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para7.2"></A>7.2 For both these issues, the potential for effects
on post-closure performance only exists if sealing materials cannot be placed in
the openings and disturbances caused by the excavations to restrict groundwater
flow and to maintain this barrier over long timescales.  This is believed to be
achievable but, because of the site-specific nature of sealing requirements, it
is intended that suitable designs and specifications of seals will be
demonstrated at a later stage of the programme. In order to progress to that
stage, information will be used from a number of sources, including work that is
currently under way in the Nirex Science Programme, relevant work previously
carried out in other international programmes, and work that is proposed to be
undertaken in the RCF.  In the absence of this information the shafts have been
evaluated in scoping studies as if sealed against the flow of groundwater to
only a very low standard, equivalent to a compacted aggregate material.  The
results of these studies have shown no detrimental effect on transport of
radionuclides and on this basis seals have to date not been included in
assessment models.</P>
<P><A NAME="ShaftLocation"></A><B>Location of the Shafts</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.3"></A>7.3 The key concern in respect of the location of the
shafts is the possibility that they would provide a preferential pathway for
groundwater flow that compromises the containment performance of the geosphere. 
Consideration has been given to various issues in this respect :</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">

<TD>the potential for a U-tube groundwater flow system with the shafts

<P>7.4 Consideration of the hydrogeological conditions in the PRZ showed that
the consequences of realising ii. or iii. would not be significantly affected by
the choice of shaft locations.  A pragmatic design solution is available to
address iv. whereby there is sufficient flexibility in the routing of the
inclined drifts that these could be arranged to arrive at the repository in
close proximity to the shaft locations.</P>
<P>7.5 When the RCF was proposed in 1992, a good database was available for
conditions at depth in the vicinity of the cluster of the boreholes into the
PRZ, represented by Boreholes 2, 4 and 5.  This gave no indications of a major
flow channel that might connect with a shaft located at Longlands Farm and
therefore gave confidence that the possibility at i. above was unlikely.  The
drilling of several further boreholes in this location and the interpretation of
more detailed geophysical surveys, as reported by Dr Chaplow in his evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para4.6">paragraphs 4.6</A>), have confirmed this
prognosis.</P>
<P>7.6 The location of the shafts was determined to be in the north-eastern
quadrant of the PRZ because this was interpreted to be upstream in relation to
the overall direction of flow in that location, as reflected by the choice of
cross-section for groundwater flow modelling reported in <I>Nirex 95</I>
(Volume 3, Section 2.1.1, pages 2.2 to 2.3) [COR/522].  The location of the
shafts at Longlands Farm, within the north-eastern quadrant of the PRZ, would
allow sufficient horizontal distance between that location and the north-eastern
boundary of the PRZ, for the inclined drift access envisaged for a repository to
be brought around the shaft location to approach from upstream without going

<P><A NAME="Para7.7"></A>7.7 The main concern in respect of the excavation
methods chosen to develop the RCF is that these will disturb the rock in such a
way as to develop preferential pathways for groundwater flow. The effect of
excavation disturbance on groundwater flows is an important area of study
proposed for the RCF.  At this stage pragmatic assumptions have been made as to
the effects, whereby the hydraulic conductivity of the rock is increased by two
orders of magnitude to a distance into the rock surrounding the excavation
equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation. These are thought to be
conservative assumptions.  Moreover, as I noted in paragraph 6.47 of my
evidence, scoping studies have shown that disturbance on this scale would be
unlikely to impair the performance of the repository and the effects of
disturbance have not been included in assessment models on this basis.</P>
<P>7.8 There is a good body of evidence from previous practice concerning the
extent of excavation disturbance of rocks of different qualities as a function
of key variables such as the diameter of the excavation and the excavation
methods chosen on which to base these assumptions.  When the assumed extent of
the disturbance is combined with the chosen values for the increased hydraulic
conductivity of the BVG within this disturbed zone there is calculated to be no
significant effect on the movement of groundwater from depth to the surface. 
This analysis takes no benefit from any measures that might be taken to reduce
excavation disturbance effects or to seal the disturbed zone subsequently.</P>
<P>7.9 It was originally envisaged that the shaft excavation would require the
freezing of some part or all of the sandstone formations overlying the BVG. 
This would have required the introduction of a large number of drill holes
around the shaft and possible disruption of the rock by freeze-thaw cycling. 
The replacement of this method by one where groundwater control is achieved by
the preferred method of grouting would introduce a major reduction in the
mechanical disturbance that would be caused, albeit that no significant impact
upon groundwater flow was calculated to result.</P>

<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Manager for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex')
having joined the Company in September 1988 on secondment from the former
Central Electricity Generating Board ('CEGB').  I am responsible for evaluations
of long-term repository safety performance of the Sellafield site and for 
advising the Director for Science on co-ordination of the programmes of site
characterisation, research and safety assessment.</P>
<P>1.2 I have been a UK delegate to the Co-ordinating Group for Site Evaluation
and Design of Experiments for Radioactive Waste Disposal of the Radioactive
Waste Management Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development Nuclear Energy Agency since its formation in 1990.  I was elected
its chairman in 1992.
</P>
<P>1.3 I have been a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee to the Swedish
&Auml;sp&ouml; Hard Rock Laboratory programme since 1992.  This committee
consists of senior scientists from academic institutions in Sweden and from the
international waste agencies which are participating in the &Auml;sp&ouml;
programme and is responsible for peer review of the results and planned
experiments.
</P>
<P>1.4 I hold a first-class honours degree in Chemistry from Nottingham
University and a PhD in Inorganic Chemistry, also from Nottingham University.</P>
<P>1.5 Prior to my secondment and subsequent appointment at Nirex, I was
employed by the CEGB.  Between 1971 and 1980 I worked on projects to evaluate
the transport of radioactive materials within power reactor circuits and the
radiological consequences of such transport for workers and public.  Between
1980 and 1985 I supported the CEGB Nuclear Decommissioning Project by
contributing to evaluations of the radiological safety of alternative strategies
for decommissioning CEGB Magnox Reactors.  Between 1985 and 1988 I was
responsible for the design and implementation of the research programme to
support the strategy for the eventual disposal of the CEGB's intermediate-level
radioactive wastes.</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P> <B>Repository Performance at Sellafield</B></P>
<P>2.1 A preliminary assessment, based on results so far, of the post-closure
performance of a repository located in the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at
Sellafield confirms the good promise of the Sellafield site as a potentially
suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater pathway is central to our
considerations of repository safety and requires to be well understood.  If
resolution of identified uncertainties confirms our current understanding of the
groundwater system at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks ('BVG') of the PRZ which would meet
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.2 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield would
result in the physical and chemical containment in the repository of all but a
small fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just
three radionuclides: chlorine&#173;36, iodine-129 and uranium-238 are calculated
to be released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the
peak risk either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>2.3 The assessment presented in my evidence emphasises the understanding
that has been developed of the contribution of the various barriers in the
repository system to the containment of radioactivity in a repository located in
the PRZ at Sellafield.  The evidence identifies the contribution to containment
performance by the engineered and geological barriers.</P>
<P>2.4 Physical containment is afforded in particular by the waste containers
which prevent ready access of groundwater to the wastes.  The results obtained
so far on the corrosion of steels under the conditions that would apply in a
repository at Sellafield show that the rates of corrosion would be expected to
be low and that the steel containers would remain sufficiently intact to result
in containment within the repository of short-lived radionuclides accounting for
the major part (about 99%) of radioactivity in the repository inventory.</P>
<P>2.5 In order to establish and maintain appropriate chemical conditions in a
repository, the space in the vaults around the waste containers will be
backfilled with a cement-based grout developed for the purpose, and known as
Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  On the basis of results obtained so far of test
work and modelling on the performance of this grout, concerning the suppression
of the solubilities of radionuclides in groundwater and sorption of dissolved
radionuclides onto cement surfaces, the chemical conditions established in a
repository at Sellafield would result in the containment in the repository of
most of the long-lived radionuclides in the disposal inventory.  Over 99% of the
residual 1% of long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which
chemical containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH,
is maintained.</P>
<P>2.6 My evidence identifies three important radionuclides that because of
their chemical properties or very long radioactive decay half-lives are not
physically or chemically contained in the repository until they have decayed to
insignificant levels.  These are chlorine-36 and iodine-129, which are
considered to be highly soluble and not subject to a high degree of sorption in
the near field of the repository, and uranium-238 which has a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years.</P>
<P>2.7 Groundwater flow models predict that the path taken by groundwater
leaving the potential repository location leads to a discharge predominantly
into the sediments currently off the coast below the Irish Sea.  In this event
the additional considerable dilution afforded by the sea leads to assessed risks
to an individual at least three orders of magnitude below the target of 10<SUP>-6
</SUP>per year.  However, the extended timescales of thousands of years before
the groundwater returns to the surface may be sufficient for a change in climate
to cause the sea level to drop and the discharge to be to a terrestrial
environment.</P>
<P>2.8 The concentrations in which the radionuclides chlorine-36 and iodine-129
may reach the surface environment are determined by the flow of groundwater
through the repository near field and by the extent of  subsequent dilution of
this volume of water by groundwater in the surrounding host rock and overlying
sedimentary formations.  It is shown that on the basis of results obtained so
far the combination of low groundwater flow in the BVG at Sellafield and the
dilution and dispersion afforded by the flow of groundwater in the overlying
sedimentary formations is likely to give rise to concentrations of these
radionuclides in the surface terrestrial environment consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.9 In the case of uranium-238 the peak in risk from this radionuclide is
considered to occur more than a million years after repository closure and to
result from a daughter radionuclide, radium-226, produced by its radioactive
decay.  On the basis of the results obtained so far, both on the groundwater
system and on the containment afforded to uranium-238 by the engineered barriers
of the repository, the performance of the repository system is likely to give
rise to concentrations of radium-226 in the surface environment consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements. </P>
<P>2.10 On the basis of these results my evidence identifies the key
uncertainties which remain and which need to be addressed to inform two key
decision points in the development of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.11 It is shown that the Rock Characterisation Facility ('RCF') is needed
to provide information to address uncertainties in three main areas:</P>

<P><B> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport</B></P>
<P>2.12 The flow of groundwater into the near field of the repository is highly
dependent upon the description of the networks of connected fractures in the
BVG.  My evidence describes how the integrated activities of observation,
monitoring and testing over extended length scales and in three dimensions only
afforded in the RCF are needed to build sufficient confidence in the calculation
of the flow rate to meet regulatory requirements with respect to post-closure
safety.</P>
<P>2.13 The calculated dilution of the radionuclides transported away from the
repository in groundwater is dependent upon the properties of the flow channels
in key geological formations.  My evidence describes how these flow channels can
be identified and characterised by the integrated activities over extended
length scales and in three dimensions only afforded in the RCF.</P>
<P>2.14 Further key uncertainties are identified in relation to groundwater
flow and radionuclide transport, namely:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the nature and extent of rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> My evidence identifies the unique attributes of the RCF for addressing
these matters.</P>
<P><B> Natural and Induced Changes</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 The key uncertainties that need to be addressed in respect of natural
and induced changes to the geological barrier are identified as :</P>
<UL>
<LI>validation of the stability of the hydrogeological system over extended
timescales;
</LI>
<LI>the effect of excavation disturbance; and
</LI>
<LI>the effect of chemical disturbance (by alkaline near-field groundwater).
</LI></UL>
<P>2.16 Detailed examination in the RCF of the fractures that are components of
the networks of connected fractures should allow the geological history of flow
patterns to be established, particularly by dating the mineralisation that has
occurred in association with flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then
be compared with the present day flow patterns to test whether significant
changes have occurred in the past and may therefore occur in the future.</P>
<P>2.17 The RCF is needed, in advance of the decision whether or not to propose
development of a repository, to validate that the site characteristics are such
that excavation disturbance would not significantly impair the containment
performance of the natural geological barrier.  Excavation of the RCF itself is
the only means by which a measurable disturbance can be created to allow
extrapolation in time and space of the consequences in the post-closure period
of a repository.</P>
<P>2.18 The access to specific features in the rock in the RCF allows testing
of the effects of alkaline near-field groundwater (derived from the cements in
the repository) on groundwater flow and radionuclide transport in the
surrounding host rock.</P>
<P><B> Design and Construction of the Repository</B></P>
<P>2.19 The way in which the RCF permits identification of geological and
hydrogeological features that must be taken into account in refining the
repository design in terms of depth, location, layout and orientation of vaults
within the PRZ is described.</P>
<P>2.20 It is also described how the confidence that various underground
features can be sealed adequately to satisfy regulatory requirements on
post-closure safety is only obtainable by access to representative features and
excavations in the rock mass as afforded by the RCF.
</P>
<P><B> Impact of the RCF</B></P>
<P>2.21 Finally, my evidence notes that the performance of the geosphere
barrier is unlikely to be impaired by the impact of the RCF and that this issue
will require to be considered as an element of any application to the regulatory
authorities for authorisation under RSA93.</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE</B></P>
<P>3.1 The purpose of my evidence is :</P>
<UL>
<LI>to describe the Nirex approach to post-closure performance assessment
(Section 4); 
</LI>
<LI>to present a preliminary analysis of post-closure performance of a
repository at Sellafield (Section 5);
</LI>
<LI>to describe the essential information required from the Rock
Characterisation Facility ('RCF') to resolve remaining uncertainties  in respect
of that performance (Section 6); and
</LI>
<LI>to describe the impact that the RCF may have upon the containment
performance of the geosphere (Section 7).
</LI></UL>
<P>3.2 In Section 5, I describe the current understanding of the performance of
a repository located at Sellafield.  The role of the geosphere, both in ensuring
the successful long-term containment properties of the engineered system and in
diluting residual radionuclides dissolved in groundwater emerging from the
engineered system, is described.</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence in Section 5 reflects the results obtained up to early 1994
on the geology and hydrogeology of the Sellafield site that are important to the
movement of groundwater which could contain radionuclides released from the
repository.  The possible implications for repository performance of the results
that have been obtained since early 1994, as presented in Dr. Chaplow's evidence
(<B>PE/NRX/14</B>, <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">Section 6</A>),
are also considered in Section 5.  This evidence shows why Nirex considers the
Sellafield site as offering good promise as a potentially suitable location for
a repository and, therefore, why it is justified to secure further information
on the site through investigations in the RCF.</P>
<P>3.4 My evidence shows that although the good promise of the site can be
established, there remain key uncertainties which require to be addressed in the
RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether or not to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield.</P>
<P>3.5 The evidence in Section 6 specifies the further information required to
address these key uncertainties which can only be acquired from the RCF.  Dr.
Mellor's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/16</B>, <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE1">Sections
4</A> and <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE2">5</A>) describes how the RCF
needs to be developed and operated to deliver this information.</P>
<P>3.6 My evidence in Section 7 considers the potential for the excavation of
the RCF, and of its shafts in particular, to impact upon the performance of a
repository subsequently located within the Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks
('BVG') of the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at Sellafield.  It shows that
there is a sound basis for the proposed location of the shafts and excavation
methods.</P>
<P><A NAME="Approach"></A><B>4. APPROACH TO POST-CLOSURE PERFORMANCE
ASSESSMENT</B></P>
<P>4.1 This Section describes the approach under development by Nirex to assess
the post-closure performance of a deep geological repository at Sellafield.  The
term 'post-closure' refers to the period from the end of repository operations
when, all the repository vaults having been filled with packaged wastes, the
accesses to the repository are backfilled and sealed.  'Assessment' is the
identification and modelling of the processes and pathways by which
radionuclides from the repository may subsequently return to the biosphere and
to people.</P>
<P>4.2 Performance assessment makes extensive use of models.  Development of
assessment models has been built around three major pathways for the possible
return of radionuclides to the biosphere and to people :</P>
<UL>
<LI>transport of radionuclides in groundwater;
</LI>
<LI>migration of radionuclides in gases; and
</LI>
<LI>return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of natural
disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.
</LI></UL>
<P> For a repository at Sellafield the most important pathway, in radiological
terms, is the groundwater pathway.  This is because each of the various
radionuclides in the wastes might be transported in groundwater whereas only a
small number could be transported as a gas.  Also the transport of radionuclides
by the groundwater pathway generally provides the framework for considering the
effect of natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion, except in
the low probability scenarios of direct return of the contents of the repository
by such means.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterPathway"></A><B> Groundwater Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 When the repository is first closed, it will
contain air (for example in the pores of the cements used to immobilise the
wastes, and in any unfilled spaces within the repository) which will, in time,
be displaced by inflowing groundwater.  Thereafter, subject to the performance
of the engineered barriers of the repository, radionuclides will eventually
dissolve or disperse in the water and be available to move into the surrounding
rock.  The extent to which the radionuclides come into contact with water, the
extent to which they dissolve and their ability to move with the groundwater
will each be controlled by the physical and chemical conditions in the
engineered barriers of the repository.</P>
<P>4.4 The engineered barriers are designed to contain as much of the
radioactivity as is reasonably practicable.  This is achieved by providing
physical containment barriers to movement of radionuclides, which are expected
to operate for at least one thousand years after repository closure in respect
of waste packages containing most of the radioactivity, and chemical
containment, operating over a period of around one million years, which will
limit the solubilities, and provide sorption, of radionuclides in groundwater
moving through the repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.5"></A>4.5 The levels of the radiological effects of any
radionuclides that are not contained by the engineered barriers and which reach
the surface in groundwater will be determined largely by the concentrations of
the radionuclides in solution.  The limitation of radionuclide solubilities and
the slow release of groundwater from the repository are of great importance
because they determine the extent to which further reductions in concentrations
must occur, through processes of retardation, spreading and dilution in the
geosphere, for the repository system to be acceptably safe.</P>
<P>4.6 Once the radionuclides in the groundwater have passed from the
repository into the successive layers of surrounding rocks, their rates of
transport to the surface will be determined by the path taken by groundwater
flow through the rocks, the time taken for water to travel along this path, and
by various physical and chemical processes that lead to retardation and
spreading.  The groundwater from the repository will mix with groundwater in the
surrounding rocks leading to dilution of the dissolved levels of radionuclides. 
The extent of dilution will not be determined solely by the amount of
groundwater flowing through the overlying rocks, relative to that flowing
through the repository.  The spreading in space and time of the transport of
repository-derived radionuclides in groundwater through each rock layer will
increase the dilution afforded by their mixing with larger volumes of water in
the succeeding rock layer.</P>
<P>4.7 Eventually groundwater containing repository-derived radionuclides will
reach shallow regions of the rock, which may be considered to be at the boundary
with the biosphere.  On crossing this boundary and entering the biosphere
further dilution, retardation or dispersion can occur by mixing with surface
water (streams, lakes and the sea) or soils.  Radionuclides could become
available for uptake by people by their entering the food-chain, by their
consumption in drinking water or by their inhalation in dust particles.</P>
<P>4.8 The concentrations of radionuclides, both in the groundwater pathway at
its various stages of returning radionuclides to the surface and in the
components of the biosphere, can be calculated on the basis of an understanding
of the controlling physical, chemical and biological processes.  The need is to
calculate the potential uptake of radionuclides by people, living now or in the
future, as a function of time.  From a knowledge of the uptake of radionuclides
through the various potential routes available, a total radiological annual
'dose' to hypothetical individuals can be calculated. This is subsequently
converted to 'annual individual risk' using a dose to risk conversion factor of
0.06 per Sievert.
</P>
<P>4.9 The times of the emergence of radionuclides in the biosphere and their
concentrations will vary according to the controlling physical and chemical
processes relevant to each radionuclide.  The maximum concentrations of
individual radionuclides returning to the biosphere will not coincide in time
unless they have very similar physical and chemical properties.  The total risk
and the contributions of individual radionuclides are typically presented in
graphs of annual radiological risk to an individual through time.  The peak
values shown on these graphs may be compared with the radiological risk target
announced by the Government in its
<I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, Final Conclusions, Cm 2919,
July 1995</I> (<I>&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)
</I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208].  At the current stage of the project,
calculations of risk are viewed as the best means of informing a judgment about
the safety of a facility, in line with the statement in <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I>.  However, it is recognised that in the future other technical
factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature, will also need to be
considered in arriving at the decision.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentModels"></A><B>Assessment Models</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.10"></A>4.10 The top-level tool used by Nirex for
calculating radiological risk from the groundwater pathway is the computer
program called MASCOT and its associated output processor MOP.  MASCOT has been
developed to carry out probabilistic safety assessments, in line with practice
in other countries, for evaluating the safety of radioactive waste disposal
systems.  It takes proper account of the uncertainties associated with the
values of important parameters which influence system performance.  It employs
the 'Monte Carlo' method in which repeated calculations of system behaviour are
made using random sampling from specified probability density functions of the
model parameters which are subject to uncertainty.  The results provide
estimates of the mean and distribution of calculated doses and associated risks.</P>
<P>4.11 MASCOT comprises sub-models describing the behaviour of the sub-systems
of the overall repository system.  These are designed to model the various
processes involved in release of radionuclides from waste packages, their
mobilisation and migration from repository vaults, transport through the
geosphere and biosphere and consequent doses and risks to individuals.  Input
information for sub-models is derived from a variety of sources, including the
output from more detailed models of the system, as described below.</P>
<P> Source Term Model</P>
<P>4.12 The &quot;source term&quot; model describes the behaviour of
radionuclides in the repository vaults and calculates the rate of  their release
as solutes in flowing groundwater. Sub-models are used to represent different
sections of the repository with different characteristics.  The key processes
considered are physical containment by the waste package, radioactive decay and
ingrowth of decay products, solubility limitation, and sorption onto the vault
backfill.  The source term model is supported by a number of research models,
such as RARECAN, CRACK 2, CHEQMATE and HARPHRQ, which address the key physical
and chemical processes in more detail.  The MASCOT source term  model calculates
the concentration of radionuclides in solution in the near-field groundwater as
a function of time.  (The near field of the repository is the part of the system
comprising the waste packages, the backfill surrounding the packages and the
seals used to close off the vaults.  The near-field groundwater is the water
within the porous structure of the backfill.)  The near-field groundwater is
available for transport into the geosphere at a rate dependent on the
groundwater flow through the repository.  (This is usually measured as the
volume in m<SUP>3</SUP> per year of groundwater flowing through the repository
volume.)</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport Through the Geosphere
</P>
<P>4.13 The geosphere sub-models describe the behaviour of radionuclides as
they are transported in groundwater flowing through the geosphere.  The primary
groundwater flow system through fractured rock, such as the BVG, comprises a
network of connected fractures which can be represented on a number of scales.
On the regional  scale - tens of square kilometres - effective properties of the
BVG and surrounding rocks are modelled using a continuum approximation to the
flow system utilising the program NAMMU.  At a repository local scale - of order
ten square kilometres - a more detailed fracture flow model, NAPSAC, is
employed.</P>
<P>4.14 Both NAMMU and NAPSAC permit multi-dimensional groundwater flow
calculations and are used to provide values of the flow of groundwater through
the repository, and of the groundwater flow path lengths and transit times
across each of the hydrogeological units in the flow path.  The groundwater flow
through the repository is measured in cubic metres per year through the full
volume of the engineered repository openings of approximately one million cubic
metres.  It must be assessed reliably because it is an important input to the
source term sub-model in MASCOT.  In addition, geosphere flow-path lengths and
water transit times are required for the geosphere transport sub-models in
MASCOT.</P>
<P>4.15 The transport sub-models within MASCOT calculate radionuclide transport
through different parts of the geosphere taking account of radionuclide decay
and ingrowth, advection, diffusion, hydrodynamic dispersion, and retardation by
sorption.  In addition, radionuclide transport can be retarded by diffusing into
the pore space in the rock matrix.</P>
<P> Biosphere</P>
<P>4.16 The biosphere sub-models of MASCOT are essentially a series of
flux-to-dose rate conversion factors which enable the geosphere calculations of
time-dependent radionuclide fluxes into the biosphere to be converted into doses
and risks to individuals.  For most radionuclides a compartment model, BIOS,
developed by the National Radiological Protection Board, is used to simulate the
processes contributing to radionuclide transport and accumulation in terrestrial
and marine environments.  However, for some key radionuclides  (chlorine-36,
iodine-129 and uranium-238 and its daughters) a heterogeneous resource area
model has been developed to permit a more detailed representation of the
behaviour of the radionuclides in the biosphere.  The development of this model
has been guided by a more physically realistic catchment model generated by the
computer code SHETRAN-UK which has been developed by Nirex, in conjunction with
the Water Resources Systems Research Unit at the University of Newcastle.  An
integral part of the biosphere modelling is definition of critical groups. 
These are defined as being representative of those members of the assumed future
communities that incur the largest annual Effective Dose from radionuclides
present in the environment.  The calculations of Effective Dose make use of
models developed through the International Commission on Radiological Protection
so that potential health risks to individuals can be calculated.  Given the
timescale over which releases are calculated to occur, significant changes in
the climate are projected to arise as a result of glacial cycling:  sea levels
and human behaviour are predicted to change accordingly.  Critical group
behaviour is defined on the basis of the behaviour of existing communities in
regions of the world which currently have analogous climate states.  Many
potential exposure routes are addressed, ranging from human consumption of
contaminated water through to complex food-chain pathways.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentCycels"></A><B> Assessment Cycles</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.17"></A>4.17 The key steps in assessment of the post-closure
performance of a repository will be repeated several times before a decision is
sought from the regulatory authorities to approve the start of disposal
operations in a repository, following its construction and commissioning.  This
iterative process is known as the 'assessment cycle' as described in <I>Nirex
Report 525, Scientific Update 1993, December 1993 </I>(sub-section 5.2, pages 30
to 31) [COR/505].
</P>
<P>4.18 One important function of an assessment is to calculate system
performance for comparison with regulatory requirements to judge whether or not
the system under assessment has the potential to meet them.  A major,
complementary output is a clearer understanding of the issues that are important
to system performance.  Identification of those issues helps to identify
priorities for further data acquisition, on waste or site characteristics for
example, for model development, and for refinement of repository design.</P>
<P>4.19 The presentation, in Section 5 of my evidence, of preliminary results
on the post-closure performance of a repository located in the PRZ at Sellafield
is intended to show our current understanding of the important issues.  This
understanding will develop and become more complete as assessment cycles are
conducted in the future.</P>
<P><A NAME="RepositoryPerformance"></A><B>5. REPOSITORY PERFORMANCE AT
SELLAFIELD</B></P>
<P>5.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the calculated
performance of the engineered and natural barriers to radionuclide transport
afforded by a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield.  The
natural barrier provided by the rocks surrounding the repository is of
particular importance as this must ensure that the required chemical conditions
can be maintained in the near field of the repository to contain most of the
radioactivity, and that any residual long-lived radionuclides that are not
contained in this way do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.
</P>
<P>5.2 My evidence identifies the key characteristics of the Sellafield site
which bear on assessment of the post-closure performance of the repository
system.  It is shown that the information and results from the Science Programme
so far suggest the Sellafield site holds good promise as a potentially suitable
location for a repository, but there are uncertainties which need to be
addressed before a decision is taken on whether to propose development of a
repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="DisposalInventory"></A><B>Disposal Inventory</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 The current planning basis for the repository is
that it will receive for disposal 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid, packaged
intermediate-level radioactive wastes and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid,
packaged low-level radioactive wastes up to the year 2060.  The radionuclide
content of this total volume of 400,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of wastes is referred to
as the &quot;disposal inventory&quot; and information on this content and the
content of associated materials that may affect repository performance is taken
from information compiled jointly by the Department of the Environment and Nirex
on radioactive waste arising in the UK (<I>DOE/RAS/92.010, UK Nirex Report No.
284, The United Kingdom Radioactive Waste Inventory, November 1992 (&quot;the
1991 National Inventory&quot;</I>) [COR/520].) (See also:<I> DOE/RAS/92.011, UK
Nirex Report No. 285, The Radionuclide Content of UK Radioactive Wastes,
November 1992; and DOE/RAS/92.012, UK Nirex Report No. 286, The Physical and
Chemical Characteristics of UK Radioactive Wastes, November 1992, </I>which are
referred to as sources of information.)</P>
<P>5.4 The disposal inventory may be sub-divided into two broad categories of
radionuclides according to their radioactive decay half-lives.  Much of the
disposal inventory is comprised of relatively short-lived 'fission products'
such as strontium-90 and caesium-137 or 'neutron activation products' such as 
nickel-63, having radioactive decay half-lives of around 100 years or less. 
(Fission products are the result of the nuclear fission of elements such as
uranium or plutonium, as used in the fuels of nuclear reactors.  Neutron
activation products result most commonly from the capture of neutrons by stable
atomic nuclei, to create unstable nuclei which subsequently undergo radioactive
decay). </P>
<P>5.5 The second category comprises radionuclides having radioactive decay
half-lives from hundreds to millions of years.  Many of these are heavy metal
elements such as plutonium, which are very insoluble in the alkaline and
chemically reducing ('low Eh') near-field conditions.  These long-lived
radionuclides include three having radioactive decay half-lives, of hundreds of
thousands of years or more, which prove to be of great importance to the
calculated performance of the deep repository.  These are chlorine-36 with a
half-life of 300,000 years; iodine-129 with a half-life of over 15 million
years; and uranium-238 with a half-life approaching 4,500 million years.  In
order to understand the results of risk calculations reported in this Proof of
Evidence, it is helpful to note that a 'daughter' radionuclide, radium-226,
produced by the decay of the uranium-238 'parent' is of much greater
radiological significance than the uranium-238 itself.</P>
<P> Key Radionuclides</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.6"></A>5.6 The more important radionuclides in terms of
their radioactivity content and relevance to the safety of disposal are listed
in order of atomic number and according to radioactive decay half-life in
<A HREF="#Table5.1">Table 5.1</A>.  The sources of the three radionuclides
found to be of greatest importance are outlined in rather more detail in the
following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.7 Chlorine-36 derives principally from neutron activation of naturally
occurring chlorine, which is present as a trace impurity in various materials in
nuclear reactors.   Accordingly it is likely to be present in small quantities
in many waste streams.  Seven waste streams have been identified as the main
sources of the radionuclide.  They contribute about 65% of the total 16.6 TBq of
chlorine-36 in the disposal inventory and have a volume of about 50,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.
 Because of the significance of this radionuclide in evaluations of repository
post-closure performance, it is considered important to take account of
uncertainties in the quantities present in the disposal inventory, as reported
in <I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table 6.3, page 6.25) [COR/522].  The value of
16.6 TBq is the central case determined for that exercise.</P>
<P>5.8 Iodine-129 derives from nuclear fission and it will be present in small
quantities in a wide range of wastes.  However, four waste streams contribute
about 50% of the projected total of 0.92 TBq, having a total volume of about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.9 Uranium-238 is a major constituent of reactor fuel and will be present
in small quantities in a wide range of wastes.  Seven waste streams contribute
about 55% of the total 36 TBq, having a total volume of about 37,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P> Packaging</P>
<P>5.10 Intermediate-level wastes intended for disposal will be immobilised
within packages to produce the 'wasteform'.  Most intermediate-level wastes will
be packaged as unshielded wasteforms.  Standard unshielded intermediate-level
waste containers are predominantly drums or boxes fabricated from stainless
steel, or in some cases carbon steel.  The 0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> capacity drum is
the most commonly used container and larger drums or boxes typically have a
capacity of 3 m<SUP>3</SUP>.  The waste is immobilised within the container,
typically using a cement-based grout to produce a solid wasteform.  The
principal waste packages for shielded intermediate-level wasteforms are concrete
boxes, having a length of approximately four metres, in which the waste is again
immobilised  in a cement-based grout.</P>
<P>5.11 Low-level wastes make a very small contribution to the radioactivity
content in the disposal inventory (less than one part in 10,000).  Typically
they will be packaged into carbon steel boxes, having a length of approximately
four metres.  It is currently envisaged that the waste will not be immobilised
within the container.</P>
<P><A NAME="PhysicalContainment"></A><B>Physical Containment</B></P>
<P>5.12 Physical containment features include the initial prevention of access
of groundwater to the radionuclides in the wastes and subsequent limitation of
the movement of groundwater containing dissolved radionuclides away from them. 
The principal factor contributing to physical containment is the integrity of
the waste containers.  Other contributions are obtained from the inaccessibility
of radionuclides in the wastes themselves, for example where their release
requires the complete corrosion of large steel components, and from the
limitation of movement of dissolved radionuclides by diffusion through the
immobilising grout inside the containers.
</P>
<P>5.13 More than 99% of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory will be
present in the unshielded wasteforms contained in drums or boxes made of
stainless or carbon steel.  The resistance of these steel containers to
corrosion under repository conditions is therefore important to the physical
containment of radionuclides.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.14"></A>5.14 The general corrosion of steels is reduced by
the presence of an alkaline water chemistry.  This is an important benefit of
surrounding the waste containers by Nirex Reference Vault Backfill which is
designed to maintain water in its pores at a high pH (where high pH is an
alkaline condition, low pH an acid condition). Corrosion is also very slow under
the anaerobic conditions that will prevail in the repository after the initial
volume of air has been displaced by inflowing groundwater and any residual
oxygen in the water has been consumed by aerobic corrosion.</P>
<P>5.15 Under anaerobic conditions, steels are subject to corrosion which
affects the entire surface of the metal, rather than at localised points. 
Typical results obtained from long-term research work carried out under
deliberately extreme conditions of temperature (up to the maximum of 80C that
might be reached for a short period of time in the repository) and
representative conditions of water chemistry in the engineered barrier system of
a repository at Sellafield show that the corrosion rate will be less than one
micron per year.  Using these and other data obtained from the research
programme the average time for a metal container to be corroded through has been
calculated to range from 9,000 to 16,000 years for the case of a stainless steel
0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> drum, as reported in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/011, Nirex
Safety Assessment Research Programme, Nirex Near-Field Research: Report on
Current Status in 1994, July 1995 </I>(Sub-section &quot;Container Lifetime

<P>5.16 Research has been carried out to determine the effects on physical
containment of the engineered gas vent in some designs of waste container and of
localised corrosion which can affect carbon steels under the initially aerobic
conditions in the repository.  In these cases, there is no significant loss of
containment even if saturation by water were established through the resulting
small penetrations of the container.  The release of radionuclides from the
wasteform to the backfill outside the container is limited by the low rates of
diffusion through the immobilising grout surrounding the waste.</P>
<P>5.17 The decay of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory is shown as a
function of time in <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.  This shows that more
than 95% of the radioactivity would be decayed after 300 years.  It also shows
that if physical containment is conservatively assumed to operate for one
thousand years, the major part of the radioactivity (about 99%) would decay
while contained within the physical barriers afforded by a repository under the
conditions found at Sellafield.  The major contribution to this containment is
the corrosion resistance of the steel containers in the water chemistry of
Sellafield groundwater conditioned to high pH in the pores of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill.</P>
<P> <A NAME="ChemicalContainment"></A><B>Chemical Containment</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.18"></A>5.18 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill surrounding
the emplaced waste containers in the disposal vaults has been carefully
specified to fulfil a number of requirements, namely :</P>
<UL>
<LI>long term maintenance of alkaline porewater chemistry in order to maintain
low dissolved concentrations of key radionuclides under the prevailing
conditions of groundwater flow and geochemistry;
</LI>
<LI>long-term maintenance of a high active-surface-area for sorption of key
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>relatively high permeability and porosity both to ensure homogeneous
performance (so that localised concentrations of materials in wastes do not
exhaust the desired chemical conditioning and thereby locally reduce the
containment performance) and to permit the escape of gas generated by chemical
reactions in the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.19 Two important effects to be taken into account in assessing the
performance at Sellafield of the chemical barrier provided by the backfill are :</P>
<UL>
<LI>leaching of reactive components by groundwater flow; and
</LI>
<LI>reactions with groundwater constituents
</LI></UL>
<P>These are each discussed in the following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.20 Under the chemically reducing ('low Eh') conditions of the repository,
the solubilities in water of several important radioelements such as plutonium
can be reduced to extremely low values (10<SUP>-7</SUP> mols m <SUP>-3</SUP>
in the case of plutonium) at pH values of between 9 and 10. The solubilities
typically remain at these low levels at any higher pH values that may be
realised in the repository.  Accordingly, the chemical conditioning performance
sought from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill in respect of reduction of
solubility is to maintain a pH above 10 for the period of time during which the
relevant radionuclides will decay to insignificant levels.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.21"></A>5.21 The maintenance of the porewater of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill at a pH value above 10 is achieved by the dissolving
into the groundwater of calcium hydroxide which is present in the cement and
lime constituents of the backfill.  The required pH will be maintained until
this supply of calcium hydroxide has been exhausted.   For a given length of
flow path through a repository vault, containing a given amount of backfill, the
rate of removal of calcium hydroxide is determined by the groundwater flow.  For
the proposed volume of about 80,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of backfill in a typical
repository vault having dimensions 550 metres long, 23.5 metres wide and a waste
stack height of 12 metres, and for a groundwater flow through the repository of
140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year    - as calculated in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3,
Sub-Section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522] from the hydrogeological data for the
Sellafield site - simple calculation shows that the pH would be maintained at a
value of greater than 10 for many millions of years.</P>
<P>5.22 It is important to understand whether the pH could be reduced more
rapidly than implied by this simple calculation.  This could occur in parts of
the repository by concentration of groundwater flows through localised
conductive features in the rock, leaving other parts of the repository with a
correspondingly longer period at high pH.  From the information presented on
groundwater compositions in <I>Nirex Report 524, The Geology and Hydrogeology
of the Sellafield Area : Interim Assessment : December 1993 </I>(Volume 3,
Tables 3.4, 3.5 and 3.7) [COR/517], it is also possible to identify a number of
dissolved chemicals present at depth in the PRZ at Sellafield which are reactive
towards cements.  All of these are taken into account, alongside similar
reactive chemicals in the wastes themselves or which would result from their
eventual breakdown, in calculating the period of time for which a high pH would
be maintained.  The results obtained so far allow us to assume conservatively
that the required pH value of 10 or more would be maintained throughout the
repository for one million years.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.23"></A>5.23 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill was designed
to afford a large surface area in its pore structure for the sorption of
radionuclides from solution in the groundwater.  The value measured for pore
surface area of 2.8 x 10<SUP>4</SUP> m<SUP>2</SUP> per kilogram of material is
highly favourable in this respect.  It is recognised that some chemical
reactions could block off parts of the porous structure of the backfill material
or that cracks could develop in the backfill and the crack surfaces become
altered to give less sorption.  None of the experimental work carried out using
synthesised Sellafield groundwater and related modelling work has indicated any
significant adverse effects.  However, in current safety assessment studies, the
sorption capacity has been reduced from the high values observed in experiments,
to take account of uncertainties in this respect.</P>
<P>5.24 A convenient way of reflecting the physical and chemical containment
afforded by the engineered barriers in the repository concept is to draw a graph
of the &quot;fractional release&quot; of a radionuclide of interest as a
function of time.  The fractional release is that fraction of the total amount
of the radionuclide in the initial disposal inventory that would be found in the
geosphere at a given time.  Its calculation takes account of release of the
radionuclide from the engineered system of the repository and also of depletion
of the radionuclide by radioactive decay.  Low values of fractional release
indicate a good containment performance by the engineered barriers.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.25"></A>5.25 <A HREF="#Figure5.2">Figure 5.2</A> shows the
benefit of chemical containment by reduction of solubility, by sorption and by
the combination of the two processes in the near field in terms of the
fractional release to the geosphere from the disposal inventory of
plutonium-239.  It can be seen that the chemical containment performance that
would be afforded by the action of the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill within the
groundwater system in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield is calculated to limit
the fractional release of plutonium-239 to approximately one part in two
thousand.  This explains why, in assessment studies of the post-closure
performance of the total repository system,  plutonium-239 is found to return to
the surface environment in such low concentrations as to make no significant
contribution to radiological risk, as shown in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table
6.18, page 6.36)<I> </I>[COR/522].</P>
<P>5.26 Calculations of fractional releases for longer-lived radionuclides than
plutonium-239 show that the chemical containment significantly limits their
fractional release for very long periods of time (beyond one million years in
the case of uranium-238.)  A period of one million years, conservatively taken
as the duration for the operation of chemical containment in a repository
located in the PRZ at Sellafield, is marked on <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.
 This shows that over 99% of the residual 1% of radioactivity present in
long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which chemical
containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH, is
maintained.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalBarrier"></A><B> Natural Barrier</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.27"></A>5.27 On the basis of the evidence that I have
presented thus far, the natural barrier afforded by the BVG rocks in the PRZ at
Sellafield would ensure a low fractional release, that is radiologically
insignificant, of all but a small number of the longest-lived radionuclides, as
a result of the physical and chemical containment by the engineered barriers of
the repository in that location.  In the case of uranium-238, having a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years,  the release to the geosphere would be limited
for over a million years by the low solubility in the high pH water in the
repository and sorption onto cement phases.  However, two long-lived
radionuclides, chlorine-36 and iodine-129, do not have the metallic character in
their solution behaviour that leads to reduction of solubility in alkali
solution, and in experimental work to date have been found not to sorb strongly
to cement phases or geological minerals.  Accordingly the behaviour of these
radionuclides is modelled by assuming high solubilities and no retardation by
sorption in the flow of groundwater from depth to the surface.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.28"></A>5.28 The further important role of the natural
barrier, identified at the start of this section of my Proof of Evidence is to
ensure that residual long-lived radionuclides that are not physically and
chemically contained by the engineered barriers, representing around 0.01% of
the initial radioactivity, do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.  This requires that the dissolved levels of radionuclides will be
sufficiently diluted to low concentrations in the groundwater eventually
carrying them to the surface.</P>
<P>5.29 The extent of dilution is determined by :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the quantity of water flowing in the near-surface rocks, into which
groundwater bearing radionuclides from the repository moves;
</LI>
<LI>the area of near-surface rocks into which groundwater bearing radionuclides
moves : the greater the area the larger the volume of water for dilution
(spreading in space); and
</LI>
<LI>the time over which the radionuclides are released into the near-surface
groundwater system.  The spreading in time arises from the rate at which they
are released from the repository (determined by flow of groundwater through the
repository and the repository porewater concentrations determined by the
physical and chemical barriers) and spreading in time during passage through the
geosphere due to processes such as dispersion, sorption and rock matrix
diffusion.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.30 A further dilution is afforded if the discharge of groundwater from the
geosphere occurs into surface water in the biosphere - in the form of streams,
lakes or the sea - before becoming accessible to people.</P>
<P>5.31 For a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, the
release from the repository of radionuclides such as uranium-238 can extend to
over a million years as a result of solubility and sorption control in the
engineered barriers and of the relatively low groundwater flow through the
repository of 140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year, as given at paragraph 5.21 of my
evidence.  Even for those radionuclides such as chlorine-36 and iodine-129 that
may not be subject to solubility and sorption control, it would take more than a
thousand years to flush the radionuclides out of the repository in a flow of 140
m<SUP>3</SUP> per year.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.32"></A>5.32 The principal source of dilution by mixing of
repository-derived groundwater with groundwater in overlying rocks is provided
at Sellafield by the Calder Sandstone.  A simple calculation is carried out in<I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3,<I> </I>Sub&#173;section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522].  It shows<I></I>that
dilution by a factor of about 600 would be achieved by assuming direct mixing of
the flow of groundwater through the repository with the flow of groundwater
discharging through an area equivalent to the plan area of the repository to
surface from the Calder Sandstone.  For the radionuclides chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 the spreading in time resulting from the short duration of the source
term compared to the geosphere travel time gives a greater dilution factor of
about 2,000.</P>
<P>5.33 As concluded in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 9.1, page 9.2)
[COR/522] the groundwater flow models used in the reported assessment studies
predict that groundwater flow from a repository located in the PRZ to the
surface environment will emerge predominantly at the bed of the eastern edge of
the Irish Sea.  If sea levels were to remain as at present, the discharge at
this location would be subject to a further and considerable dilution by sea
water.  As a consequence of these successive dilutions, the annual radiological
risk to an individual for discharge of all radionuclides to the marine
environment is assessed to be at least three orders of magnitude below the
target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>.
</P>
<P>5.34 This annual risk to an individual is an output from the models that I
described in Section 4 of my evidence.  The computed mean value of risk is
plotted on a graph as a function of time.  It is a mean value because of the use
of probabilistic safety assessment methods in which the calculations are
repeated a number of times, corresponding to the sampling of the allowed ranges
of values for input parameters, and an arithmetic mean is taken of the resulting
values for risk.  The appropriate graph showing the base-case calculation of
risk from marine discharge in a Temperate (as current) climate is produced as
<A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>,  after<I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Figure
6.6) [COR/522].</P>
<P>5.35 Under present conditions at Sellafield, a small proportion of the
discharge might occur to the terrestrial environment in association with incised
river beds.  Furthermore, the time taken for emergence into the sea bed would be
such that the sea level could possibly be lower as a consequence of climate
change, possibly placing the whole of the discharge in a terrestrial
environment.
</P>
<P>5.36 Three further curves are presented in <A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>
for a terrestrial discharge under three different biosphere states,
corresponding to Temperate, Periglacial and Boreal climates.  On the basis of
current understanding of global climate patterns, Temperate or warmer conditions
are expected to persist at Sellafield for several thousand years.  Beyond that
time period, colder Boreal or Periglacial conditions need to be considered.  For
the purpose of model calculations, each climate state is assumed to persist over
the full period evaluated.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.37"></A>5.37 The Boreal climate state will be associated
with a lower sea level than the current sea level.  Discharge is therefore
likely to be terrestrial.  The peak annual  individual risks in the Boreal
terrestrial state are 1.1 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at twenty thousand years after
repository closure and 3.3 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at four million years after
closure.  In all calculations for discharges to a terrestrial environment, the
maximum of the risk curve occurring at about twenty thousand years is
attributable mainly to chlorine-36 (with iodine-129 making a contribution of
around 4%), and that after more than a million years is attributable to the
daughter radionuclides of uranium-238, in particular radium-226.  Chlorine-36 is
effectively transported to the surface at the same rate as the water in which it
is dissolved and the peak at about twenty thousand years corresponds to the most
probable value of calculated groundwater return time.  The most significant
component of the calculated risk is from radionuclides entering the food chain,
particularly through milk derived from pasture-grazing cows.</P>
<P>5.38 Simple scoping studies were carried out to allow calculations of risk
for 'agricultural wells' in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 6.7, pages
6.18 to 6.20) [COR/522].  The preliminary estimate of peak annual individual
risk is 1.7 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP> on the basis of an assessment for chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 only : these radionuclides are expected to dominate risk in the
period before 10<SUP>5</SUP> years.  It is found that iodine-129 is the major
contributor.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.39"></A>5.39 As noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522], further
refinement of the assessment methodology will produce a better view of risk from
agricultural wells.  As for all the results in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522], the
calculations for agricultural wells reflect a reference repository design rather
than an optimised system.  If necessary, there is scope for taking specific
waste emplacement and repository design measures to reduce the risks as part of
the optimisation process which ensures that releases are as low as reasonably
practicable.  In the case of iodine-129, which is the main contributor to the
risk, 50% of the inventory is contained in a limited volume of waste, about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>, as stated in paragraph 5.8.  For such relatively small volumes
of waste, there is flexibility to develop specific measures, which might be
impractical for larger volumes of waste.</P>
<P>5.40. A number of variant calculations were reported in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume
3, Section 7, pages 7.1 to 7.18) [COR/522].  These showed that the risks
calculated to arise from a repository at Sellafield were not greatly changed as
a result of changes in the spreading time for radionuclide transport in the
geosphere if the duration of their release from the repository remains constant
(that duration is inversely proportional to the groundwater flow through the
repository.)  Similarly, the system is robust to changes in the duration of the
release if the spreading time in the geosphere remains constant.  It is only if
the duration of the release and the spreading time in the geosphere both have
values significantly lower than currently calculated that annual individual
radiological risks in excess of the target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP> were calculated
in <I>Nirex 95</I> (Volume 3, Figure 8.8) [COR/522] to arise from natural
discharges to the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="GasPathway"></A><B>Gas Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.41"></A>5.41 The gas pathway refers to the migration of
radionuclides in gaseous form from the repository to the surface environment. 
The most radiologically significant processes have been calculated to involve
the incorporation of carbon-14 from the disposal inventory in methane generated
from microbiological degradation of wastes in the repository and the subsequent
entry of this methane into the food chain, as noted in <I>Nirex Science Report
S/94/003, Post-closure Performance Assessment: Gas Generation and Migration,
November 1994 (&quot;Nirex Report S/94/003&quot;) </I>(Section 4.1, page 20)
[COR/509].
</P>
<P>5.42 The carbon-14 inventory of 2,600 TBq represents less than 0.1% of the
total disposal inventory.  Scoping calculations have been carried out making the
following simplifications that are believed to be highly conservative :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>all the carbon-14 in wastes that contain biodegradable material is
converted to gas;
</LI>
<LI>maximum rates of methane generation are achieved simultaneously in waste
packages throughout the repository;
</LI>
<LI>all the gas generated in the repository is transported instantaneously from
the repository to the surface and therefore no radioactive decay occurs; and
</LI>
<LI>the gas does not spread out in the geosphere to emerge in the surface soils
over a larger area than the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> This leads to fluxes of carbon-14 in methane entering the biosphere that
are equivalent to annual risks to an individual of about 10<SUP>-7</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.43 Work is also under way in the Nirex Safety Assessment Research
Programme ('NSARP') to study the possible significance of gas-water interactions
on radionuclide transport.  As noted in <I>Nirex Report S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section
3.3, page 16) [COR/509] much of the required information is now available but
the RCF is intended to enable some of the required site-specific data to be
acquired.
</P>
<P><A NAME="DisruptiveEvents"></A><B>Natural Disruptive Events and
Inadvertent Human Intrusion
</B></P>
<P>5.44 As discussed in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/004, Post-closure
Performance Assessment, Human Intrusion and Natural Disruptive Events, July 1995
(&quot;Nirex Report S/95/004&quot;) </I>(Sub-section 3.2, pages 12 and 13;
Section 5, page 16) [NRX/15/2], the location of a repository in the BVG at
Sellafield is likely<I></I>to afford a high level of isolation of the wastes
from the effects of natural disruptive events, such as erosion and seismicity,
and inadvertent human intrusion.</P>
<P>5.45 The principal form of inadvertent human intrusion considered to date
has involved the radiological exposure of geotechnical workers or surface
inhabitants as a result of inadvertent drilling of boreholes into the repository
at some time in the future, when records of its existence may no longer exist. 
In terms of the relevant characteristics - the dimensions of a repository vault
cross-section and the inventory of heavy metal radionuclides - the current
repository concept correlates quite closely with that assessed for the human
intrusion scenario for a repository in the PRZ at Sellafield in <I>PERA </I>(paragraphs
5.6.11 to 5.6.14, pages 36 and 37) [COR/501].  A peak annual individual risk
from intrusion of less than 10<SUP>-8</SUP> was given in Table 5.2 of that
report.  <I>Nirex Report S/95/004 </I>(Sub-section 3.1, pages 9 to 12)
[NRX/15/2]<I>  </I>updates the information on mineral resources in the
Sellafield location on the basis of the extensive investigations carried out by
Nirex.  There has been no finding of a significant new resource that would
suggest a higher incidence of drilling than assumed in <I>PERA</I> [COR/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="PotentialSuitabiltiy"></A><B>Potential Suitability of Sellafield
as a Location for a Repository
</B></P>
<P>5.46 The analysis I have presented above confirms the good promise of
Sellafield as a potentially suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater
pathway is central to our considerations of repository safety and therefore
requires to be well understood.  If resolution of uncertainties, as identified
in Section 6 below, confirms our current understanding of the groundwater system
at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the BVG rocks of the PRZ
which would meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>5.47 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield are
consistent with the physical and chemical containment of all but a small
fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just three
radionuclides, chlorine-36, iodine-129 and uranium-238, are calculated to be
released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the peak risk
either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>5.48 If conditions at the Sellafield site were to remain as at present,
resulting in predicted discharge predominantly to a marine environment, these
releases would have small consequences when compared with the risk target.  For
release of chlorine-36 to a terrestrial environment - and of iodine-129 in the
case of agricultural wells - the groundwater system needs to provide dilution of
levels of radionuclides in repository-derived groundwater sufficient to lead to
calculated risks consistent with regulatory requirements.  On the basis of the
calculations carried out, it is judged that such dilution will be afforded by
the hydrogeological system at Sellafield.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.49"></A>5.49 The strong chemical containment that will be
afforded to uranium by the Nirex repository concept ensures that any significant
migration to the surface of  uranium-238 and its daughter radionuclides only
occurs at times beyond about one hundred thousand years after repository
closure, as shown in <I>Nirex 95
</I>(Volume 3, Section 6.4, pages 6.10 to 6.12) [COR/522].  The very long
radioactive decay half-life of uranium-238,  approaching 4,500 million years,
means that it will return to the surface eventually unless a process of
mineralisation leads to its permanent incorporation in the constituents of the
cement-based backfill or the host rocks.  There is evidence that this may happen
but Nirex is not yet sufficiently confident in the evidence to incorporate the
process in safety assessments.  It is of course this long half-life that
accounts for the abundant natural occurrence of uranium-238 on the planet. 
Given the considerable uncertainties associated with numerical assessments over
timescales of the order of a million years, a comparison with naturally
occurring radioactivity is considered to represent a more effective way of
demonstrating the containment performance of the system with respect to this
nuclide,  This approach is under development for use in future assessment
studies.  Nevertheless, the extension of the numerical assessments to times
beyond one million years has produced a calculated annual individual risk of 3.3
x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> for a Boreal climate state.</P>
<P>5.50 The presentation in my evidence of the containment performance of the
barriers in a repository located at Sellafield enables the identification of
aspects of the site where Nirex must be confident that the underlying judgments
are correct and that the range of uncertainty has been narrowed sufficiently. 
These are :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the groundwater flow into the near field of the repository, which
determines the duration of chemical containment and the rates of release of
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>the dilution, during transport in the geosphere, of the dissolved
radionuclides in the groundwater released from the repository, which determines
the concentrations of radionuclides in groundwater reaching the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para5.51"></A>5.51 The most probable value for the groundwater
flow into the near field of the repository is predicted to be  140 m<SUP>3
</SUP>per year as stated in paragraph 5.21.  This value is consistent with
maintenance of chemical containment in the engineered barriers of the repository
for a million years and limits the release of uranium-238 to levels consistent
with risks meeting regulatory requirements.  This value is also consistent with
sufficient spreading in time of the release of chlorine-36 from the repository
to ensure its subsequent dilution to levels that are also consistent with risks
meeting regulatory requirements.  However, groundwater flows greater than this
cannot be ruled out.  It is noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 2.3,
page 2.13) [COR/522] that on the basis of the current judgments about the
networks of connected fractures in the BVG used to calculate the flow, a small
probability exists that the flow could be 150 times greater (or indeed smaller).
 If it were found that the description of the networks of connected fractures
giving a flow 150 times greater is a better representation of the fractures in
the BVG, then a repository would probably not meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.52"></A>5.52 Similarly, the most probable value currently
predicted for the dilution of radionuclides in the geosphere is consistent with
a repository performance meeting regulatory requirements.  This dilution is
highly dependent upon the path taken by groundwater from the repository to the
surface environment.  The modelled path is determined by the judgments
concerning networks of connected fractures in both the BVG and the overlying
sedimentary formations and we must be confident that these are correct also.</P>
<P>5.53 The relevant information on the geology and hydrogeology of Sellafield,
available in most part by early 1994, was used in the calculations of risk
reported in Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95
</I>[COR/522].  Dr. Chaplow presents in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) the further information which
has become available since then.</P>
<P>5.54 This further information has added to confidence that the site at
Sellafield offers a stable geological setting which will provide a low
groundwater flow through a repository located in the BVG and high dilution in
the overlying rocks for radionuclides released from repository vaults.  It
includes information on groundwater chemistry indicating long residence times
for the groundwater in the BVG, and results from the cross-hole testing and
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test.  These tests have provided information on the limited
nature of the connections over extended length scales in the fracture systems in
the BVG and have indicated little connection between the BVG and overlying
sandstones.  While models of the groundwater system have not yet been updated
and implications for risk calculated, I consider that this later information
broadly supports the basis of <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522] with some indications
that the modelling in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522]  may have been conservative in
its representation of networks of connected fractures in the BVG and overlying
sandstones.</P>
<P>5.55 In Section 6 of my evidence, I describe the information needed from the
RCF to build further confidence in our judgments before key decisions can be
made in the deep repository development programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="InformationRequired"></A><B>6. INFORMATION REQUIRED FROM THE RCF</B></P>
<P>6.1 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">paragraph 6.21</A>) notes that for
present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the development of
a repository:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under
RSA93; and
</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.
</LI></UL>
<P> Nirex will prepare assessments of the post-closure safety performance of
the repository for each of these decision points.  That prepared for the first
decision point will necessarily be preliminary and will be filled out and
finalised to enable the regulatory authorities to take a decision on approval of
the start of disposal operations.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.2"></A>6.2 As described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of
Evidence, (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.22">paragraphs 6.22</A> to 6.24), the
information requirements for the different stages of post-closure safety
performance assessment are somewhat different in character.  This leads to the
identification of two separate categories of information required.  These have
different timescales for delivery that are related to the two decision points
identified above.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The RCF programme, comprising 3 phases, has been
developed to deliver the information that is needed in accordance with these
timescales.  It is expected that Phase 1 of the RCF programme could deliver the
information required in relation to a decision to propose development of a
repository.  In particular, as will be explained in the following paragraphs in
this Section of my evidence, we need to obtain sufficient information to build
confidence in key models used in assessments of repository post-closure
performance and to enable confident extrapolation of descriptions of the rock
mass and groundwater system across the PRZ for use in developing the repository
design.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.4"></A>6.4 The confidence achieved by the end of Phase 1 of
the RCF programme will be dependent upon the amount and nature of information
that has been obtained at that stage.  The information available will determine
the extent to which models and extrapolations can be put to the test.  The
adequacy of this testing will be subject to rigorous review as part of informing
a decision on whether to  propose development of a repository.  In the event
that it is found inadequate,  further information will be sought from one or
both of the subsequent phases of the RCF programme.  A possible scenario is that
more information will be required on geological and hydrogeological
characteristics accessible to an extent that is too limited in Phase 1 as a
result of their orientation or spacing in relation to the shafts and connecting
galleries.  In that case the subsequent extension of the horizontal galleries of
the RCF, and drilling out from those galleries, will be designed to overcome
this limitation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.5"></A>6.5 The first category of information, required to
inform a decision on whether to propose development of a repository, relates to
those factors which are most important in determining the suitability of the
site as a location for a repository.  These factors are our predictions of
groundwater flow and dilution, the potential for natural or induced changes to
create significant new pathways for groundwater flow, and repository design. 
The position that the Company considers it necessary to achieve in respect of
each of these factors for the first decision point is as follows :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution and that
these predictions are consistent with meeting regulatory requirements;
</LI>
<LI>confidence that construction of a repository at the site, or future
naturally induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which
would significantly impair repository performance; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence in the basis for optimisation of repository depth, location,
layout and orientation, and consequent confidence in cost estimates for
repository construction.
</LI></UL>
<P> The safety assessment to be prepared in relation to this decision point
will be required to take account of the alternative scenarios for long-term
evolution of the repository system and information on naturally induced changes
will be important to establish the appropriate framework for such an analysis.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 In the second category of information, required
in relation to a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether to approve
the start of disposal operations, are those factors which will have been
addressed in the laboratory or at other research sites, but where it is likely
that the regulatory authorities will require an in situ demonstration that the
results are applicable to the repository site.  Such information requirements
are currently considered to relate to the following :</P>
<UL>
<LI>processes that can influence the transport of radionuclides in groundwater
in the geosphere;  
</LI>
<LI>quantifications of long-term effects of the interaction of the repository
system with the localised flows in the surrounding rocks; and
</LI>
<LI>finalisation of detailed design, including repository sealing measures.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 Our work has indicated that the factors for which information is sought
in this second category are not likely to determine the basic suitability of a
site as a location for a repository.  Repository safety is calculated to be less
sensitive to the ranges of assumptions that can reasonably be made about these
factors.  However, the demonstration that these factors have been taken into
account in a realistic manner is considered to be a necessary element of a
finalised assessment of post-closure safety performance needed to inform a
decision by the regulatory authorities on approval of the start of disposal
operations.  It is also considered that the second category of information will
include that required to fill out the information supplied in the safety
assessment, prepared at the first key decision point, and that this will be
achieved through a process of further systematic validation.</P>
<P>6.8 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need to
address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of the
repository, but will identify specific remaining uncertainties and the steps
that will be taken to resolve them.  If a robust evaluation can be achieved by
the end of Phase 1 of the RCF programme, then the further work in Phase 2 and
Phase 3 of the RCF programme would continue to address remaining uncertainties,
probably within the framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities,
for the progressive supply of information leading to a decision on approval to
start disposal of wastes in the repository.  </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 The calculations that we have carried out in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 9, pages 9.1 to 9.4) [COR/522] indicate that a
repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield could be developed
which would meet regulatory requirements.  This is conditional on the basis that
judgments about the rock characteristics, leading to predictions of groundwater
flow, are correct.  The risk calculations are based on a conceptual model which
contains a particular description of the networks of connected fractures
controlling flow in the BVG.  Uncertainties in the values of parameters
describing the networks have been recognised by ascribing a range of values
having different probabilities about a central value for each parameter.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Limitations on surface-based observations mean
that we cannot measure the parameters of interest directly.  Expert judgment has
been used in developing the conceptual model and associated ranges of parameter
values.  It is recognised by Nirex and the experts involved in this exercise
that different judgments could be arrived at, leading to different conceptual
models with different ranges of parameter values around different central
values.  Some of these alternative models, albeit improbable, could lead to the
prediction of high values for the flow of groundwater into the repository or low
values for its dilution in the overlying rocks that would not be consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements for post-closure safety of a repository. </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The remedy is to subject these conceptual
models to a process of validation involving forward predictions, using the
outputs of these models, and testing these predictions against field
observations. This process of validation can be used to achieve the following
objectives :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>discrimination between alternative conceptual models of the same system
using tests to measure directly some aspect of the system for which different
predictions are given by the alternative models;
</LI>
<LI>refinement of a conceptual model where there is some uncertainty about one
or more components of the model, or about the parameters associated with the
model, and the predictions can be compared with test results to reduce or remove
the uncertainty; and
</LI>
<LI>confirmation of a conceptual model as fit for its intended purpose in
post-closure performance assessment studies through testing of the adequacy of
its predictions.
</LI></UL>
<P> This process is intrinsic to the Nirex programme of hydrogeological
investigations, where modelling has been carried out to design the more
extensive hydrogeological tests and to establish criteria for their successful
implementation, and will be developed further for application in the RCF. </P>
<P>6.12 In developing the approach to model validation for the RCF programme,
it is recognised that predictions of the parameters that largely determine
overall system performance, such as groundwater flow through the repository and
dilution of levels of dissolved radionuclides in the geosphere, cannot be tested
directly.  The validation testing of the component conceptual models that are
combined to create the description of the overall system performance must be
sufficiently rigorous, therefore, to build confidence in their application. 
This implies requirements for testing over a range of length scales and for
acquiring sufficient test data to satisfy scientific opinion as to the adequacy
of the process.
</P>
<P>6.13 The RCF overcomes limitations of surface-based or laboratory
investigations for validation in the following ways :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the RCF would permit tests and observations in three dimensions and at a
scale more directly comparable to that of the repository;
</LI>
<LI>specialised tests could be performed in situ, directly on specific features
of relevance to repository performance and under geotechnical and
hydrogeotechnical  conditions which are closely comparable to those of the
repository; and
</LI>
<LI>the RCF would allow direct, in situ, observation and measurement of the
response to excavation of the potential repository host rocks and groundwater
system on a scale, at a depth, and in a location which would provide information
which can be directly related to the performance of a repository within the PRZ.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.14 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.6">paragraph 6.6</A>) has identified that the
information that the RCF will provide can be considered to address uncertainties
in three main areas :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> The nature of the key uncertainties will be explained under these headings
in the following paragraphs.  The information required to address them will be
identified in terms of its categorisation in relation to the future developments
of post-closure performance assessments to support the two decision points as
discussed above.  It will be explained why the information required can only be
obtained through the underground access to the rock mass which will be afforded
by the RCF.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterFlow"></A><B>Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide
Transport</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.15"></A>6.15 The performance of the engineered barriers of
the repository in affording physical and chemical containment is dependent upon
the flow and composition of the groundwater in the repository.  The overall
performance will determine the rate of transfer of dissolved radionuclides in
groundwater out of the near-field of the repository into the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.16 The transport of radionuclides by the groundwater in the geosphere is
dependent upon the characteristics of the rock that control groundwater flow and
the physical and chemical processes that operate within the rock.  The combined
characteristics of the repository host rock and overlying rocks will determine
the pathways taken by radionuclides to return to the surface and the
concentrations at which they will emerge in the biosphere.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.17"></A>6.17 The first category of information required
before a decision is made to propose development of a repository is to test
assumptions made about the characteristics of the site in relation to :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository; and
</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>the spreading in the geosphere of residual mobile or long-lived
radionuclides from the repository in groundwater that reaches the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.18"></A>6.18 The second category of information, required to
be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision on
whether to approve the start of disposal operations is to test that evaluations
of processes having the potential to affect the transport of radionuclides have
realistically estimated the effects on post-closure performance.  Currently,
three potentially important processes are identified where information is needed
from the RCF:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> In addition, the second category of information will include that required
to fill out the information supplied on groundwater flow and on spreading and
dilution in the geosphere in the safety assessment prepared at the first key
decision point.</P>
<P>6.19 The information required on each of the identified subjects is
described under separate headings in the following paragraphs.
</P>
<P>Calculation of Groundwater Flow through the Repository</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.20"></A>6.20 The calculation of groundwater flow through the
repository is carried out on the basis of descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, as given in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.2, pages 5.6 to 5.10) [COR/522].  It is
considered that groundwater flow occurs predominantly in fractures existing in
hard rocks such as the BVG.   Further, it is considered that fractures are not
uniformly distributed through the rock but that, as a result of natural
processes in the geological evolution of the rock formation, several individual
fractures can have developed together in connected networks.  These networks
would extend over greater distances than their component individual fractures
and are therefore likely to be more significant in controlling groundwater flow
through the rock.</P>
<P>6.21 The flow of groundwater through such a network of connected fractures
is controlled by factors such as its overall length, the aperture of the
individual fractures in the network, the ways in which they are connected
together and the variability of these characteristics within the overall
network.  The flow of groundwater through a repository will be determined by the
properties of these networks of connected fractures, by the number of them
intersected by the disposal vaults and by the hydraulic pressure gradients
driving water along them.  The locations of the networks and the spacings
between them are therefore also important information, as is the distribution of
hydraulic pressures within the networks.
</P>
<P>6.22 As described in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.1.2, pages
5.3 to 5.5) [COR/522], the results of hydrogeological tests carried out in
boreholes have been interpreted in terms of assumed intersections of the
networks of connected fractures by the boreholes.  Where such an intersection is
assumed, the properties of the fracture network are inferred from the
hydrogeological measurements.  The maximum lengths of these features are put at
many hundreds of metres and so an individual borehole having a diameter of about
150 mm would be intersecting only a small part of the overall system.  This
introduces considerable uncertainties which are recognised by Nirex in assigning
a wide range of possible descriptions to the network of connected fractures and
an associated wide range of values for the important properties.</P>
<P>6.23 The networks of connected fractures can be investigated over a greater
lengthscale by means of cross-hole testing between different boreholes.  Nirex
has carried out such tests, culminating in the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, as
described by Dr Chaplow in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para6.36">paragraphs 6.36</A> to 6.40).  These
tests have involved the generation of different possible descriptions of the
networks of connected fractures, in the forms of alternative conceptual models. 
By comparing the predictions of these models with the results of testing,
uncertainties concerning groundwater flows can be resolved to some extent and as
noted in paragraph 5.54 the outcomes appear encouraging.  However, the principal
uncertainty, concerning the range of possible descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures, will remain in the absence of direct observations and
complementary testing of the networks.
</P>
<P>6.24 The information required from the RCF is a description of the networks
of connected fractures as the main groundwater flow channels in the BVG, and the
range of values that should be assigned to the key properties of these features,
based upon physical observations.  Furthermore, the information obtained must be
capable of extrapolation both in space, throughout the volume of the BVG rocks
in the PRZ, and also in time, to validate the application of the resulting
models in assessments of repository post-closure performance at long times into
the future.</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF will allow such information to be obtained because it will
afford the opportunity to carry out complementary activities in parallel. 
Direct observations can be made on the way in which individual fractures are
connected to form extended networks.  The properties of the individual fractures
can be measured in parallel with the measurement of the properties of the
connected system as described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.11">paragraph 6.11</A>).</P>
<P>6.26 The access to a large volume of rock containing the networks of
connected fractures will allow observations to be made of their locations and of
any association with other geological features such as faults.  Relationships
with recognisable geological structures and information on trends in the
orientation and spacing of the features would allow the testing of this
information against further observations and would attach greater confidence to
the extrapolation through the rock volume.</P>
<P>6.27 Our current groundwater flow models do not fully reproduce the
hydraulic pressure field that is deduced from borehole measurements.  A
significant factor in the current differences between observation and prediction
may be the way in which the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures
are used to calculate hydrogeological properties on a regional scale.  A further
model development is planned, possibly incorporating relationships between the
depth and location of the networks and their hydrogeological properties, to
address this issue. Sinking of the RCF shafts will provide information to test
the validity of such models.</P>
<P> Spreading in the Geosphere</P>
<P>6.28 As described in paragraphs 5.28 and 5.29 of my evidence, the
concentrations at which radionuclides will be present in groundwater reaching
the surface environment will be determined by a number of factors including
their rate of release from the repository and their spreading in time and space
during passage through the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.29 The rate of release from the repository is largely determined by the
groundwater flow through the near field of the repository (taking account of the
containment afforded by the engineered barriers), where the RCF is intended to
provide essential information.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 The RCF is intended to provide information for
use in determining the spreading in time and space of the transport of
radionuclides in the BVG rocks and the overlying sedimentary formations.  The
spreading of radionuclide transport will be highly dependent upon the properties
of the main groundwater flow channels in the geological formation. Thus, the
information on groundwater flow channels in the BVG rocks sought from the RCF in
relation to calculations of groundwater flow through the repository would be
required for this second purpose also.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.31"></A>6.31 The other geological formation which is
important in this context is the St. Bees Sandstone.  A wide range of
conceptualisations of the flow channels in this formation remains possible on
the basis of the results obtained so far.  At one extreme, this range includes
approximately vertical connected fracture networks extending over large
distances and possibly connected with fracture networks in the BVG.  At the
other extreme of the range is the possibility that horizontal bedding
structures, produced by the sedimentation processes that created the sandstones,
would force the groundwater flow in a horizontal direction.</P>
<P>6.32 The RCF will afford the direct observation of the structural
characteristics of the St. Bees Sandstone, as exposed in the RCF shafts.  The
correlation of the observed large scale geological structures with observations
of groundwater flow and hydrogeological responses in the monitoring boreholes
nearby should enable us to distinguish between the possible descriptions.  A
description based upon physical observations could then be used to calculate the
spreading in time and space for radionuclide transport through this rock
formation.</P>
<P> Rock Matrix Diffusion</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.33"></A>6.33 Radionuclides transported in groundwater along
flow channels in rocks, may diffuse into the surrounding bulk rock matrix.  This
would have the effect of retarding the transport of radionuclides and also
result in some spreading in the geosphere of the initial radionuclide release
from the repository.  The consequent access to sorption sites in the surrounding
bulk rock matrix affords additional retardation to radionuclide transport.  The
nature and extent of the operation of rock matrix diffusion and sorption affects
the calculated radiological consequences of the release of metallic
radionuclides such as uranium-238 in particular.</P>
<P>6.34 Particularly in the BVG there are uncertainties as to the extent to
which this beneficial process will operate. The uncertainties arise from
uncertainties about the networks of connected fractures, the internal structures
of the fractures themselves and the in situ diffusivity of the rock matrix.</P>
<P>6.35 The requirement for this information is placed in the second category, 
to be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision
on whether to approve the start of disposal operations.  Information on the
process of rock matrix diffusion has been obtained from laboratory measurements
and experiments on rock core samples.  However, for the results of this research
to be used with confidence it must be ensured that the measurements were
applicable to the main flow channels and that important properties of the rock
were not modified by their removal from the bulk rock at depth to a laboratory. 
The RCF is required to give direct access to, and measurements in, fractures
identified on the basis of their groundwater flow properties, and to make these
measurements in situ with relatively little disturbance of the rocks.</P>
<P> Colloid Transport</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.36"></A>6.36 Colloids are small particles of matter which
remain suspended in groundwater because they do not settle under gravity.  If
colloidal particles are present in sufficiently large concentrations and remain
stable for a sufficient length of time they have the potential to cause an
increase in the effective transport of radionuclides in groundwater by
incorporating radionuclides from the near field.  No conclusive evidence has
been found to suggest that colloids would exist at significant concentrations in
a repository at Sellafield.  However, because of the known difficulties of
taking undisturbed samples of groundwater to analyse for colloids, robust
arguments are not available to demonstrate that colloids will not be present. 
The key uncertainties relate to the quantities of colloids present in Sellafield
groundwaters and the transport of colloids in fractures in the rocks at
Sellafield.</P>
<P>6.37 Considerable efforts are being made to collect good groundwater samples
from the boreholes at Sellafield for colloid analysis including the drilling of
boreholes without the use of drilling muds.  Whereas the practical difficulties
have been overcome successfully for the analysis of species in solution in
groundwater, the ability to obtain reliable samples and analyses of the colloid
population is hampered by the introduction of relatively large quantities of
particulate matter from the materials of the sampling equipment and the fluids
necessarily used to drill, test and sample the boreholes.  The immediate
accessibility of the rocks at depth in the RCF affords the opportunity to take
undisturbed samples of known origins.  This is because more specialised sampling
equipment, including provisions for stabilising existing conditions, can be
located precisely within a feature of interest.  This benefit of working within
the RCF is extended to more general geochemical sampling where a higher spatial
coverage of sampling can be achieved than through the use of boreholes drilled
from the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.38"></A>6.38 Nirex will seek to generate relatively simple
empirically based models of colloid transport based on experiments conducted
using flow rates and fracture properties of interest.  Given the requirements
for direct access to the fracture system in conjunction with the need for a high
level of control of the experimental conditions there is a particular necessity
to carry out such experiments in the RCF.  It is envisaged that these
experiments would characterise the transport of different colloids relative to a
conservative tracer (a substance that is readily identified and remains
dissolved in water as a trace on its movement) within a single fracture that had
previously been characterised.</P>
<P>Gas Migration</P>
<P>6.39 Our current understanding of processes relevant to gas migration
through the geosphere has been developed through the NSARP experimental
programme at Reskajeage Quarry in Cornwall.  The experimental results have been
used to develop and refine the modelling approach described in <I>Nirex Report
S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section 3.3, pages 13 to 16) [COR/509].  There are two aspects
of gas migration for which in situ testing is needed to confirm understanding
and validate models in order to increase confidence both in the evaluation of
the gas pathway itself and in the assessment of the effect of gas migration on
groundwater flow :</P>
<UL>
<LI>the entry of the gas into the water-saturated fracture network, since it is
necessary to be able to predict the maximum overpressuring that will be
generated in the repository as a result of gas production, in order to estimate
the potential for gas-induced fracturing of the repository or the surrounding
rock; and
</LI>
<LI>the migration of gas through the disturbed zone around the repository and
through the geosphere where issues to be considered are the mechanisms for gas
migration and the associated potential for coupled gas-water flow, the gas
pathways through the fracture network and the time taken for the gas to return
to the biosphere.  (This information is needed to identify the period over which
gas enters the biosphere and to assess whether enhanced migration of
contaminated groundwater is likely to occur.)
</LI></UL>
<P>6.40 The requisite experiments concerned with gas entry pressures and gas
migration in the BVG can only be carried out in the RCF because horizontal
boreholes are required to intersect identified and characterised fractures and
to examine some of the issues relating to the transport of the buoyant gas
through the water-filled fracture network.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalandInduced"></A><B>Natural and Induced Changes to the
Geological Barrier</B></P>
<P>6.41 It is recognised that the site characterisation programme carried out
by Nirex yields information on the present day geology and hydrogeology.  The
current regulatory requirements for a repository apply at any time in the
future.  Consideration must therefore be given to future changes to the
geosphere barrier as a result both of natural processes, including tectonic and
climatic processes, and of repository construction itself.  The information
required from the RCF again falls into the two categories determined by the
decision point against which it is generated.</P>
<P>6.42 In order to inform a decision whether to propose development of a
repository, information is required on the type and extent of natural changes
that could occur at the site to confirm that these will not significantly impair
the performance of the geosphere barrier in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport.  Similar information is required on the disturbance to
the rock that will be caused by excavating the repository itself, which is
termed 'excavation disturbance'.</P>
<P>6.43 In order to inform a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether
to approve the start of disposal operations, information is needed from testing
underground of the chemical disturbance in rocks surrounding the repository
caused by contact with alkaline pore water from the cement-based backfill. 
Every effort will have been made to assess the extent and nature of this change
to the rocks surrounding the repository in a conservative manner, using
information obtained from laboratory and field experiments and from
desk-studies.  However, the complex and site-specific nature of the interaction
requires validation to be obtained that its treatment in assessment studies is
appropriate and does not lead to underestimates of the transport of
radionuclides.</P>
<P> Natural Changes</P>
<P>6.44 Dr. Chaplow presents evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para7.6">paragraphs 7.6</A> to 7.26) that the
system of flowing fractures in the BVG has remained stable for a long period of
time.  In particular, no evidence has been obtained for the creation of new flow
paths at depth as a result of any seismic activity during the last several
million years and the groundwater system at depth shows evidence that there have
been no extensive changes as a result of climate-related events such as
glaciation for over a million years.  However, the RCF will be needed to
validate this evidence by means of direct observations of associations of
groundwater flows, mineral formation and geological structures at depth. 
Detailed examination of the fractures that are components of the main flow
channels should allow the geological history of flow patterns to be established,
particularly by dating the mineralisation that has occurred in association with
flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then be compared with the present
day flow patterns to test whether significant changes have occurred in the past
and may therefore occur in the future.  On the basis of information obtained
from borehole testing, this does not appear to be the case, but such a
conclusion would only be reliable when greater confidence is obtained in the
descriptions of the networks of connected fractures themselves through
observations and measurements in the RCF.</P>
<P> Excavation Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.45"></A>6.45 The information that can only be obtained from
carrying out work underground in the RCF relates to the disturbance of the
geology and hydrogeology that will result from excavation itself.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.46"></A>6.46 Creating an excavation in rock at depth by any
method removes material which was previously bearing some of the load of the
adjacent and overlying rocks.  Removal of this material therefore causes a
redistribution of the stresses around the excavation.  This redistribution may
be accompanied by some physical movement of the rocks around the excavation,
including movements on existing fractures and the creation of new fractures. 
This phenomenon is termed excavation disturbance.   The excavation disturbance
is confined to a volume, or zone, of rock which surrounds the excavation.  This
disturbed zone of rock surrounding shafts and drifts might provide additional
paths for transport in groundwater of radionuclides from the repository.  The
issues are the hydraulic conductivity of the excavation disturbed zone and how
far the zone extends from the excavation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.47"></A>6.47 Currently, views as to the extent and nature of
the excavation disturbed zone are based on past precedent of excavation projects
at other sites and a knowledge of the in situ stresses and rock quality measured
in Boreholes.  On this basis, it is assumed that the hydraulic conductivity of
the rock surrounding an excavation may increase by a factor of up to a hundred
over a distance equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation.  This is
believed to be a conservative description of the hydraulic characteristics and
extent of the excavation disturbed zone.  Scoping studies have shown that
disturbance on this scale is unlikely to impair the performance of the
repository and the effects of disturbance have not been included in assessment
models on this basis.  The information which is needed from the RCF is
measurement of the hydraulic and mechanical characteristics of the excavation
disturbed zone in the sandstones, Brockram and BVG to test the validity of this
assumption.</P>
<P>6.48 It is found that the potentially important effects of excavation
disturbance on groundwater flow characteristics are specific to the geological
and hydrogeological setting and to the nature of the excavation itself.  They
are likely to vary as a function of depth and location because of the different
mechanical loadings that will exist through the rock mass in three dimensions. 
Furthermore the effects, particularly in the long-term, are dependent upon a
number of interacting processes.</P>
<P>6.49 The benefit of the RCF is that it will allow direct measurement and
monitoring of excavation disturbance in the sandstones, Brockram and the
potential repository host rock.  In particular the important geological and
hydrogeological properties of the rock surrounding the excavation can be
determined before and after the excavation has been carried out and can be
observed as a function of time in the post-excavation period.  The monitoring is
particularly important to build confidence in our understanding of the evolution
of the excavation disturbed zone over time.  To enable extrapolation over
timescales of interest, the trends in further development of the disturbance
will be determined.  The response of the disturbed rock to mechanical loading
such as borehole testing will be particularly helpful in this respect.</P>
<P>6.50 The disturbance caused by the excavation will provide a significant
test of the understanding of changes that might result from natural processes. 
The stress redistribution that will occur during shaft sinking will be a useful
analogue for natural events such as glaciation that might place a cycle of
mechanical loading on the rock mass.  The response of the groundwater flow
system can be monitored to test the effects on the hydrogeological system of
such an event.
</P>
<P> Chemical Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.51"></A>6.51 A chemical disturbance will be produced in a
volume of rock, or  zone, around the repository by the alkaline fluid emanating
from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  This chemical disturbance has the
potential to modify the surfaces of fractures in the rock.
</P>
<P>6.52 Information on this subject is currently obtained by conducting
laboratory experiments on rock samples from Sellafield, by constructing
mathematical models that couple groundwater flow and chemical reaction and by
building confidence in the results of this work from comparison with
observations on naturally occurring alkaline groundwater systems.</P>
<P>6.53 The essential role of the RCF is to provide the opportunity for
calibration and validation of the mathematical models developed from the current
programme  to give the information required on the key issues listed.  The RCF
allows the detailed characterisation of identified flowing fractures to
determine their structure and mineralogy, the variability of these properties
and the precise compositions of groundwater in contact with the flow-wetted
surfaces in the fractures.  Once the fractures were characterised in this way,
their accessibility in the RCF would allow the conduct of well-controlled
validation experiments.  The principal reactions involved are believed to be
relatively slow and the experiments would build confidence in the trends of
changes to the rock properties rather than determining the long-term
characteristics of the disturbed zone by direct measurement.</P>
<P><A NAME="DesignandConstruction"></A><B>Design and Construction of the
Repository</B></P>
<P>6.54 The information required from the RCF on design and construction of the
repository can again be placed in two categories determined by the decision
point against which it is generated.  In this area in particular, the
information acquired for the decision to propose development of a repository
will be refined for subsequent development of a finalised safety assessment.</P>
<P>6.55 In order to take a decision to propose development of a repository, the
repository design must be developed sufficiently to provide a basis for the
optimisation of repository depth. location, layout and orientation.  This would
allow decisions to be taken on these parameters, albeit allowing for
finalisation of details in light of further investigations underground,
including those associated with repository construction.</P>
<P>6.56 There is little doubt that a repository could be constructed and
operated safely: the key issue is whether it will provide the long-term
isolation and containment of radionuclides in radioactive wastes once it is
closed.  A sound basis for assessment of the post-closure performance requires
that key aspects of the design related to transport of radionuclides can be
defined.  This responds to the requirement most recently restated in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208] that best practicable
means should be adopted to limit risk.  For a deep geological repository this is
taken to mean that, where there are options concerning the depth, location,
layout and orientation of the disposal vaults within the host rock, the
decisions taken must be justified.</P>
<P>6.57 It will be important to work within a framework, which has been
discussed with the regulatory authorities, that establishes the basis for making
these decisions and does not foreclose options by inappropriate developments.</P>
<P>6.58 The RCF is particularly valuable in allowing us to proceed in a
step-wise fashion of investigation in the potential host rock to finalise the
repository design.  Dr. Chaplow describes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para8.13">paragraphs 8.13</A> to 8.16) a
three-dimensional representational model of the PRZ rock mass that is currently
under development.  This will provide the framework of testing our understanding
by each successive step of excavation and associated investigations represented
by the phases of the RCF programme.  Each step in developing the RCF and
investigating the surrounding rock mass will be designed to create the minimum
site disturbance required to gain the required justification for fixing an
aspect of design through testing the rock mass model against the resulting
observations.  Thus any exploration by development of galleries in a horizontal
direction out from the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound
justification for the depth at which this will occur from confirmation of the
modelled rock characteristics.  Further extensions of investigations away from
the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound justification for the
eventual location and orientation of a repository.  Care will also be taken that
the nature of the investigations to fix these aspects of repository design would
not compromise our ability to fine tune these aspects at the final stages of
development of a repository itself.</P>
<P>6.59 Before seeking the approval of the regulatory authorities for the start
of disposal operations, information must be obtained, for use in a finalised
safety assessment, with respect to the methods of placing engineered seals,
developed in laboratory facilities, in the required settings.</P>
<P> Repository Depth, Location, Layout and Orientation</P>
<P>6.60 Currently judgments concerning repository design are based upon
interpretations of the rock mass and hydrogeology of the PRZ from information
obtained from the programme of site characterisation.  These interpretations do
not yet enable us to take a firm view on the benefits to be obtained from
particular depths, locations, layouts or orientations of the repository vaults
within the PRZ.
</P>
<P>6.61 Repository design (in particular depth, location, layout and
orientation) would affect factors identified previously : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository;
</LI>
<LI>the calculated spreading time for radionuclide transport in the BVG; and
</LI>
<LI>the mechanical and hydraulic characteristics of the excavation disturbed
zone.</LI></UL>
<P> The information required is to develop an understanding of how these
factors will vary as a function of interactions of different processes at
different locations throughout the PRZ.  In particular information is required
that enables the extrapolation throughout the BVG rocks in the PRZ of the
distribution of networks of connected fractures.</P>
<P>6.62 It might be envisaged, for example, that the repository could be
located at a depth at which there were relatively few or even no networks of
connected fractures sufficiently long to act as groundwater flow channels from
the repository depth to the overlying sedimentary formations.  Alternatively,
the spacing and orientation of the networks of connected fractures might allow a
layout of the repository vaults that minimised or wholly avoided intersections
with them.</P>
<P>6.63 It is intended that the main RCF galleries will be created at the same
horizon as the repository vaults.  The RCF shafts are required to give access to
these galleries and their depth will be determined by consideration of the
following factors : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the sufficiency of information available on taking the shaft to a certain
depth through its intersections with an adequate number and type of geological
and hydrogeological features of interest; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence that, taking remaining uncertainties into account, a repository
could be developed at the selected horizon that would meet regulatory
requirements.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.64 The RCF shaft sinking provides for the validation of the prior
understanding and associated models which will be developed to underpin the
preliminary view on repository depth, currently put at 650 metres below Ordnance
Datum ('bOD').  Those models will predict the information that will become
available to test this view.  The shaft sinking phase will have programmed into
it a decision point at which the results to date will be evaluated to establish
whether the understanding and models are confirmed.  If so, the RCF galleries
will be developed at the depth previously identified.</P>
<P>6.65 That decision point will provide for an updating of the understanding
and modelling.  The updating could indicate that further information is required
to meet the scientific objectives of adequately validating the models or that a
greater depth is appropriate for the optimisation of the repository.  If so, the
RCF shafts will be developed to the necessary depths.  The maximum depth
currently under consideration for the repository is 900 metres bOD and the
shafts of the RCF would have to be sunk to a depth of 935 metres bOD (to provide
for a sump) if this were found to be the optimised depth of the repository.  The
shafts might also be sunk to investigate depths of up to 900 metres bOD to
provide sufficient information for model validation and a decision on repository
(and hence gallery) horizon which could be at a lesser depth.</P>
<P>6.66 Given the intention to minimise the disturbance of the rock in making
these investigations, it will not be practicable to carry out detailed
investigations from the RCF throughout the PRZ.  Instead, the investigations
must be sufficient, in terms of the representative sampling of the rock mass, to
give a firm understanding of the variability of key geological and
hydrogeological characteristics of the rock mass.  The understanding that is
sought of the variations within the rock mass is to enable the variable
characteristics to be predicted throughout the PRZ on the basis of other
measurements from boreholes and various surveys.  This will allow the required
extrapolation across the rock mass to inform  decisions on repository depth,
location, layout and orientation.
</P>
<P>6.67 An essential role of the RCF in providing this information is to allow
the testing of our ability to carry out the required extrapolation.  This would
involve making predictions of the expected geological and hydrogeological
characteristics on the basis both of previous investigations from the surface
and of targeted drilling underground and then carrying out excavations to test
these predictions.  The finalised location of the repository vaults in the rock
mass would be determined by interpreting the results of targeted drilling from
the RCF.  It is essential to gain confidence from such work in the RCF that, in
any subsequent excavation of a repository, the information from prior
investigations could be utilised successfully to confirm the important
properties of the blocks of rock selected.
</P>
<P> Sealing</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.68"></A>6.68 The sealing requirements for the repository
will be established in an iterative manner by assessment studies.  This process
allows the long-term performance requirement to be established for seals placed
in various features of the repository system.  This in turn translates to the
required properties such as fluidity, durability or hydraulic conductivity (in
set condition) at the time of placing seals.  The achievement of the required
properties relates strongly to the interaction between the materials and the
precise geological setting specific to the site and location.  The features that
are currently considered are as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>flowing fractures intersecting repository vaults (which are assumed not to
be sealed in current models);
</LI>
<LI>large openings such as vaults, tunnels, drifts and shafts;
</LI>
<LI>disturbed zones surrounding excavated openings; and
</LI>
<LI>underground boreholes drilled from the proposed RCF itself.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.69 The requirement is that this work should be carried out in
representative geological settings, and in particular in the BVG at depth where
the levels of in situ stress and rock quality will be appropriate.  Furthermore
the requirement is to allow a long lead-time for the seals to set and to
establish an initial equilibrium in advance of using the results in support of a
performance assessment.  Therefore the validation that sealing requirements can
be met can only be achieved by carrying out work underground in the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="ImpactofRCF"></A><B>7. IMPACT OF THE RCF</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.1"></A>7.1 In taking the decision to apply to develop the
RCF, Nirex has given careful consideration to the potential of the RCF shafts in
particular to affect the post-closure performance of a repository subsequently
located within the PRZ because this is clearly a matter on which Nirex will have
to satisfy the regulators at the appropriate stage of an authorisation procedure
under RSA 93.  Two issues are of particular relevance to these considerations: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the location of the shafts relative to the eventual development of the
repository vaults and accesses; and
</LI>
<LI>the method of excavation and the associated disturbance of the surrounding
rock and hence of its hydrogeological properties.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para7.2"></A>7.2 For both these issues, the potential for effects
on post-closure performance only exists if sealing materials cannot be placed in
the openings and disturbances caused by the excavations to restrict groundwater
flow and to maintain this barrier over long timescales.  This is believed to be
achievable but, because of the site-specific nature of sealing requirements, it
is intended that suitable designs and specifications of seals will be
demonstrated at a later stage of the programme. In order to progress to that
stage, information will be used from a number of sources, including work that is
currently under way in the Nirex Science Programme, relevant work previously
carried out in other international programmes, and work that is proposed to be
undertaken in the RCF.  In the absence of this information the shafts have been
evaluated in scoping studies as if sealed against the flow of groundwater to
only a very low standard, equivalent to a compacted aggregate material.  The
results of these studies have shown no detrimental effect on transport of
radionuclides and on this basis seals have to date not been included in
assessment models.</P>
<P><A NAME="ShaftLocation"></A><B>Location of the Shafts</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.3"></A>7.3 The key concern in respect of the location of the
shafts is the possibility that they would provide a preferential pathway for
groundwater flow that compromises the containment performance of the geosphere. 
Consideration has been given to various issues in this respect :</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">

<TD WIDTH="50">iv.</TD>
<TD>the potential for a U-tube groundwater flow system with the shafts
conducting water into the repository and this subsequently being discharged into
the inclined drift tunnels envisaged as the principal accesses to a repository
at Sellafield.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>7.4 Consideration of the hydrogeological conditions in the PRZ showed that
the consequences of realising ii. or iii. would not be significantly affected by
the choice of shaft locations.  A pragmatic design solution is available to
address iv. whereby there is sufficient flexibility in the routing of the
inclined drifts that these could be arranged to arrive at the repository in
close proximity to the shaft locations.</P>
<P>7.5 When the RCF was proposed in 1992, a good database was available for
conditions at depth in the vicinity of the cluster of the boreholes into the
PRZ, represented by Boreholes 2, 4 and 5.  This gave no indications of a major
flow channel that might connect with a shaft located at Longlands Farm and
therefore gave confidence that the possibility at i. above was unlikely.  The
drilling of several further boreholes in this location and the interpretation of
more detailed geophysical surveys, as reported by Dr Chaplow in his evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para4.6">paragraphs 4.6</A>), have confirmed this
prognosis.</P>
<P>7.6 The location of the shafts was determined to be in the north-eastern
quadrant of the PRZ because this was interpreted to be upstream in relation to
the overall direction of flow in that location, as reflected by the choice of
cross-section for groundwater flow modelling reported in <I>Nirex 95</I>
(Volume 3, Section 2.1.1, pages 2.2 to 2.3) [COR/522].  The location of the
shafts at Longlands Farm, within the north-eastern quadrant of the PRZ, would
allow sufficient horizontal distance between that location and the north-eastern
boundary of the PRZ, for the inclined drift access envisaged for a repository to
be brought around the shaft location to approach from upstream without going
outside the PRZ. </P>
<P><A NAME="ExcavationMethods"></A><B>Excavation Methods</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.7"></A>7.7 The main concern in respect of the excavation
methods chosen to develop the RCF is that these will disturb the rock in such a
way as to develop preferential pathways for groundwater flow. The effect of
excavation disturbance on groundwater flows is an important area of study
proposed for the RCF.  At this stage pragmatic assumptions have been made as to
the effects, whereby the hydraulic conductivity of the rock is increased by two
orders of magnitude to a distance into the rock surrounding the excavation
equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation. These are thought to be
conservative assumptions.  Moreover, as I noted in paragraph 6.47 of my
evidence, scoping studies have shown that disturbance on this scale would be
unlikely to impair the performance of the repository and the effects of
disturbance have not been included in assessment models on this basis.</P>
<P>7.8 There is a good body of evidence from previous practice concerning the
extent of excavation disturbance of rocks of different qualities as a function
of key variables such as the diameter of the excavation and the excavation
methods chosen on which to base these assumptions.  When the assumed extent of
the disturbance is combined with the chosen values for the increased hydraulic
conductivity of the BVG within this disturbed zone there is calculated to be no
significant effect on the movement of groundwater from depth to the surface. 
This analysis takes no benefit from any measures that might be taken to reduce
excavation disturbance effects or to seal the disturbed zone subsequently.</P>
<P>7.9 It was originally envisaged that the shaft excavation would require the
freezing of some part or all of the sandstone formations overlying the BVG. 
This would have required the introduction of a large number of drill holes
around the shaft and possible disruption of the rock by freeze-thaw cycling. 
The replacement of this method by one where groundwater control is achieved by
the preferred method of grouting would introduce a major reduction in the
mechanical disturbance that would be caused, albeit that no significant impact
upon groundwater flow was calculated to result.</P>

<P><B>MICHAEL THOMAS FOLGER will say:
</B></P>
<P> <B><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B></P>
<P>1.1   I have been a Director of United Kingdom Nirex Limited (&quot;Nirex&quot;
or the &quot;Company&quot;) since June 1991 and Managing Director since
September of that year. Within strategy and policies decided by the Board of
Directors, I lead the executive team in delivering Nirex's step-by-step
programme. That programme is directed at disposal of intermediate-level and
low-level radioactive wastes (&quot;ILW&quot; and &quot;LLW&quot;, as classified
in the White Paper Cm. 2919 <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
Final Conclusions, (&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)</I> [GOV/208.]) 
</P>
<P>1.2   Since November 1991 I have been a member of the Radioactive Waste
Management Advisory Committee (the &quot;RWMAC&quot;).
</P>
<P>1.3   I was an administrative grade civil servant in HM Treasury between
1971 and 1985. During that time I was granted study leave in the United States
(1978-79) as a Harkness Fellow of the Commonwealth Fund of New York and was
seconded for two years to the Wiggins Teape Group (1981-83). In 1985 I joined
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in its London office and was employed in a range of
investment banking work - latterly as a Senior Vice-President - until 1991. 
</P>
<P>1.4   I hold the degree of Master of Arts from Cambridge University, where I
studied Natural Sciences and then Economics. I also hold the degree of Master of
Science in Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, following
study there at the Sloan School of Management.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Summary"></A>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P><B>Scope of Evidence
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para2.1"></A>2.1   This proof describes Nirex's history,
organisation and presence in Cumbria; the development of Government policy on
ILW disposal since 1982 and the Company's site selection procedures followed
from 1987. It explains the place of the Rock Characterisation Facility (&quot;RCF&quot;)
within a site confirmation stage which forms part of a programme for providing a
deep waste repository (&quot;DWR&quot;). The evidence also reports the views of
independent bodies on the RCF approach. In conclusion, the Company's contingent
schedule and associated cost projections for the DWR programme are described,
together with the way in which the phased RCF programme fits within that
schedule and those projections.
</P>
<P><B>Nirex
</B></P>
<P>2.2   Nirex, as a company owned by the principal civil producers of
radioactive waste, is responsible for providing a DWR, within the terms of
Government policy, for ILW and for LLW requiring deep disposal. The Company has
an established presence in West Cumbria and maintains liaison arrangements with
Cumbria County Council, other local authorities and local communities in the
area. There is evidence of public support in Cumbria for the Company's proposal
to develop an RCF. 
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy on ILW Disposal
</B></P>
<P>2.3   The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in a Parliamentary
announcement in 1989, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository should
be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next steps
should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of
boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations would
enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction of a
repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when such
investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals.
</P>
<P>2.4   The Government's 1994-95 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.5   In short, the RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context
and is consistent with it.
</P>
<P><B>Site Selection Procedures
</B></P>
<P>2.6   Nirex's site selection procedures have followed recommendations of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (&quot;IAEA&quot;) set down in 1983. They
took account of responses to public consultation undertaken during 1987 and
1988. The RWMAC reviewed the procedures leading to a 1989 shortlist of 12
candidate sites for the DWR and believed the approach to be defensible. It
accepted the logic in identifying the Dounreay and Sellafield areas for
investigation. Following a recent consideration of whether Nirex may be
considered to have adopted a reasonable approach in its investigations so far,
the Government has not proposed any change of procedure. 
</P>
<P>2.7   In 1991, the Company reviewed preliminary results available from the
geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield. The
risks of concentrating on a single preferred site, as previously planned, were
judged acceptable. It was decided to concentrate investigations on Sellafield in
the light of the initial results from the physical investigations, major
transport advantages of Sellafield viewed as a candidate repository location,
and the fact that expert assessments of other attributes of the two locations
showed little change.  
</P>
<P><B>The RCF and Site Confirmation
</B></P>
<P>2.8   In May 1992 the Company viewed results from a preliminary safety
assessment of Sellafield as encouraging and suggesting a &quot;so far so good&quot;
picture of the site's potential suitability as a location for a DWR. However, a
decision on whether to submit a planning application for development of a
repository was postponed because the available data were insufficient to permit
a firm view to be reached on a model of the hydrogeological system. The Company
decided in September 1992 to break out the RCF as a necessary free-standing
stage in its further site investigations, to permit firmer interpretations of
the hydrogeological system needed to inform a decision whether to propose
development of a DWR at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><B>Review of the Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>2.9   A Royal Society Study Group and the RWMAC have indicated their support
for the RCF proposal. Cumbria County Council has stated that the decision to
break out the RCF is a logical stage in demonstrating the safety case for a
repository. It has described the RCF as a research facility. The overall Nirex
approach to site characterisation and site confirmation is consistent with the
terms of an IAEA Safety Guide published in 1994.
</P>
<P><B>The RCF within the Forward Programme
</B></P>
<P>2.10   The RCF programme sits within a contingent schedule for a deep
repository and will progressively provide confirmatory information which should
help the regulatory authorities to form a view on whether there appears to be
any impediment to eventual authorisation for waste disposal of a repository at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.11   The time taken to bring a DWR into operation is an important
influence on total costs. Consistently with Government policy, and to give focus
to the management of a complex project, the Company sets a contingent target
date for bringing a repository into operation, which is kept under review. The
Company would not propose development of a repository unless and until it were
confident the regulatory authorities would foresee no impediment to the eventual
authorisation and licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P>2.12   The planned outlays from 1 April 1995 on constructing an RCF and
carrying out scientific studies directly associated with it are &#163;195
million at 1995 prices. From the same date, the total projected cost of bringing
a DWR into operation at Sellafield is &#163;1493 million at 1995 prices. In the
context of the overall target costs for a DWR at Sellafield, the RCF is not a
significant pre-commitment to eventual repository development in economic terms.

<P>3.1   My evidence covers:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Nirex's history, organisation and presence in Cumbria (Section 4);

</LI>
<LI>the Company's site selection procedures followed from 1987 (Section 6);
</LI>

</LI>
<LI>how information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the
regulatory authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development
of a DWR at Sellafield, and the place of the RCF within the planning schedule

</LI></UL>
<P><B><A NAME="Nirex"></A>4. NIREX</B></P>
<P><B>Role of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.1 Nirex is working to provide and manage facilities for the safe disposal
of ILW and LLW. Such wastes have arisen in the UK for over 40 years and come
from the nuclear power industry, medical, research and defence establishments
and other industries. For ILW, UK Government policy requires deep disposal in an
underground repository. Certain LLW will also require deep disposal as it is
unsuitable for disposal at the Drigg surface facility operated by BNFL.
</P>
<P>4.2 Nirex has no responsibility for high level waste disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 ILW estimated to exist as at 1 January 1995, when
conditioned for disposal on current packaging assumptions, will have a volume of
97,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>. On the same basis, a further 75,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of ILW
is projected to arise by 2010, as can be derived from COR/520. In the light of
bids for space made by major customers in 1993, the Company announced in its
press release of 8 April 1994, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that it was planning for
a total of 400,000 m<SUP>3
</SUP>of radioactive waste, including 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of LLW, to be
disposed of in an underground repository up to 2060. 
</P>
<P><B>Origins of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.4 In 1976 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, chaired by Sir
Brian Flowers (now Lord Flowers), issued its Sixth Report <I>Nuclear Power and
the Environment</I> [GOV/201]. Recommendation 41 of the report was that a
Nuclear Waste Disposal Corporation should be established, as an independent
statutory body responsible for the safe disposal of all waste arisings at
nuclear sites. The Government's initial response to that recommendation was
given in the May 1977 White Paper, <I>Nuclear Power and the Environment The
Government's Response to the Sixth Report of the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution
</I>[GOV/216], which stated in paragraph 20:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Commission recommended (41) that a Nuclear Waste Disposal
Corporation should be set up. They saw a need, not currently fulfilled, for an
executive body to develop and manage radioactive waste disposal facilities, and
they had in mind the desirability of continuity in managing the disposal and
containment of long-lived wastes. The Government see the force of this proposal,
but do not think they need to come to a decision at this stage. They propose to
reconsider it in due course in the light of the results of the current review of
existing policy for waste disposal; and they will also seek the advice of the
Nuclear Waste Management Advisory Committee.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.5 In July 1982, the Government announced in paragraph 57 of the White
Paper <I>Radioactive Waste Management</I>, (<I>&quot;the 1982 White Paper&quot;</I>)
[GOV/203] that, with its agreement, a Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste
Executive (the &quot;Executive&quot;) was to be set up by the component parts of
the nuclear industry, in co-operation, &quot;<I>to provide a mechanism by which
they can successfully fulfil their own responsibilities in this field and work
within a comprehensive plan for waste management</I>.&quot; 
</P>
<P>4.6 The Executive was responsible for arranging deep sea disposals, from
1983, of certain ILW and LLW. Because of national policy changes, no such
disposals were put into effect and the Executive concentrated its work on
providing facilities for geological disposal of ILW and LLW.
</P>
<P>4.7 United Kingdom Nirex Limited was incorporated in November 1985, as the
successor to the Executive, pursuant to a shareholders' agreement (&quot;<I>the
Shareholders' Agreement</I>&quot;) which recited the Shareholders' need to
dispose of ILW and LLW. British Nuclear Fuels plc (&quot;BNFL&quot;) and Nuclear
Electric plc each owns 42% of the issued ordinary share capital, and Scottish
Nuclear Limited and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (the &quot;UKAEA&quot;)
each owns 7%. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry holds a Special
Share.
</P>
<P>4.8 The objects for which the Company was established, as set out in its
Memorandum of Association, include:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To carry on business in the collection, treatment, transport,
storage and disposal of radioactive and other related materials.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.9 The financing needed for the Company's operations is provided by
prospective major customers or by Shareholders. The Ministry of Defence (the &quot;MOD&quot;)
has agreed, in principle and effective from 1 April 1994, to make pre-payments
in respect of its intended use of the repository. The remainder of the financing
is provided by Shareholder loans.
</P>
<P><B>Company Structure
</B></P>
<P>4.10 The Nirex Board of Directors comprises one nominee from Scottish
Nuclear Limited and two each from the UKAEA, BNFL and Nuclear Electric plc. As
Special Shareholder, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry nominates two
directors. In addition, the Managing Director and the Finance and Corporate
Services Director of Nirex are members of the Board. Sir Richard Morris CBE FEng
has been Chairman since September 1989.
</P>
<P>4.11 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] restated in paragraphs
43-45 certain conclusions on the future structure of Nirex set out in the May
1995 White Paper <I>The Prospects for Nuclear Power in the UK</I> (&quot;<I>the
Nuclear Review White Paper</I>&quot;)[GOV/215]. Specifically, it stated that the
Government would retain its special share in Nirex, that the new privatised
nuclear generating companies would be shareholders in Nirex, and that <I>the
Shareholders' Agreement </I>should in future contain a specific undertaking that
the Company will abide by Government policy. In paragraph 44 it said that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>With these safeguards, the Government considers it unnecessary to
seek additional legal powers to enforce its policies in relation to the timely
disposal of waste.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Organisation and Staffing</B></P>
<P>4.12 As at 31 May 1995, the Company's staff numbered 215, with 15 vacancies.
Of the 215 staff in post, 173 were employees based at Harwell, Oxfordshire.
Twenty-three full-time staff seconded by Shareholders or supplied on contract by
other firms were also based at Harwell. Nineteen Company employees were based at
Greengarth Hall, Holmrook, Cumbria. 
</P>
<P>4.13 The Company's organisational structure is shown in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. Staff in the core departments - Science,
Technical and Project - direct and oversee specialist contractors and
consultants engaged respectively in the Science Programme; preparation of
specifications for the disposal system (including transport and packaging
aspects) and environmental assessment; and the design and management of capital
projects (currently the RCF and in due course a DWR). 
</P>
<P>4.14 The Science Department is responsible for the Science Programme, which
will be described by Dr Holmes, Director for Science. Its current main task is
to assess the post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>4.15 The Science Department maintains close liaison with the Technical
Department which is responsible for preparing a disposal system specification to
meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities and satisfy customer needs
in an environmentally acceptable way. 
</P>
<P><B>Nirex in Cumbria
</B></P>
<P>4.16 The Nirex presence in Cumbria centres on the Director (Cumbria) and his
staff at Greengarth Hall, with appropriate Corporate Communications, Science and
Project Department staff also based there. 
</P>
<P>4.17 Science Programme contractors' staff based in Cumbria numbered
approximately 200 at the peak of drilling operations in early 1994, these
individuals being based at Longlands Farm and other operating sites. As at 3
March 1995, the total had reduced to 108, mostly located at Greengarth Hall. The
reduction reflected a decrease in borehole activity, with some drilling
suspended to avoid disturbance to a pump test being carried out in boreholes at
Longlands Farm.
</P>
<P>4.18 As at 3 March 1995, 19 Nirex employees were permanent residents in West
Cumbria. The comparable figure for contractors was 72. 
</P>
<P>4.19 Nirex wishes to see locally resident people take the fullest advantage
of employment opportunities arising from the RCF project. As far as reasonable
and practicable, RCF contractors will be required to maximise employment and
training of local personnel and, in collaboration with Nirex, provide the
necessary framework to make this policy work. Professor MacKay concludes in
paragraph <A HREF="../nrx10/nrx10.htm#Para8.1">8.1</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/10)</B>
that the employment created by the development will be of benefit to West
Cumbria.
</P>
<P>4.20 The Company maintains a sponsorship programme to promote local
educational activities and to help community-based projects. In 1994-95, this
included university sponsorships for three students in earth sciences
disciplines.
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with Local Authorities and Local Communities </U></P>
<P>4.21 Since 1990 senior Nirex staff have accepted invitations to make
periodic reports to the Sellafield Local Liaison Committee, which is chaired by
a senior County Councillor, Mr W Minto OBE, and to its Environmental Health
Sub-Committee, chaired by Professor K Boddy OBE. The Committee was established
in 1957 and its objectives include serving as a channel of information and
comment on aspects of current and future operations at the Sellafield and Drigg
sites of BNFL/UKAEA which may affect the local community or environment. 
</P>
<P>4.22 The Director (Cumbria) represents the Company on the Nirex Liaison
Group. This formal liaison machinery was set up in 1991 and is chaired at senior
officer level by Cumbria County Council. Copeland Borough Council is also
represented and the Lake District Special Planning Board attends at officer
level. Proceedings of the Liaison Group are documented in <I>Minutes of Nirex
Liaison Group, 1991-1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the Liaison Group Minutes</I>&quot;)
[CCC/1/2].
</P>
<P>4.23 At local level, to complement periodic briefings of district and parish
councils, the Company has set up with Gosforth Parish Council both a
Gosforth/Nirex Local Liaison Group and a Gosforth/Nirex Technical Consultative
Group. Representatives of adjoining parish councils attend regular meetings of
the local liaison group and the technical consultative group is to meet publicly
in future. 
</P>
<P>4.24 In addition to those channels of communication, on 16 December 1994 the
Company formally proposed to Cumbria County Council the formation of a joint
Consultation Committee, chaired at member level by the County Council and with
representation from other local authorities, to review and discuss progress of
the RCF programme as it proceeds, including the scientific results as they come
forward. The Company wrote to the County on 8 June 1995 confirming that the
proposal still stands and seeking to carry it forward as an agreed matter in the
context of the Inquiry. The County Council replied on 10 July 1995 stating that
the Company's proposal would be referred to the appropriate Committee of the
County Council when it next met. Copeland Borough Council notified the Company
in a letter of 19 July 1995 that its Policy &amp; Resources Committee would
consider the same matter when it next met. The correspondence is reproduced in
NRX/12/2.</P>
<P><U>Local Opinion</U></P>
<P>4.25 Through a public information programme, Nirex seeks to develop and
sustain a measure of support for its activities within the communities in which
it operates. Opinion surveys can be a useful way of gauging support.
</P>
<P>4.26 Several surveys have been carried out on behalf of Cumbria County
Council, as reported on pages 65-84 of the <I>Report by the Director of Economy
and Environment, Cumbria County Council, December 1994</I> [COR/104], and as
detailed in part in <I>The ICM Research Nirex Opinion Poll Wave 3, Prepared for
Cumbria County Council, November 1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>&quot;)
[COR/411]. Results from an opinion survey conducted for Copeland Borough Council
are set out in <I>Socio-Economic Impact Study of the Nuclear Industry Among
Residents on behalf of Copeland Borough Council, May 1995, North East Market
Surveys</I>, [COR/407]. 
</P>
<P>4.27 On the proposal to build an RCF at Sellafield, <I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>
[COR/411] invited respondents to state which of four specific views was closest
to their own. Table 16 on page 32 of COR/411 shows that 43% of Cumbrian
respondents and 62% of Copeland respondents stated that the view closest to
their own was that it was a &quot;<I>Good idea to test the rock structure and
how the water flows</I>&quot;. The same table also showed the next most popular
view: 37% of Cumbrian respondents and 20% of Copeland respondents stated that
the view closest to their own was that &quot;<I>Once they have gone that far
there will be no stopping the repository</I>&quot;. There is no information on
whether some respondents may have held more than one of the views specified,
albeit one being more strongly held than others. 
</P>
<P>4.28 The report on the May 1995 survey of Copeland Residents conducted for
Copeland Borough Council [COR/407] shows, in Question 13a, 53.8% of respondents
as &quot;<I>not concerned</I>&quot;<I> </I>about &quot;<I>the proposal by
Nirex</I>&quot;,<I> </I>in the words of the relevant question, to locate &quot;<I>a
RCF and repository in the area</I>&quot;.<I> </I>(21.0% were &quot;<I>concerned</I>&quot;
and 14.6% &quot;<I>very concerned</I>&quot;.)
</P>
<P>4.29 Recognising the difficulties in comparing results from different
surveys, because of different methodologies, questions and sampling techniques,
the various opinion surveys indicate support for the RCF amongst the general
public in Cumbria. The level of support appears to be higher in Copeland than in
the rest of Cumbria.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="GovernmentPolicy"></A>5. GOVERNMENT POLICY ON ILW DISPOSAL</B></P>
<P>5.1 This section of my evidence briefly traces Government policy on disposal
of ILW between 1982 and 1995. The policy has been broadly unchanged since 1986.
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy from 1982
</B></P>
<P>5.2 In <I>the 1982 White Paper</I> [GOV/203] the Government stated in
paragraph 36:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The lack of suitable disposal facilities for intermediate-level
wastes is the major current gap in waste management, and it is important that it
should be remedied. The types of wastes that can be accepted at any given
facility will depend upon the details of the eventual design, and the packaging
of the wastes, and it is not therefore possible to say with certainty at this
stage how many facilities will be required. Work is now proceeding on the basis
of bringing into operation by the end of the decade facilities which should be
able to accept a high proportion of the wastes suitable for disposal. The
probable forms are an engineered trench at a depth of about 20 - 30 metres, and
a modified mine or purpose-built cavity at greater depth.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 In October 1983, the Executive announced that it
would investigate a site at Elstow in Bedfordshire for shallow disposal and a
disused anhydrite mine at Billingham in Cleveland for deep disposal.
Considerable local concern was expressed in the areas of Elstow and Billingham
about the investigations. On 24 January 1985, the Secretary of State for the
Environment in a statement to the House of Commons, <I>(Hansard) </I>[GOV/217],
invited the Executive not to proceed further at Billingham and asked it to
select at least two further sites, in addition to Elstow, for investigation for
shallow disposal. 
</P>
<P>5.4 The Executive was also requested, in the choice of sites, to take full
account of research into methods of containing the radioactivity in the wastes.
In February 1986, Nirex announced that investigations for shallow disposal would
be undertaken at three additional locations. Public controversy arose at these
new locations and continued at Elstow.
</P>
<P><B>The 1986 Rossi Report and the Government Response
</B></P>
<P>5.5 In March 1986 the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment,
under the chairmanship of Sir Hugh Rossi, published its <I>First Report from
the Environment Committee Session 1985-86 Radioactive Waste</I> (&quot;<I>The
Rossi Report</I>&quot;) [GOV/304]. The report concluded that the UK lagged
behind other nations in work on geological disposal of radioactive waste. On
underground research, it stated in paragraph 115:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... While it is essential that site specific research is carried
out, it is a </I>sine qua non <I>that a site for research should be accepted by
the local population. All the countries we have visited have or are constructing
underground facilities which are being used for research alone and which are not
intended to be developed as full operational disposal sites. This seems a
sensible approach. It will provide much needed research in this country and will
convince the public. We are anxious that what has happened over Billingham
should not be repeated with a new deep geological site. <B>We therefore
recommend:
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(i) research on a fully constructed deep geological site in this
country is urgently needed and should be implemented; 
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(ii) such a site should be designated as an experimental facility,
explicitly excluded from being a potential operational facility</B>.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 <I>The Rossi Report</I> also recommended that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>... Near surface disposal facilities are only acceptable for
short-lived low-level wastes ...</B></I>&quot;(para. 99).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.7 In July 1986 the Government published its response to <I>the Rossi
Report </I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 White Paper</I>&quot;) [GOV/202]. It stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... continues to favour early disposal because in
general this carries a lower risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public.</I>&quot;(para. 10);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is committed to the development of a deep facility.
Studies here and abroad have confirmed that it is feasible. Further research on
the different systems that are available is being undertaken. The next step will
be for NIREX to identify potential sites for detailed investigation, so that a
site can be chosen to put to a public inquiry and, if approved, developed. In
the course of its development there will be a period of comprehensive testing
and experimentation before the facility becomes operational. There will be no
need for the prior construction of a separate experimental facility. This would
only raise concern in the area affected without yielding any compensatory
benefit. Nor, within the relatively restricted area of the UK, is it likely that
such a number of suitable sites will be identified as to make it sensible to
abandon a site that is good enough for ultimate disposal.</I>&quot; (para. 55.)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Government thus made clear its policy view that an experimental
underground facility at a location explicitly excluded from consideration as a
potential repository site, as recommended in <I>the Rossi Report</I>, was not
appropriate in the UK context. 
</P>
<P>5.8 <I>The 1986 White Paper</I> [GOV/202] also stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... there are no technical reasons why LLW and short-lived ILW
should not be placed in a near-surface facility with the element of containment
envisaged ...</I>&quot;(para. 49);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... recognises that many people would be reassured
if ... </I>[such a] <I>site</I> <I>were used only for LLW. In these
circumstances ... the Government has decided that NIREX should proceed on the
basis that a near-surface facility will only be authorised for the disposal of
what is broadly described as low-level waste ...</I>&quot; (para. 50).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>The 1987 Decision for a Multi-Purpose DWR
</B></P>
<P>5.9 In April 1987, Nirex took stock of its investigations at the four sites
for a shallow repository. Because of the Government decision announced in its
1986 White Paper, these had become candidates for disposal of LLW only. On 30
April 1987 the Chairman of Nirex wrote to the Secretary of State for the
Environment, in a letter reproduced in Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Eighth Annual
Report, September 1987 </I>[GOV/411], and recommended that work on the four
sites be taken no further. The Company had concluded that, in marginal terms,
there was not a lot of difference between the cost of disposing of LLW with ILW
in a deep repository and the cost of disposing of it in a new shallow
repository. 
</P>
<P>5.10 The Chairman's letter [GOV/411] said, in part, that in concentrating
future work on deep disposal:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... it would be wise to avoid premature commitments to a preferred
technique or how or when sites for investigation are to be identified. One
lesson from our work so far is surely that the public does not like feeling
pressurised to accept imposed solutions in this area and I would think time
spent now in considering all the issues in this way would be time well spent.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.11 The Secretary of State, in a letter of 1 May 1987, also reproduced in
Appendix C of GOV/411, agreed with the Nirex conclusion that disposal of LLW in
a multi-purpose repository would be preferable to shallow disposal. In a
statement to the House of Commons on the same day he explained that Nirex would
concentrate on identifying a <I>&quot;suitable location for a deep
multi-purpose facility&quot;
</I>for both ILW and LLW (<I>Hansard</I>)<I> </I>(&quot;<I>the 1987
Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;) [GOV/210].
</P>
<P>5.12 The May 1987 decision marked the beginning of the current DWR
programme, under which Nirex site investigations are now concentrated at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>The 1989 Parliamentary Statement 
</B></P>
<P>5.13 On 21 March 1989 the Secretary of State for the Environment announced
in a Written Answer in reply to a Parliamentary Question (<I>Hansard) (</I>&quot;<I>the
1989 Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;<I>)
</I>[GOV/211]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex's report and recommendations on the disposal of low and
intermediate-level radioactive waste in a deep repository were submitted to
Government on 28 February. Nirex recommends that a repository should be
constructed in the form of a mine under the land, and that the next steps should
be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of boreholes,
in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. In arriving at these recommendations
Nirex has concluded that it would be best to explore first those sites where
there is some measure of local support for civil nuclear activities. The further
evaluation of the geology of these two areas will enable Nirex to decide on
their suitability for construction of a repository, or whether it will be
necessary to evaluate other sites.
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Government, having consulted the radioactive waste management
advisory committee accept the report and note that Nirex, having examined the
arguments for storage rather than disposal of radioactive waste, has endorsed
the Government's policy of disposal. The Government agree that further
exploratory work is necessary before any particular site can be decided upon,
and that it is for Nirex to obtain the necessary planning permissions through
the normal procedures. Only when these investigations have been undertaken will
Nirex be in a position to submit proposals for a substantive development and to
seek the necessary approvals.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.14 The advice to Government from the RWMAC took the form of a letter of 16
March 1989 from its Chairman to the Secretary of State. As published at Appendix
C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report </I>November 1989<I>,</I> [GOV/402], it
stated in part:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>RWMAC has reviewed the site selection procedures adopted by United
Kingdom Nirex Ltd which have led to the identification of the short-list of
twelve sites. The Committee believes that the approach adopted by Nirex is
defensible. We also accept the logic in identifying the two areas for further
evaluation which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield.
The Nirex decision is consistent with our advice given to yourself in the
published RWMAC response to Nirex's consultative document 'The Way Forward'.
Nevertheless, the Committee recognises that sites associated with better
geological conditions, and which are more robust in radiological terms, exist.
However, it would be inappropriate for such sites to be evaluated by detailed
site investigation until the suitability of Dounreay and Sellafield had been
established.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.15 In March 1989, the Company published <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]. That
reported on work undertaken following public consultation initiated in 1987 -
which I explain in Section 6 of this Proof of Evidence - and explained the
Company's decision as a first step to limit further investigations to candidate
DWR sites at Dounreay and Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.16 In September 1990 the Government referred in <I>This Common
Inheritance </I>[GOV/204] at paragraph 15.29 to its deep disposal policy and
Nirex's investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>As part of its strategy for the disposal of intermediate-level
waste, the Government gave UK Nirex Ltd the task of developing a deep
underground repository to isolate the waste from the environment for the many
thousands of years which will be necessary. In 1987 the Government agreed that
the repository should also be used for low-level waste. Nirex is now carrying
out detailed geological studies at Dounreay and Sellafield to identify a
suitable site. These investigations are subject to normal planning procedures,
and the Government will make any proposal for development subject to a full
public inquiry as well as to compliance with strict safety standards.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Under the heading &quot;<I>GOVERNMENT ACTION AND POLICY REVIEW</I>&quot;,
<I>This Common Inheritance </I>also stated, in paragraph 15.38:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government will carry out a full-scale review of the prospects
for nuclear power in 1994 when the Sizewell B project will be nearing
completion. The Government and the nuclear industry will take several

<P>5.17 The 1992 Government publication <I>Environment in Trust Radioactive
Waste Management - A Safe Solution</I> [GOV/305], in a section headed &quot;<I>DISPOSAL
OPTIONS FOR RADIOACTIVE WASTE</I>&quot;, stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is satisfied that safe disposal routes can be
developed in the UK for low- and intermediate-level wastes, and that early
disposal in a deep facility is the right answer. This policy has been endorsed
by both the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment and the House
of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities. The Government also
believes that on-site storage is an unacceptable long-term option because in
general it carries a higher risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public and because decisions on disposal should not be left to future
generations. A number of studies and both Select Committees support this view.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
</B></P>
<P>5.18 On 19 May 1994, the Secretary of State for the Environment announced a
review of radioactive waste management policy (<I>Hansard)
</I>[GOV/214], to be separate from but complementary to a review of the future
prospects for nuclear power in the UK, announced by the Minister for Energy. He
explained that the Department of the Environment proposed to publish its
preliminary conclusions on the review of radioactive waste management policy
later that summer, as a basis for consultation. Separately, Her Majestys
Inspectorate of Pollution (&quot;HMIP&quot;) would be issuing for consultation a
revision of the 1984 publication <I>Disposal Facilities on Land for Low and
Intermediate-Level Radioactive Wastes: Principles for the Protection of the
Human Environment</I>, (&quot;<I>the Green Book</I>&quot;) [GOV/302]. In
parallel, the RWMAC, together with the Advisory Committee on Safety of Nuclear
Installations (&quot;ACSNI&quot;), would be asked to consider the approach to
site selection for radioactive waste disposal facilities and the criteria for
ensuring the protection of human health. 
</P>
<P>5.19 In August 1994, the Department of the Environment issued &quot;<I>Review
of Radioactive Waste Management Policy Preliminary Conclusions - A Consultation
Document</I>&quot; (&quot;<I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/306]. The summary of conclusions stated in paragraph 224:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continues to favour a policy of disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and high emitting wastes. It considers it
appropriate that Nirex should continue with its current site investigation
programme, including its application for planning permission for a rock
characterisation facility at Sellafield. Final decisions on the repository
itself must, however, depend on the establishment of a sound safety case, the
granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, as
well as costs. No fixed deadline should be set for the completion of this
process. In the meantime, the evidence as to safety and technology should be
kept under review, so that all can be satisfied that the eventual arrangements
are the best means by which this generation can fulfil its obligations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.20 On 9 May 1995, on publication of <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I>
[GOV/215], the Secretary of State for the Environment announced certain
conclusions of the Governments Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, in
advance of publication of a White Paper (which was subsequently published as
<I>the July 1995 White Paper</I>, [GOV/208]). In reply to a Parliamentary
Question <I>(Hansard)
</I>[GOV/212], he stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continue to favour a policy of deep disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and consider it appropriate that Nirex should
continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. The question had been
raised of whether a delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might
have advantages. However, the review concluded that the balance of argument was
against any such delay. The Government therefore believe that the repository
should be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable once a suitable site has
been found, although the precise timetable will depend on the granting of
planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the
establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In relation to the planning inquiry into the RCF he said:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>I have already outlined the matters about which I particularly
wish to be informed to help me reach my decision on this case. These do not
include the merits of national policy on the deep disposal of ILW. It has been
established through the courts that while, of course, Government policy can be a
material consideration that may be taken into account at a local planning
inquiry, it may not be disputed and made a central area of debate. Policy on
deep disposal of ILW has, in any case, already been the subject of wide
consultation in the course of the review.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In <I>Department of the Environment News Release </I>on 9 May 1995
[GOV/213], it was additionally stated: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.21 In May 1995, <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> [GOV/215] itself
stated in paragraph 10.39:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>Nirex and the deep repository</B>: The Government favours a
policy of deep disposal rather than indefinite storage for intermediate level
waste and believes that it is no longer right to postpone decisions about its
ultimate destination. It considers it appropriate that Nirex should continue
with its site investigation programme. The question had been raised of whether a
delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might have financial
advantages. However, financial appraisals showed little difference between
waiting 50 years or proceeding now. The review has concluded that the common
interest is in working towards developing the repository without unnecessary
delay, but allowing appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety
case and compliance with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.22 On 4 July 1995, the Government set out its radioactive waste management
policy in <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208]. The policy was stated in
paragraph 6 to have been framed &quot;<I>within the context of international
guidelines and regulations</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P>5.23 Paragraph 51 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> commented as follows
on the need to maintain a balance between costs and benefits:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<B>...<I>radioactive wastes should be managed and disposed of in
ways which protect the public, workforce and the environment. The radiation
protection principles and criteria adopted in the UK and applied by the
regulatory bodies are designed to ensure that there is no unacceptable risk
associated with radioactive waste management. In defining these principles and
criteria and in their application by the regulators, it is recognised that a
point is reached where additional costs of further reductions in risk exceed the
benefits arising from the improvements in safety achieved and that the level of
safety, and the resources required to achieve it, should not be inconsistent
with those accepted in other spheres of human activity.</I></B>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.24 In terms of fundamental policy on ILW, <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] states, as foreshadowed on 9 May 1995:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the Government continues to favour a policy of deep disposal
rather than indefinite storage for ILW and considers it appropriate that Nirex
should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. It has decided
that there would be no advantage to be gained from delaying the development of
the repository itself, and that once a suitable site has been found, it should
be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. The precise timetable will
depend on the granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory
requirements, including the establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;(para.
101);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In 1991, Nirex announced that results of initial borehole drilling
and other investigations at the two sites </I>[Sellafield and Dounreay] <I>suggested
that either could potentially support the safety case necessary for a deep
disposal site, but that it proposed to concentrate its investigations on
Sellafield because of the advantages it offered in terms of transport, with the
majority of ILW for disposal arising from BNFL's operations at Sellafield. The
RCF would form part of those investigations.</I>&quot; (para. 109).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Summary

<P>5.25 The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in his <I>1989
Parliamentary Statement</I>, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository
should be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next
steps should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking
of boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations
would enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction
of a repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when
such investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals. 
</P>
<P>5.26 The Government's 1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.27 The RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context and is
consistent with it. 
</P>
<P> <B><A NAME="SiteSelection"></A>6. SITE SELECTION PROCEDURES</B></P>
<P>6.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the procedures by
which Nirex decided to concentrate at Sellafield its site investigations for a
multi-purpose DWR.
</P>
<P>6.2 <I>The 1987 Parliamentary Statement</I> [GOV/210] explained that Nirex
would concentrate on identifying a suitable location for a deep multi-purpose
facility. I begin this part of my evidence by describing international guidance
and geological and hydrogeological considerations taken into account by Nirex in
framing its approach to site selection. As I shall describe, the Company
initiated public consultations in November 1987 to promote public understanding
of the issues involved and to stimulate comment which would assist Nirex in
developing acceptable proposals for location of a repository.

<P><B>IAEA Guidebook, 1983
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The IAEA is an inter&#173;governmental
organisation whose role is described in paragraph 8 of <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208]. In 1983 it published Safety Series report No. 59, <I>Disposal
of Low- and Intermediate-Level Solid Radioactive Wastes in Rock Cavities - A
Guidebook</I>, IAEA Vienna, 1983, (&quot;<I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>&quot;)
[GOV/501]. As described on its inside front cover, <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>was published as a category (3) document - Recommendations - issued under
the authority of the IAEA Director General. As indicated in the Foreword, it
contains guidelines to be used by regulatory bodies and implementing
organizations. Chapter 6 of the document includes general guidance on the site
selection process and Table 6.1 tabulated an <I>Idealized Sequence of
Activities for Site Selection</I>. 
</P>
<P>6.4 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>recommends, on page 19, that: &quot;<I>Repository
sites should be evaluated on the basis of geological and ecological information
as well as societal considerations</I>&quot;. Evaluation &quot;<I>is performed
in several stages, proceeding from generic to specific assessments</I>&quot;
(page 19) and: &quot;<I>The site selection should be undertaken in close
connection with the work for the repository concept and design, and if necessary
the introduction of engineered barriers should also be taken into account.</I>&quot;
(page 22.) 
</P>
<P>6.5 The idealised IAEA sequence of activities within the site selection
process comprises three stages: &quot;<I>Regional Evaluation</I>&quot;, &quot;<I>Site
Identification</I>&quot; and &quot;<I>Site Confirmation</I>&quot;. In paragraph
6.1.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] those stages of activity were described in broad
terms as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - a search on a national scale to define favourable areas of the
country; followed by</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the identification of specific candidate sites for comparative
evaluation and the selection of outstanding prospects for physical exploration
to confirm their suitability; and
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the final choice based on the results of geophysical investigation
and other studies.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.6 Regional Evaluation has the objective, as described in section 6.2 (page
23) of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... to select areas that have favourable characteristics for a
repository and to reduce them to a few preferred areas for further study. ...
Activities include ... geological mapping ... clarification of relevant
socio-economic factors and the performance of safety analyses.</I>&quot;<BR>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.7 Table 6.1 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] sees activities
to &quot;<I>characterize</I>&quot;  preliminary sites being undertaken
initially in the Site Identification stage and then, &quot;<I>in detail</I>&quot;,at
the third, Site Confirmation,<I></I>stage. During Site Confirmation, favourable
site(s) are selected and &quot;<I>Final Site Selection</I>&quot; follows.
</P>
<P>6.8 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] states on page 19 that &quot;<I>it
may not prove feasible or necessary to move sequentially</I>&quot; through the
stages of site selection and continues &quot;<I>This may be the case if
potential sites or areas may be selected by means other than a full site
investigation programme...</I>&quot;. It states, on page 2, that the practical
application of the guidelines:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... needs a case-by-case consideration, which takes into account
local conditions, e.g. natural circumstances, the characteristics of the wastes
and national and international regulations and practices.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 In commenting on rock suitability, <I>IAEA
Safety Series 59</I> [GOV/501] points out on page 9 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The suitability of the host rock will depend on individual
circumstances related to the specific site rather than the general properties of
the host rock type ... a final decision regarding the location of a radioactive
waste repository can only be made after a very careful, accurate and
comprehensive investigation of a given site and consideration of the waste
characteristics.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Identification of Geological Environments
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Following the withdrawal from Billingham in
1985, the Company sought advice from the British Geological Survey (&quot;BGS&quot;),
a research institute of the Natural Environment Research Council (&quot;NERC&quot;),
on generic geological environments suitable for ILW disposal. This led to
publication in 1986 of a BGS/Nirex paper <I>Geological Environments for Deep
Disposal of Intermediate Level Wastes in the United Kingdom</I> <I>IAEA-SM-289/37,
</I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper</I>&quot;), [COR/614]. The paper
explained on the second page that five generic geological environments had been
identified as suitable by reference to &quot;<I>requisite features</I>&quot;characterised
by:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - predictable groundwater flow paths, preferably long and
resulting in progressive mixing with older, deeper waters or leading to
discharge at sea</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- very slow local and regional groundwater movements in an area with low
regional hydraulic gradients</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- ease of construction to allow for economic repository design 
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- meeting the many accepted caveats regarding seismicity, depth, etc.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.11 The paper distinguished that approach from &quot;<I>the old approach
to HLW disposal</I>&quot;, which had been summarised in a report of 1976 from
the Institute of Geological Sciences (predecessor of the BGS) <I>Disposal of
highly active, solid radioactive wastes into geological formations - relevant
geological criteria for the United Kingdom, IGS, Report No. 76/12</I> [COR/615].
The previous approach had put great emphasis on the properties of the host rock
itself where thermal stability, for example, was a key requirement in
considering suitability for HLW disposal. But, as described on the second page
of <I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper </I>[COR/614], in the light of &quot;<I>increased
understanding of low flux hydrogeological regimes and greater confidence in
modelling them</I>&quot;, near-field physical properties were seen to have
assumed previously &quot;<I>too great a significance in comparison with a
knowledge of long distance transport pathways</I>&quot;. Site selection needed &quot;<I>to
be primarily based on defining what are considered to be suitable large scale
hydrogeological environments</I>.&quot;
</P>
<P><U>The Way Forward</U></P>
<P>6.12 Nirex published in November 1987 <I>The Way Forward - A Discussion
Document</I> (&quot;<I>The Way Forward</I>&quot;) [COR/203]. The document
explained the Company's approach to deep disposal and options on repository
configurations and on generic hydrogeological environments likely to offer
potential for siting a repository. It posed a number of questions for discussion
on those matters, and on considerations bearing on selection of a repository
site and asked which locations should be the subject of detailed investigations.
</P>
<P>6.13 The Company explained in <I>The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] that it
intended to follow the three stage site selection process suggested by the IAEA.
The document itself reported progress with the first stage - Regional
Evaluation. It noted that work on the second stage - Site Identification - would
commence in 1988.</P>
<P>6.14 BNFL had announced on 14 September 1987 in its press release
<I>Waste Storage and Disposal</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that, with the
support of Nirex, it planned to conduct preliminary geological investigations
within its Sellafield site to assess whether the underground conditions might be
suitable for developing a deep disposal facility for ILW. The announcement
explained that a likely form of development could be that of a fully engineered
offshore depository below the seabed accessed by tunnel from the Sellafield
Works. <I>The Way Forward</I> welcomed this BNFL initiative (paragraph 6.3). It
noted that the Sellafield geology was more complex than other seaward-dipping
sediments, along the east of England, but was worth careful scrutiny because
Sellafield is the main source of ILW (paragraph 5.2.7).
</P>
<P>6.15 <I>The Way Forward </I>[COR/203] explained at paragraph 5.2.3 that,
taking the earlier advice from BGS, the five hydrogeological environments
defined as likely to offer potential for siting a deep repository were:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(a) hard rocks in low relief terrain;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(b) small islands;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(c) seaward dipping and offshore sediments;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(d) inland basins of mixed sedimentary rocks; and
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(e) low permeability basement rocks under sedimentary cover (&quot;BUSC&quot;).

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Those environments were the five which had been described in <I>the 1986
BGS/Nirex paper</I> [COR/614]. Environments (a) to (c) were now identified as &quot;<I>the
preferred group</I>&quot;with their hydrogeological structures seen as simple
and consequently more predictable. It was thought likely that those three
environments would yield a sufficient number of sites suitable for investigation
(see paragraph 5.2.5 of <I>The Way Forward</I>).
</P>
<P><U>Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council Responses</U></P>
<P>6.16 In a letter to Nirex of 17 March 1988, reproduced in NRX/12/2, Cumbria
County Council gave its preliminary reactions to <I>The Way Forward</I>
[COR/203]. This followed a resolution of the Planning and Environment
Sub-Committee of the Economy and Environment Committee of the Council, on 14
December 1987, reproduced in NRX/12/2. Particular observations in the letter
which are relevant to site selection include:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>on locations which should be the subject of discussion, the County
Council's view was:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It seems that at this stage the best course is to keep both the hard
rock and coastal sediment options open to enable detailed designs to be evolved
and costed so that Cumbria can be aware of the detailed arguments. This is in
line with the Council's previous request that a general inquiry be held on waste
disposal policy. Without prejudice to any future position which may be taken,
the County Council, therefore, supports BNF's investigation of an off-Sellafield
facility, at least as far as full geophysical research.</I>&quot; (para. e<I>.</I>);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>the County Council &quot;<I>strongly</I>&quot;<I> </I>advocated, in
paragraph (f) of the letter, &quot;<I>early moves to provide proper final
disposal</I>&quot; subject to airing the issue of recoverability fully at a
public inquiry; and 
</LI>
<LI>on local liaison arrangements the County Council's view was:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Nirex should be encouraged to proceed with full investigations which
would include BNF's proposed option. Once the geophysical work is complete and
preferably during it, the County's officers and consultants should have access
to the thinking and judgments on which any conclusions are reached. Nirex should
subject their preferred proposals (perhaps at more than one location) to a full
Environmental Impact Study (as now required under the EEC Environmental
Directive)...</I>&quot;<I> </I>(Sub-para. h(iii).)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.17 Copeland Borough Council's response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
consultation was given in a letter to Nirex of 11 December 1987 reproduced in
NRX/12/2. It noted that local support was &quot;<I>secondary to finding the
'best' site</I>&quot;<I> </I>and emphasised that safety was the central issue.
In a press statement of 14 September 1987 reproduced in NRX/12/1, the Borough
Council had previously given a qualified welcome to the BNFL initiative, and
noted that an ILW facility at Sellafield could well satisfy local concern
regarding the management practices for radioactive waste then existing. The
proposals were described as providing &quot;<I>a basis for serious discussion</I>&quot;
antepenultimate paragraph of the 14 September press statement).
</P>
<P><U>The RWMAC Response to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.18 In July 1988, the RWMAC published its response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
in its <I>Report of the RWMAC Sub-Group on the Nirex Proposals for Deep Site
Investigation</I> (&quot;<I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I>&quot;)
[GOV/412]. It welcomed the definition of the five potential rock environments,
though commenting that they had been presented as essentially simplified
hydrogeological models still to be tested against site-specific locations. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.19"></A>6.19 In response to the question whether an adequate
site which enjoys local support should be preferred to an apparently superior
site which does not, <I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I> [GOV/412]
stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The search for a suitable site must not go on indefinitely; there
is little advantage in searching for a 'Rolls-Royce' solution if Nirex finds the
answer in a 'Jaguar' ... This requires Nirex to find a site with a risk to the
critical group at no more than one in a million per annum and with exposures as
low as reasonably achievable, taking into account economic and social factors.
These criteria must not be relinquished or compromised to meet the assessment
results ... We support, therefore, a pragmatic approach to site selection but on
the basis of a fixed set of assessment criteria.</I>&quot; (para. 12);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However we also recognise the difficulty of identifying more than
one site publicly without attracting the 'not in my back yard' approach.
Consequently, we accept that Nirex may wish to follow its consultation and
technical studies by nominating one site for investigation prior to development,
rather than a short-list of sites requiring site-specific investigation before a
definite choice could be made.</I>&quot; (para. 13.)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><U>University of East Anglia Report on Responses to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.20 The responses to <I>The Way Forward</I> consultation were analysed on
the Company's behalf in a November 1988 report <I>Responses to The Way Forward</I>
by the <I>Environmental Risk Assessment Unit of the School of Environmental
Sciences, University of East Anglia </I>(&quot;<I>the UEA Study</I>&quot;)
[COR/204]. There was found to be no overall unanimity of view. Amongst local
authorities, some supported underground disposal and others on-site storage of
wastes as an alternative. However, local authorities with nuclear installations
in their areas, and advisory and scientific bodies, did not on the whole support
such storage. For all consultees, safety was judged the paramount factor, with
the safe transport of wastes being the next major area of concern. In procedural
terms, there was a general welcome for the consultation exercise and opposition
to use of the Special Development Order procedure for obtaining planning
permission for investigative drilling or subsequent development.
</P>
<P>6.21 Appendix E to<I> PERA </I>[COR/501] summarised the results of <I>the
UEA study </I>[COR/204]. Paragraph 6.7.8 of <I>PERA
</I>stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The only areas of the country where local authorities</I>
<I>did show a measure of support </I>[for deep disposal] <I>were Caithness
(Scotland) and Copeland (Cumbria), which were already familiar with the nuclear
industry developments at Dounreay and Sellafield respectively.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Nirex took that position, and other views expressed from outside the nuclear
industry, into account in its work on site selection. 
</P>
<P><B>Areas of Search
</B></P>
<P>6.22 Nirex's procedures through 1988 and into 1989 followed the IAEA
guidelines outlined at paragraphs 6.3 to 6.9 above. Also, as noted at paragraph
6.1.3 of <I>PERA</I>, the Company had regard for the guidance contained in <I>the
Green Book</I>. The Company's March 1989 announcement nominating Dounreay and
Sellafield as locations for further investigations was accompanied by
publication of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] which gives extensive commentary on the
Company's work on various aspects of the DWR programme following the public
consultation during 1987 and 1988. My description of the site selection
procedures which were followed sets those procedures within the IAEA framework
of guidance. Nirex's first step - the definition of Areas of Search within which
specific sites can subsequently be identified - equated to the IAEA Regional
Evaluation stage.
</P>
<P>6.23 As noted on page 24 of<I> The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] three
potentially suitable types of hydrogeological environment were, on advice from
the BGS, the starting point for the definition in 1987 of Areas of Search.
Paragraph 6.4.1 of <I>PERA </I>[COR/501] explained that reassessments of
suitable rock environments, based on further recommendations from the BGS,
subsequently led to revised Areas of Search, which included the BUSC environment
as well as hard rocks in low relief terrain, small islands and potentially
suitable sedimentary formations. As illustrated in Figure 6.2 of <I>PERA</I>,
some 30% of the land area of Great Britain was classified within the four
hydrogeologically promising environments. 
</P>
<P>6.24 As explained in Chapter 6 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], Nirex engaged
Pieda, Planning, Economic and Development Consultants, to advise on planning
matters. Recognising the need to avoid if at all possible areas designated as
being of national importance from the standpoint of conservation, these were
mapped on a national scale and excluded from further consideration. The areas
concerned included National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Heritage
Coastlines, National Scenic Areas and National Nature Reserves. Also, in the
light of public perception of the acceptability of a repository nearby and the
desirability of minimising disturbance created by its construction and
operation, Local Districts and Boroughs with a population density of more than 5
persons per hectare were excluded from the search. The exclusions in respect of
population density, planning and nature conservation considerations were
illustrated in Figures 3, 4 and 5 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report</I>
[GOV/402] published in November 1989. Figure 6.3 of<I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed
the reduced Areas of Search on land. 
</P>
<P>6.25 In delineating offshore areas of the continental shelf potentially
suitable for the development of a sub-seabed repository, Nirex took advice from
the BGS; the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, a research institute of the
NERC; and Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited.
</P>
<P>6.26 These studies completed, in IAEA terminology, the Regional Evaluation
stage. In subsequent work, consistently with <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>,
consideration was given to some sites outside the Areas of Search which appeared
to offer particularly favourable features coupled with a satisfactory geology
(see paragraph 6.5.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]).
</P>
<P><B>Identification and Review of Specific Sites
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.27"></A>6.27 Maps of the Areas of Search were studied to
identify sites which appeared worthy of consideration for potential DWR
development. As mentioned at paragraph 6.26 above, some sites outside those
areas were also brought into consideration. Consultations were undertaken with
Government Departments and other public sector bodies having significant land
holdings, as well as with Shareholders in Nirex. The Company, working in
conjunction with the BGS and Pieda, identified about 500 sites, many
publicly-owned. Privately-owned sites offered to the Company were incorporated
in the list.
</P>
<P><U>Sieving Process</U></P>
<P>6.28 The Company refined and reduced its list of candidate sites through a
sequential sieving process, taking appropriate expert advice at each stage. This
part of the process was summarised in Figure 6.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and I
describe each stage below.
</P>
<P>6.29 A first sieving was undertaken, in conjunction with the BGS and Pieda,
to evaluate in a preliminary way the specific geological settings of each site
and to take account of environmental and planning factors not covered by the
initial exclusions made in defining Areas of Search. These included a review of
whether sites were designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest and
whether, although in administrative districts of low population density, they
were adjacent to major population centres. About 200 sites with real potential
were carried forward from this stage. 
</P>
<P>6.30 The next stage of the sieving process, conducted in conjunction with
Pieda, was a closer review of site ownership. In particular, certain small
island sites had been included in the list of about 500 in the knowledge that
their ownership was uncertain. Many of those islands remaining on the list of
about 200 were set aside once their ownership was clarified. About 160 sites
were carried forward to the next stage.
</P>
<P>6.31 Then, as described in paragraph 6.5.5 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further consideration was given to the configuration and area of the land
available at each site. Areal guidelines were drawn up with the advice of a
consortium, led by Costain Engineering Limited. and including Ove Arup and
Partners and Electrowatt Engineering Services (UK) Limited., having extensive
experience of major engineering design and construction projects in the nuclear
industry, including waste disposal. The guidelines were, for inland sites, 400
hectares and, for coastal sites, 200 hectares encompassing the maximum likely
requirements for surface facilities, the repository itself being under the sea.
The guidelines were not applied too rigorously as the land-take was seen to be
site-specific, though in <I>PERA</I> an area of 85 hectares was foreseen as
sufficient for a reference repository design under the land at either Dounreay
or Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>6.32 About 120 sites were carried forward from that stage. The geological
setting for each site remaining under consideration was then examined in further
detail by the BGS. A geological profile of each site was prepared to enable
assessment of its likely hydrogeological characteristics. Candidates likely to
perform best in hydrogeological terms were selected, with 39 sites being taken
forward.<BR>
</P>
<P><U>Identification of the Sellafield BVG as a Siting Option</U></P>
<P>6.33 The volcanic rocks beneath the Windscale (now Sellafield) Works were
described in a 1980 report from the Institute of Geological Sciences (now the
BGS) [COR/616 ], as holding &quot;<I>good</I>&quot; potential for ILW disposal
(see Figure 2, page 4 of COR/616). Beneath the Sellafield Works, they were,
however, estimated to lie 900 m bOD and the cost of investigating them at depth
was described as &quot;<I>likely to be prohibitive</I>&quot;. The potential for
burial of radioactive waste within the overlying sandstones was described as &quot;<I>limited</I>&quot;<I></I>although
&quot;<I>repository design could be envisaged whereby any leachate is allowed
to flow through the </I>[sandstone]<I>formation eventually to discharge into
the Irish Sea</I>&quot;. (Page 7-9 of Appendix 7 to COR/616.) 
</P>
<P>6.34 During 1988, desk-based studies of the Sellafield area indicated that,
just inland from the Sellafield Works, under land owned by BNFL, the volcanic
basement rock - the Borrowdale Volcanic Group (&quot;BVG&quot;) - was at an
accessible depth. Therefore, within the terms of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59,
</I>the possibility of siting a repository in that setting was introduced as a
second Sellafield option alongside the original sedimentary option beneath the
Sellafield Works, when the list of 39 locations was reviewed. As noted on page
24 of the April 1989 Nirex publication
<I>Going Forward, the development of a national disposal centre for low and
intermediate level radioactive waste</I> (&quot;<I>Going Forward</I>&quot;)<I></I>[COR/209],
the BVG option was an area of basement rock under sedimentary cover.
</P>
<P>6.35 In reviewing the 39 locations, evaluations of key factors bearing on
site suitability were prepared by Nirex, the BGS, Pieda and a team of specialist
consultants. Post-closure radiological safety, repository design and transport
were covered by, respectively, the UKAEA, the consortium led by Costain and JMP
Consultants. The Company established site availability by consulting the owners.

</P>
<P>6.36 This phase of the procedure focused on progressive evaluation of
specific sites on a comparative basis with interactive expert judgments applied
to determine which sites best justified further assessment. It resulted in 17 of
the land-based sites being taken forward. For the Sellafield site, both the
volcanic and sedimentary options remained under consideration.
</P>
<P>6.37 As set out in paragraphs 6.5.8 to 6.5.14 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further review of the 17 land-based sites was undertaken with advice from the
team of specialist consultants. The respective consultants assessed the merits
of each candidate site in relation to the disposal concept(s) which it could
potentially satisfy. Development Plans were taken into account by considering
publicly-available information on the current and future proposed use of land in
the locality of each site. Preliminary designs and cost estimates were prepared
on a generic basis for repositories constructed and operated in various rock
environments. The BGS advised on uncertainties in the existing geological data
on each site and how readily better data could be obtained by ground
investigations. Ten land-based options - including both the Sellafield
sedimentary option and the Sellafield BVG option - went forward from this
process.
</P>
<P>6.38 As described at paragraph 6.4.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and at
paragraph 6.25 of my evidence, work was done to define areas of the continental
shelf potentially suitable for sub-seabed disposal of radioactive waste. Two
generic offshore options were defined, in hard rock and sedimentary rock. Advice
was taken from Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited and NEI Limited on the
design of offshore access systems.
</P>
<P>6.39 Thus twelve options - 10 on land and two offshore - were carried
forward into a quantified comparative evaluation. Multi-attribute decision
analysis (&quot;MADA&quot;) was employed for this purpose with the advice of
Professor Lawrence Phillips of the Decision Analysis Unit of the London School
of Economics and Political Science.
</P>
<P><U>MADA</U></P>
<P>6.40 MADA is established as an appropriate tool for applying logic
systematically to help make choices between options which have to be assessed
with respect to multiple and varied attributes. Paragraph 4.23 of the report of
the Study Group drawn from the members of the RWMAC and ACSNI, <I>Site
Selection for Radioactive Waste Disposal Facilities and the Protection of Human
Health</I>,<I>March 1995</I>, (&quot;<I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>&quot;)
[GOV/409] noted its use by the Department of the Environment in assessment of
options for radioactive waste management. Under the MADA process, the weightings
applied to scores on different attributes of each option depend both on the
intrinsic importance of the attribute concerned and its discriminatory relevance
given the characteristics of the set from which choice is being made. Generally,
if on a particular attribute the options score close together then a relatively
lower weight is appropriate for that attribute.
</P>
<P>6.41 A note supplied to Cumbria County Council in November 1994, reproduced
on pages 97-119 of <I>the Report by the Director of Economy and Environment
Cumbria County Council, December </I>1994 (&quot;<I>the November 1994 Note</I>&quot;)
(COR/104 pages 97&#173;119), described how all the 12 short-listed options were
seen to have the potential to meet the post-closure safety target, which <I>the
Green Book </I>(paragraph 3.8) had expressed as equivalent to an individual
annual dose not exceeding 0.1 mSv. Moreover, the established radiological safety
principle, recently reaffirmed in paragraph 78 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] and recognised in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>
[GOV/409] (see paragraphs 3.37-3.38), is that, provided certain conditions are
met, no further reduction in risk should be sought if the estimated risk to the
public is below the target level. Thus, in ranking the 12 options, the margins
by which particular sites might give an estimated annual dose below 0.1 mSv were
relatively unimportant. Accordingly, a low weight was applied to this site
attribute in the MADA process.
</P>
<P>6.42 The MADA procedure, as detailed in <I>the November 1994 Note
</I>[COR/104 pages 97-119] took account of the site attributes grouped into four
collective branches of costs, robustness, safety and environment. Thirty
individual attributes were accorded weightings through a structured process of
expert elicitation and judgment facilitated by Professor Phillips.
Representatives of the consultants BGS, JMP Consultants, Pieda and the UKAEA, as
well as Nirex staff, participated in this process.
</P>
<P>6.43 The assessment and scoring of each site's performance under each of the
30 attributes within the four branches was undertaken by experts using the best
available data and information on each site. Definitions of the 30 attributes
and information about scores were summarised in Annex 1 to <I>the November 1994
Note</I> (see pages 111-119 of COR/104).
</P>
<P>6.44 Information on geological conditions - relevant to scoring a number of
attributes - was supplied by the BGS, drawing on the national geological records
which it maintains and site visits. Environmental information took account of
data obtained by Pieda, from local authorities and from visits to each location
to assess potential impacts.
</P>
<P>6.45 Designs and cost estimates for repositories appropriate to the
geological settings at each land-based location were prepared by the consortium
led by Costain and, for the offshore options, by Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons
Limited and NEI Limited. Those engineering consultants also provided estimates
of operational safety. JMP Consultants advised on the design of transport
systems, their environmental and safety implications and transport costs for
each site. UKAEA assessed the potential post-closure safety performance of the
different geological settings.
</P>
<P>6.46 As explained in <I>the November 1994 Note</I> (COR/104 pages 97-119),
in the base case for analysis the weights set for the four collective branches
of attributes were as follows:

<P>6.47 Cost was a discriminating attribute across the 12 options and was given
a weighting of 71.4 percentage points. With about half the wastes for deep
disposal arising at Sellafield and rail infrastructure in place there, transport
costs were a major influence on the ranking for that site. By contrast, the base
case weighting attached to local experience of nuclear matters - on which
Sellafield also scored well - was only 1.3 percentage points within the 7.1
percentage points for 'environment' factors overall. 
</P>
<P>6.48 Paragraph 4.1.8 of<I> the November 1994 Note </I>(see page 106 of
[COR/104]) explained that, in the MADA analysis, the Sellafield BVG option
ranked first on the basis of its attribute scores and base case weightings.
Under sensitivity analysis, in which weightings were altered to test the effect
on overall evaluations, the Sellafield BVG was consistently numbered amongst a
leading group of sites which tended to score consistently well. Dounreay
generally scored in the top half of the rankings. 
</P>
<P><U>Wide range of options</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.49"></A>6.49 The Company's procedures, as I have described
them, kept a wide range of options under review through the definition of Areas
of Search and in the Identification and Review of Specific Sites. As well as
land-based options, on the British mainland and small islands, there was study
of offshore options involving sub-seabed disposal via purpose-built structures.
The differing levels of potential radiological performance of widely differing
siting options were taken into account. Thus, the shortlist of 12 sites was
composed of land-based candidates from each of the four rock environments - at
least the leading two options within each environment - and offshore concepts in
hard rock and sedimentary rock.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.50"></A>6.50 Results from an early exercise to assess the
potential safety performance of the four generic environments on land, the
offshore options and the Sellafield basement setting were given in Table 5.2 of
<I>PERA </I>[COR/501]. The results suggested that an offshore repository in
hard rock under deep water would give the smallest post-closure dose to an
individual. Inclusive of the effects of other processes not then captured in the
MASCOT computer program (which is described in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para4.10">4.10</A> of Dr Hooper's evidence <B>PE/NRX/15</B>)
the estimated individual dose for the groundwater pathway was 0.0006 mSv per
year. As explained in <I>PERA </I>in paragraph 6.6.10, conventional safety
considerations told against the offshore options. Under the MADA evaluation the
hard-rock offshore option - despite an indicated post-closure radiological risk
markedly lower than others - was not a preferred choice overall.
</P>
<P><U>Selection of Dounreay and Sellafield for Further Investigation</U></P>
<P>6.51 As stated at paragraph 6.7.2 of <I>PERA </I>(COR/501), while the site
selection process was founded on the approach which I have now described above,
Nirex &quot;<I>also sought to explore the broader social context in which it is
required to discharge its technical responsibilities</I>&quot;. Both <I>the
November 1994 Note</I>, in paragraph 4.1.9 (see page 106 of COR/104), and<I>PERA</I>
(see paragraphs 6.7.2-6.7.11) noted that, through the Way Forward consultation,
only in Caithness and Copeland had local authorities shown a degree of support
for deep disposal. Also, as noted at paragraphs 6.16 and 6.17 above, both
Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council had responded constructively
to the BNFL initiative of September 1987 to undertake preliminary geological
investigations at Sellafield. Nirex's decision in 1989 was, as a first step, to
limit further investigations to Dounreay and Sellafield, as two short-listed
locations &quot;<I>where there is a measure of public support</I>&quot; (see
<I>PERA</I>, paragraph 6.7.11). The priorities set as a result of applying that
consideration were not out of line with the results of the MADA evaluation, as
described at paragraph 6.48 above.
</P>
<P>6.52 The existence of a measure of public support in the Sellafield area is
confirmed by the opinion survey results mentioned at paragraphs 4.26 to 4.29
above.
</P>
<P>6.53 The RWMAC visited the Company in November 1988 to seek an update on
site selection studies and a sub-group of RWMAC reviewed the site selection
process adopted by Nirex (see paragraphs 2.1 and 2.24 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth
Annual Report</I>). As I have already described, the Government's 1989
acceptance of the Nirex recommendation on Dounreay and Sellafield took account
of the RWMAC advice on the site selection procedures adopted by the Company (see
Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report, </I>November 1989 [GOV/402]).
The advice described the approach which had been followed by Nirex as &quot;<I>defensible</I>&quot;and
accepted &quot;<I>the logic in identifying the two areas for further evaluation
which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P><B>Concentration of Investigations at Sellafield
</B></P>
<P>6.54 As explained in Chapter 9 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], subject to the
progress of the geological investigations, and specifically to the start of
on-site work by mid-1989, it was considered that after a period of some 18
months - i.e. by the autumn of 1989 - it should be possible to reach a first
decision point. At that point, it would be determined whether either Sellafield
or Dounreay or both sites would be suitable for construction of a repository or
whether other locations should be evaluated. Detailed ground investigations
would then follow at the preferred site, together with further detailed studies
of all relevant aspects of repository development to support preparation of a
Detailed Environmental and Radiological Assessment to accompany a planning
application to construct a repository.
</P>
<P>6.55 Conceptual design illustrations for a DWR in hard rock given in Figure
4.2 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed an Underground Laboratory, at the
repository horizon, adjacent to the access shaft. A Sellafield brochure
accompanying <I>Going Forward </I>[included in COR/208] in 1989 explained in
more detail that, once DWR planning permission had been granted:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the first stages will be to construct the surface facilities,
the main entry shafts and an experimental area. This experimental area will be
used to further develop the understanding of the behaviour of the surrounding
geology. This will be of value both to the safety research teams and the
construction teams, who will require detailed information on the physical
properties of the rock in order to continue to refine the safety analysis and
disposal centre designs.</I>&quot; (page 8.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.56 A Briefing Note prepared for external use on 6 December 1989 gave the
Company's updated view on the next steps. <I>Preliminary Investigations at
Sellafield and Dounreay </I>(reproduced in NRX/12/1) reported that no planning
approvals had been received for borehole drilling at either Dounreay or
Sellafield except that for Borehole 1 at Sellafield, granted by the Secretary of
State on appeal on 21 March 1989. Nomination of a preferred site for further
investigation was expected in 1992. Following the further investigation, it was
envisaged that a planning application to construct a DWR would lead to a Public
Inquiry in 1994. The Briefing Note explained that future underground
investigations:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... may include the drilling of horizontal boreholes to intersect
features of interest from a central underground research facility.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.57 Shaft sinking and investigations underground were planned to be
undertaken following grant of planning permission for the DWR. Results from
surface-based investigation alone were expected to be sufficient for the safety
assessment which would underpin a decision to submit a planning application to
develop a repository. My letter of 21 January 1992 to County Council, reproduced
in NRX/12/2, explained a forward programme which reflected that continuing
assumption.
</P>
<P><U>Preliminary Geological Results</U></P>
<P>6.58 In line with the announced intention to nominate a preferred site for
further investigations, in July 1991 the Company reviewed preliminary results
available from the geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and
Sellafield. These results were not fed into models of post-closure safety
performance or, at that stage, subjected to formal interpretation. But, as in
1989, both were judged to have the potential to support an acceptable
post-closure safety case. Much further work was recognised to be required before
a long-term safety case could be made. 
</P>
<P><B>Conclusion
</B></P>
<P>6.59 The Company was conscious of the cost of geological investigations - in
1991 the cost of drilling a single deep borehole was typically &#163;5 million -
and of the demands on highly-specialised scientific manpower of investigating
two sites in parallel. The risks to the programme of concentrating as planned on
a single preferred site were judged acceptable. Accordingly, it was decided to
concentrate investigations on Sellafield in the light of the initial results
from physical investigations, the major transport advantages of Sellafield
viewed as a candidate repository location, and the fact that expert assessments
of other attributes of the two locations showed little change. The intention was
to decide on an application for repository planning permission in October 1992,
subject to the results from on-going safety assessment work.
</P>
<P>6.60 The Company's decision and the background to it were explained in a
Nirex news release of 23 July 1991 <I>UK Nirex Chooses Sellafield as Preferred
Site </I>reproduced in NRX/12/1. The news release stated that approximately 60%
of the radioactive waste destined for the repository arises from BNFL operations
at Sellafield. Dounreay was explained to remain a reserve option should
Sellafield prove unsuitable. It was stated that a full analysis of the Dounreay
results, alongside those from Sellafield, would be undertaken prior to a
decision to submit a planning application for a repository. Letters of 22 July
1991 from the Company to Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council
(reproduced in NRX/12/2) explained:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The decision to concentrate on Sellafield does not mean that we
have yet decided to submit a planning application for the construction of a
repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><U>Publication of Dounreay Site Investigation Results</U></P>
<P>6.61 In December 1994, Nirex published detailed geological and
hydrogeological interpretations of Dounreay based on the investigations done
there. The findings were summarised in a report entitled
<I>The Geology and Hydrogeology of Dounreay, Executive Summary, Nirex Report
653, December 1994</I> [COR/506].</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFSite"></A>7. THE RCF AND SITE CONFIRMATION</B></P>
<P>7.1 Through the second half of 1991 and into 1992, the Company continued to
review geological and hydrogeological results from Sellafield to assess the
implications of these for the potential post-closure safety performance of a DWR
located in the BVG. By the end of 1991, four deep boreholes had been completed.
Further information from geophysical surveys was also available. A preliminary
geological interpretation based on these data was provided to Cumbria County
Council as<I> Nirex Report 263 The Geology and Hydrogeology of Sellafield</I>
[COR/502] in March 1992. <I>Nirex Report 268 Sellafield Hydrogeology</I>
[COR/521], giving a preliminary hydrogeological interpretation, was published in
August 1992. 
</P>
<P>7.2 In May 1992, the Company reviewed early results from a preliminary
safety assessment for a DWR at Sellafield based on data and interpretations
available from the site investigations. The indicated peak mean risk to a
representative member of the critical group via the groundwater pathway was
below the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> risk target for a repository, which was encouraging.
The Company recognised, however, that the estimates were preliminary and that
other conceptual models of the hydrogeology, some of which would imply worse
repository performance, remained plausible given the limited data available.
Drawing firm conclusions from interpretations and modelling based on data from
an actual site - as distinct from desk-based simplifications - was proving a
more extended task than was envisaged in 1991. 
</P>
<P>7.3 Nirex decided to continue the drilling programme at Sellafield and to
postpone a decision on submitting a repository planning application. The revised
aim was to reach a decision on submitting a repository planning application by
the autumn of 1993, based on interpretation of results from the Company's
continuing site investigation programme. The rescheduling was explained in
letters of 1 June 1992 from the Company to Cumbria County Council, Copeland
Borough Council and copied to the Lake District Special Planning Board and the
Six Parishes Committee, reproduced in NRX/12/2. The overall picture was seen by
the Company as &quot;<I>so far, so good</I>&quot;, as described in the Nirex
news release of 2 June 1992, <I>Further Investigations by UK Nirex at
Sellafield</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.4"></A>7.4 Following the May 1992 decision, Nirex continued
to review the forward programme. To provide an adequate basis for reaching a
decision on proposing repository development, more certainty was required on the
potential safety performance of a DWR at Sellafield. In particular, firmer
interpretations of the hydrogeology were needed, in which the range of
conceptualisations supportable by expert judgments could be reduced.
</P>
<P>7.5 The Company concluded that an early planning application to develop a
repository at Sellafield would be unlikely to be approved. The assessment work
on post-closure safety was giving encouraging results. However, without
confirmatory information from exploratory excavation, the Company judged the
picture would be too uncertain to allow the authorising Departments to give a
meaningful &quot;<I>provisional view</I>&quot;<I> </I>on whether a proposed
repository &quot;<I>would be suitable for authorisation</I>&quot; before a
public inquiry were &quot;<I>held into whether planning permission should be
granted to construct such a facility</I>&quot;. This was the procedure provided
for at paragraph 1.3 on page 6 of <I>the Green Book</I> [GOV/302].
</P>
<P>7.6 The only practicable way forward was to undertake the planned
exploratory excavations before, rather than after, submitting a planning
application for a DWR. In September 1992, the Company agreed a contingent,
staged approach to the repository programme with only the RCF being developed
initially. The governing concept was that of a 'super-borehole', implying
minimum outlays and environmental disturbance.
</P>
<P>7.7 Development of the RCF will give the necessary opportunity to perform in
situ experiments and will be part of the Site Confirmation stage defined in
Chapter6 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>[GOV/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.8"></A>7.8 If, during Site Confirmation, the Company judges
the prospective post-closure safety performance of a repository in the
Sellafield BVG to be acceptable and repository construction is confirmed to be
safe at acceptable cost, then it would be ready to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield. As described in paragraph 9.12 below, it would need to
be confident before making such a proposal that the regulatory authorities would
foresee no impediment, in the light of the information available to them, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.9"></A>7.9 In the UK, Final Site Selection, in the
terminology of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>, is a matter for the developer
who, having selected the site, will submit a planning application for
development of the DWR and applications for authorisation of waste disposal
under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 and for licensing of the site under
the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. The &quot;<I>appropriate authorities</I>&quot;
- including the local planning authorities and the regulatory authorities -
would thus be provided with information on the proposal &quot;<I>to permit
decisions to be made</I>&quot;under those statutes&quot;<I>for final site
selection and subsequent licensing</I>&quot; (see section 6.5 of <I>IAEA Safety
Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]). Such decisions would of course be subject to the
Company satisfying all planning and environmental requirements relating to
development of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with the County and District Councils</U></P>
<P>7.10 On 14 July 1992, Copeland Borough Council adopted a formal resolution
on the Nirex Investigation Programme, as indicated in a letter to the Company of
10 August 1992, reproduced in NRX/12/2. It provided, inter alia, that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Consideration of an underground rock laboratory, which is site
specific, be supported in principle without any commitment to the repository
proposal</I>&quot;<I>.</I> (para. d.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.11 During 15-17 September 1992 the Company led a visit to the sp rock
laboratory at Oskarshamn in Sweden and to the underground repository at
Olkiluoto in Finland. A number of officers and Members from Cumbria County
Council and Copeland Borough Council joined the visit, during which there was
informal discussion about the possibility of the concept of a site-specific rock
laboratory at Sellafield.
</P>
<P>7.12 The Nirex Technical Director wrote to Cumbria County Council and to
Copeland Borough Council on 7 October 1992 about the Company's RCF plans (see
NRX/12/2). The <I>Sellafield Repository Project, A Rock Characterisation
Facility Consultative Document, </I>(&quot;<I>Nirex Report 327</I>&quot;)
[COR/504] was published on 21 October 1992 and gave a fuller description of the
purposes of the RCF. These included providing information required to make a
firmer assessment of the long-term safety of a repository, confirming
assumptions regarding repository location and design and enabling cost estimates
to be refined.
</P>
<P><U>Development of the RCF Concept</U></P>
<P>7.13 Subsequent to the September 1992 decision to propose the RCF as a
free-standing development, the Company developed the concept in detail. It took
account of responses to <I>Nirex Report 327</I> [COR/504] and, in refining the
scientific work to be carried out in the RCF programme, of further information
emerging from the continuing programme of surface-based investigations. A
project team developed detailed specifications and costings for the RCF. 
</P>
<P>7.14 In March 1993 planning permission was granted by Cumbria County Council
for temporary development needed to drill RCF monitoring and centre-line
boreholes at Longlands Farm. These boreholes were required to build the
necessary understanding of existing geological and hydrogeological conditions at
the site, and subsequently to monitor the effects of RCF construction on those
conditions. Updated interpretations of the Sellafield geology and hydrogeology
were published in <I>the Geology and Hydrogeology of the Sellafield Area:
Interim Assessment. December 1993</I>, <I>Nirex Report 524</I>, [COR/517] and
the accompanying <I>Nirex Report 525 Scientific Update 1993</I> [COR/505]
explained the current status of the Company's Science Programme, including the
continued development of its approach to modelling of post-closure safety
performance of a repository.
</P>
<P>7.15 In January 1994, with the borehole drilling at Longlands Farm well
under way, the Company adopted as a key objective the securing of early planning
approval for the RCF. Following detailed consultation through the NLG about a
draft Environmental Statement, a planning application and accompanying
documentation were submitted on 29 July 1994.
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Review"></A>8. REVIEW OF THE NIREX APPROACH</B></P>
<P><B>Government Views on Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>8.1 A recommendation in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I> [GOV/409]
(see paragraph 5.35) was that, for repository site selection decisions already
made, there be a careful, conscious matching of the process adopted against the
multiple phases of a new approach recommended by the Group. In response, in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] (paras. 106-110) the Government set down the
results of a consideration of whether Nirex has adopted a reasonable approach in
its investigations so far.
</P>
<P>8.2 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> describes how the Government accepted
Nirex's 1989 recommendation to explore first Dounreay and Sellafield to decide
on their suitability as sites for a repository. It notes the subsequent
concentration of investigations on Sellafield because of the advantages that
that site offered in terms of transport, and that the RCF would form part of
those investigations. It makes no recommendation for a different approach.
</P>
<P>8.3 At paragraph 110 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> the Government
states the following:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The matters about which the Secretary of State has said he
specifically wishes to be informed by the public inquiry into the RCF concern
the local impact of the facility's construction. The Government has already
promised to hold a full public inquiry into an application for the repository

from this procedure.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Views of Independent Bodies on the RCF Proposal
</B></P>
<P>8.4 Independent bodies have indicated their support for the RCF proposal, as
Dr Holmes explains more fully in Section 7 of his Proof of Evidence. I mention
here briefly the views of the RWMAC and of a Royal Society Study Group.
</P>
<P>8.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
states (paragraph 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) [COR/605],
published in November 1994, concluded in Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause. International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>IAEA Site Selection Framework
</B></P>
<P>8.7 The Nirex approach, including the RCF as an essential part of the Site
Confirmation stage, is consistent with the recommendations in<I> IAEA Safety
Series No. 59</I> [GOV/501]. It is also consistent with a Safety Guide published
by the IAEA in 1994 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 111 - G-4.1 Siting of Geological
Disposal Facilities A Safety Guide - A Publication within the RADWASS Programme</I>
[GOV/507]. That document refines the description of the site selection process.
It distinguishes explicitly a screening phase - comparable to that adopted by
Nirex - which is applied after geological, hydrogeological and other features
are considered, within the Area Survey Stage (see paragraph 322). The next stage
is labelled &quot;<I>Site Characterization</I>&quot;(see paragraph 303 of
GOV/507) rather than Site Identification. Its result is &quot;<I>identification
of one or more preferred sites for further study</I>&quot;(see paragraph 325)<I></I>in
the Site Confirmation Stage through which &quot;<I>a decision on site
suitability is made</I>&quot;(see paragraph 332)</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFProgramme"></A>9. THE RCF WITHIN THE FORWARD PROGRAMME</B></P>
<P>9.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence, I cover the way in which
information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the regulatory
authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development of a DWR
at Sellafield. I also discuss the RCF programme in the context of the total cost
and duration of the provisional programme for bringing a DWR into operation at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>Information Required for Decision to Propose Development of a DWR
</B></P>
<P>9.2 Paragraph 8.5 of <I>the HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] refers
to the Inspectorates providing &quot;<I>an informed input to the planning
process</I>&quot; in the context of consideration of a proposed disposal
facility &quot;<I>under the town and country planning legislation</I>&quot;.
Paragraphs 4.3 and 4.4 of GOV/307 state, in respect of a major radioactive waste
disposal facility: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In determining a planning application, the planning authority may
consult the Inspectorates on possible environmental impacts of the development.
The Inspectorates will also comment on whether or not there appears to be any
impediment, in the light of the information available to them at the time of
being consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the
categories and quantities intended. Similarly, the HSE would be consulted on
whether there appears to be any impediment to granting a site licence.&quot;</I>
(paragraph 4.3)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Notwithstanding any provisional views given by the Inspectorates
at the planning stage, the authorisations under RSA93 and licensing by the HSE
under the NI Act 1965 will remain legally separate from decisions under the town
and country planning legislation. Decisions on whether to grant an authorisation
or a licence might not be taken until later stages.</I>&quot; (paragraph 4.4).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.3 <I>The HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] set out for
consultation a staged application approach as a possible means of facilitating
the timely resolution of an application for authorisation of a major radioactive
waste disposal facility. In its October 1994 response to <I>the HMIP
Consultation Document</I> Nirex stated in paragraph 5 of the Executive Summary
(reproduced in NRX/12/4) that such an option:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>would be welcome in managing the commercial and strategic
risk associated with such a project, and Nirex has for some time envisaged the
provision of safety assessment information to the Inspectorates on a progressive
basis related to the lengthy schedule for repository development</I>.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.4 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] states in paragraph 62 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>For major projects, it is expected that developers will make early
applications for disposal authorisations. This would be at about the same time
that they seek full planning permission for the project, although it would be
determined separately. The regulators would then be able to decide on
authorisations before major commitments of money and effort had been made. If
the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted containing
conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval to start
operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned. ... The
procedure will be available under existing legislation for any applicants who
choose this route. They will not be required to do so, but the greater certainty
it could provide will give applicants an incentive to apply early in the process
in appropriate cases. Further guidance will be given in the revised and updated
version of </I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to the administration of
the Act<I>.</I>&quot; </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.5 Pending evaluation of a final version of HMIPs guidance document and of
a revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to
the administration of the Act</I>, the Companys working assumption as described
in Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph <A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">6.21</A>
of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) is that it will be appropriate to make an application for
authorisation under RSA93 at about the same time as an application for planning
permission to develop the repository. The time at which it is decided whether to
make those applications will constitute the first key decision point in
development of a repository. A decision by the regulatory authorities whether to
approve the start of waste disposal operations, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, would be a subsequent key decision point.   
</P>
<P>Dialogue with the Regulatory Authorities
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.6"></A>9.6 Before finally selecting a particular site at
which to propose repository development, at the first decision point, Nirex
needs to engage in a dialogue with the regulatory authorities about the
developing post-closure safety assessment of a repository located at that site.
The assessment will comprise results from probabilistic calculations and
consideration of a specific repository option against the Inspectorates'
principles and requirements. Through such a dialogue, it will be possible to
take a progressively firmer view about whether, in the light of the assessment,
the regulatory authorities are likely to see any impediment to the eventual
authorisation of a repository for waste disposal and grant of a site licence.
</P>
<P>9.7 By agreement, between 1991 and 1994, Nirex and the authorising
Departments exchanged information and views on Nirex's developing approach to
the evaluation of the Sellafield site. Discussions are in progress about a new
agreement, providing for a more structured approach to dialogue between Nirex
and the regulatory authorities prior to submission of any application for
authorisation of a specific repository option at Sellafield under RSA93. The
principles would be similar to the arrangements envisaged at paragraph 4.1 of
GOV/307 under which the developer of a repository would agree with the
regulatory authorities in advance a programme for the progressive supply of
information once an application is submitted for authorisation of waste
disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.8"></A>9.8 Dr Mellors evidence describes the three phases of
work in the RCF programme, illustrated in
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>.
The Phase 1 work provides for shaft sinking which, as Dr Holmes describes in his
evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of
<B>PE/NRX/13</B>), has been identified as playing a major part in the process
of model validation. Dr Mellor explains (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#Para5.9">5.9</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>) that results
from Phase 1 will be released as they are obtained from each sector of the
shaft-sinking programme. They will be an important input to the dialogue with
the regulators which I have described.    
</P>
<P><U>Requirements for the First Decision Point</U></P>
<P>9.9 Any choice of Sellafield as the site for repository development could
not responsibly be made unless Nirex's intention were to develop the repository
on grant of permission. The current target cost for constructing the repository
is &#163;805 million at 1995 prices (see <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>).
Additionally, depending when planning permission were granted, there could be
tens of &#163;millions of expenditure on continuing studies in the RCF (see
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>) to provide information needed for the key
decision point at which the regulatory authorities decide whether to approve the
start of waste disposal operations.
</P>
<P>9.10 Given the scale of the financial commitment which would follow, any
decision to propose development of a repository will obviously require a more
confident assessment of post-closure safety than did the 1992 decision to
continue the site investigation programme through the RCF. Through dialogue with
the regulators - informed by review of information which will come from the
continuing surface-based investigations and from the RCF programme - the Company
will be able to reach a view at any point as to how far the regulatory
principles and requirements for a repository are in its view effectively met or,
alternatively, how confident it is of satisfying them at the culmination of the
authorisation process.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.11"></A>9.11 Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.23">6.23</A> of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) explains
the position which the Company needs to have reached in respect of the key
matters before it could decide to propose development of a repository. Those
matters are confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution;
establishing that changes in the geological and hydrogeological setting,
following repository construction or naturally induced changes, would not result
in new pathways for water flow which would significantly impair repository
performance; and reaching provisional decisions on, and establishing a basis for
future optimisation of, key design parameters for a repository. Without
assurance of that kind in these three areas, the Company could not satisfy
itself that a repository at a particular site would meet regulatory requirements
and principles for operational and post-closure safety and that it could be
constructed safely and at acceptable cost. Paragraph 7.8 of this Proof of
Evidence explained that those are the key matters bearing on a decision to
propose repository development.
</P>
<P>9.12 As I described at paragraph 9.2 above, <I>the HMIP Consultation
Document</I> [GOV/307] states that, in the context of the determination of a
planning application to develop a DWR, the regulatory authorities will comment
to the planning authority whether there appears to be any impediment, in the
light of the information available to them at the time of being consulted, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. The
Company will keep under continuing review how far the results from its
investigations at Sellafield meet the requirements that I have described above
and whether its dialogue with the regulatory authorities had established that
those authorities would see no such impediment. Unless and until it were
confident that the regulatory authorities would foresee no such impediment, the
Company would not propose development of a repository. Recognising the nature of
the repository system, Government policy stresses that risk calculations can
only <B>inform </B>a judgment about the safety of a disposal facility. It
points out that &quot;<I>other technical factors, including ones of a more
qualitative nature, will also need to be considered</I>...&quot; (paragraph 78
of GOV/208). So it is necessary for the Company to adopt a contingent approach
to deciding whether and when to propose development of a repository, taking
account of the progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities.
</P>
<P><B>Timing 
</B></P>
<P>9.13 As described in Section 5 of this Proof of Evidence, the Governments
1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review concluded that Nirex should
work towards developing the DWR without any unnecessary delay and that, once a
suitable site has been found, it should be constructed as soon as reasonably
practicable. Specifically, as noted in paragraph 5.21 of this Proof of Evidence,
<I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> stated in paragraph 10.39: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The review has concluded that the common interest is in working
towards developing the repository without unnecessary delay, but allowing
appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety case and compliance
with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <I>Department of the Environment News Release</I> of 9 May 1995
[GOV/213] stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] stated in paragraph 101:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The precise timetable will depend on the granting of planning
consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the establishment
of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In addition, at paragraph 44 of GOV/208 the Government referred to &quot;<I>its
policies in relation to the timely disposal of waste</I>&quot;.
</P>
<P><U>Conditional Targets</U></P>
<P>9.14 As foreshadowed in 1994 in <I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>
[GOV/306] the Government policy statements given above overtake the provisions
of <I>the 1990 White Paper </I>[GOV/204] which referred to &quot;<I>speed up</I>&quot;
of Nirexs site investigations and to a proposal for development of a repository
coming &quot;<I>to a public inquiry as soon as possible</I>&quot; (paragraph
15.38 of GOV/204). As it made clear in &quot;<I>UK Nirex Report 710. United
Kingdom Nirex Limited Response to Department of Environment Consultation on
Radioactive Waste Management Policy - 14 October 1994</I>&quot; [&quot;<I>the
Nirex Response to the DoE Consultation</I>&quot;] [NRX/12/3] the Company
welcomes that change of emphasis, given the underlying requirements of careful
scientific characterisation of a repository site. Nirex believes the change
should also be helpful to public confidence (see paragraph 6.6.9 of NRX/12/3). 
</P>
<P>9.15 As I have described in paragraph 5.23 above, <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208] recognised that additional costs incurred in radioactive
waste disposal should be set against the benefits arising from improvements in
safety achieved. The &quot;<I>level of safety, and the resources required to
achieve it, should not be inconsistent with those accepted in other spheres of
human activity</I>&quot; (paragraph 51). The Companys approach is consistent
with that Government policy. As noted in paragraphs 6.6.10 to 6.7.2 of NRX/12/3,
on behalf of its customers Nirex must work to provide a deep repository
cost-effectively. An important requirement is to ensure that, subject to the
thorough approach to the scientific issues which is necessary to demonstrate
that regulatory requirements are met, and to the need to sustain public
acceptance, the repository be brought into operation without unnecessary delay.
As with any major capital programme - and in economic terms the major sums
invested in conceptual studies and site characterisation are akin to capital
spending - effective control of costs requires the avoidance of avoidable delays
during the development and construction stages.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.16"></A>9.16 One cost of unnecessary delay is the extra
interest which would accrue on the Companys financing. For the year to 31 March
1996, interest accruing on Shareholder loans under the Shareholders' Agreement
is projected at &#163;33 million. The annual interest charge will tend to rise
as the Companys borrowings increase through time. In addition, if the overall
duration of the Companys programme to first emplacement of waste in a repository
is extended, there would be substantial extra outlays involved in keeping
certain contractor teams and Company teams in place over a longer period. Under
both these headings, any delays in proceeding with Phases 2 and 3 of the RCF of
the kind discussed by Dr Holmes in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.30">6.30</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
would bring substantial additional costs.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.17"></A>9.17 Because the project schedule itself is an
important influence on total costs and tariff levels to customers, and because
it is necessary to give a clear focus to the work of the scientific and
engineering teams engaged on the DWR programme, it is appropriate for Nirex as
the developer to work towards a target date for repository operation. For the
future, as in the past, it is recognised that the target will, appropriately, be
kept under review in the light of developments.    
</P>
<P><U>Views of the RWMAC</U></P>
<P>9.18 In October 1994, in <I>the</I> <I>RWMAC Response on: the Department
of Environment's Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I> [GOV/413],
the RWMAC stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>Nirex's site investigation programme, the development of the
repository safety case and the appropriate authorisation and planning procedures
must all be carried out rigorously. There are obviously some programme issues
that are not in Nirex's control and it may be inappropriate to set fixed
deadlines for the operation of the repository.</I>&quot; (paragraph 58)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>... <I>Clear focusing and targeting are essential to carry forward the
complex repository project. ... </I>&quot; (paragraph 59.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These views are very much in line with the Companys approach to
target-setting within the Government's policy that appropriate time be allowed
for establishment of a sound safety case and compliance with the necessary
planning and regulatory requirements and that no precise deadline should be set
for that process. 
</P>
<P><U>Timing of a Decision to Propose Repository Development</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.19"></A>9.19 The Company has long emphasised that its
forward site investigation programme, undertaken in the RCF and otherwise, can
only be planned on a flexible and provisional basis. <I>Nirex Report 327 </I>[COR/504]
explained this in the context of results expected to flow progressively from the
RCF programme. Specifically, paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504 stated that if,
but only if, the results expected to be gathered during the RCF shaft sinking &quot;<I>prove
to be essentially confirmatory of geological and hydrogeological assessments
derived from surface-based investigations</I>&quot; (paragraph 1.13 of COR/504)
then a planning application for a repository could be submitted within six
months or so of excavating down to the most promising horizon for repository
development. It was emphasised that &quot;<I>more extended underground work
might be required before a judgment is possible about such an application</I>&quot;
(paragraph 1.13 COR/504).
</P>
<P>9.20 As Dr Holmes makes clear in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
Nirex continues to assume that a decision to propose repository development
could be made on the basis of the results from the scientific programme
associated with Phase 1 of the RCF, which now runs for approximately four years
and is planned to finish approximately 9 months after completion of the shafts.
As I have explained in paragraph 9.8 above, those results will be released
progressively, sector by sector, to the regulatory authorities. They will also
be published. However, consistently with paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504, Dr
Holmes also explains that further investigations, in RCF Phase 2, and possibly
Phase 3, could be necessary before a decision is made on repository development.
</P>
<P><U>Current Planning Timetable</U></P>
<P>9.21 In addition to scheduling adjustments necessitated by flexible
responses to information emerging from the characterisation of a natural rock
environment, outcomes from the process of obtaining planning permissions for
necessary investigatory developments can affect the Companys planning.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.22"></A>9.22 The Companys present planning assumption is
that if planning permission for the RCF were granted by the Secretary of State
in mid-1996 and if the Phase 1 results provide an adequate basis for deciding to
make a planning application to develop a repository at Sellafield then first
waste emplacement in a repository will be possible in the first half of 2011.
Nirex will not be declaring a new target date for first waste emplacement - be
it 2011 or some other date - until the Secretary of States decision on the
current appeal is known.
</P>
<P>9.23 Within that overall planning schedule, it is assumed that sinking of
the South Shaft would begin in December 1996 and the Phase 1 Science Programme
would be completed in February 2001. It is expected that the scientific
programme associated with Phase 1 could enable the Company to decide at that
point whether to propose repository development. The first decision point could
on that basis be timed for February 2001 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>9.24 The progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities would be a
crucial consideration in the decision. It is envisaged that an assessment of
post-closure safety would have been submitted to the regulatory authorities
ahead of the earliest date for the first decision point, to provide a basis for
review of key input assumptions. Confidence in the assumptions and judgments
made on the hydrogeological system would be provided by the RCF results as they
were progressively released through Phase1.
</P>
<P>9.25 Assuming that planning permission for a DWR could be granted 3 years
after submission of the planning application and allowing approximately 7 years
for repository construction points to the planning date of first half 2011 for
first emplacement of waste in a repository at Sellafield. Given the many issues
outside Nirex control, that date is indicative. If it were achieved then 22
years would have elapsed since detailed investigations began at Sellafield in
1989. Within that period, 15 years would have been devoted to activities
preceding the grant of planning permission for repository development. This is
not out of line with indicative programmes for deep disposal which have been
announced by various countries overseas, as described in
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A> of Dr Holmes' evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>.
</P>
<P><U>Summary</U></P>
<P>9.26 The RCF programme sits within a planning schedule for contingent
development of a DWR at Sellafield which will continue to be managed flexibly,
according to the needs of safety assessment and taking account of the other
factors I have described. Results from Phase 1 will inform dialogue with the
regulatory authorities and the Company would not propose development of a
repository until it were confident that those authorities would see no
impediment, in the light of information available to them, to authorisation and
licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P><B>Projected Expenditure on the RCF and DWR Development
</B></P>
<P>9.27 Total outlays on the deep disposal programme up to 31 March 1995 and
targeted through to 2011, in respect of a DWR assumed to be built at Sellafield,
are shown in <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A> and illustrated year by year in
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>. The projections are consistent with the
planning dates for successive stages of the programme given in paragraphs 9.21
to 9.25 above. They exclude interest and contingencies. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.28"></A>9.28 Up to 31 March 1995, Nirex outlays in pursuit
of deep disposal totalled &#163;391 million at 1995 prices. Within that total,
expenditure on the Science Programme which was specific to Sellafield amounted
to approximately &#163;252 million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P>9.29 At the present stage of the repository programme, a key focus for
management control purposes is on development and construction outlays for
bringing a Sellafield repository into operation. Current projections are for a
total outlay of &#163;1884 million at 1995 prices to bring a repository into
operation there .
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.30"></A>9.30 From 1 April 1995 the projected outlays for the
RCF programme are &#163;195 million at 1995 prices, being &#163;124 million for
construction and &#163;71 million for directly associated scientific work. This
represents 10.4% of the total projected outlays leading to a DWR at Sellafield
and 13.1% of the projected outlays to be incurred from 1 April 1995. As can be
seen from <A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>, even at its projected peak in
2000-01, the RCF outlay will be less than half total Company expenditure in any
year. Annual Company expenditures in real terms, on Sellafield site
investigations and in total, peaked in 1993-94. Company outlays, on the
investigations and in total, will not exceed the historical peak levels until
well into the next century.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.31"></A>9.31 The maximum projected annual expenditure on the
RCF, including directly associated scientific studies, is &#163;23.6 million at
1995 prices, arising in 2000-01. Contracts for the construction of the RCF and
the undertaking of the scientific work directly connected with it have not been
negotiated. But the Company's intention is to limit its financial commitment
through termination provisions, which will ensure the right to terminate at any
time. Given the projected pattern of expenditure, costs associated with early
termination are unlikely to exceed &#163;10 million at 1995 prices. Site
restoration is costed at up to &#163;3 million. So on that basis the maximum
forward commitment to the RCF project, at any time, would be approximately &#163;13
million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.32"></A>9.32 Any serious scientific investigation of a
preferred site demands the commitment of significant resources, so that the high
standards demanded by Government policy on safety can be demonstrated to be met.
In the Sellafield context, it is clear from <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>,
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A> and the discussion above that the
expenditure involved in RCF construction and associated scientific work
represents a small proportion of the projected costs for the contingent deep
repository programme. It is neither a &quot;<I>significant pre-commitment to
eventual repository development in economic terms</I>&quot; nor &quot;<I>a
'halfway' commitment to development of a repository at Sellafield</I>&quot; as
suggested in Cumbria County Council's Fifth reason for refusal of the RCF
application.

<P><B>MICHAEL THOMAS FOLGER will say:
</B></P>
<P> <B><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B></P>
<P>1.1   I have been a Director of United Kingdom Nirex Limited (&quot;Nirex&quot;
or the &quot;Company&quot;) since June 1991 and Managing Director since
September of that year. Within strategy and policies decided by the Board of
Directors, I lead the executive team in delivering Nirex's step-by-step
programme. That programme is directed at disposal of intermediate-level and
low-level radioactive wastes (&quot;ILW&quot; and &quot;LLW&quot;, as classified
in the White Paper Cm. 2919 <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
Final Conclusions, (&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)</I> [GOV/208.]) 
</P>
<P>1.2   Since November 1991 I have been a member of the Radioactive Waste
Management Advisory Committee (the &quot;RWMAC&quot;).
</P>
<P>1.3   I was an administrative grade civil servant in HM Treasury between
1971 and 1985. During that time I was granted study leave in the United States
(1978-79) as a Harkness Fellow of the Commonwealth Fund of New York and was
seconded for two years to the Wiggins Teape Group (1981-83). In 1985 I joined
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in its London office and was employed in a range of
investment banking work - latterly as a Senior Vice-President - until 1991. 
</P>
<P>1.4   I hold the degree of Master of Arts from Cambridge University, where I
studied Natural Sciences and then Economics. I also hold the degree of Master of
Science in Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, following
study there at the Sloan School of Management.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Summary"></A>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P><B>Scope of Evidence
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para2.1"></A>2.1   This proof describes Nirex's history,
organisation and presence in Cumbria; the development of Government policy on
ILW disposal since 1982 and the Company's site selection procedures followed
from 1987. It explains the place of the Rock Characterisation Facility (&quot;RCF&quot;)
within a site confirmation stage which forms part of a programme for providing a
deep waste repository (&quot;DWR&quot;). The evidence also reports the views of
independent bodies on the RCF approach. In conclusion, the Company's contingent
schedule and associated cost projections for the DWR programme are described,
together with the way in which the phased RCF programme fits within that
schedule and those projections.
</P>
<P><B>Nirex
</B></P>
<P>2.2   Nirex, as a company owned by the principal civil producers of
radioactive waste, is responsible for providing a DWR, within the terms of
Government policy, for ILW and for LLW requiring deep disposal. The Company has
an established presence in West Cumbria and maintains liaison arrangements with
Cumbria County Council, other local authorities and local communities in the
area. There is evidence of public support in Cumbria for the Company's proposal
to develop an RCF. 
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy on ILW Disposal
</B></P>
<P>2.3   The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in a Parliamentary
announcement in 1989, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository should
be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next steps
should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of
boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations would
enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction of a
repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when such
investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals.
</P>
<P>2.4   The Government's 1994-95 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.5   In short, the RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context
and is consistent with it.
</P>
<P><B>Site Selection Procedures
</B></P>
<P>2.6   Nirex's site selection procedures have followed recommendations of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (&quot;IAEA&quot;) set down in 1983. They
took account of responses to public consultation undertaken during 1987 and
1988. The RWMAC reviewed the procedures leading to a 1989 shortlist of 12
candidate sites for the DWR and believed the approach to be defensible. It
accepted the logic in identifying the Dounreay and Sellafield areas for
investigation. Following a recent consideration of whether Nirex may be
considered to have adopted a reasonable approach in its investigations so far,
the Government has not proposed any change of procedure. 
</P>
<P>2.7   In 1991, the Company reviewed preliminary results available from the
geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield. The
risks of concentrating on a single preferred site, as previously planned, were
judged acceptable. It was decided to concentrate investigations on Sellafield in
the light of the initial results from the physical investigations, major
transport advantages of Sellafield viewed as a candidate repository location,
and the fact that expert assessments of other attributes of the two locations
showed little change.  
</P>
<P><B>The RCF and Site Confirmation
</B></P>
<P>2.8   In May 1992 the Company viewed results from a preliminary safety
assessment of Sellafield as encouraging and suggesting a &quot;so far so good&quot;
picture of the site's potential suitability as a location for a DWR. However, a
decision on whether to submit a planning application for development of a
repository was postponed because the available data were insufficient to permit
a firm view to be reached on a model of the hydrogeological system. The Company
decided in September 1992 to break out the RCF as a necessary free-standing
stage in its further site investigations, to permit firmer interpretations of
the hydrogeological system needed to inform a decision whether to propose
development of a DWR at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><B>Review of the Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>2.9   A Royal Society Study Group and the RWMAC have indicated their support
for the RCF proposal. Cumbria County Council has stated that the decision to
break out the RCF is a logical stage in demonstrating the safety case for a
repository. It has described the RCF as a research facility. The overall Nirex
approach to site characterisation and site confirmation is consistent with the
terms of an IAEA Safety Guide published in 1994.
</P>
<P><B>The RCF within the Forward Programme
</B></P>
<P>2.10   The RCF programme sits within a contingent schedule for a deep
repository and will progressively provide confirmatory information which should
help the regulatory authorities to form a view on whether there appears to be
any impediment to eventual authorisation for waste disposal of a repository at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.11   The time taken to bring a DWR into operation is an important
influence on total costs. Consistently with Government policy, and to give focus
to the management of a complex project, the Company sets a contingent target
date for bringing a repository into operation, which is kept under review. The
Company would not propose development of a repository unless and until it were
confident the regulatory authorities would foresee no impediment to the eventual
authorisation and licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P>2.12   The planned outlays from 1 April 1995 on constructing an RCF and
carrying out scientific studies directly associated with it are &#163;195
million at 1995 prices. From the same date, the total projected cost of bringing
a DWR into operation at Sellafield is &#163;1493 million at 1995 prices. In the
context of the overall target costs for a DWR at Sellafield, the RCF is not a
significant pre-commitment to eventual repository development in economic terms.

<P><B><A NAME="Nirex"></A>4. NIREX</B></P>
<P><B>Role of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.1 Nirex is working to provide and manage facilities for the safe disposal
of ILW and LLW. Such wastes have arisen in the UK for over 40 years and come
from the nuclear power industry, medical, research and defence establishments
and other industries. For ILW, UK Government policy requires deep disposal in an
underground repository. Certain LLW will also require deep disposal as it is
unsuitable for disposal at the Drigg surface facility operated by BNFL.
</P>
<P>4.2 Nirex has no responsibility for high level waste disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 ILW estimated to exist as at 1 January 1995, when
conditioned for disposal on current packaging assumptions, will have a volume of
97,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>. On the same basis, a further 75,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of ILW
is projected to arise by 2010, as can be derived from COR/520. In the light of
bids for space made by major customers in 1993, the Company announced in its
press release of 8 April 1994, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that it was planning for
a total of 400,000 m<SUP>3
</SUP>of radioactive waste, including 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of LLW, to be
disposed of in an underground repository up to 2060. 
</P>
<P><B>Origins of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.4 In 1976 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, chaired by Sir
Brian Flowers (now Lord Flowers), issued its Sixth Report <I>Nuclear Power and
the Environment</I> [GOV/201]. Recommendation 41 of the report was that a
Nuclear Waste Disposal Corporation should be established, as an independent
statutory body responsible for the safe disposal of all waste arisings at
nuclear sites. The Government's initial response to that recommendation was
given in the May 1977 White Paper, <I>Nuclear Power and the Environment The
Government's Response to the Sixth Report of the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution
</I>[GOV/216], which stated in paragraph 20:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Commission recommended (41) that a Nuclear Waste Disposal
Corporation should be set up. They saw a need, not currently fulfilled, for an
executive body to develop and manage radioactive waste disposal facilities, and
they had in mind the desirability of continuity in managing the disposal and
containment of long-lived wastes. The Government see the force of this proposal,
but do not think they need to come to a decision at this stage. They propose to
reconsider it in due course in the light of the results of the current review of
existing policy for waste disposal; and they will also seek the advice of the
Nuclear Waste Management Advisory Committee.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.5 In July 1982, the Government announced in paragraph 57 of the White
Paper <I>Radioactive Waste Management</I>, (<I>&quot;the 1982 White Paper&quot;</I>)
[GOV/203] that, with its agreement, a Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste
Executive (the &quot;Executive&quot;) was to be set up by the component parts of
the nuclear industry, in co-operation, &quot;<I>to provide a mechanism by which
they can successfully fulfil their own responsibilities in this field and work
within a comprehensive plan for waste management</I>.&quot; 
</P>
<P>4.6 The Executive was responsible for arranging deep sea disposals, from
1983, of certain ILW and LLW. Because of national policy changes, no such
disposals were put into effect and the Executive concentrated its work on
providing facilities for geological disposal of ILW and LLW.
</P>
<P>4.7 United Kingdom Nirex Limited was incorporated in November 1985, as the
successor to the Executive, pursuant to a shareholders' agreement (&quot;<I>the
Shareholders' Agreement</I>&quot;) which recited the Shareholders' need to
dispose of ILW and LLW. British Nuclear Fuels plc (&quot;BNFL&quot;) and Nuclear
Electric plc each owns 42% of the issued ordinary share capital, and Scottish
Nuclear Limited and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (the &quot;UKAEA&quot;)
each owns 7%. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry holds a Special
Share.
</P>
<P>4.8 The objects for which the Company was established, as set out in its
Memorandum of Association, include:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To carry on business in the collection, treatment, transport,
storage and disposal of radioactive and other related materials.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.9 The financing needed for the Company's operations is provided by
prospective major customers or by Shareholders. The Ministry of Defence (the &quot;MOD&quot;)
has agreed, in principle and effective from 1 April 1994, to make pre-payments
in respect of its intended use of the repository. The remainder of the financing
is provided by Shareholder loans.
</P>
<P><B>Company Structure
</B></P>
<P>4.10 The Nirex Board of Directors comprises one nominee from Scottish
Nuclear Limited and two each from the UKAEA, BNFL and Nuclear Electric plc. As
Special Shareholder, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry nominates two
directors. In addition, the Managing Director and the Finance and Corporate
Services Director of Nirex are members of the Board. Sir Richard Morris CBE FEng
has been Chairman since September 1989.
</P>
<P>4.11 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] restated in paragraphs
43-45 certain conclusions on the future structure of Nirex set out in the May
1995 White Paper <I>The Prospects for Nuclear Power in the UK</I> (&quot;<I>the
Nuclear Review White Paper</I>&quot;)[GOV/215]. Specifically, it stated that the
Government would retain its special share in Nirex, that the new privatised
nuclear generating companies would be shareholders in Nirex, and that <I>the
Shareholders' Agreement </I>should in future contain a specific undertaking that
the Company will abide by Government policy. In paragraph 44 it said that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>With these safeguards, the Government considers it unnecessary to
seek additional legal powers to enforce its policies in relation to the timely
disposal of waste.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Organisation and Staffing</B></P>
<P>4.12 As at 31 May 1995, the Company's staff numbered 215, with 15 vacancies.
Of the 215 staff in post, 173 were employees based at Harwell, Oxfordshire.
Twenty-three full-time staff seconded by Shareholders or supplied on contract by
other firms were also based at Harwell. Nineteen Company employees were based at
Greengarth Hall, Holmrook, Cumbria. 
</P>
<P>4.13 The Company's organisational structure is shown in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. Staff in the core departments - Science,
Technical and Project - direct and oversee specialist contractors and
consultants engaged respectively in the Science Programme; preparation of
specifications for the disposal system (including transport and packaging
aspects) and environmental assessment; and the design and management of capital
projects (currently the RCF and in due course a DWR). 
</P>
<P>4.14 The Science Department is responsible for the Science Programme, which
will be described by Dr Holmes, Director for Science. Its current main task is
to assess the post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>4.15 The Science Department maintains close liaison with the Technical
Department which is responsible for preparing a disposal system specification to
meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities and satisfy customer needs
in an environmentally acceptable way. 
</P>
<P><B>Nirex in Cumbria
</B></P>
<P>4.16 The Nirex presence in Cumbria centres on the Director (Cumbria) and his
staff at Greengarth Hall, with appropriate Corporate Communications, Science and
Project Department staff also based there. 
</P>
<P>4.17 Science Programme contractors' staff based in Cumbria numbered
approximately 200 at the peak of drilling operations in early 1994, these
individuals being based at Longlands Farm and other operating sites. As at 3
March 1995, the total had reduced to 108, mostly located at Greengarth Hall. The
reduction reflected a decrease in borehole activity, with some drilling
suspended to avoid disturbance to a pump test being carried out in boreholes at
Longlands Farm.
</P>
<P>4.18 As at 3 March 1995, 19 Nirex employees were permanent residents in West
Cumbria. The comparable figure for contractors was 72. 
</P>
<P>4.19 Nirex wishes to see locally resident people take the fullest advantage
of employment opportunities arising from the RCF project. As far as reasonable
and practicable, RCF contractors will be required to maximise employment and
training of local personnel and, in collaboration with Nirex, provide the
necessary framework to make this policy work. Professor MacKay concludes in
paragraph <A HREF="../nrx10/nrx10.htm#Para8.1">8.1</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/10)</B>
that the employment created by the development will be of benefit to West
Cumbria.
</P>
<P>4.20 The Company maintains a sponsorship programme to promote local
educational activities and to help community-based projects. In 1994-95, this
included university sponsorships for three students in earth sciences
disciplines.
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with Local Authorities and Local Communities </U></P>
<P>4.21 Since 1990 senior Nirex staff have accepted invitations to make
periodic reports to the Sellafield Local Liaison Committee, which is chaired by
a senior County Councillor, Mr W Minto OBE, and to its Environmental Health
Sub-Committee, chaired by Professor K Boddy OBE. The Committee was established
in 1957 and its objectives include serving as a channel of information and
comment on aspects of current and future operations at the Sellafield and Drigg
sites of BNFL/UKAEA which may affect the local community or environment. 
</P>
<P>4.22 The Director (Cumbria) represents the Company on the Nirex Liaison
Group. This formal liaison machinery was set up in 1991 and is chaired at senior
officer level by Cumbria County Council. Copeland Borough Council is also
represented and the Lake District Special Planning Board attends at officer
level. Proceedings of the Liaison Group are documented in <I>Minutes of Nirex
Liaison Group, 1991-1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the Liaison Group Minutes</I>&quot;)
[CCC/1/2].
</P>
<P>4.23 At local level, to complement periodic briefings of district and parish
councils, the Company has set up with Gosforth Parish Council both a
Gosforth/Nirex Local Liaison Group and a Gosforth/Nirex Technical Consultative
Group. Representatives of adjoining parish councils attend regular meetings of
the local liaison group and the technical consultative group is to meet publicly
in future. 
</P>
<P>4.24 In addition to those channels of communication, on 16 December 1994 the
Company formally proposed to Cumbria County Council the formation of a joint
Consultation Committee, chaired at member level by the County Council and with
representation from other local authorities, to review and discuss progress of
the RCF programme as it proceeds, including the scientific results as they come
forward. The Company wrote to the County on 8 June 1995 confirming that the
proposal still stands and seeking to carry it forward as an agreed matter in the
context of the Inquiry. The County Council replied on 10 July 1995 stating that
the Company's proposal would be referred to the appropriate Committee of the
County Council when it next met. Copeland Borough Council notified the Company
in a letter of 19 July 1995 that its Policy &amp; Resources Committee would
consider the same matter when it next met. The correspondence is reproduced in
NRX/12/2.</P>
<P><U>Local Opinion</U></P>
<P>4.25 Through a public information programme, Nirex seeks to develop and
sustain a measure of support for its activities within the communities in which
it operates. Opinion surveys can be a useful way of gauging support.
</P>
<P>4.26 Several surveys have been carried out on behalf of Cumbria County
Council, as reported on pages 65-84 of the <I>Report by the Director of Economy
and Environment, Cumbria County Council, December 1994</I> [COR/104], and as
detailed in part in <I>The ICM Research Nirex Opinion Poll Wave 3, Prepared for
Cumbria County Council, November 1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>&quot;)
[COR/411]. Results from an opinion survey conducted for Copeland Borough Council
are set out in <I>Socio-Economic Impact Study of the Nuclear Industry Among
Residents on behalf of Copeland Borough Council, May 1995, North East Market
Surveys</I>, [COR/407]. 
</P>
<P>4.27 On the proposal to build an RCF at Sellafield, <I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>
[COR/411] invited respondents to state which of four specific views was closest
to their own. Table 16 on page 32 of COR/411 shows that 43% of Cumbrian
respondents and 62% of Copeland respondents stated that the view closest to
their own was that it was a &quot;<I>Good idea to test the rock structure and
how the water flows</I>&quot;. The same table also showed the next most popular
view: 37% of Cumbrian respondents and 20% of Copeland respondents stated that
the view closest to their own was that &quot;<I>Once they have gone that far
there will be no stopping the repository</I>&quot;. There is no information on
whether some respondents may have held more than one of the views specified,
albeit one being more strongly held than others. 
</P>
<P>4.28 The report on the May 1995 survey of Copeland Residents conducted for
Copeland Borough Council [COR/407] shows, in Question 13a, 53.8% of respondents
as &quot;<I>not concerned</I>&quot;<I> </I>about &quot;<I>the proposal by
Nirex</I>&quot;,<I> </I>in the words of the relevant question, to locate &quot;<I>a
RCF and repository in the area</I>&quot;.<I> </I>(21.0% were &quot;<I>concerned</I>&quot;
and 14.6% &quot;<I>very concerned</I>&quot;.)
</P>
<P>4.29 Recognising the difficulties in comparing results from different
surveys, because of different methodologies, questions and sampling techniques,
the various opinion surveys indicate support for the RCF amongst the general
public in Cumbria. The level of support appears to be higher in Copeland than in
the rest of Cumbria.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="GovernmentPolicy"></A>5. GOVERNMENT POLICY ON ILW DISPOSAL</B></P>
<P>5.1 This section of my evidence briefly traces Government policy on disposal
of ILW between 1982 and 1995. The policy has been broadly unchanged since 1986.
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy from 1982
</B></P>
<P>5.2 In <I>the 1982 White Paper</I> [GOV/203] the Government stated in
paragraph 36:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The lack of suitable disposal facilities for intermediate-level
wastes is the major current gap in waste management, and it is important that it
should be remedied. The types of wastes that can be accepted at any given
facility will depend upon the details of the eventual design, and the packaging
of the wastes, and it is not therefore possible to say with certainty at this
stage how many facilities will be required. Work is now proceeding on the basis
of bringing into operation by the end of the decade facilities which should be
able to accept a high proportion of the wastes suitable for disposal. The
probable forms are an engineered trench at a depth of about 20 - 30 metres, and
a modified mine or purpose-built cavity at greater depth.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 In October 1983, the Executive announced that it
would investigate a site at Elstow in Bedfordshire for shallow disposal and a
disused anhydrite mine at Billingham in Cleveland for deep disposal.
Considerable local concern was expressed in the areas of Elstow and Billingham
about the investigations. On 24 January 1985, the Secretary of State for the
Environment in a statement to the House of Commons, <I>(Hansard) </I>[GOV/217],
invited the Executive not to proceed further at Billingham and asked it to
select at least two further sites, in addition to Elstow, for investigation for
shallow disposal. 
</P>
<P>5.4 The Executive was also requested, in the choice of sites, to take full
account of research into methods of containing the radioactivity in the wastes.
In February 1986, Nirex announced that investigations for shallow disposal would
be undertaken at three additional locations. Public controversy arose at these
new locations and continued at Elstow.
</P>
<P><B>The 1986 Rossi Report and the Government Response
</B></P>
<P>5.5 In March 1986 the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment,
under the chairmanship of Sir Hugh Rossi, published its <I>First Report from
the Environment Committee Session 1985-86 Radioactive Waste</I> (&quot;<I>The
Rossi Report</I>&quot;) [GOV/304]. The report concluded that the UK lagged
behind other nations in work on geological disposal of radioactive waste. On
underground research, it stated in paragraph 115:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... While it is essential that site specific research is carried
out, it is a </I>sine qua non <I>that a site for research should be accepted by
the local population. All the countries we have visited have or are constructing
underground facilities which are being used for research alone and which are not
intended to be developed as full operational disposal sites. This seems a
sensible approach. It will provide much needed research in this country and will
convince the public. We are anxious that what has happened over Billingham
should not be repeated with a new deep geological site. <B>We therefore
recommend:
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(i) research on a fully constructed deep geological site in this
country is urgently needed and should be implemented; 
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(ii) such a site should be designated as an experimental facility,
explicitly excluded from being a potential operational facility</B>.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 <I>The Rossi Report</I> also recommended that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>... Near surface disposal facilities are only acceptable for
short-lived low-level wastes ...</B></I>&quot;(para. 99).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.7 In July 1986 the Government published its response to <I>the Rossi
Report </I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 White Paper</I>&quot;) [GOV/202]. It stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... continues to favour early disposal because in
general this carries a lower risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public.</I>&quot;(para. 10);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is committed to the development of a deep facility.
Studies here and abroad have confirmed that it is feasible. Further research on
the different systems that are available is being undertaken. The next step will
be for NIREX to identify potential sites for detailed investigation, so that a
site can be chosen to put to a public inquiry and, if approved, developed. In
the course of its development there will be a period of comprehensive testing
and experimentation before the facility becomes operational. There will be no
need for the prior construction of a separate experimental facility. This would
only raise concern in the area affected without yielding any compensatory
benefit. Nor, within the relatively restricted area of the UK, is it likely that
such a number of suitable sites will be identified as to make it sensible to
abandon a site that is good enough for ultimate disposal.</I>&quot; (para. 55.)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Government thus made clear its policy view that an experimental
underground facility at a location explicitly excluded from consideration as a
potential repository site, as recommended in <I>the Rossi Report</I>, was not
appropriate in the UK context. 
</P>
<P>5.8 <I>The 1986 White Paper</I> [GOV/202] also stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... there are no technical reasons why LLW and short-lived ILW
should not be placed in a near-surface facility with the element of containment
envisaged ...</I>&quot;(para. 49);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... recognises that many people would be reassured
if ... </I>[such a] <I>site</I> <I>were used only for LLW. In these
circumstances ... the Government has decided that NIREX should proceed on the
basis that a near-surface facility will only be authorised for the disposal of
what is broadly described as low-level waste ...</I>&quot; (para. 50).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>The 1987 Decision for a Multi-Purpose DWR
</B></P>
<P>5.9 In April 1987, Nirex took stock of its investigations at the four sites
for a shallow repository. Because of the Government decision announced in its
1986 White Paper, these had become candidates for disposal of LLW only. On 30
April 1987 the Chairman of Nirex wrote to the Secretary of State for the
Environment, in a letter reproduced in Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Eighth Annual
Report, September 1987 </I>[GOV/411], and recommended that work on the four
sites be taken no further. The Company had concluded that, in marginal terms,
there was not a lot of difference between the cost of disposing of LLW with ILW
in a deep repository and the cost of disposing of it in a new shallow
repository. 
</P>
<P>5.10 The Chairman's letter [GOV/411] said, in part, that in concentrating
future work on deep disposal:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... it would be wise to avoid premature commitments to a preferred
technique or how or when sites for investigation are to be identified. One
lesson from our work so far is surely that the public does not like feeling
pressurised to accept imposed solutions in this area and I would think time
spent now in considering all the issues in this way would be time well spent.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.11 The Secretary of State, in a letter of 1 May 1987, also reproduced in
Appendix C of GOV/411, agreed with the Nirex conclusion that disposal of LLW in
a multi-purpose repository would be preferable to shallow disposal. In a
statement to the House of Commons on the same day he explained that Nirex would
concentrate on identifying a <I>&quot;suitable location for a deep
multi-purpose facility&quot;
</I>for both ILW and LLW (<I>Hansard</I>)<I> </I>(&quot;<I>the 1987
Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;) [GOV/210].
</P>
<P>5.12 The May 1987 decision marked the beginning of the current DWR
programme, under which Nirex site investigations are now concentrated at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>The 1989 Parliamentary Statement 
</B></P>
<P>5.13 On 21 March 1989 the Secretary of State for the Environment announced
in a Written Answer in reply to a Parliamentary Question (<I>Hansard) (</I>&quot;<I>the
1989 Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;<I>)
</I>[GOV/211]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex's report and recommendations on the disposal of low and
intermediate-level radioactive waste in a deep repository were submitted to
Government on 28 February. Nirex recommends that a repository should be
constructed in the form of a mine under the land, and that the next steps should
be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of boreholes,
in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. In arriving at these recommendations
Nirex has concluded that it would be best to explore first those sites where
there is some measure of local support for civil nuclear activities. The further
evaluation of the geology of these two areas will enable Nirex to decide on
their suitability for construction of a repository, or whether it will be
necessary to evaluate other sites.
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Government, having consulted the radioactive waste management
advisory committee accept the report and note that Nirex, having examined the
arguments for storage rather than disposal of radioactive waste, has endorsed
the Government's policy of disposal. The Government agree that further
exploratory work is necessary before any particular site can be decided upon,
and that it is for Nirex to obtain the necessary planning permissions through
the normal procedures. Only when these investigations have been undertaken will
Nirex be in a position to submit proposals for a substantive development and to
seek the necessary approvals.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.14 The advice to Government from the RWMAC took the form of a letter of 16
March 1989 from its Chairman to the Secretary of State. As published at Appendix
C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report </I>November 1989<I>,</I> [GOV/402], it
stated in part:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>RWMAC has reviewed the site selection procedures adopted by United
Kingdom Nirex Ltd which have led to the identification of the short-list of
twelve sites. The Committee believes that the approach adopted by Nirex is
defensible. We also accept the logic in identifying the two areas for further
evaluation which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield.
The Nirex decision is consistent with our advice given to yourself in the
published RWMAC response to Nirex's consultative document 'The Way Forward'.
Nevertheless, the Committee recognises that sites associated with better
geological conditions, and which are more robust in radiological terms, exist.
However, it would be inappropriate for such sites to be evaluated by detailed
site investigation until the suitability of Dounreay and Sellafield had been
established.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.15 In March 1989, the Company published <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]. That
reported on work undertaken following public consultation initiated in 1987 -
which I explain in Section 6 of this Proof of Evidence - and explained the
Company's decision as a first step to limit further investigations to candidate
DWR sites at Dounreay and Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.16 In September 1990 the Government referred in <I>This Common
Inheritance </I>[GOV/204] at paragraph 15.29 to its deep disposal policy and
Nirex's investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>As part of its strategy for the disposal of intermediate-level
waste, the Government gave UK Nirex Ltd the task of developing a deep
underground repository to isolate the waste from the environment for the many
thousands of years which will be necessary. In 1987 the Government agreed that
the repository should also be used for low-level waste. Nirex is now carrying
out detailed geological studies at Dounreay and Sellafield to identify a
suitable site. These investigations are subject to normal planning procedures,
and the Government will make any proposal for development subject to a full
public inquiry as well as to compliance with strict safety standards.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Under the heading &quot;<I>GOVERNMENT ACTION AND POLICY REVIEW</I>&quot;,
<I>This Common Inheritance </I>also stated, in paragraph 15.38:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government will carry out a full-scale review of the prospects
for nuclear power in 1994 when the Sizewell B project will be nearing
completion. The Government and the nuclear industry will take several

<P>5.17 The 1992 Government publication <I>Environment in Trust Radioactive
Waste Management - A Safe Solution</I> [GOV/305], in a section headed &quot;<I>DISPOSAL
OPTIONS FOR RADIOACTIVE WASTE</I>&quot;, stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is satisfied that safe disposal routes can be
developed in the UK for low- and intermediate-level wastes, and that early
disposal in a deep facility is the right answer. This policy has been endorsed
by both the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment and the House
of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities. The Government also
believes that on-site storage is an unacceptable long-term option because in
general it carries a higher risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public and because decisions on disposal should not be left to future
generations. A number of studies and both Select Committees support this view.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
</B></P>
<P>5.18 On 19 May 1994, the Secretary of State for the Environment announced a
review of radioactive waste management policy (<I>Hansard)
</I>[GOV/214], to be separate from but complementary to a review of the future
prospects for nuclear power in the UK, announced by the Minister for Energy. He
explained that the Department of the Environment proposed to publish its
preliminary conclusions on the review of radioactive waste management policy
later that summer, as a basis for consultation. Separately, Her Majestys
Inspectorate of Pollution (&quot;HMIP&quot;) would be issuing for consultation a
revision of the 1984 publication <I>Disposal Facilities on Land for Low and
Intermediate-Level Radioactive Wastes: Principles for the Protection of the
Human Environment</I>, (&quot;<I>the Green Book</I>&quot;) [GOV/302]. In
parallel, the RWMAC, together with the Advisory Committee on Safety of Nuclear
Installations (&quot;ACSNI&quot;), would be asked to consider the approach to
site selection for radioactive waste disposal facilities and the criteria for
ensuring the protection of human health. 
</P>
<P>5.19 In August 1994, the Department of the Environment issued &quot;<I>Review
of Radioactive Waste Management Policy Preliminary Conclusions - A Consultation
Document</I>&quot; (&quot;<I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/306]. The summary of conclusions stated in paragraph 224:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continues to favour a policy of disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and high emitting wastes. It considers it
appropriate that Nirex should continue with its current site investigation
programme, including its application for planning permission for a rock
characterisation facility at Sellafield. Final decisions on the repository
itself must, however, depend on the establishment of a sound safety case, the
granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, as
well as costs. No fixed deadline should be set for the completion of this
process. In the meantime, the evidence as to safety and technology should be
kept under review, so that all can be satisfied that the eventual arrangements
are the best means by which this generation can fulfil its obligations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.20 On 9 May 1995, on publication of <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I>
[GOV/215], the Secretary of State for the Environment announced certain
conclusions of the Governments Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, in
advance of publication of a White Paper (which was subsequently published as
<I>the July 1995 White Paper</I>, [GOV/208]). In reply to a Parliamentary
Question <I>(Hansard)
</I>[GOV/212], he stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continue to favour a policy of deep disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and consider it appropriate that Nirex should
continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. The question had been
raised of whether a delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might
have advantages. However, the review concluded that the balance of argument was
against any such delay. The Government therefore believe that the repository
should be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable once a suitable site has
been found, although the precise timetable will depend on the granting of
planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the
establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In relation to the planning inquiry into the RCF he said:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>I have already outlined the matters about which I particularly
wish to be informed to help me reach my decision on this case. These do not
include the merits of national policy on the deep disposal of ILW. It has been
established through the courts that while, of course, Government policy can be a
material consideration that may be taken into account at a local planning
inquiry, it may not be disputed and made a central area of debate. Policy on
deep disposal of ILW has, in any case, already been the subject of wide
consultation in the course of the review.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In <I>Department of the Environment News Release </I>on 9 May 1995
[GOV/213], it was additionally stated: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.21 In May 1995, <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> [GOV/215] itself
stated in paragraph 10.39:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>Nirex and the deep repository</B>: The Government favours a
policy of deep disposal rather than indefinite storage for intermediate level
waste and believes that it is no longer right to postpone decisions about its
ultimate destination. It considers it appropriate that Nirex should continue
with its site investigation programme. The question had been raised of whether a
delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might have financial
advantages. However, financial appraisals showed little difference between
waiting 50 years or proceeding now. The review has concluded that the common
interest is in working towards developing the repository without unnecessary
delay, but allowing appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety
case and compliance with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.22 On 4 July 1995, the Government set out its radioactive waste management
policy in <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208]. The policy was stated in
paragraph 6 to have been framed &quot;<I>within the context of international
guidelines and regulations</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P>5.23 Paragraph 51 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> commented as follows
on the need to maintain a balance between costs and benefits:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<B>...<I>radioactive wastes should be managed and disposed of in
ways which protect the public, workforce and the environment. The radiation
protection principles and criteria adopted in the UK and applied by the
regulatory bodies are designed to ensure that there is no unacceptable risk
associated with radioactive waste management. In defining these principles and
criteria and in their application by the regulators, it is recognised that a
point is reached where additional costs of further reductions in risk exceed the
benefits arising from the improvements in safety achieved and that the level of
safety, and the resources required to achieve it, should not be inconsistent
with those accepted in other spheres of human activity.</I></B>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.24 In terms of fundamental policy on ILW, <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] states, as foreshadowed on 9 May 1995:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the Government continues to favour a policy of deep disposal
rather than indefinite storage for ILW and considers it appropriate that Nirex
should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. It has decided
that there would be no advantage to be gained from delaying the development of
the repository itself, and that once a suitable site has been found, it should
be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. The precise timetable will
depend on the granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory
requirements, including the establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;(para.
101);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In 1991, Nirex announced that results of initial borehole drilling
and other investigations at the two sites </I>[Sellafield and Dounreay] <I>suggested
that either could potentially support the safety case necessary for a deep
disposal site, but that it proposed to concentrate its investigations on
Sellafield because of the advantages it offered in terms of transport, with the
majority of ILW for disposal arising from BNFL's operations at Sellafield. The
RCF would form part of those investigations.</I>&quot; (para. 109).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Summary
</B></P>
<P>5.25 The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in his <I>1989
Parliamentary Statement</I>, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository
should be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next
steps should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking
of boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations
would enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction
of a repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when
such investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals. 
</P>
<P>5.26 The Government's 1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.27 The RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context and is
consistent with it. 
</P>
<P> <B><A NAME="SiteSelection"></A>6. SITE SELECTION PROCEDURES</B></P>
<P>6.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the procedures by
which Nirex decided to concentrate at Sellafield its site investigations for a
multi-purpose DWR.
</P>
<P>6.2 <I>The 1987 Parliamentary Statement</I> [GOV/210] explained that Nirex
would concentrate on identifying a suitable location for a deep multi-purpose
facility. I begin this part of my evidence by describing international guidance
and geological and hydrogeological considerations taken into account by Nirex in
framing its approach to site selection. As I shall describe, the Company
initiated public consultations in November 1987 to promote public understanding
of the issues involved and to stimulate comment which would assist Nirex in
developing acceptable proposals for location of a repository.

<P><B>IAEA Guidebook, 1983
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The IAEA is an inter&#173;governmental
organisation whose role is described in paragraph 8 of <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208]. In 1983 it published Safety Series report No. 59, <I>Disposal
of Low- and Intermediate-Level Solid Radioactive Wastes in Rock Cavities - A
Guidebook</I>, IAEA Vienna, 1983, (&quot;<I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>&quot;)
[GOV/501]. As described on its inside front cover, <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>was published as a category (3) document - Recommendations - issued under
the authority of the IAEA Director General. As indicated in the Foreword, it
contains guidelines to be used by regulatory bodies and implementing
organizations. Chapter 6 of the document includes general guidance on the site
selection process and Table 6.1 tabulated an <I>Idealized Sequence of
Activities for Site Selection</I>. 
</P>
<P>6.4 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>recommends, on page 19, that: &quot;<I>Repository
sites should be evaluated on the basis of geological and ecological information
as well as societal considerations</I>&quot;. Evaluation &quot;<I>is performed
in several stages, proceeding from generic to specific assessments</I>&quot;
(page 19) and: &quot;<I>The site selection should be undertaken in close
connection with the work for the repository concept and design, and if necessary
the introduction of engineered barriers should also be taken into account.</I>&quot;
(page 22.) 
</P>
<P>6.5 The idealised IAEA sequence of activities within the site selection
process comprises three stages: &quot;<I>Regional Evaluation</I>&quot;, &quot;<I>Site
Identification</I>&quot; and &quot;<I>Site Confirmation</I>&quot;. In paragraph
6.1.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] those stages of activity were described in broad
terms as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - a search on a national scale to define favourable areas of the
country; followed by</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the identification of specific candidate sites for comparative
evaluation and the selection of outstanding prospects for physical exploration
to confirm their suitability; and
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the final choice based on the results of geophysical investigation
and other studies.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.6 Regional Evaluation has the objective, as described in section 6.2 (page
23) of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... to select areas that have favourable characteristics for a
repository and to reduce them to a few preferred areas for further study. ...
Activities include ... geological mapping ... clarification of relevant
socio-economic factors and the performance of safety analyses.</I>&quot;<BR>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.7 Table 6.1 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] sees activities
to &quot;<I>characterize</I>&quot;  preliminary sites being undertaken
initially in the Site Identification stage and then, &quot;<I>in detail</I>&quot;,at
the third, Site Confirmation,<I></I>stage. During Site Confirmation, favourable
site(s) are selected and &quot;<I>Final Site Selection</I>&quot; follows.
</P>
<P>6.8 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] states on page 19 that &quot;<I>it
may not prove feasible or necessary to move sequentially</I>&quot; through the
stages of site selection and continues &quot;<I>This may be the case if
potential sites or areas may be selected by means other than a full site
investigation programme...</I>&quot;. It states, on page 2, that the practical
application of the guidelines:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... needs a case-by-case consideration, which takes into account
local conditions, e.g. natural circumstances, the characteristics of the wastes
and national and international regulations and practices.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 In commenting on rock suitability, <I>IAEA
Safety Series 59</I> [GOV/501] points out on page 9 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The suitability of the host rock will depend on individual
circumstances related to the specific site rather than the general properties of
the host rock type ... a final decision regarding the location of a radioactive
waste repository can only be made after a very careful, accurate and
comprehensive investigation of a given site and consideration of the waste
characteristics.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Identification of Geological Environments
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Following the withdrawal from Billingham in
1985, the Company sought advice from the British Geological Survey (&quot;BGS&quot;),
a research institute of the Natural Environment Research Council (&quot;NERC&quot;),
on generic geological environments suitable for ILW disposal. This led to
publication in 1986 of a BGS/Nirex paper <I>Geological Environments for Deep
Disposal of Intermediate Level Wastes in the United Kingdom</I> <I>IAEA-SM-289/37,
</I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper</I>&quot;), [COR/614]. The paper
explained on the second page that five generic geological environments had been
identified as suitable by reference to &quot;<I>requisite features</I>&quot;characterised
by:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - predictable groundwater flow paths, preferably long and
resulting in progressive mixing with older, deeper waters or leading to
discharge at sea</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- very slow local and regional groundwater movements in an area with low
regional hydraulic gradients</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- ease of construction to allow for economic repository design 
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- meeting the many accepted caveats regarding seismicity, depth, etc.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.11 The paper distinguished that approach from &quot;<I>the old approach
to HLW disposal</I>&quot;, which had been summarised in a report of 1976 from
the Institute of Geological Sciences (predecessor of the BGS) <I>Disposal of
highly active, solid radioactive wastes into geological formations - relevant
geological criteria for the United Kingdom, IGS, Report No. 76/12</I> [COR/615].
The previous approach had put great emphasis on the properties of the host rock
itself where thermal stability, for example, was a key requirement in
considering suitability for HLW disposal. But, as described on the second page
of <I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper </I>[COR/614], in the light of &quot;<I>increased
understanding of low flux hydrogeological regimes and greater confidence in
modelling them</I>&quot;, near-field physical properties were seen to have
assumed previously &quot;<I>too great a significance in comparison with a
knowledge of long distance transport pathways</I>&quot;. Site selection needed &quot;<I>to
be primarily based on defining what are considered to be suitable large scale
hydrogeological environments</I>.&quot;
</P>
<P><U>The Way Forward</U></P>
<P>6.12 Nirex published in November 1987 <I>The Way Forward - A Discussion
Document</I> (&quot;<I>The Way Forward</I>&quot;) [COR/203]. The document
explained the Company's approach to deep disposal and options on repository
configurations and on generic hydrogeological environments likely to offer
potential for siting a repository. It posed a number of questions for discussion
on those matters, and on considerations bearing on selection of a repository
site and asked which locations should be the subject of detailed investigations.
</P>
<P>6.13 The Company explained in <I>The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] that it
intended to follow the three stage site selection process suggested by the IAEA.
The document itself reported progress with the first stage - Regional
Evaluation. It noted that work on the second stage - Site Identification - would
commence in 1988.</P>
<P>6.14 BNFL had announced on 14 September 1987 in its press release
<I>Waste Storage and Disposal</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that, with the
support of Nirex, it planned to conduct preliminary geological investigations
within its Sellafield site to assess whether the underground conditions might be
suitable for developing a deep disposal facility for ILW. The announcement
explained that a likely form of development could be that of a fully engineered
offshore depository below the seabed accessed by tunnel from the Sellafield
Works. <I>The Way Forward</I> welcomed this BNFL initiative (paragraph 6.3). It
noted that the Sellafield geology was more complex than other seaward-dipping
sediments, along the east of England, but was worth careful scrutiny because
Sellafield is the main source of ILW (paragraph 5.2.7).
</P>
<P>6.15 <I>The Way Forward </I>[COR/203] explained at paragraph 5.2.3 that,
taking the earlier advice from BGS, the five hydrogeological environments
defined as likely to offer potential for siting a deep repository were:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(a) hard rocks in low relief terrain;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(b) small islands;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(c) seaward dipping and offshore sediments;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(d) inland basins of mixed sedimentary rocks; and
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(e) low permeability basement rocks under sedimentary cover (&quot;BUSC&quot;).

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Those environments were the five which had been described in <I>the 1986
BGS/Nirex paper</I> [COR/614]. Environments (a) to (c) were now identified as &quot;<I>the
preferred group</I>&quot;with their hydrogeological structures seen as simple
and consequently more predictable. It was thought likely that those three
environments would yield a sufficient number of sites suitable for investigation
(see paragraph 5.2.5 of <I>The Way Forward</I>).

<P><U>Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council Responses</U></P>
<P>6.16 In a letter to Nirex of 17 March 1988, reproduced in NRX/12/2, Cumbria
County Council gave its preliminary reactions to <I>The Way Forward</I>
[COR/203]. This followed a resolution of the Planning and Environment
Sub-Committee of the Economy and Environment Committee of the Council, on 14

disposal policy. Without prejudice to any future position which may be taken,
the County Council, therefore, supports BNF's investigation of an off-Sellafield
facility, at least as far as full geophysical research.</I>&quot; (para. e<I>.</I>);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>the County Council &quot;<I>strongly</I>&quot;<I> </I>advocated, in

</LI>
<LI>on local liaison arrangements the County Council's view was:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Nirex should be encouraged to proceed with full investigations which

subject their preferred proposals (perhaps at more than one location) to a full
Environmental Impact Study (as now required under the EEC Environmental
Directive)...</I>&quot;<I> </I>(Sub-para. h(iii).)

<P>6.17 Copeland Borough Council's response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
consultation was given in a letter to Nirex of 11 December 1987 reproduced in
NRX/12/2. It noted that local support was &quot;<I>secondary to finding the
'best' site</I>&quot;<I> </I>and emphasised that safety was the central issue.
In a press statement of 14 September 1987 reproduced in NRX/12/1, the Borough
Council had previously given a qualified welcome to the BNFL initiative, and
noted that an ILW facility at Sellafield could well satisfy local concern
regarding the management practices for radioactive waste then existing. The
proposals were described as providing &quot;<I>a basis for serious discussion</I>&quot;

<P><U>The RWMAC Response to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.18 In July 1988, the RWMAC published its response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
in its <I>Report of the RWMAC Sub-Group on the Nirex Proposals for Deep Site
Investigation</I> (&quot;<I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I>&quot;)
[GOV/412]. It welcomed the definition of the five potential rock environments,
though commenting that they had been presented as essentially simplified
hydrogeological models still to be tested against site-specific locations. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.19"></A>6.19 In response to the question whether an adequate
site which enjoys local support should be preferred to an apparently superior
site which does not, <I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I> [GOV/412]
stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The search for a suitable site must not go on indefinitely; there
is little advantage in searching for a 'Rolls-Royce' solution if Nirex finds the
answer in a 'Jaguar' ... This requires Nirex to find a site with a risk to the
critical group at no more than one in a million per annum and with exposures as
low as reasonably achievable, taking into account economic and social factors.
These criteria must not be relinquished or compromised to meet the assessment
results ... We support, therefore, a pragmatic approach to site selection but on
the basis of a fixed set of assessment criteria.</I>&quot; (para. 12);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However we also recognise the difficulty of identifying more than
one site publicly without attracting the 'not in my back yard' approach.
Consequently, we accept that Nirex may wish to follow its consultation and
technical studies by nominating one site for investigation prior to development,
rather than a short-list of sites requiring site-specific investigation before a
definite choice could be made.</I>&quot; (para. 13.)

<P><U>University of East Anglia Report on Responses to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.20 The responses to <I>The Way Forward</I> consultation were analysed on
the Company's behalf in a November 1988 report <I>Responses to The Way Forward</I>
by the <I>Environmental Risk Assessment Unit of the School of Environmental
Sciences, University of East Anglia </I>(&quot;<I>the UEA Study</I>&quot;)
[COR/204]. There was found to be no overall unanimity of view. Amongst local
authorities, some supported underground disposal and others on-site storage of
wastes as an alternative. However, local authorities with nuclear installations
in their areas, and advisory and scientific bodies, did not on the whole support
such storage. For all consultees, safety was judged the paramount factor, with
the safe transport of wastes being the next major area of concern. In procedural
terms, there was a general welcome for the consultation exercise and opposition
to use of the Special Development Order procedure for obtaining planning
permission for investigative drilling or subsequent development.
</P>
<P>6.21 Appendix E to<I> PERA </I>[COR/501] summarised the results of <I>the
UEA study </I>[COR/204]. Paragraph 6.7.8 of <I>PERA
</I>stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The only areas of the country where local authorities</I>
<I>did show a measure of support </I>[for deep disposal] <I>were Caithness
(Scotland) and Copeland (Cumbria), which were already familiar with the nuclear
industry developments at Dounreay and Sellafield respectively.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Nirex took that position, and other views expressed from outside the nuclear
industry, into account in its work on site selection. 
</P>
<P><B>Areas of Search
</B></P>
<P>6.22 Nirex's procedures through 1988 and into 1989 followed the IAEA
guidelines outlined at paragraphs 6.3 to 6.9 above. Also, as noted at paragraph
6.1.3 of <I>PERA</I>, the Company had regard for the guidance contained in <I>the
Green Book</I>. The Company's March 1989 announcement nominating Dounreay and
Sellafield as locations for further investigations was accompanied by
publication of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] which gives extensive commentary on the
Company's work on various aspects of the DWR programme following the public
consultation during 1987 and 1988. My description of the site selection
procedures which were followed sets those procedures within the IAEA framework
of guidance. Nirex's first step - the definition of Areas of Search within which
specific sites can subsequently be identified - equated to the IAEA Regional
Evaluation stage.
</P>
<P>6.23 As noted on page 24 of<I> The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] three
potentially suitable types of hydrogeological environment were, on advice from
the BGS, the starting point for the definition in 1987 of Areas of Search.
Paragraph 6.4.1 of <I>PERA </I>[COR/501] explained that reassessments of
suitable rock environments, based on further recommendations from the BGS,
subsequently led to revised Areas of Search, which included the BUSC environment
as well as hard rocks in low relief terrain, small islands and potentially
suitable sedimentary formations. As illustrated in Figure 6.2 of <I>PERA</I>,
some 30% of the land area of Great Britain was classified within the four
hydrogeologically promising environments. 
</P>
<P>6.24 As explained in Chapter 6 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], Nirex engaged
Pieda, Planning, Economic and Development Consultants, to advise on planning
matters. Recognising the need to avoid if at all possible areas designated as
being of national importance from the standpoint of conservation, these were
mapped on a national scale and excluded from further consideration. The areas
concerned included National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Heritage
Coastlines, National Scenic Areas and National Nature Reserves. Also, in the
light of public perception of the acceptability of a repository nearby and the
desirability of minimising disturbance created by its construction and
operation, Local Districts and Boroughs with a population density of more than 5
persons per hectare were excluded from the search. The exclusions in respect of
population density, planning and nature conservation considerations were
illustrated in Figures 3, 4 and 5 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report</I>
[GOV/402] published in November 1989. Figure 6.3 of<I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed
the reduced Areas of Search on land. 
</P>
<P>6.25 In delineating offshore areas of the continental shelf potentially
suitable for the development of a sub-seabed repository, Nirex took advice from
the BGS; the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, a research institute of the
NERC; and Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited.
</P>
<P>6.26 These studies completed, in IAEA terminology, the Regional Evaluation
stage. In subsequent work, consistently with <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>,
consideration was given to some sites outside the Areas of Search which appeared
to offer particularly favourable features coupled with a satisfactory geology
(see paragraph 6.5.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]).
</P>
<P><B>Identification and Review of Specific Sites
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.27"></A>6.27 Maps of the Areas of Search were studied to
identify sites which appeared worthy of consideration for potential DWR
development. As mentioned at paragraph 6.26 above, some sites outside those
areas were also brought into consideration. Consultations were undertaken with
Government Departments and other public sector bodies having significant land
holdings, as well as with Shareholders in Nirex. The Company, working in
conjunction with the BGS and Pieda, identified about 500 sites, many
publicly-owned. Privately-owned sites offered to the Company were incorporated
in the list.
</P>
<P><U>Sieving Process</U></P>
<P>6.28 The Company refined and reduced its list of candidate sites through a
sequential sieving process, taking appropriate expert advice at each stage. This
part of the process was summarised in Figure 6.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and I
describe each stage below.
</P>
<P>6.29 A first sieving was undertaken, in conjunction with the BGS and Pieda,
to evaluate in a preliminary way the specific geological settings of each site
and to take account of environmental and planning factors not covered by the
initial exclusions made in defining Areas of Search. These included a review of
whether sites were designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest and
whether, although in administrative districts of low population density, they
were adjacent to major population centres. About 200 sites with real potential
were carried forward from this stage. 
</P>
<P>6.30 The next stage of the sieving process, conducted in conjunction with
Pieda, was a closer review of site ownership. In particular, certain small
island sites had been included in the list of about 500 in the knowledge that
their ownership was uncertain. Many of those islands remaining on the list of
about 200 were set aside once their ownership was clarified. About 160 sites
were carried forward to the next stage.
</P>
<P>6.31 Then, as described in paragraph 6.5.5 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further consideration was given to the configuration and area of the land
available at each site. Areal guidelines were drawn up with the advice of a
consortium, led by Costain Engineering Limited. and including Ove Arup and
Partners and Electrowatt Engineering Services (UK) Limited., having extensive
experience of major engineering design and construction projects in the nuclear
industry, including waste disposal. The guidelines were, for inland sites, 400
hectares and, for coastal sites, 200 hectares encompassing the maximum likely
requirements for surface facilities, the repository itself being under the sea.
The guidelines were not applied too rigorously as the land-take was seen to be
site-specific, though in <I>PERA</I> an area of 85 hectares was foreseen as
sufficient for a reference repository design under the land at either Dounreay
or Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>6.32 About 120 sites were carried forward from that stage. The geological
setting for each site remaining under consideration was then examined in further
detail by the BGS. A geological profile of each site was prepared to enable
assessment of its likely hydrogeological characteristics. Candidates likely to
perform best in hydrogeological terms were selected, with 39 sites being taken
forward.<BR>
</P>
<P><U>Identification of the Sellafield BVG as a Siting Option</U></P>
<P>6.33 The volcanic rocks beneath the Windscale (now Sellafield) Works were
described in a 1980 report from the Institute of Geological Sciences (now the
BGS) [COR/616 ], as holding &quot;<I>good</I>&quot; potential for ILW disposal
(see Figure 2, page 4 of COR/616). Beneath the Sellafield Works, they were,
however, estimated to lie 900 m bOD and the cost of investigating them at depth
was described as &quot;<I>likely to be prohibitive</I>&quot;. The potential for
burial of radioactive waste within the overlying sandstones was described as &quot;<I>limited</I>&quot;<I></I>although
&quot;<I>repository design could be envisaged whereby any leachate is allowed
to flow through the </I>[sandstone]<I>formation eventually to discharge into
the Irish Sea</I>&quot;. (Page 7-9 of Appendix 7 to COR/616.) 
</P>
<P>6.34 During 1988, desk-based studies of the Sellafield area indicated that,
just inland from the Sellafield Works, under land owned by BNFL, the volcanic
basement rock - the Borrowdale Volcanic Group (&quot;BVG&quot;) - was at an
accessible depth. Therefore, within the terms of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59,
</I>the possibility of siting a repository in that setting was introduced as a
second Sellafield option alongside the original sedimentary option beneath the
Sellafield Works, when the list of 39 locations was reviewed. As noted on page
24 of the April 1989 Nirex publication
<I>Going Forward, the development of a national disposal centre for low and
intermediate level radioactive waste</I> (&quot;<I>Going Forward</I>&quot;)<I></I>[COR/209],
the BVG option was an area of basement rock under sedimentary cover.
</P>
<P>6.35 In reviewing the 39 locations, evaluations of key factors bearing on
site suitability were prepared by Nirex, the BGS, Pieda and a team of specialist
consultants. Post-closure radiological safety, repository design and transport
were covered by, respectively, the UKAEA, the consortium led by Costain and JMP
Consultants. The Company established site availability by consulting the owners.

</P>
<P>6.36 This phase of the procedure focused on progressive evaluation of
specific sites on a comparative basis with interactive expert judgments applied
to determine which sites best justified further assessment. It resulted in 17 of
the land-based sites being taken forward. For the Sellafield site, both the
volcanic and sedimentary options remained under consideration.
</P>
<P>6.37 As set out in paragraphs 6.5.8 to 6.5.14 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further review of the 17 land-based sites was undertaken with advice from the
team of specialist consultants. The respective consultants assessed the merits
of each candidate site in relation to the disposal concept(s) which it could
potentially satisfy. Development Plans were taken into account by considering
publicly-available information on the current and future proposed use of land in
the locality of each site. Preliminary designs and cost estimates were prepared
on a generic basis for repositories constructed and operated in various rock
environments. The BGS advised on uncertainties in the existing geological data
on each site and how readily better data could be obtained by ground
investigations. Ten land-based options - including both the Sellafield
sedimentary option and the Sellafield BVG option - went forward from this
process.
</P>
<P>6.38 As described at paragraph 6.4.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and at
paragraph 6.25 of my evidence, work was done to define areas of the continental
shelf potentially suitable for sub-seabed disposal of radioactive waste. Two
generic offshore options were defined, in hard rock and sedimentary rock. Advice
was taken from Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited and NEI Limited on the
design of offshore access systems.
</P>
<P>6.39 Thus twelve options - 10 on land and two offshore - were carried
forward into a quantified comparative evaluation. Multi-attribute decision
analysis (&quot;MADA&quot;) was employed for this purpose with the advice of
Professor Lawrence Phillips of the Decision Analysis Unit of the London School
of Economics and Political Science.
</P>
<P><U>MADA</U></P>
<P>6.40 MADA is established as an appropriate tool for applying logic
systematically to help make choices between options which have to be assessed
with respect to multiple and varied attributes. Paragraph 4.23 of the report of
the Study Group drawn from the members of the RWMAC and ACSNI, <I>Site
Selection for Radioactive Waste Disposal Facilities and the Protection of Human
Health</I>,<I>March 1995</I>, (&quot;<I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>&quot;)
[GOV/409] noted its use by the Department of the Environment in assessment of
options for radioactive waste management. Under the MADA process, the weightings
applied to scores on different attributes of each option depend both on the
intrinsic importance of the attribute concerned and its discriminatory relevance
given the characteristics of the set from which choice is being made. Generally,
if on a particular attribute the options score close together then a relatively
lower weight is appropriate for that attribute.
</P>
<P>6.41 A note supplied to Cumbria County Council in November 1994, reproduced
on pages 97-119 of <I>the Report by the Director of Economy and Environment
Cumbria County Council, December </I>1994 (&quot;<I>the November 1994 Note</I>&quot;)
(COR/104 pages 97&#173;119), described how all the 12 short-listed options were
seen to have the potential to meet the post-closure safety target, which <I>the
Green Book </I>(paragraph 3.8) had expressed as equivalent to an individual
annual dose not exceeding 0.1 mSv. Moreover, the established radiological safety
principle, recently reaffirmed in paragraph 78 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] and recognised in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>
[GOV/409] (see paragraphs 3.37-3.38), is that, provided certain conditions are
met, no further reduction in risk should be sought if the estimated risk to the
public is below the target level. Thus, in ranking the 12 options, the margins
by which particular sites might give an estimated annual dose below 0.1 mSv were
relatively unimportant. Accordingly, a low weight was applied to this site
attribute in the MADA process.
</P>
<P>6.42 The MADA procedure, as detailed in <I>the November 1994 Note
</I>[COR/104 pages 97-119] took account of the site attributes grouped into four
collective branches of costs, robustness, safety and environment. Thirty
individual attributes were accorded weightings through a structured process of
expert elicitation and judgment facilitated by Professor Phillips.
Representatives of the consultants BGS, JMP Consultants, Pieda and the UKAEA, as
well as Nirex staff, participated in this process.
</P>
<P>6.43 The assessment and scoring of each site's performance under each of the
30 attributes within the four branches was undertaken by experts using the best
available data and information on each site. Definitions of the 30 attributes
and information about scores were summarised in Annex 1 to <I>the November 1994
Note</I> (see pages 111-119 of COR/104).
</P>
<P>6.44 Information on geological conditions - relevant to scoring a number of
attributes - was supplied by the BGS, drawing on the national geological records
which it maintains and site visits. Environmental information took account of
data obtained by Pieda, from local authorities and from visits to each location
to assess potential impacts.
</P>
<P>6.45 Designs and cost estimates for repositories appropriate to the
geological settings at each land-based location were prepared by the consortium
led by Costain and, for the offshore options, by Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons
Limited and NEI Limited. Those engineering consultants also provided estimates
of operational safety. JMP Consultants advised on the design of transport
systems, their environmental and safety implications and transport costs for
each site. UKAEA assessed the potential post-closure safety performance of the
different geological settings.
</P>
<P>6.46 As explained in <I>the November 1994 Note</I> (COR/104 pages 97-119),
in the base case for analysis the weights set for the four collective branches
of attributes were as follows:

<P>6.47 Cost was a discriminating attribute across the 12 options and was given
a weighting of 71.4 percentage points. With about half the wastes for deep
disposal arising at Sellafield and rail infrastructure in place there, transport
costs were a major influence on the ranking for that site. By contrast, the base
case weighting attached to local experience of nuclear matters - on which
Sellafield also scored well - was only 1.3 percentage points within the 7.1
percentage points for 'environment' factors overall. 
</P>
<P>6.48 Paragraph 4.1.8 of<I> the November 1994 Note </I>(see page 106 of
[COR/104]) explained that, in the MADA analysis, the Sellafield BVG option
ranked first on the basis of its attribute scores and base case weightings.
Under sensitivity analysis, in which weightings were altered to test the effect
on overall evaluations, the Sellafield BVG was consistently numbered amongst a
leading group of sites which tended to score consistently well. Dounreay
generally scored in the top half of the rankings. 
</P>
<P><U>Wide range of options</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.49"></A>6.49 The Company's procedures, as I have described
them, kept a wide range of options under review through the definition of Areas
of Search and in the Identification and Review of Specific Sites. As well as
land-based options, on the British mainland and small islands, there was study
of offshore options involving sub-seabed disposal via purpose-built structures.
The differing levels of potential radiological performance of widely differing
siting options were taken into account. Thus, the shortlist of 12 sites was
composed of land-based candidates from each of the four rock environments - at
least the leading two options within each environment - and offshore concepts in
hard rock and sedimentary rock.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.50"></A>6.50 Results from an early exercise to assess the
potential safety performance of the four generic environments on land, the
offshore options and the Sellafield basement setting were given in Table 5.2 of
<I>PERA </I>[COR/501]. The results suggested that an offshore repository in
hard rock under deep water would give the smallest post-closure dose to an
individual. Inclusive of the effects of other processes not then captured in the
MASCOT computer program (which is described in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para4.10">4.10</A> of Dr Hooper's evidence <B>PE/NRX/15</B>)
the estimated individual dose for the groundwater pathway was 0.0006 mSv per
year. As explained in <I>PERA </I>in paragraph 6.6.10, conventional safety
considerations told against the offshore options. Under the MADA evaluation the
hard-rock offshore option - despite an indicated post-closure radiological risk
markedly lower than others - was not a preferred choice overall.
</P>
<P><U>Selection of Dounreay and Sellafield for Further Investigation</U></P>
<P>6.51 As stated at paragraph 6.7.2 of <I>PERA </I>(COR/501), while the site
selection process was founded on the approach which I have now described above,
Nirex &quot;<I>also sought to explore the broader social context in which it is
required to discharge its technical responsibilities</I>&quot;. Both <I>the
November 1994 Note</I>, in paragraph 4.1.9 (see page 106 of COR/104), and<I>PERA</I>
(see paragraphs 6.7.2-6.7.11) noted that, through the Way Forward consultation,
only in Caithness and Copeland had local authorities shown a degree of support
for deep disposal. Also, as noted at paragraphs 6.16 and 6.17 above, both
Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council had responded constructively
to the BNFL initiative of September 1987 to undertake preliminary geological
investigations at Sellafield. Nirex's decision in 1989 was, as a first step, to
limit further investigations to Dounreay and Sellafield, as two short-listed
locations &quot;<I>where there is a measure of public support</I>&quot; (see
<I>PERA</I>, paragraph 6.7.11). The priorities set as a result of applying that
consideration were not out of line with the results of the MADA evaluation, as
described at paragraph 6.48 above.
</P>
<P>6.52 The existence of a measure of public support in the Sellafield area is
confirmed by the opinion survey results mentioned at paragraphs 4.26 to 4.29
above.
</P>
<P>6.53 The RWMAC visited the Company in November 1988 to seek an update on
site selection studies and a sub-group of RWMAC reviewed the site selection
process adopted by Nirex (see paragraphs 2.1 and 2.24 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth
Annual Report</I>). As I have already described, the Government's 1989
acceptance of the Nirex recommendation on Dounreay and Sellafield took account
of the RWMAC advice on the site selection procedures adopted by the Company (see
Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report, </I>November 1989 [GOV/402]).
The advice described the approach which had been followed by Nirex as &quot;<I>defensible</I>&quot;and
accepted &quot;<I>the logic in identifying the two areas for further evaluation
which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P><B>Concentration of Investigations at Sellafield
</B></P>
<P>6.54 As explained in Chapter 9 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], subject to the
progress of the geological investigations, and specifically to the start of
on-site work by mid-1989, it was considered that after a period of some 18
months - i.e. by the autumn of 1989 - it should be possible to reach a first
decision point. At that point, it would be determined whether either Sellafield
or Dounreay or both sites would be suitable for construction of a repository or
whether other locations should be evaluated. Detailed ground investigations
would then follow at the preferred site, together with further detailed studies
of all relevant aspects of repository development to support preparation of a
Detailed Environmental and Radiological Assessment to accompany a planning
application to construct a repository.
</P>
<P>6.55 Conceptual design illustrations for a DWR in hard rock given in Figure
4.2 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed an Underground Laboratory, at the
repository horizon, adjacent to the access shaft. A Sellafield brochure
accompanying <I>Going Forward </I>[included in COR/208] in 1989 explained in
more detail that, once DWR planning permission had been granted:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the first stages will be to construct the surface facilities,
the main entry shafts and an experimental area. This experimental area will be
used to further develop the understanding of the behaviour of the surrounding
geology. This will be of value both to the safety research teams and the
construction teams, who will require detailed information on the physical
properties of the rock in order to continue to refine the safety analysis and
disposal centre designs.</I>&quot; (page 8.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.56 A Briefing Note prepared for external use on 6 December 1989 gave the
Company's updated view on the next steps. <I>Preliminary Investigations at
Sellafield and Dounreay </I>(reproduced in NRX/12/1) reported that no planning
approvals had been received for borehole drilling at either Dounreay or
Sellafield except that for Borehole 1 at Sellafield, granted by the Secretary of
State on appeal on 21 March 1989. Nomination of a preferred site for further
investigation was expected in 1992. Following the further investigation, it was
envisaged that a planning application to construct a DWR would lead to a Public
Inquiry in 1994. The Briefing Note explained that future underground
investigations:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... may include the drilling of horizontal boreholes to intersect
features of interest from a central underground research facility.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.57 Shaft sinking and investigations underground were planned to be
undertaken following grant of planning permission for the DWR. Results from
surface-based investigation alone were expected to be sufficient for the safety
assessment which would underpin a decision to submit a planning application to
develop a repository. My letter of 21 January 1992 to County Council, reproduced
in NRX/12/2, explained a forward programme which reflected that continuing
assumption.
</P>
<P><U>Preliminary Geological Results</U></P>
<P>6.58 In line with the announced intention to nominate a preferred site for
further investigations, in July 1991 the Company reviewed preliminary results
available from the geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and
Sellafield. These results were not fed into models of post-closure safety
performance or, at that stage, subjected to formal interpretation. But, as in
1989, both were judged to have the potential to support an acceptable
post-closure safety case. Much further work was recognised to be required before
a long-term safety case could be made. 
</P>
<P><B>Conclusion
</B></P>
<P>6.59 The Company was conscious of the cost of geological investigations - in
1991 the cost of drilling a single deep borehole was typically &#163;5 million -
and of the demands on highly-specialised scientific manpower of investigating
two sites in parallel. The risks to the programme of concentrating as planned on
a single preferred site were judged acceptable. Accordingly, it was decided to
concentrate investigations on Sellafield in the light of the initial results
from physical investigations, the major transport advantages of Sellafield
viewed as a candidate repository location, and the fact that expert assessments
of other attributes of the two locations showed little change. The intention was
to decide on an application for repository planning permission in October 1992,
subject to the results from on-going safety assessment work.
</P>
<P>6.60 The Company's decision and the background to it were explained in a
Nirex news release of 23 July 1991 <I>UK Nirex Chooses Sellafield as Preferred
Site </I>reproduced in NRX/12/1. The news release stated that approximately 60%
of the radioactive waste destined for the repository arises from BNFL operations
at Sellafield. Dounreay was explained to remain a reserve option should
Sellafield prove unsuitable. It was stated that a full analysis of the Dounreay
results, alongside those from Sellafield, would be undertaken prior to a
decision to submit a planning application for a repository. Letters of 22 July
1991 from the Company to Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council
(reproduced in NRX/12/2) explained:

<P>&quot;<I>The decision to concentrate on Sellafield does not mean that we
have yet decided to submit a planning application for the construction of a
repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><U>Publication of Dounreay Site Investigation Results</U></P>
<P>6.61 In December 1994, Nirex published detailed geological and
hydrogeological interpretations of Dounreay based on the investigations done
there. The findings were summarised in a report entitled
<I>The Geology and Hydrogeology of Dounreay, Executive Summary, Nirex Report
653, December 1994</I> [COR/506].</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFSite"></A>7. THE RCF AND SITE CONFIRMATION</B></P>
<P>7.1 Through the second half of 1991 and into 1992, the Company continued to
review geological and hydrogeological results from Sellafield to assess the
implications of these for the potential post-closure safety performance of a DWR
located in the BVG. By the end of 1991, four deep boreholes had been completed.
Further information from geophysical surveys was also available. A preliminary
geological interpretation based on these data was provided to Cumbria County
Council as<I> Nirex Report 263 The Geology and Hydrogeology of Sellafield</I>
[COR/502] in March 1992. <I>Nirex Report 268 Sellafield Hydrogeology</I>
[COR/521], giving a preliminary hydrogeological interpretation, was published in
August 1992. 
</P>
<P>7.2 In May 1992, the Company reviewed early results from a preliminary
safety assessment for a DWR at Sellafield based on data and interpretations
available from the site investigations. The indicated peak mean risk to a
representative member of the critical group via the groundwater pathway was
below the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> risk target for a repository, which was encouraging.
The Company recognised, however, that the estimates were preliminary and that
other conceptual models of the hydrogeology, some of which would imply worse
repository performance, remained plausible given the limited data available.
Drawing firm conclusions from interpretations and modelling based on data from
an actual site - as distinct from desk-based simplifications - was proving a
more extended task than was envisaged in 1991. 
</P>
<P>7.3 Nirex decided to continue the drilling programme at Sellafield and to
postpone a decision on submitting a repository planning application. The revised
aim was to reach a decision on submitting a repository planning application by
the autumn of 1993, based on interpretation of results from the Company's
continuing site investigation programme. The rescheduling was explained in
letters of 1 June 1992 from the Company to Cumbria County Council, Copeland
Borough Council and copied to the Lake District Special Planning Board and the
Six Parishes Committee, reproduced in NRX/12/2. The overall picture was seen by
the Company as &quot;<I>so far, so good</I>&quot;, as described in the Nirex
news release of 2 June 1992, <I>Further Investigations by UK Nirex at
Sellafield</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.4"></A>7.4 Following the May 1992 decision, Nirex continued
to review the forward programme. To provide an adequate basis for reaching a
decision on proposing repository development, more certainty was required on the
potential safety performance of a DWR at Sellafield. In particular, firmer
interpretations of the hydrogeology were needed, in which the range of
conceptualisations supportable by expert judgments could be reduced.
</P>
<P>7.5 The Company concluded that an early planning application to develop a
repository at Sellafield would be unlikely to be approved. The assessment work
on post-closure safety was giving encouraging results. However, without
confirmatory information from exploratory excavation, the Company judged the
picture would be too uncertain to allow the authorising Departments to give a
meaningful &quot;<I>provisional view</I>&quot;<I> </I>on whether a proposed
repository &quot;<I>would be suitable for authorisation</I>&quot; before a
public inquiry were &quot;<I>held into whether planning permission should be
granted to construct such a facility</I>&quot;. This was the procedure provided
for at paragraph 1.3 on page 6 of <I>the Green Book</I> [GOV/302].
</P>
<P>7.6 The only practicable way forward was to undertake the planned
exploratory excavations before, rather than after, submitting a planning
application for a DWR. In September 1992, the Company agreed a contingent,
staged approach to the repository programme with only the RCF being developed
initially. The governing concept was that of a 'super-borehole', implying
minimum outlays and environmental disturbance.
</P>
<P>7.7 Development of the RCF will give the necessary opportunity to perform in
situ experiments and will be part of the Site Confirmation stage defined in
Chapter6 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>[GOV/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.8"></A>7.8 If, during Site Confirmation, the Company judges
the prospective post-closure safety performance of a repository in the
Sellafield BVG to be acceptable and repository construction is confirmed to be
safe at acceptable cost, then it would be ready to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield. As described in paragraph 9.12 below, it would need to
be confident before making such a proposal that the regulatory authorities would
foresee no impediment, in the light of the information available to them, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.9"></A>7.9 In the UK, Final Site Selection, in the
terminology of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>, is a matter for the developer
who, having selected the site, will submit a planning application for
development of the DWR and applications for authorisation of waste disposal
under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 and for licensing of the site under
the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. The &quot;<I>appropriate authorities</I>&quot;
- including the local planning authorities and the regulatory authorities -
would thus be provided with information on the proposal &quot;<I>to permit
decisions to be made</I>&quot;under those statutes&quot;<I>for final site
selection and subsequent licensing</I>&quot; (see section 6.5 of <I>IAEA Safety
Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]). Such decisions would of course be subject to the
Company satisfying all planning and environmental requirements relating to
development of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with the County and District Councils</U></P>
<P>7.10 On 14 July 1992, Copeland Borough Council adopted a formal resolution
on the Nirex Investigation Programme, as indicated in a letter to the Company of
10 August 1992, reproduced in NRX/12/2. It provided, inter alia, that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Consideration of an underground rock laboratory, which is site
specific, be supported in principle without any commitment to the repository
proposal</I>&quot;<I>.</I> (para. d.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.11 During 15-17 September 1992 the Company led a visit to the sp rock
laboratory at Oskarshamn in Sweden and to the underground repository at
Olkiluoto in Finland. A number of officers and Members from Cumbria County
Council and Copeland Borough Council joined the visit, during which there was
informal discussion about the possibility of the concept of a site-specific rock
laboratory at Sellafield.
</P>
<P>7.12 The Nirex Technical Director wrote to Cumbria County Council and to
Copeland Borough Council on 7 October 1992 about the Company's RCF plans (see
NRX/12/2). The <I>Sellafield Repository Project, A Rock Characterisation
Facility Consultative Document, </I>(&quot;<I>Nirex Report 327</I>&quot;)
[COR/504] was published on 21 October 1992 and gave a fuller description of the
purposes of the RCF. These included providing information required to make a
firmer assessment of the long-term safety of a repository, confirming
assumptions regarding repository location and design and enabling cost estimates
to be refined.
</P>
<P><U>Development of the RCF Concept</U></P>
<P>7.13 Subsequent to the September 1992 decision to propose the RCF as a
free-standing development, the Company developed the concept in detail. It took
account of responses to <I>Nirex Report 327</I> [COR/504] and, in refining the
scientific work to be carried out in the RCF programme, of further information
emerging from the continuing programme of surface-based investigations. A
project team developed detailed specifications and costings for the RCF. 
</P>
<P>7.14 In March 1993 planning permission was granted by Cumbria County Council
for temporary development needed to drill RCF monitoring and centre-line
boreholes at Longlands Farm. These boreholes were required to build the
necessary understanding of existing geological and hydrogeological conditions at
the site, and subsequently to monitor the effects of RCF construction on those
conditions. Updated interpretations of the Sellafield geology and hydrogeology
were published in <I>the Geology and Hydrogeology of the Sellafield Area:
Interim Assessment. December 1993</I>, <I>Nirex Report 524</I>, [COR/517] and
the accompanying <I>Nirex Report 525 Scientific Update 1993</I> [COR/505]
explained the current status of the Company's Science Programme, including the
continued development of its approach to modelling of post-closure safety
performance of a repository.
</P>
<P>7.15 In January 1994, with the borehole drilling at Longlands Farm well
under way, the Company adopted as a key objective the securing of early planning
approval for the RCF. Following detailed consultation through the NLG about a
draft Environmental Statement, a planning application and accompanying
documentation were submitted on 29 July 1994.
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Review"></A>8. REVIEW OF THE NIREX APPROACH</B></P>
<P><B>Government Views on Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>8.1 A recommendation in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I> [GOV/409]
(see paragraph 5.35) was that, for repository site selection decisions already
made, there be a careful, conscious matching of the process adopted against the
multiple phases of a new approach recommended by the Group. In response, in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] (paras. 106-110) the Government set down the
results of a consideration of whether Nirex has adopted a reasonable approach in
its investigations so far.
</P>
<P>8.2 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> describes how the Government accepted
Nirex's 1989 recommendation to explore first Dounreay and Sellafield to decide
on their suitability as sites for a repository. It notes the subsequent
concentration of investigations on Sellafield because of the advantages that
that site offered in terms of transport, and that the RCF would form part of
those investigations. It makes no recommendation for a different approach.
</P>
<P>8.3 At paragraph 110 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> the Government
states the following:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The matters about which the Secretary of State has said he
specifically wishes to be informed by the public inquiry into the RCF concern
the local impact of the facility's construction. The Government has already
promised to hold a full public inquiry into an application for the repository
itself, wherever it may be situated. The Government sees no reason to depart
from this procedure.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Views of Independent Bodies on the RCF Proposal
</B></P>
<P>8.4 Independent bodies have indicated their support for the RCF proposal, as
Dr Holmes explains more fully in Section 7 of his Proof of Evidence. I mention
here briefly the views of the RWMAC and of a Royal Society Study Group.
</P>
<P>8.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
states (paragraph 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) [COR/605],
published in November 1994, concluded in Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause. International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>IAEA Site Selection Framework
</B></P>
<P>8.7 The Nirex approach, including the RCF as an essential part of the Site
Confirmation stage, is consistent with the recommendations in<I> IAEA Safety
Series No. 59</I> [GOV/501]. It is also consistent with a Safety Guide published
by the IAEA in 1994 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 111 - G-4.1 Siting of Geological
Disposal Facilities A Safety Guide - A Publication within the RADWASS Programme</I>
[GOV/507]. That document refines the description of the site selection process.
It distinguishes explicitly a screening phase - comparable to that adopted by
Nirex - which is applied after geological, hydrogeological and other features
are considered, within the Area Survey Stage (see paragraph 322). The next stage
is labelled &quot;<I>Site Characterization</I>&quot;(see paragraph 303 of
GOV/507) rather than Site Identification. Its result is &quot;<I>identification
of one or more preferred sites for further study</I>&quot;(see paragraph 325)<I></I>in
the Site Confirmation Stage through which &quot;<I>a decision on site
suitability is made</I>&quot;(see paragraph 332)</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFProgramme"></A>9. THE RCF WITHIN THE FORWARD PROGRAMME</B></P>
<P>9.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence, I cover the way in which
information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the regulatory
authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development of a DWR
at Sellafield. I also discuss the RCF programme in the context of the total cost
and duration of the provisional programme for bringing a DWR into operation at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>Information Required for Decision to Propose Development of a DWR
</B></P>
<P>9.2 Paragraph 8.5 of <I>the HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] refers
to the Inspectorates providing &quot;<I>an informed input to the planning
process</I>&quot; in the context of consideration of a proposed disposal
facility &quot;<I>under the town and country planning legislation</I>&quot;.
Paragraphs 4.3 and 4.4 of GOV/307 state, in respect of a major radioactive waste
disposal facility: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In determining a planning application, the planning authority may
consult the Inspectorates on possible environmental impacts of the development.
The Inspectorates will also comment on whether or not there appears to be any
impediment, in the light of the information available to them at the time of
being consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the
categories and quantities intended. Similarly, the HSE would be consulted on
whether there appears to be any impediment to granting a site licence.&quot;</I>
(paragraph 4.3)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Notwithstanding any provisional views given by the Inspectorates
at the planning stage, the authorisations under RSA93 and licensing by the HSE
under the NI Act 1965 will remain legally separate from decisions under the town
and country planning legislation. Decisions on whether to grant an authorisation
or a licence might not be taken until later stages.</I>&quot; (paragraph 4.4).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.3 <I>The HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] set out for
consultation a staged application approach as a possible means of facilitating
the timely resolution of an application for authorisation of a major radioactive
waste disposal facility. In its October 1994 response to <I>the HMIP
Consultation Document</I> Nirex stated in paragraph 5 of the Executive Summary
(reproduced in NRX/12/4) that such an option:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>would be welcome in managing the commercial and strategic
risk associated with such a project, and Nirex has for some time envisaged the
provision of safety assessment information to the Inspectorates on a progressive
basis related to the lengthy schedule for repository development</I>.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.4 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] states in paragraph 62 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>For major projects, it is expected that developers will make early
applications for disposal authorisations. This would be at about the same time
that they seek full planning permission for the project, although it would be
determined separately. The regulators would then be able to decide on
authorisations before major commitments of money and effort had been made. If
the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted containing
conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval to start
operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned. ... The
procedure will be available under existing legislation for any applicants who
choose this route. They will not be required to do so, but the greater certainty
it could provide will give applicants an incentive to apply early in the process
in appropriate cases. Further guidance will be given in the revised and updated
version of </I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to the administration of
the Act<I>.</I>&quot; </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.5 Pending evaluation of a final version of HMIPs guidance document and of
a revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to
the administration of the Act</I>, the Companys working assumption as described
in Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph <A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">6.21</A>
of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) is that it will be appropriate to make an application for
authorisation under RSA93 at about the same time as an application for planning
permission to develop the repository. The time at which it is decided whether to
make those applications will constitute the first key decision point in
development of a repository. A decision by the regulatory authorities whether to
approve the start of waste disposal operations, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, would be a subsequent key decision point.   
</P>
<P>Dialogue with the Regulatory Authorities
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.6"></A>9.6 Before finally selecting a particular site at
which to propose repository development, at the first decision point, Nirex
needs to engage in a dialogue with the regulatory authorities about the
developing post-closure safety assessment of a repository located at that site.
The assessment will comprise results from probabilistic calculations and
consideration of a specific repository option against the Inspectorates'
principles and requirements. Through such a dialogue, it will be possible to
take a progressively firmer view about whether, in the light of the assessment,
the regulatory authorities are likely to see any impediment to the eventual
authorisation of a repository for waste disposal and grant of a site licence.
</P>
<P>9.7 By agreement, between 1991 and 1994, Nirex and the authorising
Departments exchanged information and views on Nirex's developing approach to
the evaluation of the Sellafield site. Discussions are in progress about a new
agreement, providing for a more structured approach to dialogue between Nirex
and the regulatory authorities prior to submission of any application for
authorisation of a specific repository option at Sellafield under RSA93. The
principles would be similar to the arrangements envisaged at paragraph 4.1 of
GOV/307 under which the developer of a repository would agree with the
regulatory authorities in advance a programme for the progressive supply of
information once an application is submitted for authorisation of waste
disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.8"></A>9.8 Dr Mellors evidence describes the three phases of
work in the RCF programme, illustrated in
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>.
The Phase 1 work provides for shaft sinking which, as Dr Holmes describes in his
evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of
<B>PE/NRX/13</B>), has been identified as playing a major part in the process
of model validation. Dr Mellor explains (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#Para5.9">5.9</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>) that results
from Phase 1 will be released as they are obtained from each sector of the
shaft-sinking programme. They will be an important input to the dialogue with
the regulators which I have described.    
</P>
<P><U>Requirements for the First Decision Point</U></P>
<P>9.9 Any choice of Sellafield as the site for repository development could
not responsibly be made unless Nirex's intention were to develop the repository
on grant of permission. The current target cost for constructing the repository
is &#163;805 million at 1995 prices (see <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>).
Additionally, depending when planning permission were granted, there could be
tens of &#163;millions of expenditure on continuing studies in the RCF (see
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>) to provide information needed for the key
decision point at which the regulatory authorities decide whether to approve the
start of waste disposal operations.
</P>
<P>9.10 Given the scale of the financial commitment which would follow, any
decision to propose development of a repository will obviously require a more
confident assessment of post-closure safety than did the 1992 decision to
continue the site investigation programme through the RCF. Through dialogue with
the regulators - informed by review of information which will come from the
continuing surface-based investigations and from the RCF programme - the Company
will be able to reach a view at any point as to how far the regulatory
principles and requirements for a repository are in its view effectively met or,
alternatively, how confident it is of satisfying them at the culmination of the
authorisation process.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.11"></A>9.11 Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.23">6.23</A> of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) explains
the position which the Company needs to have reached in respect of the key
matters before it could decide to propose development of a repository. Those
matters are confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution;
establishing that changes in the geological and hydrogeological setting,
following repository construction or naturally induced changes, would not result
in new pathways for water flow which would significantly impair repository
performance; and reaching provisional decisions on, and establishing a basis for
future optimisation of, key design parameters for a repository. Without
assurance of that kind in these three areas, the Company could not satisfy
itself that a repository at a particular site would meet regulatory requirements
and principles for operational and post-closure safety and that it could be
constructed safely and at acceptable cost. Paragraph 7.8 of this Proof of
Evidence explained that those are the key matters bearing on a decision to
propose repository development.
</P>
<P>9.12 As I described at paragraph 9.2 above, <I>the HMIP Consultation
Document</I> [GOV/307] states that, in the context of the determination of a
planning application to develop a DWR, the regulatory authorities will comment
to the planning authority whether there appears to be any impediment, in the
light of the information available to them at the time of being consulted, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. The
Company will keep under continuing review how far the results from its
investigations at Sellafield meet the requirements that I have described above
and whether its dialogue with the regulatory authorities had established that
those authorities would see no such impediment. Unless and until it were
confident that the regulatory authorities would foresee no such impediment, the
Company would not propose development of a repository. Recognising the nature of
the repository system, Government policy stresses that risk calculations can
only <B>inform </B>a judgment about the safety of a disposal facility. It
points out that &quot;<I>other technical factors, including ones of a more
qualitative nature, will also need to be considered</I>...&quot; (paragraph 78
of GOV/208). So it is necessary for the Company to adopt a contingent approach
to deciding whether and when to propose development of a repository, taking
account of the progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities.
</P>
<P><B>Timing 
</B></P>
<P>9.13 As described in Section 5 of this Proof of Evidence, the Governments
1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review concluded that Nirex should
work towards developing the DWR without any unnecessary delay and that, once a
suitable site has been found, it should be constructed as soon as reasonably
practicable. Specifically, as noted in paragraph 5.21 of this Proof of Evidence,
<I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> stated in paragraph 10.39: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The review has concluded that the common interest is in working
towards developing the repository without unnecessary delay, but allowing
appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety case and compliance
with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <I>Department of the Environment News Release</I> of 9 May 1995
[GOV/213] stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] stated in paragraph 101:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The precise timetable will depend on the granting of planning
consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the establishment
of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In addition, at paragraph 44 of GOV/208 the Government referred to &quot;<I>its
policies in relation to the timely disposal of waste</I>&quot;.
</P>
<P><U>Conditional Targets</U></P>
<P>9.14 As foreshadowed in 1994 in <I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>
[GOV/306] the Government policy statements given above overtake the provisions
of <I>the 1990 White Paper </I>[GOV/204] which referred to &quot;<I>speed up</I>&quot;
of Nirexs site investigations and to a proposal for development of a repository
coming &quot;<I>to a public inquiry as soon as possible</I>&quot; (paragraph
15.38 of GOV/204). As it made clear in &quot;<I>UK Nirex Report 710. United
Kingdom Nirex Limited Response to Department of Environment Consultation on
Radioactive Waste Management Policy - 14 October 1994</I>&quot; [&quot;<I>the
Nirex Response to the DoE Consultation</I>&quot;] [NRX/12/3] the Company
welcomes that change of emphasis, given the underlying requirements of careful
scientific characterisation of a repository site. Nirex believes the change
should also be helpful to public confidence (see paragraph 6.6.9 of NRX/12/3). 
</P>
<P>9.15 As I have described in paragraph 5.23 above, <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208] recognised that additional costs incurred in radioactive
waste disposal should be set against the benefits arising from improvements in
safety achieved. The &quot;<I>level of safety, and the resources required to
achieve it, should not be inconsistent with those accepted in other spheres of
human activity</I>&quot; (paragraph 51). The Companys approach is consistent
with that Government policy. As noted in paragraphs 6.6.10 to 6.7.2 of NRX/12/3,
on behalf of its customers Nirex must work to provide a deep repository
cost-effectively. An important requirement is to ensure that, subject to the
thorough approach to the scientific issues which is necessary to demonstrate
that regulatory requirements are met, and to the need to sustain public
acceptance, the repository be brought into operation without unnecessary delay.
As with any major capital programme - and in economic terms the major sums
invested in conceptual studies and site characterisation are akin to capital
spending - effective control of costs requires the avoidance of avoidable delays
during the development and construction stages.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.16"></A>9.16 One cost of unnecessary delay is the extra
interest which would accrue on the Companys financing. For the year to 31 March
1996, interest accruing on Shareholder loans under the Shareholders' Agreement
is projected at &#163;33 million. The annual interest charge will tend to rise
as the Companys borrowings increase through time. In addition, if the overall
duration of the Companys programme to first emplacement of waste in a repository
is extended, there would be substantial extra outlays involved in keeping
certain contractor teams and Company teams in place over a longer period. Under
both these headings, any delays in proceeding with Phases 2 and 3 of the RCF of
the kind discussed by Dr Holmes in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.30">6.30</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
would bring substantial additional costs.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.17"></A>9.17 Because the project schedule itself is an
important influence on total costs and tariff levels to customers, and because
it is necessary to give a clear focus to the work of the scientific and
engineering teams engaged on the DWR programme, it is appropriate for Nirex as
the developer to work towards a target date for repository operation. For the
future, as in the past, it is recognised that the target will, appropriately, be
kept under review in the light of developments.    
</P>
<P><U>Views of the RWMAC</U></P>
<P>9.18 In October 1994, in <I>the</I> <I>RWMAC Response on: the Department
of Environment's Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I> [GOV/413],
the RWMAC stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>Nirex's site investigation programme, the development of the
repository safety case and the appropriate authorisation and planning procedures
must all be carried out rigorously. There are obviously some programme issues
that are not in Nirex's control and it may be inappropriate to set fixed
deadlines for the operation of the repository.</I>&quot; (paragraph 58)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>... <I>Clear focusing and targeting are essential to carry forward the
complex repository project. ... </I>&quot; (paragraph 59.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These views are very much in line with the Companys approach to
target-setting within the Government's policy that appropriate time be allowed
for establishment of a sound safety case and compliance with the necessary
planning and regulatory requirements and that no precise deadline should be set
for that process. 
</P>
<P><U>Timing of a Decision to Propose Repository Development</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.19"></A>9.19 The Company has long emphasised that its
forward site investigation programme, undertaken in the RCF and otherwise, can
only be planned on a flexible and provisional basis. <I>Nirex Report 327 </I>[COR/504]
explained this in the context of results expected to flow progressively from the
RCF programme. Specifically, paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504 stated that if,
but only if, the results expected to be gathered during the RCF shaft sinking &quot;<I>prove
to be essentially confirmatory of geological and hydrogeological assessments
derived from surface-based investigations</I>&quot; (paragraph 1.13 of COR/504)
then a planning application for a repository could be submitted within six
months or so of excavating down to the most promising horizon for repository
development. It was emphasised that &quot;<I>more extended underground work
might be required before a judgment is possible about such an application</I>&quot;
(paragraph 1.13 COR/504).
</P>
<P>9.20 As Dr Holmes makes clear in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
Nirex continues to assume that a decision to propose repository development
could be made on the basis of the results from the scientific programme
associated with Phase 1 of the RCF, which now runs for approximately four years
and is planned to finish approximately 9 months after completion of the shafts.
As I have explained in paragraph 9.8 above, those results will be released
progressively, sector by sector, to the regulatory authorities. They will also
be published. However, consistently with paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504, Dr
Holmes also explains that further investigations, in RCF Phase 2, and possibly
Phase 3, could be necessary before a decision is made on repository development.
</P>
<P><U>Current Planning Timetable</U></P>
<P>9.21 In addition to scheduling adjustments necessitated by flexible
responses to information emerging from the characterisation of a natural rock
environment, outcomes from the process of obtaining planning permissions for
necessary investigatory developments can affect the Companys planning.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.22"></A>9.22 The Companys present planning assumption is
that if planning permission for the RCF were granted by the Secretary of State
in mid-1996 and if the Phase 1 results provide an adequate basis for deciding to
make a planning application to develop a repository at Sellafield then first
waste emplacement in a repository will be possible in the first half of 2011.
Nirex will not be declaring a new target date for first waste emplacement - be
it 2011 or some other date - until the Secretary of States decision on the
current appeal is known.
</P>
<P>9.23 Within that overall planning schedule, it is assumed that sinking of
the South Shaft would begin in December 1996 and the Phase 1 Science Programme
would be completed in February 2001. It is expected that the scientific
programme associated with Phase 1 could enable the Company to decide at that
point whether to propose repository development. The first decision point could
on that basis be timed for February 2001 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>9.24 The progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities would be a
crucial consideration in the decision. It is envisaged that an assessment of
post-closure safety would have been submitted to the regulatory authorities
ahead of the earliest date for the first decision point, to provide a basis for
review of key input assumptions. Confidence in the assumptions and judgments
made on the hydrogeological system would be provided by the RCF results as they
were progressively released through Phase1.
</P>
<P>9.25 Assuming that planning permission for a DWR could be granted 3 years
after submission of the planning application and allowing approximately 7 years
for repository construction points to the planning date of first half 2011 for
first emplacement of waste in a repository at Sellafield. Given the many issues
outside Nirex control, that date is indicative. If it were achieved then 22
years would have elapsed since detailed investigations began at Sellafield in
1989. Within that period, 15 years would have been devoted to activities
preceding the grant of planning permission for repository development. This is
not out of line with indicative programmes for deep disposal which have been
announced by various countries overseas, as described in
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A> of Dr Holmes' evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>.
</P>
<P><U>Summary</U></P>
<P>9.26 The RCF programme sits within a planning schedule for contingent
development of a DWR at Sellafield which will continue to be managed flexibly,
according to the needs of safety assessment and taking account of the other
factors I have described. Results from Phase 1 will inform dialogue with the
regulatory authorities and the Company would not propose development of a
repository until it were confident that those authorities would see no
impediment, in the light of information available to them, to authorisation and
licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P><B>Projected Expenditure on the RCF and DWR Development
</B></P>
<P>9.27 Total outlays on the deep disposal programme up to 31 March 1995 and
targeted through to 2011, in respect of a DWR assumed to be built at Sellafield,
are shown in <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A> and illustrated year by year in
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>. The projections are consistent with the
planning dates for successive stages of the programme given in paragraphs 9.21
to 9.25 above. They exclude interest and contingencies. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.28"></A>9.28 Up to 31 March 1995, Nirex outlays in pursuit
of deep disposal totalled &#163;391 million at 1995 prices. Within that total,
expenditure on the Science Programme which was specific to Sellafield amounted
to approximately &#163;252 million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P>9.29 At the present stage of the repository programme, a key focus for
management control purposes is on development and construction outlays for
bringing a Sellafield repository into operation. Current projections are for a
total outlay of &#163;1884 million at 1995 prices to bring a repository into
operation there .
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.30"></A>9.30 From 1 April 1995 the projected outlays for the
RCF programme are &#163;195 million at 1995 prices, being &#163;124 million for
construction and &#163;71 million for directly associated scientific work. This
represents 10.4% of the total projected outlays leading to a DWR at Sellafield
and 13.1% of the projected outlays to be incurred from 1 April 1995. As can be
seen from <A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>, even at its projected peak in
2000-01, the RCF outlay will be less than half total Company expenditure in any
year. Annual Company expenditures in real terms, on Sellafield site
investigations and in total, peaked in 1993-94. Company outlays, on the
investigations and in total, will not exceed the historical peak levels until
well into the next century.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.31"></A>9.31 The maximum projected annual expenditure on the
RCF, including directly associated scientific studies, is &#163;23.6 million at
1995 prices, arising in 2000-01. Contracts for the construction of the RCF and
the undertaking of the scientific work directly connected with it have not been
negotiated. But the Company's intention is to limit its financial commitment
through termination provisions, which will ensure the right to terminate at any
time. Given the projected pattern of expenditure, costs associated with early
termination are unlikely to exceed &#163;10 million at 1995 prices. Site
restoration is costed at up to &#163;3 million. So on that basis the maximum
forward commitment to the RCF project, at any time, would be approximately &#163;13
million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.32"></A>9.32 Any serious scientific investigation of a
preferred site demands the commitment of significant resources, so that the high
standards demanded by Government policy on safety can be demonstrated to be met.
In the Sellafield context, it is clear from <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>,
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A> and the discussion above that the
expenditure involved in RCF construction and associated scientific work
represents a small proportion of the projected costs for the contingent deep
repository programme. It is neither a &quot;<I>significant pre-commitment to
eventual repository development in economic terms</I>&quot; nor &quot;<I>a
'halfway' commitment to development of a repository at Sellafield</I>&quot; as
suggested in Cumbria County Council's Fifth reason for refusal of the RCF
application.

<P> <B>The Scientific Case for the RCF</B></P>
<P>1.2 There appears to be a consensus between Nirex and the Objectors that a
stage of underground investigations is required in order to evaluate fully the
potential of a site to host a deep repository for radioactive waste.</P>
<P>1.3 The Objectors advance two main strands of argument for not granting
planning permission for the RCF at Sellafield:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Sellafield is a 'poor site' and hence there is no point in proceeding with
the RCF and investigations should be transferred to one or more alternative
sites; and</LI>
<LI>development of the RCF at Sellafield is premature as further work is
required, including establishment of baseline conditions, prior to RCF
construction.</LI></UL>
<P>1.4 Nirex's position is that the site holds good promise as a potentially
suitable location for a repository and that it is appropriate to develop the RCF
now.</P>
<P>1.5 In respect of 'good promise', a substantial base of information on the
characteristics of the site has been established.  However, the suitability or
otherwise of a site cannot be established on the basis of review of individual
characteristics in isolation.  Nor can it be established on the basis of a
comparison of whether or not a site meets descriptions of generic environments
used to assist in site sieving during the site identification phase.  It is the
evaluation of the overall post-closure safety performance of a repository at a
site which determines the suitability or otherwise of a site.</P>
<P>1.6 The post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield has
been evaluated in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522] which indicates results consistent
with regulatory requirements.  Site characterisation data coming forward since
those which comprised the basis for
<I>Nirex 95</I> have broadly confirmed its basis, but there are some
indications that it may have been conservative in its representation of networks
of connected fractures in the BVG and between the BVG and the overlying
sandstones above the North Head Member of the St Bees Sandstone.</P>
<P>1.7 I consider that now is the appropriate time to develop the RCF for the
following reasons:</P>
<UL>
<LI>baseline conditions have been established;</LI>
<LI>our understanding of the site has reached a sufficient level of development
and the necessary scientific tools are available; and</LI>
<LI>further work to be carried out in parallel with the RCF is unlikely to 
change our view of site performance substantially.</LI></UL>
<P>1.8 Confidence in our evaluation of the performance of a repository at
Sellafield is not yet sufficient to underpin a decision on whether or not to
propose development of repository.  The RCF is the essential next step to reach
that decision point.  There is no reason not to proceed with the RCF given that
baseline conditions have been established, and that science and our
understanding of the site are sufficiently advanced to ensure the RCF will take
our confidence forward.  The Royal Society Study Group, the RWMAC and the Nirex
Review Panel have similarly concluded that the RCF is an appropriate, timely and
essential next step in our programme.  Other deep waste repository programmes
round the world plan for a similar stage of underground investigations in order
to establish the suitability of sites for a repository.</P>
<P> <B>Miscellaneous Issues</B>

Evidence or in cross-examination of Mr Folger as follows:</P>

<P>2.2 Section 3 identifies the consensus on the need for a stage of
underground investigations to evaluate fully the potential of a site to host a
deep repository and summarises the reasons given by the Objectors for not
granting planning permission for the RCF.  It then goes on to summarise Nirex's
scientific case for the RCF and, in particular, that the site holds good promise
for a deep repository and that now is the appropriate time for development of
the RCF.</P>
<P>2.3 Section 4 addresses four issues as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>peer review;</LI>
<LI>Royal Society Study;</LI>
<LI>uniqueness; and</LI>
<LI>scientific approach.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="ScientificCase"></A><B>3. THE SCIENTIFIC CASE FOR THE RCF</B></P>
<P>3.1 This Section summarises Nirex's scientific case for the RCF in response
to that made by the Objectors against it, as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the consensus on the need for a stage of underground investigations to
evaluate fully the potential of a site to host a deep repository for radioactive
waste (paragraphs 3.2 to 3.4);</LI>
<LI>the scientific case made by the Objectors against the RCF at Sellafield
(paragraph 3.5 to 3.10);</LI>
<LI>the scientific case for the RCF in respect of the good promise that
Sellafield has as a potentially suitable location for a repository (paragraphs
3.11 to 3.23);</LI>
<LI>the scientific case for the RCF in respect of now being the appropriate
time for its development (paragraphs 3.24 to 3.30); and</LI>
<LI>conclusions (paragraphs 3.31 to 3.33).</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Consensus"></A><B> Consensus on the Need for Underground
Investigations</B></P>
<P>3.2 There appears to be a consensus between Nirex and the Objectors that a
stage of underground investigations is required in order to evaluate fully the
potential of a site to host a deep repository for radioactive waste.  Thus, for
example, at paragraph 1.4 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/CCC/7) Mr Hetherington
indicates:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The County Council, of course, accepts that in-situ
characterisation of a chosen site is necessary before final regulatory approval</I>&quot;.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> At paragraph 4.20 of PE/CCC/7 Mr Hetherington indicates:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The hydrogeological and safety case evidence we have put forward
suggests that now is the time to fully review the Sellafield option.  It is in
this context that the RWMAC support for the RCF as a whole must be judged.  In
effect the Council accepts their overall approach, 'in simple terms, the more
information, the better</I>.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.3 Similarly, Dr Green and DrWestern for Friends of the Earth indicate
(PE/FOE/1, paragraph 9.5):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Within the staged development of a nuclear waste repository
construction of a rock characterisation facility will be required.  However, it
is critically important that RCF construction is not undertaken prematurely.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.4 Dr Haszeldine for Greenpeace indicates (PE/GNP/3, paragraph 16.10):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>I have no objection to the principle of a Rock Laboratory in the
UK.  However the choice of the present site appears premature</I>, ....&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Objectors"></A> <B>The Scientific Case of the Objectors Against
the RCF </B></P>
<P>3.5 The Objectors advance two main strands of argument for not granting
planning permission for the RCF at Sellafield:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Sellafield is a 'poor site' and hence there is no point in proceeding with
the RCF and investigations should be transferred to one or more alternative
sites; and</LI>
<LI>development of the RCF at Sellafield is premature as further work is
required, including establishment of baseline conditions, prior to RCF
construction.</LI></UL>
<P> I will deal with each of these in turn.</P>
<P>Poor  Site</P>
<P>3.6 It is primarily Cumbria County Council and, in particular, Professor
Mather, Dr Starmer and Mr Hetherington who develop the argument that an RCF
should not be developed at Sellafield because it is a &quot;<I>poor site</I>&quot;.
Professor Mather lists a series of &quot;<I>negative characteristics</I>&quot;
of the groundwater regime at paragraph 8.7 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/CCC/4),
points to &quot;<I>the complexity and unpredictability of the hydrogeology</I>&quot;
at paragraph 8.9, and concludes at paragraph 8.10,  &quot;<I>The evidence so
far collected reinforces the conclusion that this is a poor site</I>&quot;. 
Thus Professor Mather bases his &quot;<I>poor site</I>&quot; conclusion on
hydrogeological characteristics rather than an evaluation of post-closure safety
performance of a repository.</P>
<P>3.7 Dr Starmer does consider post-closure safety performance and concludes
at paragraph 7.9 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/CCC/5) that &quot;.....
<I>the current performance assessment is not robust</I>&quot;, and that, &quot;.....
<I>no amount of further investigation or improvements in models will guarantee
improved results that will unequivocally meet the risk target</I>&quot;.
</P>
<P>3.8 Mr Hetherington, on the basis of the conclusions of Professor Mather and
Dr Starmer, draws a somewhat firmer conclusion that &quot;....
<I>it is already evident that the Sellafield site is not suitable for the use
proposed</I> <I>(a repository) and that Nirex, rather than proceeding with the
RCF now, should take time to revisit and re-evaluate a site or sites which are
likely to lower radiological risk and provide greater levels of confidence in
their assessment.</I>&quot;  (PE/CCC/7, paragraph 2.5).  Mr Hetherington does
not indicate whether his conclusion that Sellafield is not suitable means that
he considers that the site will not meet regulatory requirements.  Nirex has
previously acknowledged that sites offering lower radiological risk could
potentially exist (<B>PE/NRX/12/S1</B>, <A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12s1.htm#Para6.4">paragraphs
6.4</A> and <A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12s1.htm#Para6.5">6.5</A>).</P>
<P>3.9 Dr Haszeldine for Greenpeace expresses reservations about the
suitability of the site, and in particular at paragraph 16.6 of PE/GNP/3, &quot;<I>This
is arguably one of the most geologically difficult sites in the UK on which to
construct a Repository for radioactive waste</I>.&quot;  However, he does not
appear to rule the site out, given his comments at paragraph 16.10 (PE/GNP/3) on
the need for more information at Sellafield.</P>
<P> Prematurity</P>
<P>3.10 It is primarily Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace who develop the
line of argument that development of the RCF at Sellafield is premature.  Dr
Green and Dr Western for Friends of the Earth conclude (PE/FOE/1, paragraph
10.6):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>FOE concludes that, because of the large volume of further
necessary work before Nirex should commence on upon </I>[sic]<I>RCF
construction, the length of time that this essential work will take, and the
lack of a properly validated baseline model of existing conditions on the site,
planning permission should not be granted</I>&quot;.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Dr Richardson for Greenpeace indicates (PE/GNP/4, paragraph 11.3):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In international terms the site characterisation role of RCF is
premature, since laboratories have not yet demonstrated that adequate
predictions in fractured rock can be made</I>&quot;.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="GoodPromise"></A> <B>The Scientific Case for the RCF: Good
Promise</B>
</P>
<P>3.11 Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper in their Main and Supplementary Proofs of
Evidence (<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm"><B>PE/NRX/14</B></A>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14s1.htm"><B>PE/NRX/14/S1</B></A> and
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm"><B>PE/NRX/15</B></A>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15s1.htm"><B>PE/NRX/15/S1</B></A> respectively) have
presented the basis for Nirex's conclusion that Sellafield holds goods promise
as a potentially suitable location for a repository.  That basis is summarised
in paragraphs 3.12 to 3.23 below.</P>
<P>3.12 Results from the extensive programme of investigations that has been
carried out since 1989 show that the characteristics of the site are broadly as
envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for detailed geological
investigations, but that we now have a much more detailed picture of the site
than then existed.  The results indicate that the flow of groundwater through
the potential repository host rock, the BVG, is low and that, in contrast, there
is high flow towards the sea in the upper parts of the overlying sedimentary
rocks.  These characteristics enable the geological setting at Sellafield to
perform the two key functions identified as necessary at
<A HREF="nrx13.htm#Para4.6">paragraph 4.6</A> of my Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>)
to ensure the satisfactory operation of the physical and chemical barriers of
the repository, and to ensure sufficient dilution of residual radionuclides
released from the repository vaults.
</P>
<P>3.13 Although many radionuclides can be contained within a repository until
they have decayed to insignificant levels, in the long term some releases of
long-lived radionuclides will inevitably occur.  Retardation and dilution in the
geological environment are then the active mechanisms whereby the concentrations
of these radionuclides and their consequent radiological impacts are reduced. 
For mobile and long-lived radionuclides which do not appear to interact strongly
with the rock such as chlorine&#173;36 and iodine-129, dilution is the most
important process.</P>
<P>3.14 That dilution has an important role to play in ensuring post-closure
safety was recognised at paragraph 3.2.8 of <I>Nirex Report No. 71.  Deep
Repository Project, Preliminary Environmental &amp; Radiological Assessment and
Preliminary Safety Report</I> (&quot;<I>PERA</I>&quot;) [COR/501]:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Dispersal, dilution and radioactive decay with time during
radionuclide migration through the geosphere provide additional mechanistic
barriers</I>&quot;.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Similar conclusions have been reached in the Swiss programme to develop a
high-level waste repository (NRX/13/3, page 81):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Although it is not normally regarded as a safety barrier, the
importance of the contrast between the low water flux through the
low-permeability basement and the much higher fluxes in major water-conducting
faults, higher-permeability crystalline basement, overlying sediments, gravel
aquifers and surface waters, should be emphasised.  Dilution along the flow path
considerably decreases the concentration of any released radionuclides and hence
also their potential hazard</I>&quot;.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.15 The European Commission recommended criteria for siting a repository
also recognise the role to be played by dilution (FOE/7/14, page 6):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Because water is the most effective natural carrier of
radioactivity out of the repository, low groundwater flow and/or appropriate
dilution capabilities are essential requirements, together with appropriate
characteristics of the underground waters</I>&quot;.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.16 It is not, however, the hydrogeological characteristics of a site in
isolation that form the basis for judging the suitability or otherwise of a
site, but the evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a repository
at the site.   This is discussed at 
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12s1.htm#Para6.24">paragraphs 6.24</A> to 6.28 of Mr
Folger's Supplementary Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12/S1</B>).</P>
<P>3.17 Potential repository performance in respect of the groundwater pathway,
given our understanding of the site in early 1994 has therefore been evaluated
in <I>Nirex 95: A Preliminary Analysis of the Groundwater Pathway for a Deep
Repository at Sellafield</I> (&quot;<I>Nirex 95</I>&quot;<I>)</I> [COR/522]. 
<I> </I>The analysis of repository performance at Sellafield, presented in
<I>Nirex 95</I> incorporates uncertainties in the evaluation of risk in a
manner consistent with regulatory requirements.  Conservative, simplifying
assumptions have been used where current understanding does not permit more
detailed description of the mechanisms and processes to be incorporated with
confidence.  The analysis specifically includes features of the site identified
by Objectors as &quot;<I>negative characteristics</I>&quot; for example, the
potential for hydraulic connection over extended distances within the BVG and
between the BVG and overlying sandstones (the Type II<I> </I>features).
</P>
<P>3.18 <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522] presents a base case in which calculated
risks for terrestrial discharge in the boreal biosphere are 1.1x10<SUP>-7
</SUP>at twenty thousand years and 3.3x10<SUP>-7</SUP> at four million years. 
For the agricultural well, a peak annual risk of 1.7x10<SUP>-6</SUP> is
indicated on the basis of preliminary calculations.  The potential
over-estimation of risk from the agricultural well in these calculations due to
the neglect of dilution by recent meteoric water is discussed at page 6.19 of
Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522].  Dr Hooper's Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
at <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.39">paragraph 5.39</A>) points to design
measures that could be taken to reduce risks if necessary.  It is considered
that these factors should lead to values of calculated risk below the target in
future evaluations.</P>
<P>3.19 It is recognised that the assessment models used in<I> Nirex 95</I>
[COR/522] do not fully reproduce the elevated heads at depth.   Also,
information from the Site Characterisation Programme arising subsequent to that
which forms the basis for <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522] suggests that the extent of
hydraulic connections within the BVG, and to the overlying sandstones above the
North Head Member of the St Bees Sandstone, may have been overestimated (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para6.70">paragraph 6.70</A>, vi and vii; <B>PE/NRX/14/S1</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14s1.htm#Para8.29">paragraphs 8.29</A> to 8.34).  Variant
calculations are included in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522, Section 7] which 
evaluate the consequences for risk of these various effects.  These calculations
show that risk is relatively insensitive to the variants considered.  This
insensitivity lends confidence to the robustness of our evaluation and arises
from the characteristics of the site, in particular the low permeability of the
basement rock and the potential for dilution in the overlying aquifer.  The
factors controlling repository performance at Sellafield are discussed in more
detail in Section 8 of Volume 3 of
<I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522].</P>
<P>3.20 The results presented in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522] reflect a number of
assumptions which it is considered may in due course prove to be unduly
conservative.  Work is in progress to address the basis for these current
assumptions which may lead to revised models whose incorporation in future
assessments will tend to lower calculated risk.  Dr Hooper's evidence
identifies, in particular, the following assumptions:</P>
<UL>
<LI> Unrestricted access of groundwater to the wastes immediately after
repository closure in the base case (Nirex 95, Volume 3, Sub-section 3.3.1(a),
page 3.7) [COR/522].  This has the effect of assuming complete and instantaneous
dissolution in groundwater of the entire inventory of chlorine&#173;36 and
iodine&#173;129.  It ignores the mechanisms that would in reality spread the
release of these radionuclides to groundwater over many thousands of years (and
therefore reduce peak risk) including container corrosion, diffusion through
waste encapsulation materials and corrosion of metals and ceramics where these
incorporate part of the inventory;</LI>
<LI>Release of radionuclides from repository vaults to Type II features (Nirex
95, Volume 3, Sub-section 3.2.4, page 3.5) [COR/522] which is the shortest route
across the BVG.  This ignores potential benefits of avoiding intersections of
vaults with Type II features or sealing Type II features;
</LI>
<LI>Absence of mineralisation as a mechanism for reducing the solubility and
hence the release of uranium&#173;238 in particular (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.49">paragraph 5.49</A>);</LI>
<LI>Reduced sorption in the near field to make allowance for possible long-term
deleterious mechanisms (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.23">paragraph 5.23</A>).  This leads to
higher calculated releases of radionuclides than are suggested by results of
research work on long-term effects (<B>PE/NRX/15/S1</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15s1.htm#Para6.32">paragraph 6.32</A>); and;</LI>
<LI>A depth of the agricultural well consistent with the maximum identified
from practice in the area, ignoring the likelihood of shallower wells due to
their interception of adequate water supply at lesser depth (<B>PE/NRX/15/S1</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15s1.htm#Para8.33">paragraph 8.33</A> and Nirex 95, Volume
3, pages 6.18 to 6.20) [COR/522] and the absence of mixing of recent meteoric
water and sandstone aquifer water in the analysis of the agricultural well
(Nirex 95, Volume 3, page 6.19) [COR/522] which would lead to reductions in
calculated risks.</LI></UL>
<P>3.21 <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522] addresses the most important pathway in
radiological terms, the groundwater pathway, but does not cover all pathways for
radionuclide return to the human environment.  Similarly, it does not address
all processes, e.g. mobilisation of radionuclides by colloids or transient
effects due to climate change, which could, in principle, influence calculated
risk.  It is planned that, through the RCF and other components of the Science
Programme that will be carried out in parallel, we will move to a position where
the safety assessments that underpin the two key decision points identified at
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">paragraph 6.21</A> of my Proof of
Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>) (i.e. a decision by Nirex to propose development of
a repository, and a decision by the regulatory authorities to approve the start
of disposal operations) will address all the factors influencing the
post-closure safety performance of the repository. 
</P>
<P>3.22 Consideration has been given to alternative pathways as summarised in
Dr Hooper's Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.41">paragraphs 5.41</A> to 5.45), and effects
such as the impact of colloids on radionuclide transport or of transient effects
associated with climate change (see <B>PE/NRX/15/S1</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15s1.htm#Para7.52">paragraphs 7.52</A> to 7.58 (colloids),
and <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15s1.htm#Para8.7">paragraphs 8.7</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15s1.htm#Para9.67">9.67</A> to 9.70 (climate change)). 
This consideration has not identified pathways or processes not yet incorporated
in our assessments which are likely to change significantly our conclusions in
respect of repository performance.  Further work in the RCF, and carried out in
parallel with the RCF, will enable these pathways and processes to be
incorporated in the assessments underpinning  future decision points.</P>
<P>3.23 For the groundwater pathway we recognise a number of factors which
could influence the calculated value of risk in future assessments:</P>

<P><A NAME="Timing"></A> <B>The Scientific Case for the RCF : Timing</B></P>
<P>3.24 I consider that it is appropriate to develop the RCF now for the
following reasons:</P>
<UL>
<LI>baseline conditions have been established;</LI>
<LI>our understanding of the site has reached a sufficient level of development
and the necessary scientific tools are available; and</LI>
<LI>further work to be carried out in parallel with the RCF is unlikely to 
change our view of site performance substantially.</LI></UL>
<P> Paragraphs 3.25 to 3.30 below provide further explanation of each of these
three reasons.</P>
<P>3.25 Prior to construction of the RCF, baseline conditions for groundwater
pressures and geochemical conditions need to be established.  Sufficient
information needs to have been acquired so that:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the disturbance created by the RCF can be measured with confidence and used
to test and develop models of the site; and</LI>
<LI>there is a sufficient database on undisturbed conditions that the
properties of the PRZ can be interpreted within the context of regional
groundwater flow and hydrochemical models.</LI></UL>
<P>3.26 Dr Chaplow's Main and Supplementary Proofs of Evidence at
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14a1.htm#Appendix2">Appendix 2</A> of
<B>PE/NRX/14</B> and <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14s1.htm#BaselineHydrogeological">Section
10</A> of <B>PE/NRX/14/S1</B> describe the position which has been achieved in
respect of groundwater pressures and geochemistry and provides the basis for our
view that baseline conditions have been established.  The RWMAC have indicated
that their 1993 recommendations on the time required to establish baseline
conditions are now likely to be met in view of the interpolation into the
programme of the RCF planning inquiry [GOV/414, paragraph 14].  As explained by
Dr Chaplow (<B>PE/NRX/14/S1</B>, <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14s1.htm#Para10.36">paragraphs
10.36</A> to 10.39), where further geochemical data are needed, they can most
appropriately be obtained from the RCF, or from further boreholes (for example,
Boreholes 15 to 18).</P>
<P>3.27 Substantial progress has been made over the last 10 years in
characterising flow in fractured rocks, much of it in radioactive waste
programmes with which Nirex is closely involved.  Also, through appropriate
treatment of uncertainty, the appropriate use of stochastic and deterministic
descriptions, and use of conservative, simplifying assumptions to ensure that we
have not underestimated risk, we do not need a comprehensive understanding and
description of all features and processes.  Given these considerations, it is
our view that the necessary scientific tools are available, in particular in
respect of flow in fractured rocks, to ensure that the RCF can advance our
confidence in the safety assessment.  Dr Hooper's Supplementary Proof of
Evidence at <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15s1.htm#Para9.18">paragraphs 9.18</A> to 9.27
(<B>PE/NRX/15/S1</B>) describes the stage of development of fracture flow
models.</P>
<P>3.28 It is notable that the Royal Society Study Group considered the stage
of development of the relevant fields of science and arrived at the conclusion
(pages 6 and 7) [COR/605] that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Its </I>[the RCF's]<I> construction should begin as soon as is
practicable, bearing in mind the need to complete some site characterisation
studies in advance of the disturbance to the hydrogeological regime that
building the RCF will cause.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> My understanding is that their reservation on timing related to the need to
establish baseline conditions which I have discussed at paragraphs 3.25 and 3.26
above.</P>
<P>3.29 Substantial progress has been made in developing a suite of models of
the groundwater flow system at Sellafield.  The current iteration in their
development associated with the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test will permit further
refinement of those models.  The RCF represents the next major opportunity to
take those models forward, given that it will test their capability to predict
the observations of the groundwater system that will be made in the RCF and it
will enable us to test our judgements on the nature of the networks of connected
fractures upon which they are based.
</P>
<P>3.30 Dr Chaplow has described the extensive programme of surface-based site
characterisation that has been carried out (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14a1.htm#Appendix1">Appendix 1</A>).  We are finding that
new boreholes and new observations are adding to the detail of our understanding
of the site rather than substantially changing that understanding.  It is
considered that remaining surface-based activities, while necessary to complete
our picture, are very unlikely to substantially change our view of the site. 
Whereas conservatisms tending to over-estimate risk have been recognised
(paragraph 3.20), consideration of effects not included in the
<I>Nirex 95</I> safety assessment [COR/522], as discussed at paragraph 3.22
above, indicate that they are unlikely to change substantially our evaluation of
the safety performance of a repository at Sellafield.  It is therefore
appropriate that these remaining activities should be carried out in parallel
with the RCF and there is no sound reason to delay the RCF to allow for the
surface-based experiments to be completed.</P>
<P><A NAME="Conclusions"></A><B>Conclusions</B></P>
<P>3.31 I conclude that a substantial base of information on the
characteristics of the site has been established.  However, the suitability or
otherwise of a site cannot be established on the basis of review of individual
characteristics in isolation.  Nor can it be established on the basis of a
comparison of whether or not a site meets descriptions of generic environments
used to assist in site sieving during the site identification phase.  It is the
evaluation of the overall post-closure safety performance of a repository at a
site which determines its suitability or otherwise.</P>
<P>3.32 The post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield has
been evaluated in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522] which indicates results consistent
with regulatory requirements.  Site characterisation data coming forward since
those which comprised the basis for
<I>Nirex 95</I> have broadly confirmed its basis, but there are some
indications that it may have been conservative in its representation of networks
of connected fractures in the BVG and between the BVG and the overlying
sandstones above the North Head Member of the St Bees Sandstone.</P>
<P>3.33 However, confidence in our evaluation of the performance of a
repository at Sellafield is not yet sufficient to underpin a decision on whether
or not to propose development of repository.  The RCF is the essential next step
to reach that decision point.  There is no reason not to proceed with the RCF
given that baseline conditions have been established, and that science and our
understanding of the site are sufficiently advanced to ensure the RCF will take
our confidence forward.  The Royal Society Study Group, the RWMAC and the Nirex
Review Panel have similarly concluded that the RCF is an appropriate, timely and
essential next step in our programme.  Other deep waste repository programmes
round the world plan for a similar stage of underground investigations in order
to establish the suitability of sites for a repository.</P>

</P>
<P>4.1 In this Section I address four issues raised in Objectors' Proofs of
Evidence or in cross-examination of Mr Folger, as follows:</P>

<TD>scientific approach</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><A NAME="PeerReview"></A><B> Peer Review</B></P>
<P>4.2 The need for peer review of the Nirex Science Programme is a recurrent
theme raised in many of the Objectors' Proofs of Evidence.  Nirex's approach to
peer review and the publication of information from the Science Programme is set
out in Mr Folger's Supplementary Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12/S1</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12s1.htm#Para8.1">paragraphs 8.1</A> to 8.6).  He explains
that peer review is an integral part of the Science Programme.  Consequently,
time is allowed for peer review of plans for activities and of results prior to
publication.  In my Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="nrx13.htm#Para5.4">paragraph 5.4</A>) I explain the quantity of
information that has been published or made available for consultation to date. 
In his evidence to the Inquiry on Day 25, Mr Folger indicated that Nirex will
publish, prior to commencement of RCF shaft sinking, predictions of significant
findings expected to arise during the shaft sinking phase.  Mr Folger indicates
in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#Para9.8">paragraph 9.8</A>) that we will release
results from the RCF sector by sector. </P>
<P>4.3 Hence, I consider that results from the Science Programme have been, and
will continue to be, made available to the wider academic community and other
interested groups, such that the consequent review and challenge, which
complements that which is a regulatory necessity, is facilitated in a timely
way.  Given that the Science Programme has at least 6 years to run prior to a
decision on whether to propose repository development at Sellafield (<B>PE/NRX/12/S1</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12s1.htm#Para4.3">paragraph 4.3</A>), I believe  that
these arrangements will permit Nirex to take full advantage of such review and
associated scientific debate.  I therefore consider that concerns expressed by
Dr Western and Dr Green in their Proof of Evidence (PE/FOE/1, paragraph 7.10)
and by Mr Richardson (PE/GNP/4, paragraph 8.16) are met.</P>
<P>4.4 Mr Richardson indicates (PE/GNP/4, paragraph 10.7) that Nirex's
provisional plan for a decision on a repository planning application at the end
of Phase 1 &quot;<I>flies in the face of all accepted scientific practice</I>&quot;
in that it &quot;<I>does not allow for any independent peer review</I>&quot;. 
As I indicate at paragraph 4.2 above, peer review is an integral part of the
Science Programme and will take place continuously through Phase 1 of the RCF. 
Also, given that Nirex will publish in advance its predictions of significant
findings expected to arise during shaft sinking and results will be published on
a sector by sector basis throughout Phase 1, I consider that there is also
opportunity for review by the wider academic community and other interested
groups.  Initially that review will inform Nirex's decision on whether to
propose repository development, and subsequently it will inform the Public
Inquiry into a repository planning application which it is assumed, in Nirex's
contingent programme, will not commence until a year after completion of the RCF
Phase 1 science programme.</P>
<P><A NAME="RoyalSociety"></A><B>Royal Society Study</B>
</P>
<P>4.5 <I>The Royal Society Study Group Report</I> [COR/605] is referred to by
a number of Objectors in their Proofs of Evidence.  The Royal Society Study was
carried out during the latter part of 1993 and the first half of 1994, following
an invitation to the Royal Society from Nirex.  The Terms of Reference of the
Study are set out at Section 2.2, page 13 of the Study Group's report [COR/605].
 As indicated at Section 2.3 of [COR/605], while the Study was to be concerned
with the development of generic guidelines;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... the Group depended largely upon studying the actual conduct of
the work on the proposed deep repository at Sellafield in order to be able to
address Item 2 </I>[appropriate methods for the treatment of fundamental
uncertainties]<I> of the above Terms of Reference.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.6 <I>The Royal Society Study Group Report</I>  [COR/605] indicates at
page 15 that Appendix E lists the &quot;<I>bibliographic references used in the
preparation of this Report</I>&quot;.  The Nirex response to the Report, and in
particular the six main recommendations set out at pages 10 and 11 was issued in
November 1994 and is attached as Appendix 1.</P>
<P><A NAME="Uniqueness"></A><B>Uniqueness</B></P>
<P>4.7 Questions were put to Mr Folger in cross-examination on the extent to
which the RCF and the Nirex repository project could be considered unique. 
Comparisons between the Nirex project and those in other countries are made in
my Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>, <A HREF="nrx13.htm#Para8.1">paragraphs
8.1</A> to 8.3 and at <A HREF="nrx13.htm#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>).  I conclude
there that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations in an
RCF at Sellafield, prior to a decision on whether to propose development of a
repository, is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P>4.8 In addition to the comparisons made at
<A HREF="nrx13.htm#OtherCountries">Section 8</A> of my Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>),
I would make the following comparisons:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>most new laboratories proposed in other countries are site-specific rather
than generic laboratories;</LI>
<LI>Finland, France and the United States are proceeding straight to rock
characterisation facilities and then repositories without first building and
operating generic laboratories;</LI>
<LI>it is planned in Sweden that a deep waste repository will be operational in
saturated fractured rock for long-lived wastes by the year 2010, i.e. in advance
of the planning date for the Nirex repository, and detailed investigations have
not yet commenced at a candidate site;</LI>
<LI>deep waste repositories for long-lived intermediate level wastes are
planned to be operational by 2000 in Konrad, in Germany, and WIPP in the United
States.  In both cases, safety assessments have been submitted to the
appropriate authorities. </LI></UL>
<P>4.9 Whilst the application of sufficient qualifiers will inevitably result
in uniqueness, particularly for a relatively small sample as in the case of deep
waste repository projects, I consider that there are sufficient similarities
between Nirex's plans and those in other countries that it is inappropriate to
label either the RCF or the Nirex repository programme as unique.</P>
<P><A NAME="ScientificApproach"></A> <B>Scientific Approach</B></P>
<P>4.10 Dr Green and Dr Western at paragraph 7.3 of their Proof of Evidence
(PE/FOE/1) point to paragraph 50 of the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste
Management Policy, Final Conclusions</I> (&quot;<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>&quot;)<I></I>[GOV/208]
and in particular to one of the supporting principles of sustainable development
that &quot;<I>decisions should be based on the best possible scientific
information and analysis of risks</I>&quot;.  At paragraph 10.4 of PE/FOE/1 they
set out five reasons why they do not consider the scientific information
obtained so far in the Nirex Science Programme as being the &quot;<I>best

<P>4.11 More generally, I have set out at <A HREF="nrx13.htm#Para5.1">paragraphs
5.1</A> to 5.6 of my Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>) the approach taken by
Nirex to the Science Programme and, at paragraphs 5.5 and 5.6, the praise from
the RWMAC and the Royal Society for the quality of information arising from the
programme.  An important aspect of our approach is to ensure long-term
involvement of contractors of international repute.  <A HREF="#Table4.1">Table
4.1</A> lists eight of the main contractors who have a major and long-term
involvement in the programme.  I consider that the Nirex Science Programme to
date, and that planned for the future, of which the RCF is an essential
component, is consistent with generating the &quot;<I>best possible scientific
information</I>&quot; indicated at paragraph 50 of the <I>1995 White Paper</I>
[GOV/208].</P>
<P>4.12 Dr Haszeldine at paragraph 15.2 of his Proof of Evidence (PE/GNP/3)
indicates that he is &quot;<I>very impressed with the quality and  validity of
Nirex data.</I>&quot;  He indicates that &quot;<I>I have only praise for the
integrity and generosity of individual scientists from Nirex and its Contractors
whom I have collaborated with</I>&quot;.  However, he indicates at paragraph
15.1 that he has concerns that &quot;<I>major misconceptions in basic
judgements are being propagated through the Nirex system, and are being
undetected by the Nirex system of Quality Assurance (QA).  This concern has been
shown by the ability of a few University scientists to assemble radically
alternative views of the same area, on the same data, to those proposed by
Nirex.</I>&quot;  The Supplementary Proofs of Evidence of Dr Hooper and Dr
Chaplow have established that the &quot;<I>radically alternative views of the
same area</I>&quot; assembled by &quot;<I>a few University scientists</I>&quot;
(PE/GNP/3, paragraph 15.1) (by which I presume Dr Haszeldine means those
University scientists such as himself who have contributed Proofs of Evidence to
the Objectors' cases) are not well founded. </P>

<BR>
</FONT></B>
</P>
<P>Nirex approached the Royal Society in the spring of 1993 to ask if it would
set up an independent Study Group to address the scientific issues associated
with the evaluation of the performance over long timescales of an underground
repository for radioactive wastes.  This approach was prompted by the Company's
desire to ensure that the Nirex Scientific Programme, currently focused on
evaluation of the suitability of a site at Sellafield for a deep repository, is
subjected to high quality challenge and review.  In line with Nirex's policy of
openness in respect of its work, the Company recognised it as important that the
Study Group's conclusions be made public and that the Group should be completely
independent.  The Company is grateful to the Royal Society for responding
positively to the initial approach, and to the Study Group members for all their
efforts in assimilating and drawing together a coherent set of conclusions in a
limited period of time.  Nirex believes that the Study Group has made an
important contribution to public discussion of the science of radioactive waste
disposal and welcomes publication of the Report.</P>
<P>Given the remit of the Study Group to examine the Nirex Scientific Programme
in the context of 'international best practice', Nirex is pleased to note the
conclusions drawn about the quality of Nirex's scientific work and the high
respect which it commands from others engaged in parallel work worldwide.  Also
welcome is the firm endorsement of the need to proceed with the Rock
Characterisation Facility (RCF), the next major step in Nirex's programme to
characterise the Sellafield site.</P>
<P>One objective in setting up the Study was to identify areas in which the
Nirex programme could be strengthened.  The Study Group's recommendations in
this respect are therefore particularly useful and in many cases work is already
in hand, or planned, to address the issues raised by the Study Group.  </P>
<P><A NAME="PageA1.3"></A>The initial Nirex response addresses the six
principal recommendations made by the Study Group as follows:</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">1.</TD>
<TD>With respect to the timetable of the programme, Nirex well accepts the need
to respect the stage of development of the science and the need to expose key
issues of interpretation to review and scientific debate in advance of a public
inquiry into a repository.  In fact, such factors are key elements in Nirex's
forward planning, which sets tight targets to maintain momentum and
cost-effectiveness but provides scope to take more time to resolve particular
issues as necessary.  The Study Group has recognised Nirex's track record of
flexibility.<BR><BR>The timescales for the Nirex project are in line with
those being pursued by some other countries (e.g. Sweden, US and Germany all
plan to have a deep repository for long-lived wastes operational by 2010). 
Inevitably there are uncertainties associated with the timescales of the
project, for example the outcome of the planning application for the RCF could
have a significant impact on the timing of the repository.  However, given the
substantial resources devoted to the Scientific Programme and the rapid progress
being made in developing understanding of the Sellafield site, 1999 remains a
sensible target for a decision on whether or not to apply to build a repository
at Sellafield.  Nevertheless, as supporting documentation for the RCF planning
application makes clear, if after the first phase of the RCF programme the
evaluation of the Sellafield site is not sufficiently confident to underpin a
decision for or against, then more time would be taken to carry out further
studies.<BR><BR>The target timescale itself provides 4 or 5 years for data
acquisition, interpretations and dialogue with the scientific community before
even a Town and Country Planning Act application would be submitted in respect
of a repository.  There would then be a further 10 years before the safety
regulators approved the Final Safety Case.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">2.</TD>
<TD>The Report suggests that consideration should be given to conducting R &amp;
D at Sellafield in two phases, the first relating to short-lived waste leading
to the establishment of a safety case for those wastes and the construction of a
deep repository for them.  A possible outcome would then be construction of a
deep repository for short-lived wastes in a location which might subsequently
prove unsuitable for long-lives wastes.  In fact, it would make no economic
sense to proceed at all at Sellafield unless there is good confidence that the
site is adequate for disposal of long-lived wastes as well as short-lived ILW. 
(A separate facility for the latter would in fact be more economically provided
in the shape of a surface or near-surface facility as at Forsmark in Sweden,
Olkiluoto in Finland and Centre de l'Aube in France.  Indeed the Royal Society
itself, in its separate response to the Waste Management Review, has suggested
that consideration should be given in the UK to a <U>surface</U> disposal
facility for short-lived intermediate level wastes.)<BR><BR>The Report also
suggests that, if adequate confidence in post-closure safety for longer lived
wastes were to prove difficult to achieve for the potential repository zone as
currently defined at Sellafield, then consideration should be given to the
volcanic rocks further west.  While Nirex would not at this stage finally rule
out such a location, the current PRZ has been arrived at by a careful process of
analysis and elimination.  This process has included the examination of the
technical feasibility of a repository located in the rocks suggested by the
Study Group.  These studies identified significant practical difficulties in the
construction of such a repository and pointed to important construction and
operational safety issues.  These are linked to high rock pressures and ambient
temperatures at the great depths involved.  Such issues have to be given full
weight alongside the geology and hydrogeology in selecting the zone for detailed
investigations.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">3.</TD>
<TD>In the context of openness and peer review, the Report recognises the peer
review of Nirex research (which includes site-specific as well as generic
information) which is achieved through publication and international
co-operation.  The Report also recognises the willingness of Nirex to seek
external inputs to development of its scientific strategy, as evidenced by
initiation of the Royal Society Study itself and through the setting up of the
Geological Review Panel.  In line with other responsible organisations involved
in research and development, the Company's approach is to publish information
when it has been developed to a level of confidence appropriate for public
review.  In order to facilitate the Study Group's work, information was &quot;fast-tracked&quot;
in the form of commercial-in-confidence preliminary reports subsequently being
brought up to publication standard.<BR><BR>Nirex has published many volumes of
information on its research database and on site-specific information. 
Inevitably, confidence in risk calculations which depends on the performance of
all elements of the system and their interactions, tends to follow behind the
development of understanding of the performance of individual elements of the
system.  Nevertheless, Nirex has already published illustrative risk
calculations for the Sellafield site in Report 525 and, early in 1995,
preliminary results will be available from further safety assessment work,
giving a view of Sellafield's post-closure safety performance together with the
underpinning hydrogeological interpretation.  Such interim calculations are, as
the Study Group Report suggests, used in setting priorities for the ongoing
Scientific Programme and in the refinement of repository design.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">4.</TD>
<TD>As previously indicated to the Study Group, the development of scenarios is
an important element of Nirex's development of safety assessment methodology. 
The scenarios will address the consequences of climate changes, the importance
of which is recognised in the Study Group's Report.  The Company's strategy is
that the development of such scenarios should be based on a sound understanding
of current site conditions and should be informed by an adequate database
developed from site characterisation activities.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">5.</TD>
<TD>The development of understanding of groundwater movements in fractured rock
is a central element of Nirex's work to describe transport of radioactivity in
the geosphere.  The Company has made substantial progress both in modelling
groundwater movements and in establishing a high quality database.  This
database includes substantial information on the geochemistry which is
recognised as an important record of the history of the site and is important in
constraining and validating models of present and future groundwater behaviour. 
It is recognised that more needs to be done in this area and that the Rock
Characterisation Facility has a crucial role to play.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">6.</TD>
<TD>The Company notes the Study Group's conclusion that the RCF will provide a
valuable base for site-specific studies.  It is intended that scientific studies
will be carried out in the RCF for a period of around ten years, possibly
longer.  The first phase of the RCF, the sinking of the shafts, with a planned
duration of nearly four years, will provide an important opportunity for
validation of key models which underpin the safety assessment.  This should lead
to a significant increase in confidence in evaluation of the suitability of the
site, as previously recognised in published advice provided by the consultants
Intera to HMIP in 1990.<BR><BR>It may be that confidence is sufficient at the
end of Phase 1 of the RCF to underpin a decision on a planning application for a
repository.  In that case, the later phases of the RCF would inform the final
safety case which is required to seek permission to accept wastes into a
repository.  However, as clearly recognised in Nirex's planning application for
the RCF, it could be that significant further work beyond Phase 1 in the RCF
will be required before sufficient confidence is achieved to decide on the
repository planning application.  This approach to planning the RCF programme is
in line with our overall approach to planning the Nirex programme as described
earlier.<BR><BR> With respect to international participation in the RCF, Nirex
intends to ensure that the best international experience is available to the RCF
project and discussions have already been held with the European Union about
their participation.</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of

<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)

review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)

and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]
</P>

</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

1993 following preliminary investigations at five sites. A decision to select
one site for a stage of underground investigations is planned for the year 2000,
eight years after the commencement of detailed site characterisation. An

<TD WIDTH="96">France</TD>
<TD WIDTH="480">Three potential sites are being investigated for a deep
repository. Detailed surface-based characterisation began in 1994 and, by way of
example, at one site it has comprised 15 boreholes at least 300m deep
complemented by geophysical studies. It is planned to commence construction of
rock characterisation facilities on at least two of the sites in 1996, i.e. two
years after commencement of detailed surface-based characterisation.  A decision
on whether to propose a repository at one of the sites is planned for 2006. This
decision would therefore be made some 12 years after commencement of detailed
site characterisation.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>Germany</TD>
<TD>Detailed surface-based characterisation of a salt dome at Gorleben was
carried out over a six year period between 1979 and 1985. These surface-based
investigations comprised four deep boreholes, 44 shallower boreholes and
geophysical surveys. Excavations to enable underground investigations to be
undertaken commenced in 1986, some seven years after commencement of detailed
site investigation. If suitability of the site is confirmed, it is planned to
construct a repository which could be operational by 2008.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>Spain</TD>
<TD>Choice of a site for detailed characterisation is planned for the year
2000. It is then planned that a 15 year programme, comprising surface-based
investigations followed by a rock characterisation facility, will be carried out
prior to decisions on repository construction.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>Sweden</TD>
<TD>It is planned to carry out detailed site characterisation, initially
comprising boreholes and surface-based geoscientific surveys at two sites over a
four year period commencing in 1995. An underground laboratory would then be
constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground
data collection would continue during the repository construction phase leading
to a final safety report.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>Switzerland</TD>
<TD>Detailed characterisation of two potential sites is planned to be carried
out in the period from 1994 to 2000. Subsequently, an underground laboratory is
planned for one site to provide sufficient geological data to allow an
application for a repository construction licence.

<TR>
<TD>USA</TD>
<TD>Comprehensive detailed surface-based characterisation began at Yucca
Mountain in Nevada in 1991 following its designation in 1987 by Federal statute
as the candidate repository site. Construction of an underground laboratory
commenced in 1993. It is planned that this will lead to a decision on an
application for a licence in 2001 and, if this is approved, repository
construction would start in 2004, 13 years after the commencement of detailed
site characterisation.

<P> <B>DR ROBERT CHAPLOW will say:</B></P>
<P><B>1.   <A NAME="PERSONAL">PERSONAL DETAILS</A></B></P>
<P>1.1   I have been the Manager for Site Characterisation in the Science
Department of United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex') since June 1993.  I am
responsible for acquiring and interpreting site specific data in the Sellafield
area in order to understand and describe the geology and hydrogeology as an
input to the assessment of the suitability of the site for development of a deep
repository for radioactive waste disposal.</P>
<P>1.2   I hold a first class honours degree in Geology of the University of
London and am an Associate of the Royal School of Mines, London.  Following post
graduate research I was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree by London
University and a Diploma of Membership of the Imperial College.  I am a Fellow
of the Geological Society of London and a Chartered Geologist.  I was a Lecturer
in Engineering Geology at Imperial College (1971-75) and external examiner for
the MSc course in Engineering Geology at Leeds University (1989-92).  I have
been a member of the Programme Board of the British Geological Survey (1988-93),
a member of the Universities Funding Council Research Assessment Review Panel
for Earth Sciences and Environmental Studies (1992), a member of the Natural
Environment Research Council's Earth Science Committee (1993-94) and of their
Earth Science and Technology Board (1994 to date).  I was appointed by the
Minister for the Environment and Countryside as a Member of Council of the
Nature Conservancy Council for England (English Nature) and served in this
position from 1991-95.  I am the author of 17 technical papers on aspects of
geology and hydrogeology and have presented papers at technical conferences and
seminars in UK, India, Thailand and the United States.</P>
<P>1.3   From 1975 until I joined Nirex in 1993 I was employed by Sir Alexander
Gibb &amp; Partners, initially as Chief Engineering Geologist.  I was appointed
as an Associate of the company in 1985 and a Director in 1989.  I have been
responsible for providing geological and hydrogeological inputs to the
investigation, design and construction of over 50 major engineering projects
located in more than 30 countries world-wide.  These projects have included
tunnels, major underground openings and dams.  I was Project Manager for the
work undertaken by Gibb for Nirex for the characterisation of the site at
Fulbeck as a potential site for shallow disposal of radioactive waste, and was
Project Director for the work undertaken to investigate the sites at Dounreay
and Sellafield.  On behalf of Nirex I managed the first phase of geological and
hydrogeological interpretation of the geological and hydrogeological data from
Dounreay and Sellafield in 1991/92 which led to the issues of Nirex Reports 263
to 272 on Sellafield in 1992 and to the preparation of the reports on Dounreay
which were subsequently issued as Nirex Reports 653, and 657 to 661.</P>
<P><B>2.   <A NAME="SUMMARY">SUMMARY</A></B></P>
<P><B>Scope of the Evidence</B></P>
<P>2.1   My evidence summarises and interprets the results available so far
from studies and surveys of the geology and hydrogeology of the Sellafield site.</P>
<P>2.2   Reference is made to two reports, published by Nirex, that summarise
the results.  These are <I>Nirex Report 524</I> [COR/517] published in 1993,
and <I>Nirex Report SA/95/002</I> [COR/518], published in 1995.  Information is
given on sources of unpublished data which are available for reference.</P>
<P>2.3   My evidence describes:</P>

<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL></TD></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>2.4   Separate sections  present, for each of these three areas of
uncertainty, the current understanding and the remaining uncertainties which
need to be resolved.  Those issues that cannot be resolved from the surface and
must be addressed from underground in the RCF are highlighted. </P>
<P><B>Investigations So Far</B></P>
<P>2.5   Nirex has carried out an extensive and systematic investigation of the
geology and hydrogeology of the Sellafield site using a range of surface-based
techniques.  A wide range of technical specialists has conducted the work and
care has been taken to avoid undue reliance on any single technique in the
interpretation of ground conditions.</P>
<P>2.6   The investigations have been carried out primarily within an area some
60 km by 65 km, centred on Sellafield and have comprised:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD>drilling at twenty two sites with a total of 25,712 metres of drilling. 
The deepest borehole is 1,950 metres deep.  Most of the drilling has been
carried out to obtain continuous core of the rock penetrated;</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>ii.</TD>
<TD> hydrogeological testing, groundwater sampling, geophysical surveys and the
installation of instruments to monitor groundwater conditions in the boreholes;
and</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>iii.</TD>
<TD>geological mapping, hydrogeological and geophysical surveys and earthquake
monitoring, all carried out from the surface.</TD></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>2.7   Carrying out investigation and construction activities at the site
perturbs the groundwater pressures and can perturb the geochemical
characteristics of the groundwater. The results so far show that baseline
hydrogeological conditions have been established.</P>
<P><B>Geological Structure</B></P>
<P>2.8   The geological structure of the site has been defined by the
investigations carried out.  Detailed maps and sections showing the distribution
of the main geological units and the faults that cut them have been published (<I>Nirex
Report 524</I> [COR/517] <I>and Nirex Report SA/95/002</I> [COR/518]).</P>
<P>2.9   The Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks ('BVG'), the potential
repository host rocks, crops out (is at the surface) in the east of the Site
area.  Towards the west, the BVG is overlain by a sequence of cover rocks. 
These comprise Triassic sandstones (Ormskirk Sandstone, Calder Sandstone and St.
Bees Sandstone) and a group of Permian rocks designated the 'Cumbrian Coast
Group'.</P>
<P>2.10   The rocks are cut by a series of faults that displace the rock units.
 In the onshore area, these faults generally trend in a north-west to south-east
direction.  Other fault directions do occur, the most notable of which are the
east-north-east to west-south-west trend shown by the faults in the Seascale
Fault Zone.</P>
<P>2.11   The geological structure of the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') has
been defined in greater detail than the surrounding area as a result of the
greater concentration of investigations carried out in the area.  The BVG has
been sub-divided into a series of formations and members having distinct
geological and hydrogeological characteristics.  Further investigations are in
progress, most notably the interpretation of a 3-D seismic reflection survey,
that will further assist in extending this detailed interpretation across the
wider PRZ.</P>
<P><B>Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport</B></P>
<P>2.12   The main way in which radionuclides can be transported away from a
repository is by flow of groundwater.  The groundwater flow through the rocks is
thus an important factor in determining the performance of a repository in terms
of its ability to limit releases of radioactivity. </P>
<P>2.13   With reference to an extensive range of hydrogeological and
geochemical data, it is shown that groundwater flow in and through the BVG is
low.  This conclusion is based on the following observations:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER" ALIGN="LEFT">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD>the hydraulic conductivity of the BVG is low;</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>ii.</TD>
<TD>groundwater flow through the BVG is through fractures in the rock;</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>iii.</TD>
<TD>groundwater flow in and through the BVG is controlled by the flowing
fractures, which comprise around 0.5% of the fractures in the BVG;</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>iv.</TD>
<TD>the network of flowing fractures was largely created some 200 million years
ago and has persisted since that time, although changes to individual flowing
fractures are likely to have occurred.  The persistence of the network indicates
a high degree of stability within the system;</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>v.</TD>
<TD>significant progress has been made in establishing the geological
characteristics of the flowing fractures thus providing confidence regarding
extrapolation of conditions through the rock mass;</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>vi.</TD>
<TD>the flowing fractures are linked to form networks of connected fractures
through which groundwater can flow.  This was deduced initially from the results
of the short-term hydrogeological testing.  Testing carried out during the last
eighteen months, particularly the Fracture Network Testing, Cross-Hole Hydraulic
Testing and the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, has indicated that these connections
may not be as extensive as had been originally inferred;</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>vii.</TD>
<TD>a provisional conclusion from the Borehole RCF3 pump test is that there
appears to be little connection between the BVG and the overlying sandstones;</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>viii.</TD>
<TD>there is little or no vertical component of environmental head gradient
from the likely level of a repository through to the base of the Brockram and,
in some parts of the PRZ, on up into the sandstones; and</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>ix.</TD>
<TD>the geochemical data, and particularly the conclusions on long residence
times, are providing independent confirmation of low groundwater flow.</TD></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>2.14   Dilution of any groundwater leaving a repository located at depth in
the BVG is provided largely by a combination of low groundwater flows in the BVG
and mixing of this water with higher flows shown to be occurring in the
overlying sandstones.</P>
<P>2.15   However, the surface-based investigations have not been able fully to
address the remaining uncertainties due to the inherent limitations of
measurements made in boreholes drilled from the surface.  Firstly, the boreholes
are only able to sample the rock over a limited volume defined by the length (or
depth) of the hole and its diameter.  Many features, such as fractures, are thus
inadequately sampled.  Secondly, the borehole testing is unable to provide
direct evidence concerning the spatial variability and length of the fractures,
or of the ways in which they form networks of connected flowing fractures. 
Limited indirect evidence is, however, provided by the various forms of
hydrogeological testing carried out in the boreholes.</P>
<P>2.16   It is the characterisation of the flowing fractures and, in
particular, the way in which these are connected so as to permit the movement of
groundwater through the BVG and into overlying strata, that constitutes the
principal area of remaining uncertainty.</P>
<P><B>Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier</B></P>
<P>2.17   It is important to be able to demonstrate that future change, which
may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not create new
pathways that would result in unacceptable groundwater flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair their
ability to retain radioactivity.</P>
<P>2.18   Studies related to natural and induced changes to the geological
barrier have concluded that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER" ALIGN="LEFT">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD>the Sellafield Region area, like most basement areas, owes its origins to a
long geological history.  At Sellafield this history can be traced back some 460
million years.  The geological structure has been defined by the investigations;</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>ii.</TD>
<TD>dating of fault rocks and studies of fracture mineralisation support the
view that the last major episode of faulting occurred over 100 million years ago
and that the flowing fractures are part of a system of fractures that has
probably persisted in the rocks for around 200 million years;</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>iii.</TD>
<TD>no evidence has been found of tectonic faults having involved both bedrock
and the Quaternary deposits nor has any evidence been found to indicate that
there has been extensive flushing of the water from depth within the BVG during
the last glaciation;</TD></TR>

<P><B>Conclusions</B></P>
<P>2.21   Nirex has carried out an extensive and systematic investigation of
the geology and hydrogeology of the Sellafield site using a wide range of
techniques and technical specialists.  So far the investigations have been
carried out entirely from the surface.</P>
<P>2.22   Studies of the geology of the area have confirmed that the geological
sequence and structure are essentially as was expected when the decision was
taken in 1989 to investigate the site.  The investigations have, however, added
substantial detail to the understanding of the geology.</P>
<P>2.23   Recognising that the main way in which radionuclides can be
transported away from a repository is by flow of groundwater, considerable
effort has been directed towards understanding the hydrogeology of the site.  In
my opinion, the studies have confirmed that the site has the two main
characteristics favourable for locating a repository.  Firstly, there are low
groundwater flows in the BVG which would host the repository and, secondly,
there would be substantial subsequent dilution of any solutes in that water as
it joins the active groundwater system in the overlying sandstones.</P>
<P>2.24   These favourable characteristics of the site are being indicated by a
range of independent observations.  Thus, the likely low groundwater flows are
being indicated by measurements of low hydraulic conductivity in the BVG, by
observations that flow is through a small sub-set of fractures, and by
observations of groundwater chemistry that indicate residence times for water
and solutes in the BVG of possibly up to 1.5 million years. </P>
<P>2.25   A provisional conclusion from the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test is that
there appears to be little connection between the BVG and the overlying
sandstones.</P>
<P>2.26   The groundwater system at the site is increasingly well understood
and capable of being described using simple mathematical models supported by a
number of independent datasets.  Good progress is being made in matching the
predictions from these models with independent field measurements.</P>
<P>2.27   However, the surface-based investigations are not able fully to
address the remaining uncertainties due to the inherent limitations of
measurements made in deep boreholes drilled from the surface.  Firstly, the
boreholes are only able to sample the rock over a limited volume defined by the
length (or depth) of the hole and its diameter.  Many features, such as
fractures, are thus inadequately sampled.  Secondly, the borehole testing is
unable to provide direct evidence concerning the spatial variability and length
of the fractures and of the ways they form the networks of connected fractures
that control groundwater flow.</P>
<P>2.28   It is the characterisation of the flow zones and, in particular, the
way in which these form networks of connected fractures so as to permit the
movement of groundwater through the BVG and into overlying strata, that
constitutes the principal area of remaining uncertainty.</P>
<P>2.29   Uncertainties also exist regarding the extent to which current models
reliably predict excavation disturbance and the variations in rock properties as
they impact the selection of the depth, location, layout and orientation of the
repository vaults.</P>
<P>2.30   These remaining uncertainties need to be addressed before a decision
can be made to propose a repository at the site.  They can only be addressed
through investigations in the RCF.</P>

<P>My evidence summarises and interprets the results available so far from
studies and surveys of the geology and hydrogeology of the Sellafield site.</P>
<P><B>Documentation</B></P>
<P>3.2   The results of the investigations so far carried out at Sellafield are
contained in reports and appendices comprising over 1600 individual volumes. 
The document structure is summarised in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Table3.1">Table
3.1</A>.  This shows the various categories of reports which contain the
results.  In order to assist with the progress of the Inquiry, these reports
have been subdivided into two categories.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para3.3"></A>3.3   First there are the two reports that summarise
the results of the investigations and form a part of this evidence.  These are
Core Inquiry Documents and comprise <I>The Geology and Hydrogeology of the
Sellafield Area:  Interim Assessment:  December 1993 (&quot;Nirex Report 524&quot;)</I>

Investigations:  Factual Report - Compilation of Maps and Drawings (&quot;Nirex

that have arisen from the investigations and, in response to the Secretary of
State's statement under Rule 6(10) of the Town and Country Planning (Inquiries
Procedure) Rules 1992, addresses his wish to be informed about the results
available so far from studies and surveys of the geology and hydrogeology of the
site.  The report also lists the detailed factual and interpretation reports
published by Nirex.  I refer to over 35 key drawings in my evidence; the other
drawings lie there for information.  A copy of <I>Nirex Report SA/95/002</I>
[COR/518] was sent to Cumbria County Council on 6 July 1995.  It comprises 180

<P>3.4   Second are Nirex Reports which are referenced to provide details of
where the detailed data can be found if anyone should wish to consult it.  They
comprise mainly factual reports which have not been published, but are available
at the Nirex offices in Cumbria for reference on request to Nirex.  It is only
because of the number of the factual reports (around 1600 volumes) that they
have not been made widely available.  This second category of documents is
referenced with curved brackets, for example {107} and {S/95/008}, the number
referring to the Nirex Report Number.  The data contained in these reports is
summarised in the documents included in the first category identified in
<A HREF="#Para3.3">Paragraph 3.3</A>.</P>
<P><B>Structure of Evidence</B></P>
<P>3.5   Section 4 of my evidence describes the investigations carried out so
far at Sellafield into the geology and hydrogeology of the site.  Reference is
made to two appendices which provide more detail on the scope of the
investigations and on the establishment of baseline hydrogeological conditions.</P>
<P>3.6   Section 5 provides a general introduction to the geology of the
Sellafield site and establishes the framework within which I will then describe
the main conclusions which arise from the investigations.</P>
<P>3.7   Sections 6 to 8 summarise our understanding of the characteristics of
the site in relation to the three key areas of uncertainty to be addressed by
the RCF:</P>

<P>3.8   In each of sections 6 to 8 the current understanding is described and
explained and the remaining uncertainties which need to be resolved, are
identified.  An explanation is given of which of these can and are being
addressed by further surface-based investigations.  Finally those issues are
identified which, because of the inherent limitations of surface-based
investigation techniques, can only be addressed in the RCF.</P>
<P>3.9   In Section 9, I present my conclusions.  The significant geological
and hydrogeological characteristics interpreted from the results so far of the
investigations are summarised.  The remaining uncertainties that need to be
addressed and that can only be addressed by investigations in the RCF are
highlighted.</P>
<P><B>Definitions</B></P>
<P>3.10   One of the main threads which extends through my evidence is the
concept of 'flow zones'. Using Full Sector Tests (<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA7">Table
A.7</A>, Appendix 1) in boreholes, zones in the rock are identified through
which water can be induced to flow.  These zones are called 'flow zones'.  Using
data from the boreholes and from analysis of the rock cores, these flow zones
are characterised.  In some cases the flow is found to occur along one or more
fractures in the rock.  These fractures are termed 'flowing fractures'.  In
other cases, particularly in the Brockram and sandstones, flow cannot be
assigned to particular fractures since it may, for example, be occurring
partially or completely through the rock matrix.  In these cases the flow zone
is referred to as a 'flowing feature' {S/95/006}.</P>
<P>3.11   The individual flowing fractures combine together to form 'networks
of connected fractures' through which groundwater flow occurs.  Although we can
observe and characterise individual flowing fractures, we need to develop
conceptual models to describe the networks of connected fractures because we
cannot directly observe or characterise them using boreholes drilled from the
surface.  We can, however, infer certain characteristics of the networks from
observations made in the boreholes.  These matters are described in Section 6 of
my evidence.</P>
<P>3.12   The Sellafield site (the 'site') refers to the area that has been
investigated.  The site has been subdivided into four areas within which
different studies have been carried out (<A HREF="#Para4.2">Paragraphs 4.2</A>
- 4.6).</P>
<P>3.13   As far as possible, technical terms used in my evidence are explained
as they arise.  However, recognising the breadth of my evidence, it is
inevitable that terms may be used which are unfamiliar to the reader.  A full
glossary of technical terms has been compiled to which reference should be made
for the definition of all such technical terms (<I>Glossary</I> <I>of
scientific terms</I> [COR/519]).</P>
<P><B>4.   <A NAME="INVESTIGATIONS">INVESTIGATIONS SO FAR</A></B></P>
<P>4.1   Nirex has adopted a systematic approach to the design  and
implementation of its investigations of the site.  The process of investigating
the geology and hydrogeology of the area is given the name of 'site
characterisation'.  A wide range of technical specialists and techniques has
been used in the conduct of the work.  Care has been taken to avoid undue
reliance on any single technique in the investigation and interpretation of the
ground conditions.</P>
<P><B>Geographical Location of Investigations</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.2"></A>4.2   The studies carried out in West Cumbria have
been contained primarily within four areas designated as the 'Region',
'District', and 'Site' areas (<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure4.1">Figures 4.1</A>
and <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure4.2">4.2</A>) and the Potential Repository Zone
('PRZ') area (<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure4.3">Figure 4.3</A>).</P>
<P>4.3   The Region is an area onshore and offshore of approximately 60 km by
65 km for which information has been gathered on geological features which might
have relevance to a repository safety assessment.  Existing published sources of
information and commercial offshore seismic survey data have been used. 
Additional data, including structural geological data relevant to seismicity
studies and geological data to place the Sellafield site into its broader
geological framework, have been collected from wider areas extending for
distances of over 100 km from Sellafield.</P>
<P>4.4   The District is an area of approximately 20 km by 30 km within which
geological features may have direct relevance to a repository.  Within this area
Nirex has commissioned new geological, geophysical and hydrogeological
investigations.  These investigations have been supplemented by study of data
from past mining activities and other sources of information.</P>
<P>4.5   The Site area immediately around the PRZ covers approximately 5000
hectares.  All the Nirex Deep Boreholes ('Boreholes') are located in this area (<A
HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure4.2">Figure 4.2</A>).</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6   Since 1992 the characterisation activities have
increasingly concentrated on the PRZ, leading to a greater level of detailed
understanding of this particular area (<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure4.3">Figure
4.3</A>).</P>
<P><B>Scope of the Investigations</B></P>

<P>4.9   Carrying out investigation and construction activities at the site
perturbs the groundwater pressures and can perturb the geochemical
characteristics of the groundwater.  The perturbations caused by construction of
the RCF are likely to be more extensive than those caused so far by
surface-based investigations.  It is therefore important to have established
both the groundwater pressures and the geochemical conditions with an adequate
level of confidence before construction of the RCF commences.  This is the
concept of being able to define the 'baseline hydrogeological conditions'. 
Appendix 2 reviews the information obtained from the investigations so far and
shows that baseline conditions have been established in terms of groundwater
heads and geochemical conditions.</P>
<P><B>5.   <A NAME="GEOLOGICAL">GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE</A></B></P>
<P><B>Introduction</B></P>
<P>5.1   This section of my evidence provides a general introduction to the
geological structure of the Sellafield site which will form the framework within
which I will then describe the main conclusions from the investigations.</P>
<P>5.2   Reference is made to two reports (<I>Nirex Report 524</I> [COR/517]
<I>and Nirex Report SA/95/002</I> [COR/518]) which together provide a more
detailed description of the geology of the area for those who wish to obtain a
more detailed and comprehensive description.</P>
<P><B>Geological Structure of the Site</B></P>
<P>5.3   The Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks ('BVG'), the potential
repository host rock, crops out (is at the surface) in the north-east of the
Site area (see Drawing No. 10032 in<I> Nirex Report SA/95/002</I> [COR/518]). 
Towards the west, the BVG is overlain by a sequence of cover rocks.  These
comprise Triassic sandstones (Ormskirk Sandstone, Calder Sandstone and St. Bees
Sandstone) and a group of Permian rocks designated the 'Cumbrian Coast Group'
(See Drawing No. 10059 in<I> Nirex Report SA/95/002</I> [COR/518]). 
<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A> is a geological sequence in the
Sellafield Region area and <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure5.2">Figure 5.2</A> is a
geological cross-section to illustrate the geological sequence and structure of
the PRZ.</P>
<P>5.4   To the west of the Fleming Hall Fault Zone, Carboniferous rocks,
dominantly comprising limestones, occur between the Cumbrian Coast Group and the
BVG (<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure5.2">Figure 5.2</A>).  Within the PRZ the top
of the BVG is between approximately 400 metres and 600 metres below ground
surface.  At the coast the top of the BVG is some 1500 to 1600 metres below
ground level and by 10 km offshore the surface has fallen to 3000 metres below
sea level.  (Contours on this top basement surface are shown in Drawing Nos.
10051 to 10054 in<I> Nirex Report SA/95/002</I> [COR/518]).</P>
<P>5.5   This top basement surface is also shown as a three-dimensional
visualisation in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>.  This diagram
is a view from the south-west of the District area and shows the shape of the
top surface of the BVG.  The way in which the surface drops in elevation towards
the west can be seen as can the sharp changes in the slope associated with fault
displacements.  In the onshore area these faults generally trend in a north-west
to south-east direction.  Other fault directions do occur, the most notable of
which are the east-north-east to west-south-west trend shown by the faults
within the Seascale Fault Zone.</P>
<P><B>Geological Structure of the PRZ</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.6"></A>5.6   The investigations of the geology and
hydrogeology of the site have progressively been focused on the PRZ and on the
proposed position for the RCF.  </P>
<P>5.7   The general structure of the PRZ is illustrated in
<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure5.4">Figure 5.4</A>.  This is a view from the
south-east (with the overlying sandstones removed) showing the Brockram (part of
the Cumbrian Coast Group) overlying the BVG.  The main faults that have been
recognised from the seismic surveys are also shown.</P>
<P>5.8   To the west (left hand side of <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure5.4">Figure
5.4</A>) of the RCF the Fleming Hall Fault is shown and to the west of this, the
Carboniferous Limestone (shown in blue) occurs between the Brockram and the BVG.
 In this area the eastern limit of the Carboniferous strata is marked by the
Fleming Hall Fault.  Further to the north this eastern limit trends in a
north-easterly direction away from the fault (See Drawing No. 10054 in<I> Nirex
Report SA/95/002</I> [COR/518]).</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.9"></A>5.9   Three reports on the results of investigations
in this area have been published by Nirex in 1995 dealing with the geological
structure of the PRZ, the flow zone characterisation of the RCF area, and the
geology and hydrogeology of the RCF South Shaft location {Nirex Report Nos.
S/95/005 to 007}.  This sub-section of my evidence summarises the main
conclusions of these reports.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.10"></A>5.10   The progress reported in <I>Nirex Report
525, Scientific Update 1993, December 1993 (&quot;Nirex Report 525&quot;)</I>
related to the subdivision of the BVG has been continued.  <I>Nirex Report 525</I>
(paragraph 3.3, page 16) [COR/505] stated:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Prior to the commencement of the Nirex studies, BVG in the local
area was classified as a thick sequence of undifferentiated volcanic tuffs
(consolidated volcanic ash) and lava flows.  One of the major achievements of
work reported here has been to establish a subdivision of the rocks into several
formations which can be correlated between boreholes over distances of several
kilometres.  This subdivision has enabled the structure of the BVG to be defined
in more detail.  It is also becoming apparent that the hydrogeological
properties of the rocks are related to this same stratigraphic subdivision. &quot;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.11   An interpretation of the geological structure of the proposed RCF
South Shaft area is shown in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure5.5">Figure 5.5</A>. 
This shows the two formations recognised in this part of the BVG: the Fleming
Hall Formation and the Brown Bank Formation.  The Fleming Hall Formation has
been further subdivided into three members: the Longlands Farm Member, the Sides
Farm Member and the Town End Farm Member.</P>
<P>5.12   A general relationship has been observed between rock quality
(inferred from geophysical logs and measurements on the cores) and the
identified members and formations.  An alteration zone in the Longlands Farm
Member, the Sides Farm Member (both in the Fleming Hall Formation) and the Brown
Bank Formation have been shown to be intervals characterised by lower rock
strength and higher fracture frequency relative to the other parts of the
sequence in the RCF South Shaft area.  The distribution of these rock units is
shown in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure5.5">Figure 5.5</A>.</P>
<P>5.13   The analysis of the fractures seen in the cores of BVG obtained from
the Boreholes is indicating that the orientation characteristics of the
fractures vary markedly with depth.  Structural domains have been defined in
which the fractures have similar characteristics {S/95/007}.  The boundaries
between these domains, in the majority of cases, are either lithological
boundaries or faults.</P>
<P>5.14   Some progress has been made in extrapolating the detailed geological
structure established in the RCF South Shaft area out into the PRZ.  The
geological cross-sections and serial section at the 650 metres below Ordnance
Datum ('bOD') level (Drawing Nos., 10061, 10062 and 10067 in<I> Nirex Report
SA/95/002</I> [COR/518]) demonstrate the progress being made in the
extrapolation.  The results of the 3-D seismic reflection trial survey will
further assist in extending this extrapolation across the wider PRZ area.</P>
<P><B>6.   <A NAME="GROUNDWATER">GROUNDWATER FLOW AND RADIONUCLIDE TRANSPORT</A></B></P>
<P><B>INTRODUCTION</B></P>
<P>6.1   The main way in which radionuclides can be transported away from a
repository is by flow of groundwater.  The groundwater flow through the rocks is
thus an important factor in determining the performance of a repository in terms
of its ability to limit releases of radioactivity.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.2"></A>6.2   The Nirex repository concept requires that the
geological barrier must perform two key functions.  Firstly it must ensure that
there are low flows of groundwater through the repository so that the physical
and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radioactivity.  Secondly, the geological barrier must ensure that there is
sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides released from the vaults in
order to limit concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface.</P>
<P>6.3   This section of my evidence examines the information and understanding
of groundwater flow at the site that has emerged from the investigations carried
out so far.  It presents the information that shows the groundwater flows
through the BVG are low.  It then presents the information to indicate that the

<P><B>I     GROUNDWATER FLOWS</B></P>
<P>6.6   Old hard rocks, such as the BVG, contain natural fractures that have
developed in response to the long history of formation, burial and the tectonic
processes to which they have been subjected.  The rock between the fractures has
a very low hydraulic conductivity (i.e. a low ability to permit water to flow
through it) and water will tend, therefore, to flow through fractures.  In order
for the fractures themselves to be able to transmit water for any distance
through the rock they must be both open and connected together.  Thus, the
existence of fractures in the rock is not, in itself, evidence that the rock
mass (intact rock plus fractures) is able to transmit water. Not all fractures
are identical and some are better able to transmit water than others: such
fractures are the flowing fractures.</P>
<P>6.7   That the BVG contains fractures can easily be seen from a cursory
examination of the rocks exposed at the surface and from examination of the
cores from the boreholes.  The first aspect of the consideration of groundwater
flow through the BVG is thus to establish the extent to which fractures have a
dominant influence on controlling groundwater flow through the rocks.  The
second is to identify which of these fractures are important as possible
pathways for groundwater flow.</P>
<P><B>Influence of Fractures on Groundwater Flow</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.8"></A>6.8   In order to establish the extent to which the
fractures in the rock have an important influence on the ability of the BVG to
transmit water, tests are carried out on blocks of rock with and without
fractures and the hydraulic conductivity of the two sets of results compared. 
If the fractures are dominating the ability of the rock to transmit water we
should expect to see that the tests on samples containing fractures yield higher
values of hydraulic conductivity than corresponding tests on samples without
fractures.  The simplest way of doing this is to test small core samples of rock
in the laboratory (because these can be seen not to contain fractures) and then
to carry out tests over lengths of many metres in boreholes having first
demonstrated from an examination of the borehole cores that such test lengths
contain fractures.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9   The way in which this was done is shown in <I>Nirex
Report 525</I>, (Figure 10, page 17) [COR/505] which shows the values of
hydraulic conductivity measured in 50 metre long sections in the Boreholes and
on small core samples in the laboratory.  The results for the BVG are summarised
in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.1">Figure 6.1</A>(a).  The field values (shown
in green) can be seen to have hydraulic conductivity values about 2 orders of
magnitude greater than the values (shown in red) obtained on small core samples
in the laboratory. The difference between these two sets of data thus indicates
the importance of fractures in determining the overall hydraulic conductivity of
the BVG.</P>
<P>6.10   Having established that the hydraulic conductivity of the BVG is
controlled by fractures, the next aspect of the investigations was to determine
whether all the fractures behave in a similar manner or whether there is a
sub-set of fractures which have the dominant influence on controlling
groundwater flow.</P>
<P>6.11   Full Sector Tests (as described in <A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA7">Table
A.7</A>, Appendix 1) are carried out in the Boreholes to identify those sections
of the borehole wall through which groundwater can be induced to flow.  This was
reported in <I>Nirex Report 525</I> [COR/505] (page 19) which described the
observation that groundwater flow in the BVG, and, to some extent in other
formations, occurred through a small subset of fractures.  It was thus shown
that the dominant influence on groundwater flow through the BVG was not the
complete set of fractures but rather this small subset of fractures.  The zones
in the boreholes through which groundwater flow can be induced are called 'flow
zones'.  Using data from the boreholes and from analysis of the rock cores,
these flow zones have been characterised.  In some cases the flow is found to
occur along one or more fractures in the rock.  These fractures are termed
'flowing fractures'.  In other cases, particularly in the Brockram and
sandstones, flow cannot be assigned to particular fractures since it may, for
example, be occurring partially or completely through the rock matrix.  In these
cases the flow zone is referred to as a 'flowing feature' {S/95/006}.</P>
<P>6.12   The importance of these flow zones in controlling the hydraulic
conductivity of the BVG can be seen from the analysis of the borehole tests
described in <A HREF="#Para6.9">Paragraph 6.9</A> above.  This was done by
comparing the hydraulic conductivity values in those sections of the boreholes
which had been shown to contain flow zones with those from sections without
identified flow zones. 
<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.1">Figure 6.1</A> (b) shows these results.  For
those sections containing flow zones (shown in green) the median value was
between 10<SUP>-8</SUP> and 10<SUP>-9</SUP> metres/second and, for those
sections without the flow zones (shown in red), the median value was between 10<SUP>-10</SUP>
and 10<SUP>-11</SUP> metres/second.  The difference in the median values of
over two orders of magnitude of hydraulic conductivity clearly shows the marked
influence of the presence of flow zones on groundwater flow in the BVG.</P>
<P>6.13   It is relevant to note that the measured values of hydraulic
conductivity reported above are similar to those predicted in 1989 in <I>PERA
</I>(Table 8.2) [COR/501] ).  Thus, the results obtained from the testing were
generally as expected.</P>
<P>6.14   The testing described above demonstrated the importance of the flow
zones and showed that the hydraulic conductivity values in the BVG in sections
of boreholes without such zones were lower than those obtained from sections
with such features.  An outstanding issue was, however, to determine what, if
any, influence the other fractures in the BVG (i.e. not flowing fractures) had
on the hydraulic conductivity of the BVG as a whole.  This was examined by
investigations carried out during 1994 to measure the hydraulic conductivity of
the rock mass remote from (as well as close to and across) the identified
flowing fractures.  This was the Short Interval Hydraulic Testing (see
<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA8">Table A.8</A> in Appendix 1).  By making measurements
over short lengths of borehole (1 to 2 metres long) flow zones are measured
separately and the hydraulic conductivity of the rock mass containing the other
fractures can be determined.  The results of this testing, which took place in
the BVG in Borehole RCF3, are shown in
<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.2">Figure 6.2</A>.  The flow zones (shown as blue
arrows) were identified from Full Sector Tests carried out prior to the Short
Interval Hydraulic Testing.  The Short Interval Hydraulic Testing indicated the
presence of two main clusters (labelled 1 and 2) and a third smaller cluster
(labelled 3) of higher values, but still with hydraulic conductivity values of
less than 1 x 10<SUP>-8</SUP> metres/second.  Unsurprisingly, these clusters
appear to be associated with the previously identified flow zones.  More
importantly, higher values from the Short Interval Hydraulic Testing are not
found between the identified flow zones.  In these sections of the borehole, the
tests gave hydraulic conductivity values of less than 1 x 10<SUP>-11</SUP>
metres/second.  The distribution of these values appears very similar to the
values obtained from the laboratory tests on core samples of unfractured BVG. 
This shows that the background fractures have little influence on the overall
hydraulic conductivity of the BVG.</P>
<P>6.15   The testing has thus indicated some important features of the BVG:</P>

<P><A NAME="Para6.16"></A>6.16   The results of the hydrogeological testing
described above have indicated that the BVG has a low hydraulic conductivity. 
However, because of the influence of the flowing fractures in controlling
groundwater flow and the importance of taking due regard of the ways in which
these hydrogeologically significant features form networks of connected
fractures, it is not justifiable to take measurements of hydraulic conductivity
from small scale tests in the laboratory or in the boreholes and to apply these
directly to groundwater flow models which represent the large scale system.  The
process of deriving large scale hydrogeological parameters (effective
parameters) from the testing for use in the modelling is described in <I>Nirex
95</I> [COR/522].</P>
<P><B>Characterisation of Flow Zones</B></P>
<P>6.17   Having shown the importance of the flow zones in controlling the
hydraulic conductivity of the BVG, the next important issue is to characterise
them so that they can be appropriately incorporated into groundwater flow models
of the site.  This aspect of flow zone characterisation is considered in this
sub-section of the evidence.</P>
<P>6.18   In 1993 when<I> Nirex Report 525</I> [COR/505] was published, there
was little information on the origin or nature of these flow zones, other than
that they could be identified, by testing, where they intersected a borehole. 
The Royal Society Study Group shared the Nirex view that characterisation of the
flow zones was important as the basis for defining the organisation of
groundwater pathways within the BVG.  They stated in their report <I>(The Royal
Society, Disposal of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories, November 1994 (&quot;The
Royal Society, November 1994&quot;)</I> [COR/605]  (Section 6.8, page 110):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;However, an important unresolved issue has been encountered: the
most detailed geological and hydrogeological data yet available have failed to
yield a simple relationship between the inferred pattern of fracturing in the
repository host rock, the Borrowdale Volcanics, and the organisation of
groundwater pathways.&quot;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.19   The studies so far undertaken by Nirex have characterised the flow
zones in nine boreholes within the PRZ, namely Boreholes 2, 4, 5, RCF1, RCF2,
RCF3, RCM1, RCM2 and RCM3 {S/95/006}.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.20"></A>6.20   Analysis of the flow zones in the RCF area
(defined as the area of Boreholes RCF3, RCM1 and RCM2) has indicated an
association between the occurrence of flow zones and the geological succession
of the BVG.  An interval in the Longlands Farm Member between 580 metres and 630
metres bOD was identified as containing flow zones in all three boreholes.  The
top of the Longlands Farm Member from the base of the Brockram to 500 metres bOD
and the Sides Farm Member at 670 metres bOD also showed some tendency to contain
flow zones.  The Town End Farm Member is notable in the RCF South Shaft area as
being largely unfaulted, comprising high quality rock and being almost devoid of
identified flow zones.</P>
<P>6.21   Characterisation of the flow zones in the RCF South Shaft area has
also indicated an apparent linear decrease in flow zone hydraulic conductivity
with depth {S/95/006}.</P>
<P>6.22   In total, only 154 flow zones have been identified in the boreholes
which together amounted to over 8,000 metres of drilling.  This is about 0.5% of
the total number of fractures encountered in the boreholes.  Fifty percent of
the flow zones occur in the sandstone, 8% in the Brockram and the remaining 42%
in the BVG.  Thus, only 64 flow zones have been identified in the BVG in the
area studied.</P>
<P>6.23   The analysis of these flow zones {S/95/006} has been carried out to
identify specific features responsible for the inflow of water and to
investigate the mineralogical and petrological character of these and adjacent
features seen in the borehole cores.  In particular, the mineralisation,
distribution, orientation and character of the features have been examined.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.24"></A>6.24   The minerals and fluid inclusions which occur
in the fractures provide information which can be used to interpret the time
when the fractures were created and their history in terms of further periods of
movement which may have occurred since their formation.  Stable isotope
signatures and fluid inclusion characteristics of the fracture minerals provide
an insight into the chemistry of the mineralising fluids and the conditions
under which mineralisation occurred {520} {SA/95/001}.  The investigations of
fracture mineralisation commenced with a general review of the history of
mineralisation and the establishment of a series of mineralisation episodes
which have affected the rocks at different times in their history and have
resulted in the deposition of different minerals within the fractures.  This
work was reported in 1993 {520}.  Subsequently, the studies of fracture
mineralisation have concentrated on the intervals containing flow zones
{S/95/006}.</P>
<P>6.25   These studies have enabled the establishment of a well-defined
history of fracture movement and discrete mineralisation events affecting the
site.  Nine broad but discrete mineralisation episodes (designated ME1 to ME9)
have been recognised.  These can be correlated with regional patterns of
mineralisation and diagenesis, both in the East Irish Sea Basin and in the Lake
District.  Limited potassium-argon dating of illite clay mineralisation in fault
gouge, and correlations with regional patterns of mineralisation have enabled
the periods of fracture development and mineralisation to be dated.</P>
<P>6.26   The mineralisation episodes are summarised in
<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Table6.1">Table 6.1</A>. In most cases there appears to
be no particular relationship between fracture orientation, fracture type and
mineralisation episode.  Each mineralisation episode, with the exception of ME2,
has reactivated and reutilised the pre-existing fractures and veins of earlier
episodes.  This is because the carbonate- or hematite-dominated fracture-fill is
relatively weakly bonded to adjacent wallrock and therefore the veins represent
planes of weakness, which are readily reactivated in preference to the formation
of new fractures.</P>
<P>6.27   The following conclusions have been reached from these studies of the
flow zones {S/95/006}:</P>

<TD>the flow zones in the Sherwood Sandstone Group are largely matrix flow with

<TD>in the BVG the flow zones are mostly associated with mineralised flowing

<TD>v.</TD>
<TD>there is a broad relationship between flow zones and the occurrence of ME6

to a particular mineralisation episode and, of these, 48 (67%) were assigned to

<TD>there is no obvious relationship between flow zones and faulting in the St.

and faulting is variable between individual boreholes;</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>vii.</TD>
<TD>there is a strong relationship between flow zones and the presence of ME9

<TD>the close association between flow zones, proximity to faults, ME6

groundwater flow in the BVG is related more to the larger scale distribution of
ME6 mineralisation in the rock mass, rather than the type, orientation or
intensity of individual flowing features or fractures; and</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>ix.</TD>
<TD>there is an apparent linear reduction in measured hydraulic conductivity
values in the flowing fractures with depth.</TD></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.28   Relating these various conclusions to the understanding of the
geological history of the site suggests that the majority of the flowing
fractures probably owe their origin to fracture movements which occurred around
the early to middle Triassic, some 200 million years ago when the ME6
mineralisation episode occurred.  These fractures probably remained as flowing
features during subsequent periods of fault movement and mineralisation.  The
last significant period of fault movement occurred around 100 million years ago
as indicated by the dating of clays in fault gouges.  The flowing fractures
appear to have remained hydraulically active subsequently as indicated by the
development of ME9 late calcite.  Such mineral precipitation, and associated
dissolution, is likely to have altered the specific characteristics of
individual fractures and may have caused some adjustments to the networks of
connected fractures over time.  However, the evidence so far supports the view
that the ME6 fracture network has provided the framework for the network of
connected fractures and that this framework has persisted for some 200 million
years.</P>
<P>6.29   Although the understanding of these important flowing fractures has
developed significantly over the last eighteen months, the understanding
concerning the physical character of these fractures is based solely on
observations and measurements made on small diameter core samples.  As noted in
<A HREF="#Para6.27viii">Paragraph 6.27 viii</A>. above the groundwater flow in
the BVG may be related more to the larger scale distribution of ME6
mineralisation in the rock mass rather than the type, orientation or intensity
of individual flowing fractures. It is therefore necessary to examine the larger
scale features using techniques other than observations and measurements on
small diameter core samples.  This has been done in the Boreholes by examining
results from hydraulic testing to provide indications of the ways in which the
flow zones may form networks of connected fractures over longer length scales. 
This issue of 'connectivity' is addressed in the next sub-section.</P>
<P><B>Fracture Connectivity</B></P>
<P>6.32   Showing that the flowing fractures have an important influence on the
hydraulic conductivity of the BVG is only the first step in determining
groundwater flows within and through the BVG.  The second, and perhaps more
important, step is to determine the way in which these flowing fractures are
connected.  If these fractures are well connected within the BVG and also
connected on through the overlying rock formations, there could be higher flows
through a repository and lower subsequent dilution than if the flowing fractures
are poorly connected both within the BVG and to the overlying formations.  These
issues are addressed in this sub-section of the evidence.</P>
<P>6.31   From analysis of the Environmental Pressure Measurements in the
Boreholes (<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA7">Table A.7</A>, Appendix 1) it was
suggested by Nirex that the flowing fractures were hydrogeologically linked,
possibly over hundreds of metres (<I>Nirex Report 525</I>, paragraph 4, page 22
[COR/505]).  However, at that time (in late 1993 and early 1994) when the
groundwater flow models which subsequently formed the basis for the safety
assessment studies reported in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522] were being developed,
there was no direct information on the form of these connections.  Judgments
were made concerning the manner in which the flowing fractures were connected to
form the extended networks through which flow predominantly occurs.</P>
<P>6.32   These judgments were used to inform the development of a
hydrogeological conceptual model.  In this model, the main flow channels in the
rocks were described as networks of connected fractures having length scales
ranging up to hundreds of metres.  This description implied a relatively high
vertical hydraulic conductivity for groundwater flow in the BVG and Basal St.
Bees Sandstone compared with conductivity implied by the rock matrix and
individual fractures.</P>
<P>6.33   The nature of the connections in the fracture systems has
subsequently been investigated through Fracture Network Testing, Cross-Hole
Hydraulic Testing and from the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test (see
<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA8">Table A.8</A> in Appendix 1 for further sources of
information on the nature of these tests).  Further information has been
obtained from the Regional Hydrogeological Surveys.
</P>
<P>6.34   Each of these programmes of testing represents 'State-of-the Art'
scientific activities incorporating numerical modelling to assist with the
design of the testing, precision monitoring of the test outputs and detailed
analysis of the test results.  The detailed interpretation of the testing has
not yet been completed.  Hence, the results presented in my evidence are
preliminary, but are presented in as much detail as possible to illustrate the
nature of the data being generated and the implications of these data.</P>
<P><U>Fracture Network Testing</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.35"></A>6.35   The Fracture Network Testing was carried out
in Borehole RCF3 and is described in <A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA8">Table A.8</A> in
Appendix 1.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.36"></A>6.36   The results are summarised in
<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.5">Figure 6.5</A>.  The diagram shows the layout
of the test sections in relation to the observed flow zones and identified
faults. The locations of the test sections are shown together with an indication
of where responses were observed in adjacent sections.  The responses in the
monitoring section are quantified as the drop in pressure in those sections as a
percentage of the drop in pressure in the test section as a result of pumping. 
Many of the sections of the hole which were tested yielded such a small flow
from the test section (shown as 'NF' on the diagram) that they did not produce
any measurable response in the adjacent sections.  The hydraulic conductivity
values are shown as derived from the short-term Environmental Pressure
Measurements.</P>
<P>6.37   Those sections of the borehole which did not generate responses in
other sections or within which responses were not generated by testing in other
sections are shown as Zone I.  Those sections in which responses were generated
by testing elsewhere but when tested themselves did not generate responses are
grouped as Zone II.  Those sections which generated responses elsewhere and
which responded to testing elsewhere are grouped as Zone III and shaded yellow. 
The fact that Zone III bands are narrow suggests that there are not extensive
connections along the length of the borehole.  If there were extensive
connections, widespread responses would have been observed.  There is also seen
to be a direct relationship between the Zone III sections and the presence of
flow zones in the borehole as shown in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.5">Figure
6.5</A>.  Areas of higher response are also seen to correspond to the clusters
of higher conductivity values obtained from the Short Interval Hydraulic
Testing.  These are shown in red in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.5">Figure 6.5</A>
and are derived from <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.1">Figure 6.1</A>. This
programme of testing thus demonstrates the direct influence of flow zones on the
ability to pump water from the fracture system, and hence recognises the
importance of these flow zones as potential pathways for groundwater flow.  It
also demonstrates the limited extent of connections in the fracture system along
the length of the borehole.  By its nature, this programme of Fracture Network
Testing cannot identify connections within the fracture system in lateral
directions away from the borehole.</P>
<P><U>Cross-Hole Hydraulic Testing in Boreholes 2 and 4</U></P>
<P>6.38   Cross-Hole Hydraulic Testing has been carried out between Boreholes 2
and 4 (<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA8">Table A.8</A> in Appendix 1).  The objective
of this testing was to characterise the flow zones within Borehole 2 and to
establish the connectivity of these both within the borehole (Borehole 2) and
with a neighbouring borehole (Borehole 4).  The programme of testing comprised
seven periods of pumping from individual sections of Borehole 2, each of which
contained identified flow zones, whilst monitoring zones above and below the
pumped section (as for the Fracture Network Testing) and whilst monitoring zones
in the adjacent Borehole 4 using the installed groundwater monitoring string. 
Boreholes 2 and 4 are approximately 120 metres apart.  The rock between
Boreholes 2 and 4 had previously been structurally characterised by cross-hole
seismic tomography.  Borehole 2 is approximately down-dip of Borehole 4.</P>
<P>6.39   The Cross-Hole Hydraulic Testing thus provided the opportunity to
examine the way in which flowing fractures might be connected on a larger scale
than was possible using the Fracture Network Testing.  It also provided the
opportunity to examine the possible coincidence of the flow zones with known
geological structures.  Unlike the Fracture Network Testing, the test sections
for the Cross-Hole Hydraulic Testing were only located in parts of the borehole
which contained identified flow zones.  Hence, some responses were observed in
all tests.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.40"></A>6.40   A summary of the results obtained from the
testing is shown in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.6">Figure 6.6</A>. This
figure shows the locations of five of the seven pumping sections.  (More
detailed results, including the data from the other two pumping sections omitted
from <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.6">Figure 6.6</A> for clarity, are shown as
Drawing No. 10090 in<I> Nirex Report SA/95/002</I> [COR/518]).   The figure
also shows the responses observed in Borehole 2 to the pumping of sections in
Borehole 2.  It confirms the pattern of responses seen in similar tests carried
out in Borehole RCF3 and shown in
<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.5">Figure 6.5</A>.  The figure also shows the
responses observed in Borehole 4 to the pumping in Borehole 2.  The geological
structure between the boreholes is derived from the results of the seismic
tomography survey and the position of main faults (Fault 1 and Fault 200) is
shown.  The diagram shows that responses from each pumping test in Borehole 2
were only seen in limited parts of Borehole 4 and that these responses did not
occur along the lines of the major faults known to extend between the two
boreholes.  This suggests that the flowing features, at least in this area, are
not synonymous with these larger faults.  It is also noted that the observed
responses from each test are confined to a limited vertical sequence of BVG. 
None of these tests show responses which are observed through the full sequence
of the BVG.  It should be noted that the responses observed in Borehole 4 were
extremely small.  Many were close to the limits of resolution of the monitoring
equipment and of a similar magnitude to the natural, short-term cyclic
fluctuations observed in the monitoring network dataset (See
<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#ParaB2.14">Paragraphs B.2.14</A> - B.2.15 in Appendix 2).</P>
<P><U>Borehole RCF3 Pump Test</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.41"></A>6.41   The Borehole RCF3 Pump Test is a programme of
tests carried out by pumping from sections of Borehole RCF3 covering each of the
three main geological units: the St. Bees Sandstone, the Brockram and the BVG. 
The responses of the groundwater system to the pumping are being monitored in
the groundwater pressure monitoring system (see <A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA11">Table
A.11</A> in Appendix 1).  At the time of preparing this evidence the testing was
still in progress and the results had not been interpreted in detail.  However,
preliminary results are presented to illustrate the nature and implications of
the data being generated.</P>
<P>6.42   Some of the results of the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test are shown in
<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.7">Figure 6.7</A>.  (This drawing is a
reproduction of part of Drawing No. 10092 in<I>Nirex Report SA/95/002 </I>[COR/518]
to which reference should be made for details of the locations of the various
pumping sections and gauges installed in the borehole).  It shows the
groundwater pressures measured at eleven locations (15 gauges) in Borehole RCF3
during the pump test.  The pressures (shown as calculated environmental heads)
in those sections of the borehole being pumped are shown, together with the
pressures measured in other sections of the borehole.  (Responses measured in
the other boreholes in the monitoring network are shown in Drawing Nos. 10111 to
10131 in<I> Nirex Report SA/95/002</I> [COR/518].)</P>
<P>6.43   The heads in the various sections of the borehole have baseline
values of around 80 metres above Ordnance Datum ('aOD').  During the Brockram
test (Jan-Feb 1995) the pumping was carried out in the section containing gauges
P9 and P10 (green lines in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.7">Figure 6.7</A>). 
In Borehole RCF3 pressure changes can be seen in both these gauges but not in
any of the other gauges.  Similarly, in the sandstone test (March 1995) gauges
P11 and P13 show the reduction in pressure in the pumped test section (red and
mid blue lines).  However, the other sections, including the recovering Brockram
Zone, show no response to this pumping.  On <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.7">Figure
6.7</A> the BVG test is still in the drawdown stage.  The responses in the
pumped sections (P3 and P4) look slightly different from the responses in the
pumped sections during the other two tests.  This is because the head in the BVG
is being kept constant for the duration of the test, rather than the flow rate
from the test section being kept constant as with the other tests.  (The pumped
section for the BVG test is at approximately 640 to 680 metres bOD.  It
coincides with Cluster 2 in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.2">Figure 6.2</A> and
with the lowermost Zone III section in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.5">Figure
6.5</A>.)</P>
<P>6.44   During the BVG tests small responses have been observed in two
sections immediately above (P5 and P6) the pumped section.  No other responses
were observed in Borehole RCF3.  A similar pattern of responses is observed in
other boreholes in the monitoring network (See Drawing Nos. 10111 - 10131 in<I>Nirex
Report SA/95/002</I> [COR/518]).</P>
<P>6.45   A provisional conclusion from the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test is that
there appears to be little connection between the BVG and the overlying
sandstones.</P>
<P><U>Observations from Regional Hydrogeological Studies</U></P>
<P>6.46   The groundwater at depth in the BVG is saline and warmer than the
near surface freshwater.  The temperature differential arises from the natural
geothermal gradient.  Hence, the presence of deeper groundwaters at the surface,
which could indicate the existence of connected pathways from depth through
which flow was occurring, would be indicated by the presence of saline and/or
warm waters at the surface.  (This same principle is used in the Full Sector
Tests to identify flow zones in Boreholes.)  This issue has been examined by
consideration of the variations in near-surface groundwater chemistry and
temperature.  (See Drawing Nos. 10097 - 10102 and 10206 - 10209 in<I> Nirex
Report SA/95/002</I> for the chemistry data [COR/518].)</P>
<P>6.47   There is no evidence from these regional hydrogeological studies for
the existence of direct natural connections from depth to the surface through
which deep groundwater is flowing.</P>
<P><B>Groundwater Heads and Gradients</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.48"></A>6.48   At its simplest level, groundwater will only
flow if there is a head gradient.  (There are other processes, such as
diffusion, which can produce slow movement of groundwater, but these processes
are much less significant than pressure induced flow.)  The measurement of the
heads thus forms an important part of the characterisation of the site.</P>
<P>6.49   The information on groundwater heads at the time <I>Nirex Report 525</I>
[COR/505] was published was restricted to that derived from interpretation of
short-term Environmental Pressure Measurements in which data from an 8 or 16
hour test was used to extrapolate the in situ pressure.  Referring to this, <I>Nirex
Report 524</I>, (Volume 3, Section 4.4.2, page 4-4) [COR/517] made the following
statements:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The value of in situ pressure is therefore an interpretation of a
dataset, it is not strictly a measurement or observation......During the
pressure recovery period, high conductivity intervals recover to much closer to
their in situ pressure than low conductivity intervals.  The degree of
extrapolation for high conductivity intervals is consequently much less.  In
addition, the shape of the pressure recovery plot in low conductivity sections
may be affected by pressure and temperature disturbances caused by the drilling
process.&quot;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.50   It was also noted in <I>Nirex Report 525</I> (Section 3.4, page 17)
[COR/505] that the deep groundwater was saline and that it was therefore
necessary to calculate 'environmental heads' to determine the potential for
vertical flow.  This stated:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The groundwater at depth within the BVG is saline.....Saline water
is more dense than fresh water and so, in order to assess the possible driving
force for a vertical component of flow, the measured groundwater pressure must
be converted to 'environmental' heads which take account of the influence of
varying density. &quot;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.51   The results from this monitoring network that is now established and
operational have provided data recorded continuously over many months (Drawing
Nos. 10111 to 10131 in<I> Nirex Report SA/95/002</I> [COR/518]).  These
measurements have thus allowed for the groundwater system to settle down and
recover from the effects of drilling and testing (see Appendix 2, Section B.2).</P>
<P>6.52   The current understanding of the distribution of groundwater heads at
the Site is described in the following paragraphs.</P>
<P><U>Vertical Head Profiles</U></P>
<P>6.53   In general, there is a good agreement between the pressures and heads
derived by long-term monitoring and those from Environmental Pressure
Measurements carried out during drilling.  There is some evidence, derived from
interpretation of the Environmental Pressure Measurements, particularly in
Boreholes 2 and 4, for local small scale variations in heads attributable to
borehole history and pumping activities.  It is possible that many of the minor
variations apparent in the data from the short-term hydrogeological testing
could have similar causes.  The data from the long-term monitoring provides a
means of developing confidence that the recorded pressures and calculated heads
are free from perturbations caused by drilling or testing (See Appendix 2).</P>
<P>6.54   The general features of the groundwater head profile in the RCF area
of the PRZ are illustrated in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.8">Figure 6.8</A>. 
This figure is derived from the long-term monitoring data for six boreholes.  It
shows how the environmental head varies with depth in the boreholes.  Three
distinct zones with different characteristics can be identified and are labelled
Zones 1, 2 and 3.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.55"></A>6.55   In Zone 1 an upward gradient of about 12
metres head change in 170 metres depth of borehole (i.e. about 7%) is found
above about 170 metres bOD.  This contrasts with Borehole 8 (not shown in
<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.8">Figure 6.8</A>) in which a 5% downward
gradient is apparent in the upper 150 metres of the St Bees Sandstone.  This
overall pattern suggests that the upper 150 to 200 metres of the Sherwood
Sandstone Group is an active aquifer system receiving recharge in the higher
ground (Borehole 8) and containing coastward and upward moving freshwater for
much of the area where ground level is below about 100 metres aOD.  This may
locally give rise to artesian flow in areas of depressed topography (e.g.
Holmrook 13 Borehole).</P>
<P>6.56   <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.8">Figure 6.8</A> shows that from
about 170 metres bOD to the base of the Permo-Triassic rocks, little or no
vertical gradient is apparent.  In the area covered by the Boreholes shown in
<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.8">Figure 6.8</A> this absence of vertical
gradient continues down through the upper 400 metres or so of the BVG.  In some
other Boreholes, for example Boreholes 2, 4 and 5, the top of Zone 2 is somewhat
deeper and appears to coincide with the top of the Brockram.  This pattern
suggests that, over much of the PRZ, there is little or no head gradient to
drive vertical flow in the upper portion of the BVG and that in some areas, this
pattern extends through the Brockram and up into the Sherwood Sandstone Group.</P>
<P>6.57   In Zone 3 <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.8">Figure 6.8</A> shows that
at depth within the BVG an increase in environmental head occurs.  In
<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.8">Figure 6.8</A> the boundary between Zones 2
and 3 is shown at 800 metres bOD.  The level of this boundary is not precisely
defined but it appears to lie between about 750 metres bOD and 900 metres bOD in
the area of these boreholes.</P>
<P><U>Regional Head Distributions</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.58"></A>6.58   Freshwater heads calculated from the borehole
monitoring data are used to indicate whether there is a gradient which might
give rise to components of flow in the horizontal direction.  The results
indicate a consistent pattern of head gradients towards the coast.</P>
<P>6.59   The gradient, which is regionally between 2 and 4% and locally up to
7% (in the PRZ), appears to be topographically related and is consistent
regardless of the stratigraphy.  Over areas covered by data, there appears to be
no potential for the landward ingress of groundwater at levels between 100
metres and 800 metres bOD.  Beneath this depth, data are limited but suggest
that near the coast there may be a gradient in the opposite direction, i.e.
towards the land.</P>
<P><B>Geochemistry</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.60"></A>6.60   The geochemical characteristics of the water
provide information on how the groundwater system has evolved over time,
including providing evidence of past groundwater flow directions and mixing
processes which are occurring within the system. The interpretation of
groundwater flow and mixing processes that arise from the geochemical studies
thus provide independent evidence that can be compared with the predictions of
groundwater flow derived from consideration of the physical charateristics of
hydraulic conductivity and head.</P>
<P>6.61   The scope of the geochemical studies in terms of the range of
analyses carried out has been described in <A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#ParaA8.1">Paragraphs
A.8.1</A> to A.8.4 and in Table A.9 in Appendix 1.  The manner in which chemical
tracers are used to correct for drill-fluid contamination has been described in
<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#ParaA4.4">Paragraphs A.4.4</A> to A.4.5 in Appendix 1 and
the extent to which the baseline geochemistry has been established has been
reviewed in Section B.3 of Appendix 2.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.62"></A>6.62   Nirex Report 525 identified three groundwater
regimes (Shown in Figure 13 of<I> Nirex Report 525</I> [COR/505]).  These were:</P>

<TD></TD>
<TD>iii.</TD>
<TD>a deep brine with a lower bromine to chlorine ratio occurring at depth in

<P>6.63   A detailed update of the hydrochemistry (i.e. the geochemistry of the
water) of Sellafield, was published by Nirex in July 1995 {S/95/008}.  This
report focused on interpreting the greatly increased amounts of data that have
become available since Nirex published the last interpretation of the
geochemistry in 1993 in <I>Nirex Report 524</I>, (Volume 3, Section 3)
[COR/517].</P>
<P>6.64   The newly available data are broadly consistent with the overall
interpretation presented in 1993 (<I>Nirex Report 524,</I> Volume 3, Section 3
[COR/517]) even though there is now some 2.5 times the volume of data available
as compared to 1993.  Thus, the interpretation has confirmed that there appear
to be the three major groundwater regimes identifiable across the site,
correlating with distinct components to the groundwater salinity.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.65"></A>6.65   However, the recent data have also indicated
that the freshwater can be subdivided into two types distinguished on the basis
of the stable oxygen isotope data {S/95/008}.  This newly identified type occurs
locally beneath the Coastal Plain Regime where the freshwater, on the basis of
the measured stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes, is different from the shallow
freshwater.  This is clearly shown by the additional data, ringed in yellow on
the lower part of
<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#FigB32">Figure B.3.2</A> (Appendix 2) derived from 1995
data, which was not present in the earlier 1993 data.  It is believed that this
deeper water was recharged under colder climate conditions than currently
exists, possibly during the Pleistocene.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.66"></A>6.66   The recognition of this fourth component, and
the way in which it has enabled all the groundwater compositions so far observed
at the site to be attributed to mixing between the four identified components,
represents a significant advance in the understanding of the geochemistry of the
Site.  This is because it provides confidence that the pattern of groundwater
type distribution has been revealed and that there are no longer any observed
compositions that cannot be explained in terms of well defined mixing
relationships.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.67"></A>6.67   The saline transition zone, which marks the
interface between the fresh water above and the saline water below, is
relatively sharp in the PRZ and generally occurs in the Brockram and basal
sandstones.  To the south and west of the PRZ the saline transition zone is more
diffuse.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.68"></A>6.68   A good indicator of the rate of groundwater
flow through the system is provided by the length of time that the water has
been resident in the ground.  Information can also be obtained for the residence
time of the solutes dissolved in the water.  (See
<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Table6.2">Table 6.2</A> for a description of the
geochemical indicators of groundwater residence times.)  The best evidence for
residence times for water and solutes in the BVG in the PRZ comes from stable
isotopes and chlorine-36 data respectively.  The stable isotopes (oxygen and
hydrogen) together with data from analysis of the noble gases in the water,
indicate the water has been recharged (entered the ground) under colder climate
conditions, during the Pleistocene (up to 1.6 million years ago).  The
chlorine-36 data indicate that the chloride in the water in the BVG in the PRZ
has had a long residence time, possibly over 1.5 million years.  Preliminary
helium data also indicate long residence times of similar magnitudes.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.69"></A>6.69   The latest interpretation of the geochemical
data is thus indicating:</P>

groundwater through the BVG at depth and a high potential for dilution and

radionuclides from a repository in groundwater that may ultimately reach the
surface environment.</TD></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>III     REMAINING UNCERTAINTIES</B></P>
<P><B>Understanding and Prediction of Groundwater System</B></P>
<P>6.74   Nirex recognises the importance of the groundwater flow regime being
well understood and predictable (<I>PERA,</I> paragraph 6.3.1 [COR/501]).</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.75"></A>6.75   The extensive programme of investigations is
indicating a consistent pattern of groundwater conditions.  The  description of
the basic three groundwater regimes, comprising deep brine, deep saline water
and shallow freshwater, have remained essentially unchanged from an early stage
in the investigations.  In 1992, on this basis of only a limited reconnaissance
of the site, the three-regime system was identified in schematic form in <I>Nirex
Report 268 Sellafield Hydrogeology, August 1992 (&quot;Nirex Report 268&quot;)</I>
(Figure 3.3) [COR/521].  The regimes were described in more detail in 1993
(Figure 13 of<I> Nirex Report 525</I> [COR/505]).  It was noted that
information from the determination of groundwater chemistry was helping to
confirm the pattern of groundwater flow indicated independently by the
information on the groundwater pressures and hydraulic conductivity.  Finally,
as summarised in <A HREF="#Para6.60">Paragraphs 6.60</A> - 6.69 of my evidence,
the current interpretation of the groundwater regimes remains essentially
unchanged despite the substantial increase in the amount of available data from
the site.</P>
<P>6.76   Nirex has designed its investigations to take due account of the
features of the site to provide confidence that the significant ones are
recognised and characterised.  Care is taken to avoid undue reliance on any
single technique in the interpretation of the ground conditions.  This means
that significant features and characteristics of the site are invariably
investigated using a range of independent techniques. This provides assurance
that these significant features and characteristics are determined with
confidence.  An example quoted earlier in this section (<A HREF="#Para6.69">Paragraph
6.69</A>) was the use of four independent analyses, all of which gave consistent
results, for the estimation of residence times for groundwater and solutes. 
Another example is the conclusion of low groundwater flow through a small
sub-set of fractures in the BVG which is based on independent observations
arising from Full Sector Tests, flow zone characterisation, mineralogical
studies, Short Interval Hydraulic Testing, Fracture Network Testing and the
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test.</P>
<P>6.77   The level of detail with which it is now possible to describe the
features of the site shows that a high level of understanding of the groundwater
conditions has been developed. The basic nature of the groundwater flow system
has been established, but uncertainties remain to be addressed in respect of the
quantification of flows.</P>
<P>6.78   The prognosis of the site conditions, as presented by Nirex in 1989
when the decision was taken to investigate Sellafield (<I>PERA,</I> Section 8
[COR/501]), has been confirmed.  As new data are obtained they are fitting into
place with previous views about the site that had relied more heavily on
judgment.</P>
<P>6.79   The extent to which the groundwater flow regimes can be described
using mathematical models is a further aspect related to understanding and
predictability.  However, it is not adequate simply to be able to describe the
groundwater flow system using mathematical models.  It is important that the
model predictions are compared with independent field observations and
experimental measurements.  This is the principle of validation described in Dr
Holmes' evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>, <A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para5.8">Paragraphs
5.8</A> - 5.9).</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.80"></A>6.80   As recognised by Nirex in 1993, some of the
initial groundwater flow models were unable fully to reproduce certain aspects
of the independent field measurements (<I>Nirex Report 524, </I>Volume 3, page
8-5 [COR/517] and <I>Nirex Report 525</I>, page 22 [COR/505])</P>
<P>6.81   Some improvement in the match between models and independent
observations is being noted in the new models published in <I>Nirex 95</I>
[COR/522].  However, there are still some differences between the calculated and
observed salinities and heads.</P>
<P>6.82   The characteristics of the networks of connected fractures in the
ground can only be established by direct measurements of the rock in three
dimensions on length scales sufficient to cover the intersections and
connections of the real fractures.  This cannot be achieved without direct
access to the rocks underground from the RCF.</P>
<P><B>Summary of Remaining Uncertainties affecting Groundwater Flow</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.83"></A>6.83   A considerable amount of information and
understanding exists regarding the site and issues related to groundwater flow. 
However, as I have identified, there are some remaining uncertainties which
currently limit confidence in the assessments of post-closure performance needed
to enable a decision to be taken on whether or not Nirex should propose
development of a repository.</P>
<P>6.84   Some of these remaining uncertainties can be addressed from continued
surface-based investigation; others can be addressed in the laboratory.  These
are listed in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Table6.3">Table 6.3</A> (a).</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.85"></A>6.85   However, although the investigations carried
out so far have provided a considerable amount of understanding about the nature
and distribution of the flow zones in the Boreholes, there remains uncertainty
regarding the conceptual models which we need to develop to describe the way in
which these fractures form networks of connected fractures through which
groundwater flows.  This is because we cannot directly observe or characterise
these networks using boreholes from the surface even though we can infer some
information about them from the hydrogeological testing we have carried out.</P>
<P>6.86   Investigations from the surface are thus not able fully to address
the remaining uncertainties due to the inherent limitations of such measurements
made in Boreholes.  In particular:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER" ALIGN="LEFT">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD>the Boreholes are only able to sample the rock over a limited volume
defined by the length (or depth) of the hole and its diameter.  Many features,
such as fractures are thus inadequately sampled.  It is known that many of the
fractures observed in the rocks at the surface have lengths often measured in
metres.  The Boreholes are thus unable to provide any substantial information
about the variability of fractures at the length scales approaching the lengths
of individual fractures; and</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>ii.</TD>
<TD>although the presence of flow zones can be recognised in Boreholes, and the
behaviour of the networks of connected fractures examined by hydrogeological
tests (such as the Cross-Hole Hydraulic Testing and the Borehole RCF3 Pump
Test), the opportunity does not exist for studying and characterising the flow
zones themselves, except at the specific location where they happen to have been
intercepted by the borehole.  No direct evidence can thus be obtained about
their spatial variability and length, and the way they are connected except at
the scale of the borehole sample.</TD></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.87"></A>6.87   The RCF will allow these remaining
uncertainties to be addressed because it will allow the flow zones and the ways
in which they form networks of connected fractures to be directly observed and
characterised in the excavations created as shafts and galleries.  These will
provide observations at length scales very much longer than those provided by
the borehole cores.  They will also permit the networks of connected fractures
to be observed and characterised in three dimensions by permitting access to
them both through excavations and through the drilling of short, closely
targeted boreholes drilled from the underground excavations.  Through testing
and monitoring utilising closely spaced and targeted boreholes we will be able
to obtain a much more detailed and comprehensive understanding of these networks
of connected fractures than is possible using deep boreholes from the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.88"></A>6.88   It was noted in <A HREF="#Para6.40">Paragraph
6.40</A> that many of the responses observed in the Cross-Hole Hydraulic Testing
were extremely small and that many were close to the limits of resolution of the
monitoring equipment and of a similar magnitude to the natural short-term cyclic
fluctuations observed in the monitoring network dataset.  These small responses
were observed from the effects of drawdowns induced in Borehole 2 of between 100
and 200 metres in head. The drawdowns (reductions in groundwater pressures)
induced by the construction of the RCF will be significantly greater (up to 1000
metres) than those which will have been induced on the groundwater system by the
existing hydrogeological testing.  Such drawdowns will tend to reveal the
presence of any connections which exist between the BVG and the overlying
sandstones by inducing flow from the sandstones through the Brockram and into
the BVG which will be detected by the instrumentation network already installed
around the RCF shaft site (<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA11">Table A.11</A> in
Appendix 1).</P>
<P><B>7.   <A NAME="NATURAL">NATURAL AND INDUCED CHANGES TO THE GEOLOGICAL
BARRIER</A></B></P>
<P>7.1   It is important to be able to demonstrate that future changes, which
may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not create new
pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to the
engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair their
ability to retain radioactivity.</P>
<P><B>Natural Changes</B></P>
<P>Approach</P>
<P>7.2   A geological principle which guides much of the thinking on geological
change is that of uniformitarianism: that the present can be used to interpret
the past.  This principle leads directly to the concept that processes operating
at present and in the past will operate in the future, and produce similar
results over the timescales of interest to repository safety assessment studies.
</P>
<P>7.3   The current approach being adopted by Nirex is to concentrate efforts
on observing the effects on the system of past geological and climatic changes. 
This approach is supported by the <I>Nirex Review Panel</I> <I>Annual Report,

<P>7.5   Tectonic and climatic processes are likely to affect any site in the
UK over the time periods we need to consider.  The issue is therefore one of
establishing a rational basis for estimating the impact of these changes so that
they can be given appropriate recognition in the assessment of the post-closure
performance of a repository.</P>
<P>Age of Faulting</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.6"></A>7.6   Traditionally, fault movements were dated
indirectly by determining the ages of rocks offset by the faults and the ages of
undisturbed, cross-cutting (e.g. dykes or mineral veins) or overlying strata. 
In recent years, a growing number of techniques have been applied to enable
direct dating of fault rocks using a similar approach to that adopted for dating
the fracture mineralisation (<A HREF="#Para6.24">Paragraphs 6.24</A> - 6.25).</P>
<P>7.7   Using these new techniques, two groups of fault rocks have been dated,
namely:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER" ALIGN="LEFT">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD> three samples from Fault 200 encountered in Boreholes 2 and 4; and</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>ii.</TD>
<TD>three samples from Borehole 3 and 4 which shared many features but were
markedly different from the first group.</TD></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8   The samples from the first group gave ages for the fault wall rock
ranging from 255 to 315 million years.  Fault gouge samples were dated at
between 118 and 146 million years and were considered to represent minimum ages
for fault activation and reactivation along different planes in the same fault
zone.</P>
<P>7.9   An authigenic illite clay in the second group gave a minimum age of
212 million years, possibly representing a period of enhanced tectonic activity
during the opening of the East Irish Sea Basin in the Triassic.  The minimum age
of authigenic illite-smectite clay also in the second group was estimated to be
60 million years.  This is not thought to be related to a faulting episode, but
may be due to a thermal event at that time in the Tertiary (See
<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>).</P>
<P>7.10   Dating of the fault rocks and studies of the fracture mineralisation,
including that associated with the flow zones, thus supports the view that the
last major episode of faulting occurred over 100 million years ago and that the
network of flowing fractures has probably persisted in the rocks for around 200
million years.  This is not to say that younger fault movements have definitely
not occurred.  Indeed, geological evidence from surrounding parts of the UK
suggest movements may well have continued into the Tertiary and beyond. 
However, we see no evidence that these younger movements, if they have affected
the Sellafield rocks, have caused significant changes to the rocks relevant to
the potential of the site to host a repository.  Investigations are required in
the RCF to examine the rocks at depth for evidence of recent changes, although I
do not expect to observe any significant features.</P>
<P>Impacts of Glaciation</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.11"></A>7.11   During the latter part of the Quaternary, the
British Isles have been glaciated on several occasions.  About ten more
glaciations of comparable extent are anticipated in the next million years. 
<I>The Royal Society, November 1994</I> (Section 10.1.3 (i), page 156)
[COR/605] stated:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Over the next 10,000 - 100,000 years it is very probable that
global climate will change so as to produce glacial or periglacial conditions in
the UK, with a lowering of sea level and a major impact on the biosphere. &quot;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.12   The results of the Quaternary Characterisation studies available so

<TD>ii.</TD>
<TD>the Quaternary sediments show evidence of dislocations associated with ice
movement (glacitectonic structures).  However, despite extensive searching using
remote sensing and high resolution seismic surveys, no evidence has been found
of tectonic faults having involved both the bedrock and the Quaternary deposits
themselves.</TD></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.13   The palaeohydrogeological aspects of the geochemical studies (<A
HREF="#Para6.65">Paragraph 6.65</A>) have indicated that the deeper freshwater
component was possibly recharged in a cold (glacial or periglacial) phase of the
Pleistocene, with the shallower component being recharged since that time. 
However, no evidence has been found to indicate that there has been extensive
flushing of the water from depth during the last glaciation (10,000 to 26,000
years ago) since the chlorine-36 and helium data have indicated residence times
for solutes in the order of 1.5 million years.</P>
<P>Earthquakes</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.14"></A>7.14   This section examines the occurrence of
earthquakes in the UK and in the area around Sellafield.  On the basis of the
effects they have produced, it concludes that, although there is some level of
earthquake activity in the area around Sellafield, earthquakes are not expected
to have a significant effect on the physical stability of the site in terms of
its potential to host a repository.</P>
<P>7.15   Whilst it is important to take due consideration of earthquakes in
the assessment of the site, it is equally important to keep such studies in
perspective.  The <I>Nirex Review Panel Annual Report</I>, 1994 (Section 3.1.1
(a), page 4) [COR/516] stated:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The Panel holds the view that earthquakes are unlikely to be a
major threat to the performance of the Sellafield site.  However, because no
area of Britain may be considered totally immune, Nirex should maintain a
balanced view and focus on establishing whether the site is robust to the
effects of earthquakes.  This is best achieved through a consideration of the
geological record, and details of historical seismicity&quot;.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.16   Nirex have collated a considerable amount of data relevant to the
seismicity of the area around Sellafield through the site characterisation
programme and seismicity studies.  Work is continuing in all areas of study.</P>
<P>7.17   International safety guidelines relevant to the siting of nuclear
facilities are used as the basis for the Nirex studies on seismicity of the
Sellafield site.  <I>IAEA Safety Standards No 99, Safety principles and
technical criteria for the underground disposal of high level radioactive
wastes, 1989 (&quot;IAEA Safety Series No 99&quot;)</I> (Criterion 7, page 15,
paragraph 4.4.1) [GOV/503] states that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The possibility of tectonic, seismic and other disturbances which
can create new paths for the transport of radionuclides shall also be carefully
evaluated. &quot;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;In general, however, underground structures are not so susceptible
to seismic disturbances as surface structures.  Potential vertical and lateral
movements, stresses, and subsurface faulting should be taken into account when
developing scenarios resulting in various adverse effects, not only on
repository performance, but also on the hydrogeological conditions in the
surrounding area. &quot;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

(Section III.1, page 5) [NRX/14/2] stated:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The site shall present a high degree of stability: tectonic
movement should not be expected to occur (or to induce significant phenomena)
before, e.g. 10000 years, evaluated at regional levels and forecasted from

should be deemed to be stable as long as necessary according to the safety
assessment. Seismicity shall be low.  Its acceptable level depends on the option
and the site, but it shall be shown that tectonic movements are not expected to
reach Level 7 on the Richter scale (or an intensity of IX-X in the modified
Mercalli scale). &quot;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.20   <I>The Royal Society, November 1994</I> [COR/605] (Paragraph 10.1.2,
page 155) stated:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The mainland of the UK is not close to an active plate boundary
and the evidence from the historical record of the last few hundred years shows
that it has been subject to only moderate or small earthquakes (up to about
magnitude 5.5) in that time.  However, on the timescale of interest to Nirex's
post-closure assessment this may not always be the case.  Infrequent earthquakes
with magnitudes exceeding 6.0 do occur in the interior of plates away from their
boundaries, and some of these may be associated with the loading and unloading
of ice caps that accompany climatic change.  The effects of earthquakes on a
potential repository site therefore need to be considered. &quot;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para7.21"></A>7.21   Nirex has initiated studies to evaluate the
nature of the tectonic and seismic disturbance which could affect a repository
at Sellafield.  The methodology for these studies is in accordance with <I>IAEA
Safety Series 50-SG-S1, Earthquakes and Associated Topics in relation to Nuclear
Power Plant siting, A safety Guide, Vienna, 1991</I> [GOV/508].</P>
<P>7.22   The geological structure interpreted from the extensive site
investigation studies has identified the main faults within the area around
Sellafield.  The identification of faults is important because earthquakes of
significant size generally occur on already-existing faults.  The identified
faults are being characterised and, as described in <A HREF="#Para7.6">Paragraphs
7.6</A> - 7.10, studies to date support the view that the last major episode of
faulting occurred over 100 million years ago.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.23"></A>7.23   A seismological database has been assembled
for the Sellafield area {SA/95/003}, which is based upon historical records and
instrumentally recorded earthquakes.  The 1786 Whitehaven earthquake of
magnitude 4.7MSA (MSA is the surface wave magnitude assessed from a
consideration of the felt area of the earthquake {SA/95/003}) is the most
significant earthquake for which records exist in the Sellafield area.  Over the
last four centuries, at least fifteen earthquakes would have been felt around
the Sellafield site although there is nothing in the historical and instrumental
records to indicate that any comparable event has occurred near the site since
1786 (See Drawing Nos. 10106 to 10108 in<I> Nirex Report SA/95/002</I>
[COR/518]).</P>
<P>7.24   Although it was not felt at Sellafield, the 1865 earthquake at
Rampside near Barrow is the most damaging earthquake that appears to have
occurred in West Cumbria.  It was of low magnitude (3.0 MSA) but near surface
(probably less than 1 km) and therefore generated relatively high intensities
(VII - VIII) over a small area.  The earthquake is believed to be unique among
British earthquakes in that it caused liquefaction of beach sands with the
expulsion of water.  There is no reason to suppose that any effects on deep
groundwater were involved that would be relevant to the assessment of repository
performance.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.25"></A>7.25   Nevertheless, Nirex is examining the risk
associated with hydrogeological changes due to seismicity. Palaeohydrogeological
studies of the fracture network will provide evidence on how the minerals and
their fluid inclusions in the fracture system have evolved.  Such studies do,
however, require access to the fracture system to provide samples of fault and
fracture infill material.  To characterise the faults and fractures and to
permit suitable and representative sample locations to be selected requires
access to the rock mass at depth.  This can only be provided in the RCF.  The
groundwater monitoring system, together with the Sellafield seismic network and
the acoustic monitoring equipment, will provide evidence as to whether changes
to the groundwater system occur in association with earthquakes recorded in the
local area.  As discussed in <A HREF="#Para6.71">Paragraphs 6.71</A> - 6.73,
the groundwater system at the Sellafield site provides dilution in the
sandstones for any water released from the BVG.  Hence, even if some deep water
was released in an earthquake this water would be subject to dilution in the
sandstones before reaching the surface.</P>

excavation will result in some changes to the fracture properties and may
generate new fractures. This type of change arising from construction is
referred to as 'excavation disturbance'.  The significance of this is described

<P>7.32   Item i. has so far been addressed through the examination of the
fractures using boreholes drilled from the surface.  This technique is
restricted to locations where a borehole happens to encounter a significant
feature and limited to the size of the core sample (approximately 100 mm
diameter).  The RCF will permit significant fractures, once encountered, to be
examined in detail in three dimensions through a combination of excavation and
targeted drilling.  In this way information on such issues as length,
continuity, connectivity, orientation and variability in three dimensions can be
explored.</P>
<P>7.33   Measurements of excavation disturbance are required (to address item
ii. above) to validate the extent to which the models that predict excavation
disturbance are valid for the BVG.  These measurements can only be made in an
underground excavation such as the RCF.</P>
<P>7.34   Other matters that remain to be addressed are the continuing
monitoring of earthquakes and acoustic emission from the rocks and investigation
of the Quaternary deposits.  These can adequately be addressed using
surface-based investigation as summarised in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Table6.3">Table
6.3</A> (b).</P>
<P><B>8.   <A NAME="DESIGN">DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE REPOSITORY</A></B></P>
<P><B>Introduction</B></P>
<P>If a repository is constructed at the site, decisions will be needed to
select the depth, location, layout and orientation of the repository vaults. 
This selection will be influenced by the nature, distribution and dimensions of
potentially important structures, such as flow zones, within the rock mass that
could control rock quality or groundwater flow.  This section of my evidence
explains the current understanding of these features and identifies the
remaining uncertainties which need to be addressed.</P>
<P><B>Geological and Hydrogeological Factors Influencing Repository Depth,
Location, Layout and Orientation</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.2"></A>8.2   The BVG was identified as the potential
repository host rock.  The position of the top of the BVG was, and is, defined
by the contours on the top of the Basement (See Drawing No. 10054 in<I> Nirex
Report SA/95/002</I> [COR/518]).</P>
<P>8.3   The initial results from Boreholes 2, 4 and 5 suggested the
possibility of slightly elevated hydraulic conductivity in the upper 100 metres
of the BVG.  (EPM 9 in Borehole 2, EPM 6 and 7 in Borehole 4 and EPM 9 in
Borehole 5: Drawing Nos. 10133, 10135 and 10136 in<I> Nirex Report SA/95/002</I>
[COR/518]).  This supported a previously developed view that a repository should
be located with at least 100 metres of BVG cover.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.4"></A>8.4   The top surface of the BVG falls in elevation
towards the west (<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure5.2">Figures 5.2</A> and
<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure5.3">5.3</A>).  Hence, in order to maintain the
nominal 100 metre cover of BVG over a repository, as the repository is moved
progressively west it would have to become deeper.  The measured rock stresses
show a linear increase with depth (<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA13">Table A.13</A> in
Appendix 1), the temperature increases with depth (20&#183;C at 500 metres
depth, thereafter increasing at 25&#183;C per 1000 metres) and the extent of the
excavation disturbance likely to develop around a repository is likely to
increase with depth. Construction costs will also tend to increase with depth,
partly because of the ground conditions and partly because of increased cost of
access (deeper shafts and/or longer access drifts).  Taking these factors into
account, the maximum depth for a repository was taken, for planning purposes, as
1000 metres below ground level, which approximated to 900 metres bOD.</P>
<P>8.5   To provide the nominal 100 metres of BVG cover above a repository, the
western limit of a potential repository location is thus defined by the 800
metres bOD contour on the top surface of the BVG (See Drawing No. 10054 in<I>Nirex
Report SA/95/002</I> [COR/518]).</P>
<P>8.6   The 800 metre bOD contour on the top of the BVG is approximately
coincident with the Fleming Hall Fault.  This is not only a large fault, with a
trace length of 4 km and a maximum throw (at base Permo-Triassic) of 355 metres,
but it also forms the eastern limit of the Carboniferous Limestone.  The
Carboniferous Limestone generally has a higher hydraulic conductivity than the
BVG (median value is 5 x 10-8 metres/second) and there is evidence from the
borehole core samples that the formation shows enhancement of hydraulic
conductivity by solution processes along fractures (<I>Nirex Report 524, </I>Volume
3, section 2.3.6, pages 2-10 [COR/517]).  There is also the known potential of
the Carboniferous Limestone to contain iron ore bodies.  The decision was
therefore taken to avoid the repository being located close to the Carboniferous
Limestone.  This factor thus defines the westward and northward extent of the
PRZ.</P>
<P>8.7   To the south-east of the Site area the Seascale Fault Zone occurs. 
This is a major east-south-east trending structure comprising a number of
individual faults.  Displacements measured at the base of the Permo-Triassic
range up to 170 m across an individual fault with the overall throw across the
fault zone in excess of 350 metres.</P>
<P>8.8   The current hydrogeological modelling (<I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522])
assumes that both the Fleming Hall and Seascale Fault Zones are significant
hydrogeological features with enhanced hydraulic conductivity associated with
them.  This supports the previous decision that a repository should avoid being
positioned immediately adjacent to these two fault zones.</P>
<P>8.9   Thus the position of possible locations for a repository in plan is
defined by the extent of the Carboniferous Limestone to the north, by the
Fleming Hall fault to the west and by the Seascale Fault to the south.  The
eastern limit is defined on environmental grounds by the boundary of the Lake
District National Park.  The boundary of the PRZ as now defined has been refined
in detail to reflect current land ownership, but remains essentially as defined
above on geological and hydrogeological grounds.</P>
<P>8.10   Having set the above constraints on the margins  of the PRZ, the top
of the BVG is noted to be at approximately 550 metres bOD in the southern corner
of the PRZ.  Thus, still maintaining the concept of a normal 100 metres of BVG
over a repository, the nominal highest level of a repository is 650 metres bOD. 
As explained in <A HREF="#Para8.4">Paragraph 8.4</A> above, the nominal lowest
level is 900 metres bOD.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.11"></A>8.11  Studies are continuing to select a preferred
position for a repository within the PRZ.  Geotechnical modelling {NGI Reports
931005-031 and 931005-51} has enabled some understanding to be gained on the
likely sensitivity of the behaviour of repository vaults to variations in depth,
layout and orientation of the repository in relation to variations in rock
quality.  As noted in <A HREF="#Para7.30">Paragraph 7.30</A>, there are
uncertainties related to this modelling in terms of validating the input
parameters for the rock mass and the outputs from the models in relation to the
actual behaviour of the BVG.</P>
<P>8.12   The investigations have indicated (<A HREF="#Para5.6">Paragraphs 5.6</A>
- 5.14 and <A HREF="#Para6.20">6.20</A> - 6.21) that the properties of the BVG
are variable.  Particular characteristics which are emerging are:</P>

<P><A NAME="Para8.13"></A>8.13   A three-dimensional representational model of
the PRZ rock mass is currently being developed.  This incorporates interpreted
geological, hydrogeological, geotechnical and geochemical data to provide a
detailed description of the PRZ.  It takes as its basis the current geological
model of the PRZ which has, in turn, been developed from the integration of
borehole data, cross-hole seismic tomography surveys, seismic reflection surveys
and potential field data {S/95/005}.  Further refinement to the model will be
possible on completion of the interpretation of the trial 3-D seismic survey
carried out in 1994.</P>
<P>8.14   The model is inevitably based on partial data.  However, by taking
due regard of the uncertainties inherent in the model and by testing the various
alternative interpretations against independent measurements, confidence can be
built that the model is an adequate representation of reality.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.15"></A>8.15   The current model of the site incorporates a
number of judgments that cannot be adequately tested using data obtained from
the surface.  Of these, the most important relates to the nature and arrangement
of networks of connected flowing fractures in the rock.  Their distribution
within the rock mass and the extent to which they may be intersected by
repository vaults, and hence the extent to which it might be possible to locate
vaults to limit the intersections between these networks of connected fractures
and the repository vaults are further important considerations.</P>
<P>8.16   The model will be tested against direct measurements in the RCF. 
Initially, the RCF will test the model in the area of the shafts. 
Progressively, as galleries are driven out from the shafts and peripheral
drilling carried out, the model will be tested in the wider PRZ.  The rate at
which confidence will be built in the model of the wider PRZ will depend on the
extent to which it is found to be an adequate representation of the conditions
found in the RCF.</P>
<P><B>Summary of Remaining Uncertainties Affecting Repository Design and
Construction</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.17"></A>8.17   In Section 6 of my evidence I showed that the
main flow channels in the BVG are considered to consist of networks of connected
fractures.  As described in <A HREF="#Para6.8">Paragraphs 6.8</A> - 6.45, it is
the characterisation of the flowing fractures and features and, in particular,
the way in which these are connected so as to permit the movement of groundwater
through the BVG and into the overlying strata that constitutes the principal
area of remaining uncertainty.</P>
<P>8.18   There are some further investigations planned to be undertaken from
the surface that partially address some of the uncertainties.  These are
described in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Table6.3">Table 6.3</A> (c).  However, in
much the same way as explained in
<A HREF="#Para6.83">Paragraphs 6.83</A> - 6.88 in relation to groundwater flow
and radionuclide transport, remaining uncertainties over the characteristics of
the flow zones, and particularly their large-scale characteristics, such as
their distribution through the PRZ, that cannot be determined from boreholes, is
currently limiting our ability to select an optimum position for a repository. 
In addition, as explained in <A HREF="#Para7.31">Paragraphs 7.31</A> - 7.34,
uncertainties over the extent of excavation disturbance and the relationship
between this and variations in rock properties within the PRZ also limits our
ability to select the optimum position for a repository.</P>
<P>8.19   These remaining uncertainties can only be addressed through
investigations carried out underground in the RCF.</P>
<P><B>9.   <A NAME="CONCLUSIONS">CONCLUSIONS</A></B></P>
<P><B>Introduction</B></P>
<P>9.1   This final section of my evidence draws together the various threads
presented earlier into a series of consolidated conclusions.  Firstly, I
summarise our current understanding of the geology and hydrogeology of the
Sellafield site in qualitative terms, recognising that it is only through the
process of safety assessment that the suitability of the site can be assessed in
relation to regulatory targets.  Secondly, I draw together the various remaining
uncertainties that exist concerning the geology and hydrogeology of the site
that need to be addressed in the RCF.</P>
<P><B>Summary of Current Understanding of Geology and Hydrogeology</B></P>
<P>9.2   Nirex has carried out an extensive and systematic investigation of the
geology and hydrogeology of the Sellafield site using a wide range of techniques
and technical specialists.  So far the investigations have been carried out
entirely from the surface.</P>
<P>9.3   Studies of the geology of the area have confirmed that the geological
sequence and structure are essentially as expected when the decision was taken
in 1989 to investigate the site.  The investigations have, however, added
substantial detail to the understanding of the geology.</P>
<P>9.4   Recognising that the main way in which radionuclides can be
transported away from a repository is by flow of groundwater, considerable
effort has been directed towards understanding the hydrogeology of the site. 
The site has favourable characteristics in respect of the two key functions
which the geological barrier must achieve (see <A HREF="#Para6.2">Paragraph 6.2</A>
above).  Firstly, there are low groundwater flows in the BVG which would host
the repository and, secondly, there would be substantial subsequent dilution of
any solutes in that water as it joins the active groundwater system in the
overlying sandstones.</P>
<P>9.5   These favourable characteristics of the site are being indicated by a
range of independent observations.  Thus, low flow of groundwater is indicated
by measurements of low hydraulic conductivity in the BVG, by observations that
flow is through a small sub-set of fractures, and by observations of groundwater
chemistry that indicate residence times for water and solutes in the BVG of
possibly up to 1.5 million years. </P>
<P>9.6   A provisional conclusion from the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test is that
there appears to be little connection between the BVG and the overlying
sandstones.</P>
<P>9.7   The groundwater system at the site is increasingly well understood and
capable of being described using simple mathematical models supported by a
number of independent datasets.  Good progress is being made in matching the
predictions from these models with independent field measurements.</P>
<P><B>Summary of Remaining Uncertainties that need to be addressed in the RCF</B></P>
<P>9.8   However, the surface-based investigations are not able fully to
address the remaining uncertainties due to the inherent limitations of
measurements made in Boreholes drilled from the surface.  Firstly, the Boreholes
are only able to sample the rock over a limited volume defined by the length (or
depth) of the hole and its diameter.  Many features, such as fractures, are thus
inadequately sampled.  Secondly, the Borehole testing is unable to provide
direct evidence concerning the spatial variability and length of the fractures,
and the way in which they form networks of connected fractures that control
groundwater flow.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.9"></A>9.9   It is the characterisation of the flow zones
and, in particular, the way in which these are connected so as to permit the
movement of groundwater through the BVG and into overlying strata, that
constitutes the principal area of remaining uncertainty</P>
<P>9.10   Uncertainties also exist regarding the extent to which current models
reliably predict the extent of excavation disturbance and the variations in rock
properties as they impact the selection of the position for a repository.  </P>
<P>9.11   These remaining uncertainties need to be addressed before a decision
can be made to propose a repository at the site.  They can only be addressed
through investigations in the RCF.</P>

<P> <B>DR ROBERT CHAPLOW will say:</B></P>
<P><B>1.   <A NAME="PERSONAL">PERSONAL DETAILS</A></B></P>
<P>1.1   I have been the Manager for Site Characterisation in the Science
Department of United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex') since June 1993.  I am
responsible for acquiring and interpreting site specific data in the Sellafield
area in order to understand and describe the geology and hydrogeology as an
input to the assessment of the suitability of the site for development of a deep
repository for radioactive waste disposal.</P>
<P>1.2   I hold a first class honours degree in Geology of the University of
London and am an Associate of the Royal School of Mines, London.  Following post
graduate research I was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree by London
University and a Diploma of Membership of the Imperial College.  I am a Fellow
of the Geological Society of London and a Chartered Geologist.  I was a Lecturer
in Engineering Geology at Imperial College (1971-75) and external examiner for
the MSc course in Engineering Geology at Leeds University (1989-92).  I have
been a member of the Programme Board of the British Geological Survey (1988-93),
a member of the Universities Funding Council Research Assessment Review Panel
for Earth Sciences and Environmental Studies (1992), a member of the Natural
Environment Research Council's Earth Science Committee (1993-94) and of their
Earth Science and Technology Board (1994 to date).  I was appointed by the
Minister for the Environment and Countryside as a Member of Council of the
Nature Conservancy Council for England (English Nature) and served in this
position from 1991-95.  I am the author of 17 technical papers on aspects of
geology and hydrogeology and have presented papers at technical conferences and
seminars in UK, India, Thailand and the United States.</P>
<P>1.3   From 1975 until I joined Nirex in 1993 I was employed by Sir Alexander
Gibb &amp; Partners, initially as Chief Engineering Geologist.  I was appointed
as an Associate of the company in 1985 and a Director in 1989.  I have been
responsible for providing geological and hydrogeological inputs to the
investigation, design and construction of over 50 major engineering projects
located in more than 30 countries world-wide.  These projects have included
tunnels, major underground openings and dams.  I was Project Manager for the
work undertaken by Gibb for Nirex for the characterisation of the site at
Fulbeck as a potential site for shallow disposal of radioactive waste, and was
Project Director for the work undertaken to investigate the sites at Dounreay
and Sellafield.  On behalf of Nirex I managed the first phase of geological and
hydrogeological interpretation of the geological and hydrogeological data from
Dounreay and Sellafield in 1991/92 which led to the issues of Nirex Reports 263
to 272 on Sellafield in 1992 and to the preparation of the reports on Dounreay
which were subsequently issued as Nirex Reports 653, and 657 to 661.</P>

<P><B>Investigations So Far</B></P>
<P>2.5   Nirex has carried out an extensive and systematic investigation of the
geology and hydrogeology of the Sellafield site using a range of surface-based
techniques.  A wide range of technical specialists has conducted the work and
care has been taken to avoid undue reliance on any single technique in the
interpretation of ground conditions.</P>
<P>2.6   The investigations have been carried out primarily within an area some
60 km by 65 km, centred on Sellafield and have comprised:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD>drilling at twenty two sites with a total of 25,712 metres of drilling.

<TD></TD>

<TD>geological mapping, hydrogeological and geophysical surveys and earthquake

<P>2.7   Carrying out investigation and construction activities at the site
perturbs the groundwater pressures and can perturb the geochemical
characteristics of the groundwater. The results so far show that baseline
hydrogeological conditions have been established.</P>
<P><B>Geological Structure</B></P>
<P>2.8   The geological structure of the site has been defined by the
investigations carried out.  Detailed maps and sections showing the distribution
of the main geological units and the faults that cut them have been published (<I>Nirex
Report 524</I> [COR/517] <I>and Nirex Report SA/95/002</I> [COR/518]).</P>
<P>2.9   The Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks ('BVG'), the potential
repository host rocks, crops out (is at the surface) in the east of the Site
area.  Towards the west, the BVG is overlain by a sequence of cover rocks. 
These comprise Triassic sandstones (Ormskirk Sandstone, Calder Sandstone and St.
Bees Sandstone) and a group of Permian rocks designated the 'Cumbrian Coast
Group'.</P>
<P>2.10   The rocks are cut by a series of faults that displace the rock units.
 In the onshore area, these faults generally trend in a north-west to south-east
direction.  Other fault directions do occur, the most notable of which are the
east-north-east to west-south-west trend shown by the faults in the Seascale
Fault Zone.</P>
<P>2.11   The geological structure of the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') has
been defined in greater detail than the surrounding area as a result of the
greater concentration of investigations carried out in the area.  The BVG has
been sub-divided into a series of formations and members having distinct
geological and hydrogeological characteristics.  Further investigations are in
progress, most notably the interpretation of a 3-D seismic reflection survey,
that will further assist in extending this detailed interpretation across the
wider PRZ.</P>
<P><B>Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport</B></P>
<P>2.12   The main way in which radionuclides can be transported away from a
repository is by flow of groundwater.  The groundwater flow through the rocks is
thus an important factor in determining the performance of a repository in terms
of its ability to limit releases of radioactivity. </P>
<P>2.13   With reference to an extensive range of hydrogeological and
geochemical data, it is shown that groundwater flow in and through the BVG is
low.  This conclusion is based on the following observations:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER" ALIGN="LEFT">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD>the hydraulic conductivity of the BVG is low;</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>ii.</TD>
<TD>groundwater flow through the BVG is through fractures in the rock;</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>iii.</TD>
<TD>groundwater flow in and through the BVG is controlled by the flowing
fractures, which comprise around 0.5% of the fractures in the BVG;</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>iv.</TD>
<TD>the network of flowing fractures was largely created some 200 million years
ago and has persisted since that time, although changes to individual flowing
fractures are likely to have occurred.  The persistence of the network indicates
a high degree of stability within the system;</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>v.</TD>
<TD>significant progress has been made in establishing the geological
characteristics of the flowing fractures thus providing confidence regarding
extrapolation of conditions through the rock mass;</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>vi.</TD>
<TD>the flowing fractures are linked to form networks of connected fractures
through which groundwater can flow.  This was deduced initially from the results
of the short-term hydrogeological testing.  Testing carried out during the last
eighteen months, particularly the Fracture Network Testing, Cross-Hole Hydraulic
Testing and the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, has indicated that these connections
may not be as extensive as had been originally inferred;</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>vii.</TD>
<TD>a provisional conclusion from the Borehole RCF3 pump test is that there
appears to be little connection between the BVG and the overlying sandstones;</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>viii.</TD>
<TD>there is little or no vertical component of environmental head gradient
from the likely level of a repository through to the base of the Brockram and,
in some parts of the PRZ, on up into the sandstones; and</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>ix.</TD>
<TD>the geochemical data, and particularly the conclusions on long residence
times, are providing independent confirmation of low groundwater flow.</TD></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>2.14   Dilution of any groundwater leaving a repository located at depth in
the BVG is provided largely by a combination of low groundwater flows in the BVG
and mixing of this water with higher flows shown to be occurring in the
overlying sandstones.</P>
<P>2.15   However, the surface-based investigations have not been able fully to
address the remaining uncertainties due to the inherent limitations of
measurements made in boreholes drilled from the surface.  Firstly, the boreholes
are only able to sample the rock over a limited volume defined by the length (or
depth) of the hole and its diameter.  Many features, such as fractures, are thus
inadequately sampled.  Secondly, the borehole testing is unable to provide
direct evidence concerning the spatial variability and length of the fractures,
or of the ways in which they form networks of connected flowing fractures. 
Limited indirect evidence is, however, provided by the various forms of
hydrogeological testing carried out in the boreholes.</P>
<P>2.16   It is the characterisation of the flowing fractures and, in
particular, the way in which these are connected so as to permit the movement of
groundwater through the BVG and into overlying strata, that constitutes the
principal area of remaining uncertainty.</P>
<P><B>Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier</B></P>
<P>2.17   It is important to be able to demonstrate that future change, which
may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not create new
pathways that would result in unacceptable groundwater flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair their
ability to retain radioactivity.</P>
<P>2.18   Studies related to natural and induced changes to the geological
barrier have concluded that:</P>

<P><B>Design and Construction of the Repository</B></P>
<P>2.19   If a repository is constructed at the site, decisions will be needed
to select the depth, location, layout and orientation of the repository vaults. 
This selection will be influenced by the nature, distribution and dimensions of
potentially important structures within the rock mass that could control rock
quality or groundwater flow.</P>

concluded that:</P>

<P><B>Conclusions</B></P>
<P>2.21   Nirex has carried out an extensive and systematic investigation of
the geology and hydrogeology of the Sellafield site using a wide range of
techniques and technical specialists.  So far the investigations have been
carried out entirely from the surface.</P>
<P>2.22   Studies of the geology of the area have confirmed that the geological
sequence and structure are essentially as was expected when the decision was
taken in 1989 to investigate the site.  The investigations have, however, added
substantial detail to the understanding of the geology.</P>
<P>2.23   Recognising that the main way in which radionuclides can be
transported away from a repository is by flow of groundwater, considerable
effort has been directed towards understanding the hydrogeology of the site.  In
my opinion, the studies have confirmed that the site has the two main
characteristics favourable for locating a repository.  Firstly, there are low
groundwater flows in the BVG which would host the repository and, secondly,
there would be substantial subsequent dilution of any solutes in that water as
it joins the active groundwater system in the overlying sandstones.</P>
<P>2.24   These favourable characteristics of the site are being indicated by a
range of independent observations.  Thus, the likely low groundwater flows are
being indicated by measurements of low hydraulic conductivity in the BVG, by
observations that flow is through a small sub-set of fractures, and by
observations of groundwater chemistry that indicate residence times for water
and solutes in the BVG of possibly up to 1.5 million years. </P>
<P>2.25   A provisional conclusion from the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test is that
there appears to be little connection between the BVG and the overlying
sandstones.</P>
<P>2.26   The groundwater system at the site is increasingly well understood
and capable of being described using simple mathematical models supported by a
number of independent datasets.  Good progress is being made in matching the
predictions from these models with independent field measurements.</P>
<P>2.27   However, the surface-based investigations are not able fully to
address the remaining uncertainties due to the inherent limitations of
measurements made in deep boreholes drilled from the surface.  Firstly, the
boreholes are only able to sample the rock over a limited volume defined by the
length (or depth) of the hole and its diameter.  Many features, such as
fractures, are thus inadequately sampled.  Secondly, the borehole testing is
unable to provide direct evidence concerning the spatial variability and length
of the fractures and of the ways they form the networks of connected fractures
that control groundwater flow.</P>
<P>2.28   It is the characterisation of the flow zones and, in particular, the
way in which these form networks of connected fractures so as to permit the
movement of groundwater through the BVG and into overlying strata, that
constitutes the principal area of remaining uncertainty.</P>
<P>2.29   Uncertainties also exist regarding the extent to which current models
reliably predict excavation disturbance and the variations in rock properties as
they impact the selection of the depth, location, layout and orientation of the
repository vaults.</P>
<P>2.30   These remaining uncertainties need to be addressed before a decision
can be made to propose a repository at the site.  They can only be addressed
through investigations in the RCF.</P>

<P>My evidence summarises and interprets the results available so far from
studies and surveys of the geology and hydrogeology of the Sellafield site.</P>
<P><B>Documentation</B></P>
<P>3.2   The results of the investigations so far carried out at Sellafield are
contained in reports and appendices comprising over 1600 individual volumes. 
The document structure is summarised in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Table3.1">Table

results.  In order to assist with the progress of the Inquiry, these reports
have been subdivided into two categories.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para3.3"></A>3.3   First there are the two reports that summarise
the results of the investigations and form a part of this evidence.  These are
Core Inquiry Documents and comprise <I>The Geology and Hydrogeology of the
Sellafield Area:  Interim Assessment:  December 1993 (&quot;Nirex Report 524&quot;)</I>
[COR/517] published in 1993, and <I>Sellafield Geological and Hydrogeological
Investigations:  Factual Report - Compilation of Maps and Drawings (&quot;Nirex

that have arisen from the investigations and, in response to the Secretary of
State's statement under Rule 6(10) of the Town and Country Planning (Inquiries
Procedure) Rules 1992, addresses his wish to be informed about the results
available so far from studies and surveys of the geology and hydrogeology of the
site.  The report also lists the detailed factual and interpretation reports
published by Nirex.  I refer to over 35 key drawings in my evidence; the other
drawings lie there for information.  A copy of <I>Nirex Report SA/95/002</I>
[COR/518] was sent to Cumbria County Council on 6 July 1995.  It comprises 180

<P>3.4   Second are Nirex Reports which are referenced to provide details of
where the detailed data can be found if anyone should wish to consult it.  They
comprise mainly factual reports which have not been published, but are available
at the Nirex offices in Cumbria for reference on request to Nirex.  It is only
because of the number of the factual reports (around 1600 volumes) that they
have not been made widely available.  This second category of documents is

<P>3.6   Section 5 provides a general introduction to the geology of the
Sellafield site and establishes the framework within which I will then describe
the main conclusions which arise from the investigations.</P>
<P>3.7   Sections 6 to 8 summarise our understanding of the characteristics of
the site in relation to the three key areas of uncertainty to be addressed by
the RCF:</P>

<P>3.8   In each of sections 6 to 8 the current understanding is described and
explained and the remaining uncertainties which need to be resolved, are
identified.  An explanation is given of which of these can and are being
addressed by further surface-based investigations.  Finally those issues are
identified which, because of the inherent limitations of surface-based
investigation techniques, can only be addressed in the RCF.</P>
<P>3.9   In Section 9, I present my conclusions.  The significant geological
and hydrogeological characteristics interpreted from the results so far of the
investigations are summarised.  The remaining uncertainties that need to be
addressed and that can only be addressed by investigations in the RCF are
highlighted.</P>
<P><B>Definitions</B></P>
<P>3.10   One of the main threads which extends through my evidence is the
concept of 'flow zones'. Using Full Sector Tests (<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA7">Table
A.7</A>, Appendix 1) in boreholes, zones in the rock are identified through
which water can be induced to flow.  These zones are called 'flow zones'.  Using
data from the boreholes and from analysis of the rock cores, these flow zones
are characterised.  In some cases the flow is found to occur along one or more
fractures in the rock.  These fractures are termed 'flowing fractures'.  In
other cases, particularly in the Brockram and sandstones, flow cannot be
assigned to particular fractures since it may, for example, be occurring
partially or completely through the rock matrix.  In these cases the flow zone
is referred to as a 'flowing feature' {S/95/006}.</P>
<P>3.11   The individual flowing fractures combine together to form 'networks
of connected fractures' through which groundwater flow occurs.  Although we can
observe and characterise individual flowing fractures, we need to develop
conceptual models to describe the networks of connected fractures because we
cannot directly observe or characterise them using boreholes drilled from the
surface.  We can, however, infer certain characteristics of the networks from
observations made in the boreholes.  These matters are described in Section 6 of
my evidence.</P>
<P>3.12   The Sellafield site (the 'site') refers to the area that has been
investigated.  The site has been subdivided into four areas within which
different studies have been carried out (<A HREF="#Para4.2">Paragraphs 4.2</A>
- 4.6).</P>
<P>3.13   As far as possible, technical terms used in my evidence are explained
as they arise.  However, recognising the breadth of my evidence, it is
inevitable that terms may be used which are unfamiliar to the reader.  A full
glossary of technical terms has been compiled to which reference should be made
for the definition of all such technical terms (<I>Glossary</I> <I>of
scientific terms</I> [COR/519]).</P>
<P><B>4.   <A NAME="INVESTIGATIONS">INVESTIGATIONS SO FAR</A></B></P>
<P>4.1   Nirex has adopted a systematic approach to the design  and
implementation of its investigations of the site.  The process of investigating
the geology and hydrogeology of the area is given the name of 'site
characterisation'.  A wide range of technical specialists and techniques has
been used in the conduct of the work.  Care has been taken to avoid undue
reliance on any single technique in the investigation and interpretation of the
ground conditions.</P>
<P><B>Geographical Location of Investigations</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.2"></A>4.2   The studies carried out in West Cumbria have
been contained primarily within four areas designated as the 'Region',
'District', and 'Site' areas (<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure4.1">Figures 4.1</A>
and <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure4.2">4.2</A>) and the Potential Repository Zone
('PRZ') area (<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure4.3">Figure 4.3</A>).</P>
<P>4.3   The Region is an area onshore and offshore of approximately 60 km by
65 km for which information has been gathered on geological features which might
have relevance to a repository safety assessment.  Existing published sources of
information and commercial offshore seismic survey data have been used. 
Additional data, including structural geological data relevant to seismicity
studies and geological data to place the Sellafield site into its broader
geological framework, have been collected from wider areas extending for
distances of over 100 km from Sellafield.</P>
<P>4.4   The District is an area of approximately 20 km by 30 km within which
geological features may have direct relevance to a repository.  Within this area
Nirex has commissioned new geological, geophysical and hydrogeological
investigations.  These investigations have been supplemented by study of data
from past mining activities and other sources of information.</P>
<P>4.5   The Site area immediately around the PRZ covers approximately 5000
hectares.  All the Nirex Deep Boreholes ('Boreholes') are located in this area (<A
HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure4.2">Figure 4.2</A>).</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6   Since 1992 the characterisation activities have
increasingly concentrated on the PRZ, leading to a greater level of detailed
understanding of this particular area (<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure4.3">Figure

<P>4.9   Carrying out investigation and construction activities at the site
perturbs the groundwater pressures and can perturb the geochemical
characteristics of the groundwater.  The perturbations caused by construction of
the RCF are likely to be more extensive than those caused so far by
surface-based investigations.  It is therefore important to have established
both the groundwater pressures and the geochemical conditions with an adequate
level of confidence before construction of the RCF commences.  This is the
concept of being able to define the 'baseline hydrogeological conditions'. 
Appendix 2 reviews the information obtained from the investigations so far and
shows that baseline conditions have been established in terms of groundwater
heads and geochemical conditions.</P>

<P><B>Introduction</B></P>
<P>5.1   This section of my evidence provides a general introduction to the
geological structure of the Sellafield site which will form the framework within
which I will then describe the main conclusions from the investigations.</P>
<P>5.2   Reference is made to two reports (<I>Nirex Report 524</I> [COR/517]
<I>and Nirex Report SA/95/002</I> [COR/518]) which together provide a more
detailed description of the geology of the area for those who wish to obtain a
more detailed and comprehensive description.</P>
<P><B>Geological Structure of the Site</B></P>
<P>5.3   The Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks ('BVG'), the potential
repository host rock, crops out (is at the surface) in the north-east of the
Site area (see Drawing No. 10032 in<I> Nirex Report SA/95/002</I> [COR/518]). 
Towards the west, the BVG is overlain by a sequence of cover rocks.  These
comprise Triassic sandstones (Ormskirk Sandstone, Calder Sandstone and St. Bees
Sandstone) and a group of Permian rocks designated the 'Cumbrian Coast Group'
(See Drawing No. 10059 in<I> Nirex Report SA/95/002</I> [COR/518]). 
<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A> is a geological sequence in the
Sellafield Region area and <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure5.2">Figure 5.2</A> is a
geological cross-section to illustrate the geological sequence and structure of
the PRZ.</P>
<P>5.4   To the west of the Fleming Hall Fault Zone, Carboniferous rocks,
dominantly comprising limestones, occur between the Cumbrian Coast Group and the
BVG (<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure5.2">Figure 5.2</A>).  Within the PRZ the top
of the BVG is between approximately 400 metres and 600 metres below ground
surface.  At the coast the top of the BVG is some 1500 to 1600 metres below
ground level and by 10 km offshore the surface has fallen to 3000 metres below
sea level.  (Contours on this top basement surface are shown in Drawing Nos.
10051 to 10054 in<I> Nirex Report SA/95/002</I> [COR/518]).</P>
<P>5.5   This top basement surface is also shown as a three-dimensional
visualisation in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>.  This diagram
is a view from the south-west of the District area and shows the shape of the
top surface of the BVG.  The way in which the surface drops in elevation towards
the west can be seen as can the sharp changes in the slope associated with fault
displacements.  In the onshore area these faults generally trend in a north-west
to south-east direction.  Other fault directions do occur, the most notable of
which are the east-north-east to west-south-west trend shown by the faults
within the Seascale Fault Zone.</P>
<P><B>Geological Structure of the PRZ</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.6"></A>5.6   The investigations of the geology and
hydrogeology of the site have progressively been focused on the PRZ and on the
proposed position for the RCF.  </P>
<P>5.7   The general structure of the PRZ is illustrated in
<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure5.4">Figure 5.4</A>.  This is a view from the
south-east (with the overlying sandstones removed) showing the Brockram (part of
the Cumbrian Coast Group) overlying the BVG.  The main faults that have been
recognised from the seismic surveys are also shown.</P>
<P>5.8   To the west (left hand side of <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure5.4">Figure
5.4</A>) of the RCF the Fleming Hall Fault is shown and to the west of this, the
Carboniferous Limestone (shown in blue) occurs between the Brockram and the BVG.
 In this area the eastern limit of the Carboniferous strata is marked by the
Fleming Hall Fault.  Further to the north this eastern limit trends in a
north-easterly direction away from the fault (See Drawing No. 10054 in<I> Nirex
Report SA/95/002</I> [COR/518]).</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.9"></A>5.9   Three reports on the results of investigations
in this area have been published by Nirex in 1995 dealing with the geological
structure of the PRZ, the flow zone characterisation of the RCF area, and the
geology and hydrogeology of the RCF South Shaft location {Nirex Report Nos.
S/95/005 to 007}.  This sub-section of my evidence summarises the main
conclusions of these reports.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.10"></A>5.10   The progress reported in <I>Nirex Report
525, Scientific Update 1993, December 1993 (&quot;Nirex Report 525&quot;)</I>
related to the subdivision of the BVG has been continued.  <I>Nirex Report 525</I>
(paragraph 3.3, page 16) [COR/505] stated:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Prior to the commencement of the Nirex studies, BVG in the local
area was classified as a thick sequence of undifferentiated volcanic tuffs
(consolidated volcanic ash) and lava flows.  One of the major achievements of
work reported here has been to establish a subdivision of the rocks into several
formations which can be correlated between boreholes over distances of several
kilometres.  This subdivision has enabled the structure of the BVG to be defined
in more detail.  It is also becoming apparent that the hydrogeological
properties of the rocks are related to this same stratigraphic subdivision. &quot;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.11   An interpretation of the geological structure of the proposed RCF
South Shaft area is shown in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure5.5">Figure 5.5</A>. 
This shows the two formations recognised in this part of the BVG: the Fleming
Hall Formation and the Brown Bank Formation.  The Fleming Hall Formation has
been further subdivided into three members: the Longlands Farm Member, the Sides
Farm Member and the Town End Farm Member.</P>
<P>5.12   A general relationship has been observed between rock quality
(inferred from geophysical logs and measurements on the cores) and the
identified members and formations.  An alteration zone in the Longlands Farm
Member, the Sides Farm Member (both in the Fleming Hall Formation) and the Brown
Bank Formation have been shown to be intervals characterised by lower rock
strength and higher fracture frequency relative to the other parts of the
sequence in the RCF South Shaft area.  The distribution of these rock units is
shown in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure5.5">Figure 5.5</A>.</P>
<P>5.13   The analysis of the fractures seen in the cores of BVG obtained from
the Boreholes is indicating that the orientation characteristics of the
fractures vary markedly with depth.  Structural domains have been defined in
which the fractures have similar characteristics {S/95/007}.  The boundaries
between these domains, in the majority of cases, are either lithological
boundaries or faults.</P>
<P>5.14   Some progress has been made in extrapolating the detailed geological
structure established in the RCF South Shaft area out into the PRZ.  The
geological cross-sections and serial section at the 650 metres below Ordnance
Datum ('bOD') level (Drawing Nos., 10061, 10062 and 10067 in<I> Nirex Report
SA/95/002</I> [COR/518]) demonstrate the progress being made in the
extrapolation.  The results of the 3-D seismic reflection trial survey will
further assist in extending this extrapolation across the wider PRZ area.</P>
<P><B>6.   <A NAME="GROUNDWATER">GROUNDWATER FLOW AND RADIONUCLIDE TRANSPORT</A></B></P>
<P><B>INTRODUCTION</B></P>
<P>6.1   The main way in which radionuclides can be transported away from a
repository is by flow of groundwater.  The groundwater flow through the rocks is
thus an important factor in determining the performance of a repository in terms
of its ability to limit releases of radioactivity.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.2"></A>6.2   The Nirex repository concept requires that the
geological barrier must perform two key functions.  Firstly it must ensure that
there are low flows of groundwater through the repository so that the physical
and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radioactivity.  Secondly, the geological barrier must ensure that there is
sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides released from the vaults in
order to limit concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface.</P>
<P>6.3   This section of my evidence examines the information and understanding
of groundwater flow at the site that has emerged from the investigations carried
out so far.  It presents the information that shows the groundwater flows
through the BVG are low.  It then presents the information to indicate that the
groundwater system provides dilution of any water leaving a repository located
in the BVG.  Finally, conclusions are drawn concerning the extent of our current
understanding of the groundwater system and the remaining uncertainties which
need to be addressed in the RCF.</P>
<P>6.4   The judgments that currently need to be made about aspects of the
groundwater flow system, because of inherent limitations with surface-based
investigations, are identified.</P>
<P>6.5   The evidence in this section is presented under the following
headings:</P>
<P><U>Groundwater flows.</U>  This is addressed by consideration of:</P>
<UL>
<LI>influence of fractures on groundwater flow;</LI>
<LI>characterisation of flow zones;</LI>
<LI>fracture connectivity;</LI>
<LI>groundwater heads and gradients; and</LI>
<LI>geochemistry.</LI></UL>
<P><U>Dilution.</U>  The current understanding regarding the extent to which
the groundwater system provides dilution of groundwater which may leave a
repository is reviewed; and</P>
<P><U>Remaining uncertainties.</U>  The current understanding of the
groundwater system is reviewed and the remaining geological and hydrogeological
uncertainties affecting understanding of groundwater flow are summarised. 
Conclusions are drawn as to which of these remaining uncertainties can be
addressed by further investigations from the surface and which need to be
addressed in the RCF.</P>
<P><B>I     GROUNDWATER FLOWS</B></P>
<P>6.6   Old hard rocks, such as the BVG, contain natural fractures that have
developed in response to the long history of formation, burial and the tectonic
processes to which they have been subjected.  The rock between the fractures has
a very low hydraulic conductivity (i.e. a low ability to permit water to flow
through it) and water will tend, therefore, to flow through fractures.  In order
for the fractures themselves to be able to transmit water for any distance
through the rock they must be both open and connected together.  Thus, the
existence of fractures in the rock is not, in itself, evidence that the rock
mass (intact rock plus fractures) is able to transmit water. Not all fractures
are identical and some are better able to transmit water than others: such
fractures are the flowing fractures.</P>
<P>6.7   That the BVG contains fractures can easily be seen from a cursory
examination of the rocks exposed at the surface and from examination of the
cores from the boreholes.  The first aspect of the consideration of groundwater
flow through the BVG is thus to establish the extent to which fractures have a
dominant influence on controlling groundwater flow through the rocks.  The
second is to identify which of these fractures are important as possible
pathways for groundwater flow.</P>
<P><B>Influence of Fractures on Groundwater Flow</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.8"></A>6.8   In order to establish the extent to which the
fractures in the rock have an important influence on the ability of the BVG to
transmit water, tests are carried out on blocks of rock with and without
fractures and the hydraulic conductivity of the two sets of results compared. 
If the fractures are dominating the ability of the rock to transmit water we
should expect to see that the tests on samples containing fractures yield higher
values of hydraulic conductivity than corresponding tests on samples without
fractures.  The simplest way of doing this is to test small core samples of rock
in the laboratory (because these can be seen not to contain fractures) and then
to carry out tests over lengths of many metres in boreholes having first
demonstrated from an examination of the borehole cores that such test lengths
contain fractures.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9   The way in which this was done is shown in <I>Nirex
Report 525</I>, (Figure 10, page 17) [COR/505] which shows the values of
hydraulic conductivity measured in 50 metre long sections in the Boreholes and
on small core samples in the laboratory.  The results for the BVG are summarised
in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.1">Figure 6.1</A>(a).  The field values (shown
in green) can be seen to have hydraulic conductivity values about 2 orders of
magnitude greater than the values (shown in red) obtained on small core samples
in the laboratory. The difference between these two sets of data thus indicates
the importance of fractures in determining the overall hydraulic conductivity of
the BVG.</P>
<P>6.10   Having established that the hydraulic conductivity of the BVG is
controlled by fractures, the next aspect of the investigations was to determine
whether all the fractures behave in a similar manner or whether there is a
sub-set of fractures which have the dominant influence on controlling
groundwater flow.</P>
<P>6.11   Full Sector Tests (as described in <A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA7">Table
A.7</A>, Appendix 1) are carried out in the Boreholes to identify those sections
of the borehole wall through which groundwater can be induced to flow.  This was
reported in <I>Nirex Report 525</I> [COR/505] (page 19) which described the
observation that groundwater flow in the BVG, and, to some extent in other
formations, occurred through a small subset of fractures.  It was thus shown
that the dominant influence on groundwater flow through the BVG was not the
complete set of fractures but rather this small subset of fractures.  The zones
in the boreholes through which groundwater flow can be induced are called 'flow
zones'.  Using data from the boreholes and from analysis of the rock cores,
these flow zones have been characterised.  In some cases the flow is found to
occur along one or more fractures in the rock.  These fractures are termed
'flowing fractures'.  In other cases, particularly in the Brockram and
sandstones, flow cannot be assigned to particular fractures since it may, for
example, be occurring partially or completely through the rock matrix.  In these
cases the flow zone is referred to as a 'flowing feature' {S/95/006}.</P>
<P>6.12   The importance of these flow zones in controlling the hydraulic
conductivity of the BVG can be seen from the analysis of the borehole tests
described in <A HREF="#Para6.9">Paragraph 6.9</A> above.  This was done by
comparing the hydraulic conductivity values in those sections of the boreholes
which had been shown to contain flow zones with those from sections without
identified flow zones. 
<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.1">Figure 6.1</A> (b) shows these results.  For
those sections containing flow zones (shown in green) the median value was
between 10<SUP>-8</SUP> and 10<SUP>-9</SUP> metres/second and, for those
sections without the flow zones (shown in red), the median value was between 10<SUP>-10</SUP>
and 10<SUP>-11</SUP> metres/second.  The difference in the median values of
over two orders of magnitude of hydraulic conductivity clearly shows the marked
influence of the presence of flow zones on groundwater flow in the BVG.</P>
<P>6.13   It is relevant to note that the measured values of hydraulic
conductivity reported above are similar to those predicted in 1989 in <I>PERA
</I>(Table 8.2) [COR/501] ).  Thus, the results obtained from the testing were
generally as expected.</P>
<P>6.14   The testing described above demonstrated the importance of the flow
zones and showed that the hydraulic conductivity values in the BVG in sections
of boreholes without such zones were lower than those obtained from sections
with such features.  An outstanding issue was, however, to determine what, if
any, influence the other fractures in the BVG (i.e. not flowing fractures) had
on the hydraulic conductivity of the BVG as a whole.  This was examined by
investigations carried out during 1994 to measure the hydraulic conductivity of
the rock mass remote from (as well as close to and across) the identified
flowing fractures.  This was the Short Interval Hydraulic Testing (see
<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA8">Table A.8</A> in Appendix 1).  By making measurements
over short lengths of borehole (1 to 2 metres long) flow zones are measured
separately and the hydraulic conductivity of the rock mass containing the other
fractures can be determined.  The results of this testing, which took place in
the BVG in Borehole RCF3, are shown in
<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.2">Figure 6.2</A>.  The flow zones (shown as blue
arrows) were identified from Full Sector Tests carried out prior to the Short
Interval Hydraulic Testing.  The Short Interval Hydraulic Testing indicated the
presence of two main clusters (labelled 1 and 2) and a third smaller cluster
(labelled 3) of higher values, but still with hydraulic conductivity values of
less than 1 x 10<SUP>-8</SUP> metres/second.  Unsurprisingly, these clusters
appear to be associated with the previously identified flow zones.  More
importantly, higher values from the Short Interval Hydraulic Testing are not
found between the identified flow zones.  In these sections of the borehole, the
tests gave hydraulic conductivity values of less than 1 x 10<SUP>-11</SUP>
metres/second.  The distribution of these values appears very similar to the
values obtained from the laboratory tests on core samples of unfractured BVG. 
This shows that the background fractures have little influence on the overall
hydraulic conductivity of the BVG.</P>
<P>6.15   The testing has thus indicated some important features of the BVG:</P>

<TD>the fractures in the BVG, other than the identified flowing fractures, have

very similar to the laboratory tests on unfractured BVG.</TD></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.16"></A>6.16   The results of the hydrogeological testing
described above have indicated that the BVG has a low hydraulic conductivity. 
However, because of the influence of the flowing fractures in controlling
groundwater flow and the importance of taking due regard of the ways in which
these hydrogeologically significant features form networks of connected
fractures, it is not justifiable to take measurements of hydraulic conductivity
from small scale tests in the laboratory or in the boreholes and to apply these
directly to groundwater flow models which represent the large scale system.  The
process of deriving large scale hydrogeological parameters (effective
parameters) from the testing for use in the modelling is described in <I>Nirex
95</I> [COR/522].</P>
<P><B>Characterisation of Flow Zones</B></P>
<P>6.17   Having shown the importance of the flow zones in controlling the
hydraulic conductivity of the BVG, the next important issue is to characterise
them so that they can be appropriately incorporated into groundwater flow models
of the site.  This aspect of flow zone characterisation is considered in this
sub-section of the evidence.</P>
<P>6.18   In 1993 when<I> Nirex Report 525</I> [COR/505] was published, there
was little information on the origin or nature of these flow zones, other than
that they could be identified, by testing, where they intersected a borehole. 
The Royal Society Study Group shared the Nirex view that characterisation of the
flow zones was important as the basis for defining the organisation of
groundwater pathways within the BVG.  They stated in their report <I>(The Royal
Society, Disposal of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories, November 1994 (&quot;The
Royal Society, November 1994&quot;)</I> [COR/605]  (Section 6.8, page 110):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;However, an important unresolved issue has been encountered: the
most detailed geological and hydrogeological data yet available have failed to
yield a simple relationship between the inferred pattern of fracturing in the
repository host rock, the Borrowdale Volcanics, and the organisation of
groundwater pathways.&quot;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.19   The studies so far undertaken by Nirex have characterised the flow
zones in nine boreholes within the PRZ, namely Boreholes 2, 4, 5, RCF1, RCF2,
RCF3, RCM1, RCM2 and RCM3 {S/95/006}.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.20"></A>6.20   Analysis of the flow zones in the RCF area
(defined as the area of Boreholes RCF3, RCM1 and RCM2) has indicated an
association between the occurrence of flow zones and the geological succession
of the BVG.  An interval in the Longlands Farm Member between 580 metres and 630
metres bOD was identified as containing flow zones in all three boreholes.  The
top of the Longlands Farm Member from the base of the Brockram to 500 metres bOD
and the Sides Farm Member at 670 metres bOD also showed some tendency to contain
flow zones.  The Town End Farm Member is notable in the RCF South Shaft area as
being largely unfaulted, comprising high quality rock and being almost devoid of
identified flow zones.</P>
<P>6.21   Characterisation of the flow zones in the RCF South Shaft area has
also indicated an apparent linear decrease in flow zone hydraulic conductivity
with depth {S/95/006}.</P>
<P>6.22   In total, only 154 flow zones have been identified in the boreholes
which together amounted to over 8,000 metres of drilling.  This is about 0.5% of
the total number of fractures encountered in the boreholes.  Fifty percent of
the flow zones occur in the sandstone, 8% in the Brockram and the remaining 42%
in the BVG.  Thus, only 64 flow zones have been identified in the BVG in the
area studied.</P>
<P>6.23   The analysis of these flow zones {S/95/006} has been carried out to
identify specific features responsible for the inflow of water and to
investigate the mineralogical and petrological character of these and adjacent
features seen in the borehole cores.  In particular, the mineralisation,
distribution, orientation and character of the features have been examined.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.24"></A>6.24   The minerals and fluid inclusions which occur
in the fractures provide information which can be used to interpret the time
when the fractures were created and their history in terms of further periods of
movement which may have occurred since their formation.  Stable isotope
signatures and fluid inclusion characteristics of the fracture minerals provide
an insight into the chemistry of the mineralising fluids and the conditions
under which mineralisation occurred {520} {SA/95/001}.  The investigations of
fracture mineralisation commenced with a general review of the history of
mineralisation and the establishment of a series of mineralisation episodes
which have affected the rocks at different times in their history and have
resulted in the deposition of different minerals within the fractures.  This
work was reported in 1993 {520}.  Subsequently, the studies of fracture
mineralisation have concentrated on the intervals containing flow zones
{S/95/006}.</P>
<P>6.25   These studies have enabled the establishment of a well-defined
history of fracture movement and discrete mineralisation events affecting the
site.  Nine broad but discrete mineralisation episodes (designated ME1 to ME9)
have been recognised.  These can be correlated with regional patterns of
mineralisation and diagenesis, both in the East Irish Sea Basin and in the Lake
District.  Limited potassium-argon dating of illite clay mineralisation in fault
gouge, and correlations with regional patterns of mineralisation have enabled
the periods of fracture development and mineralisation to be dated.</P>
<P>6.26   The mineralisation episodes are summarised in
<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Table6.1">Table 6.1</A>. In most cases there appears to
be no particular relationship between fracture orientation, fracture type and
mineralisation episode.  Each mineralisation episode, with the exception of ME2,
has reactivated and reutilised the pre-existing fractures and veins of earlier
episodes.  This is because the carbonate- or hematite-dominated fracture-fill is
relatively weakly bonded to adjacent wallrock and therefore the veins represent
planes of weakness, which are readily reactivated in preference to the formation
of new fractures.</P>
<P>6.27   The following conclusions have been reached from these studies of the
flow zones {S/95/006}:</P>

<P>6.28   Relating these various conclusions to the understanding of the
geological history of the site suggests that the majority of the flowing
fractures probably owe their origin to fracture movements which occurred around
the early to middle Triassic, some 200 million years ago when the ME6
mineralisation episode occurred.  These fractures probably remained as flowing
features during subsequent periods of fault movement and mineralisation.  The
last significant period of fault movement occurred around 100 million years ago
as indicated by the dating of clays in fault gouges.  The flowing fractures
appear to have remained hydraulically active subsequently as indicated by the
development of ME9 late calcite.  Such mineral precipitation, and associated
dissolution, is likely to have altered the specific characteristics of
individual fractures and may have caused some adjustments to the networks of
connected fractures over time.  However, the evidence so far supports the view
that the ME6 fracture network has provided the framework for the network of
connected fractures and that this framework has persisted for some 200 million
years.</P>
<P>6.29   Although the understanding of these important flowing fractures has
developed significantly over the last eighteen months, the understanding
concerning the physical character of these fractures is based solely on
observations and measurements made on small diameter core samples.  As noted in
<A HREF="#Para6.27viii">Paragraph 6.27 viii</A>. above the groundwater flow in
the BVG may be related more to the larger scale distribution of ME6
mineralisation in the rock mass rather than the type, orientation or intensity
of individual flowing fractures. It is therefore necessary to examine the larger
scale features using techniques other than observations and measurements on
small diameter core samples.  This has been done in the Boreholes by examining
results from hydraulic testing to provide indications of the ways in which the
flow zones may form networks of connected fractures over longer length scales. 
This issue of 'connectivity' is addressed in the next sub-section.</P>
<P><B>Fracture Connectivity</B></P>
<P>6.32   Showing that the flowing fractures have an important influence on the
hydraulic conductivity of the BVG is only the first step in determining
groundwater flows within and through the BVG.  The second, and perhaps more
important, step is to determine the way in which these flowing fractures are
connected.  If these fractures are well connected within the BVG and also
connected on through the overlying rock formations, there could be higher flows
through a repository and lower subsequent dilution than if the flowing fractures
are poorly connected both within the BVG and to the overlying formations.  These
issues are addressed in this sub-section of the evidence.</P>
<P>6.31   From analysis of the Environmental Pressure Measurements in the
Boreholes (<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA7">Table A.7</A>, Appendix 1) it was
suggested by Nirex that the flowing fractures were hydrogeologically linked,
possibly over hundreds of metres (<I>Nirex Report 525</I>, paragraph 4, page 22
[COR/505]).  However, at that time (in late 1993 and early 1994) when the
groundwater flow models which subsequently formed the basis for the safety
assessment studies reported in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522] were being developed,
there was no direct information on the form of these connections.  Judgments
were made concerning the manner in which the flowing fractures were connected to
form the extended networks through which flow predominantly occurs.</P>
<P>6.32   These judgments were used to inform the development of a
hydrogeological conceptual model.  In this model, the main flow channels in the
rocks were described as networks of connected fractures having length scales
ranging up to hundreds of metres.  This description implied a relatively high
vertical hydraulic conductivity for groundwater flow in the BVG and Basal St.
Bees Sandstone compared with conductivity implied by the rock matrix and
individual fractures.</P>
<P>6.33   The nature of the connections in the fracture systems has
subsequently been investigated through Fracture Network Testing, Cross-Hole
Hydraulic Testing and from the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test (see
<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA8">Table A.8</A> in Appendix 1 for further sources of
information on the nature of these tests).  Further information has been
obtained from the Regional Hydrogeological Surveys.
</P>
<P>6.34   Each of these programmes of testing represents 'State-of-the Art'
scientific activities incorporating numerical modelling to assist with the
design of the testing, precision monitoring of the test outputs and detailed
analysis of the test results.  The detailed interpretation of the testing has
not yet been completed.  Hence, the results presented in my evidence are
preliminary, but are presented in as much detail as possible to illustrate the
nature of the data being generated and the implications of these data.</P>
<P><U>Fracture Network Testing</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.35"></A>6.35   The Fracture Network Testing was carried out
in Borehole RCF3 and is described in <A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA8">Table A.8</A> in
Appendix 1.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.36"></A>6.36   The results are summarised in
<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.5">Figure 6.5</A>.  The diagram shows the layout
of the test sections in relation to the observed flow zones and identified
faults. The locations of the test sections are shown together with an indication
of where responses were observed in adjacent sections.  The responses in the
monitoring section are quantified as the drop in pressure in those sections as a
percentage of the drop in pressure in the test section as a result of pumping. 
Many of the sections of the hole which were tested yielded such a small flow
from the test section (shown as 'NF' on the diagram) that they did not produce
any measurable response in the adjacent sections.  The hydraulic conductivity
values are shown as derived from the short-term Environmental Pressure
Measurements.</P>
<P>6.37   Those sections of the borehole which did not generate responses in
other sections or within which responses were not generated by testing in other
sections are shown as Zone I.  Those sections in which responses were generated
by testing elsewhere but when tested themselves did not generate responses are
grouped as Zone II.  Those sections which generated responses elsewhere and
which responded to testing elsewhere are grouped as Zone III and shaded yellow. 
The fact that Zone III bands are narrow suggests that there are not extensive
connections along the length of the borehole.  If there were extensive
connections, widespread responses would have been observed.  There is also seen
to be a direct relationship between the Zone III sections and the presence of
flow zones in the borehole as shown in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.5">Figure
6.5</A>.  Areas of higher response are also seen to correspond to the clusters
of higher conductivity values obtained from the Short Interval Hydraulic
Testing.  These are shown in red in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.5">Figure 6.5</A>
and are derived from <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.1">Figure 6.1</A>. This
programme of testing thus demonstrates the direct influence of flow zones on the
ability to pump water from the fracture system, and hence recognises the
importance of these flow zones as potential pathways for groundwater flow.  It
also demonstrates the limited extent of connections in the fracture system along
the length of the borehole.  By its nature, this programme of Fracture Network
Testing cannot identify connections within the fracture system in lateral
directions away from the borehole.</P>
<P><U>Cross-Hole Hydraulic Testing in Boreholes 2 and 4</U></P>
<P>6.38   Cross-Hole Hydraulic Testing has been carried out between Boreholes 2
and 4 (<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA8">Table A.8</A> in Appendix 1).  The objective
of this testing was to characterise the flow zones within Borehole 2 and to
establish the connectivity of these both within the borehole (Borehole 2) and
with a neighbouring borehole (Borehole 4).  The programme of testing comprised
seven periods of pumping from individual sections of Borehole 2, each of which
contained identified flow zones, whilst monitoring zones above and below the
pumped section (as for the Fracture Network Testing) and whilst monitoring zones
in the adjacent Borehole 4 using the installed groundwater monitoring string. 
Boreholes 2 and 4 are approximately 120 metres apart.  The rock between
Boreholes 2 and 4 had previously been structurally characterised by cross-hole
seismic tomography.  Borehole 2 is approximately down-dip of Borehole 4.</P>
<P>6.39   The Cross-Hole Hydraulic Testing thus provided the opportunity to
examine the way in which flowing fractures might be connected on a larger scale
than was possible using the Fracture Network Testing.  It also provided the
opportunity to examine the possible coincidence of the flow zones with known
geological structures.  Unlike the Fracture Network Testing, the test sections
for the Cross-Hole Hydraulic Testing were only located in parts of the borehole
which contained identified flow zones.  Hence, some responses were observed in
all tests.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.40"></A>6.40   A summary of the results obtained from the
testing is shown in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.6">Figure 6.6</A>. This
figure shows the locations of five of the seven pumping sections.  (More
detailed results, including the data from the other two pumping sections omitted
from <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.6">Figure 6.6</A> for clarity, are shown as
Drawing No. 10090 in<I> Nirex Report SA/95/002</I> [COR/518]).   The figure
also shows the responses observed in Borehole 2 to the pumping of sections in
Borehole 2.  It confirms the pattern of responses seen in similar tests carried
out in Borehole RCF3 and shown in
<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.5">Figure 6.5</A>.  The figure also shows the
responses observed in Borehole 4 to the pumping in Borehole 2.  The geological
structure between the boreholes is derived from the results of the seismic
tomography survey and the position of main faults (Fault 1 and Fault 200) is
shown.  The diagram shows that responses from each pumping test in Borehole 2
were only seen in limited parts of Borehole 4 and that these responses did not
occur along the lines of the major faults known to extend between the two
boreholes.  This suggests that the flowing features, at least in this area, are
not synonymous with these larger faults.  It is also noted that the observed
responses from each test are confined to a limited vertical sequence of BVG. 
None of these tests show responses which are observed through the full sequence
of the BVG.  It should be noted that the responses observed in Borehole 4 were
extremely small.  Many were close to the limits of resolution of the monitoring
equipment and of a similar magnitude to the natural, short-term cyclic
fluctuations observed in the monitoring network dataset (See
<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#ParaB2.14">Paragraphs B.2.14</A> - B.2.15 in Appendix 2).</P>
<P><U>Borehole RCF3 Pump Test</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.41"></A>6.41   The Borehole RCF3 Pump Test is a programme of
tests carried out by pumping from sections of Borehole RCF3 covering each of the
three main geological units: the St. Bees Sandstone, the Brockram and the BVG. 
The responses of the groundwater system to the pumping are being monitored in
the groundwater pressure monitoring system (see <A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA11">Table
A.11</A> in Appendix 1).  At the time of preparing this evidence the testing was
still in progress and the results had not been interpreted in detail.  However,
preliminary results are presented to illustrate the nature and implications of
the data being generated.</P>
<P>6.42   Some of the results of the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test are shown in
<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.7">Figure 6.7</A>.  (This drawing is a
reproduction of part of Drawing No. 10092 in<I>Nirex Report SA/95/002 </I>[COR/518]
to which reference should be made for details of the locations of the various
pumping sections and gauges installed in the borehole).  It shows the
groundwater pressures measured at eleven locations (15 gauges) in Borehole RCF3
during the pump test.  The pressures (shown as calculated environmental heads)
in those sections of the borehole being pumped are shown, together with the
pressures measured in other sections of the borehole.  (Responses measured in
the other boreholes in the monitoring network are shown in Drawing Nos. 10111 to
10131 in<I> Nirex Report SA/95/002</I> [COR/518].)</P>
<P>6.43   The heads in the various sections of the borehole have baseline
values of around 80 metres above Ordnance Datum ('aOD').  During the Brockram
test (Jan-Feb 1995) the pumping was carried out in the section containing gauges
P9 and P10 (green lines in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.7">Figure 6.7</A>). 
In Borehole RCF3 pressure changes can be seen in both these gauges but not in
any of the other gauges.  Similarly, in the sandstone test (March 1995) gauges
P11 and P13 show the reduction in pressure in the pumped test section (red and
mid blue lines).  However, the other sections, including the recovering Brockram
Zone, show no response to this pumping.  On <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.7">Figure
6.7</A> the BVG test is still in the drawdown stage.  The responses in the
pumped sections (P3 and P4) look slightly different from the responses in the
pumped sections during the other two tests.  This is because the head in the BVG
is being kept constant for the duration of the test, rather than the flow rate
from the test section being kept constant as with the other tests.  (The pumped
section for the BVG test is at approximately 640 to 680 metres bOD.  It
coincides with Cluster 2 in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.2">Figure 6.2</A> and
with the lowermost Zone III section in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.5">Figure
6.5</A>.)</P>
<P>6.44   During the BVG tests small responses have been observed in two
sections immediately above (P5 and P6) the pumped section.  No other responses
were observed in Borehole RCF3.  A similar pattern of responses is observed in
other boreholes in the monitoring network (See Drawing Nos. 10111 - 10131 in<I>Nirex
Report SA/95/002</I> [COR/518]).</P>
<P>6.45   A provisional conclusion from the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test is that
there appears to be little connection between the BVG and the overlying
sandstones.</P>
<P><U>Observations from Regional Hydrogeological Studies</U></P>
<P>6.46   The groundwater at depth in the BVG is saline and warmer than the
near surface freshwater.  The temperature differential arises from the natural
geothermal gradient.  Hence, the presence of deeper groundwaters at the surface,
which could indicate the existence of connected pathways from depth through
which flow was occurring, would be indicated by the presence of saline and/or
warm waters at the surface.  (This same principle is used in the Full Sector
Tests to identify flow zones in Boreholes.)  This issue has been examined by
consideration of the variations in near-surface groundwater chemistry and
temperature.  (See Drawing Nos. 10097 - 10102 and 10206 - 10209 in<I> Nirex
Report SA/95/002</I> for the chemistry data [COR/518].)</P>
<P>6.47   There is no evidence from these regional hydrogeological studies for
the existence of direct natural connections from depth to the surface through
which deep groundwater is flowing.</P>
<P><B>Groundwater Heads and Gradients</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.48"></A>6.48   At its simplest level, groundwater will only
flow if there is a head gradient.  (There are other processes, such as
diffusion, which can produce slow movement of groundwater, but these processes
are much less significant than pressure induced flow.)  The measurement of the
heads thus forms an important part of the characterisation of the site.</P>
<P>6.49   The information on groundwater heads at the time <I>Nirex Report 525</I>
[COR/505] was published was restricted to that derived from interpretation of
short-term Environmental Pressure Measurements in which data from an 8 or 16
hour test was used to extrapolate the in situ pressure.  Referring to this, <I>Nirex
Report 524</I>, (Volume 3, Section 4.4.2, page 4-4) [COR/517] made the following
statements:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The value of in situ pressure is therefore an interpretation of a
dataset, it is not strictly a measurement or observation......During the
pressure recovery period, high conductivity intervals recover to much closer to
their in situ pressure than low conductivity intervals.  The degree of
extrapolation for high conductivity intervals is consequently much less.  In
addition, the shape of the pressure recovery plot in low conductivity sections
may be affected by pressure and temperature disturbances caused by the drilling
process.&quot;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.50   It was also noted in <I>Nirex Report 525</I> (Section 3.4, page 17)
[COR/505] that the deep groundwater was saline and that it was therefore
necessary to calculate 'environmental heads' to determine the potential for
vertical flow.  This stated:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The groundwater at depth within the BVG is saline.....Saline water
is more dense than fresh water and so, in order to assess the possible driving
force for a vertical component of flow, the measured groundwater pressure must
be converted to 'environmental' heads which take account of the influence of
varying density. &quot;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.51   The results from this monitoring network that is now established and
operational have provided data recorded continuously over many months (Drawing
Nos. 10111 to 10131 in<I> Nirex Report SA/95/002</I> [COR/518]).  These
measurements have thus allowed for the groundwater system to settle down and
recover from the effects of drilling and testing (see Appendix 2, Section B.2).</P>
<P>6.52   The current understanding of the distribution of groundwater heads at
the Site is described in the following paragraphs.</P>
<P><U>Vertical Head Profiles</U></P>
<P>6.53   In general, there is a good agreement between the pressures and heads
derived by long-term monitoring and those from Environmental Pressure
Measurements carried out during drilling.  There is some evidence, derived from
interpretation of the Environmental Pressure Measurements, particularly in
Boreholes 2 and 4, for local small scale variations in heads attributable to
borehole history and pumping activities.  It is possible that many of the minor
variations apparent in the data from the short-term hydrogeological testing
could have similar causes.  The data from the long-term monitoring provides a
means of developing confidence that the recorded pressures and calculated heads
are free from perturbations caused by drilling or testing (See Appendix 2).</P>
<P>6.54   The general features of the groundwater head profile in the RCF area
of the PRZ are illustrated in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.8">Figure 6.8</A>. 
This figure is derived from the long-term monitoring data for six boreholes.  It
shows how the environmental head varies with depth in the boreholes.  Three
distinct zones with different characteristics can be identified and are labelled
Zones 1, 2 and 3.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.55"></A>6.55   In Zone 1 an upward gradient of about 12
metres head change in 170 metres depth of borehole (i.e. about 7%) is found
above about 170 metres bOD.  This contrasts with Borehole 8 (not shown in
<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.8">Figure 6.8</A>) in which a 5% downward
gradient is apparent in the upper 150 metres of the St Bees Sandstone.  This
overall pattern suggests that the upper 150 to 200 metres of the Sherwood
Sandstone Group is an active aquifer system receiving recharge in the higher
ground (Borehole 8) and containing coastward and upward moving freshwater for
much of the area where ground level is below about 100 metres aOD.  This may
locally give rise to artesian flow in areas of depressed topography (e.g.
Holmrook 13 Borehole).</P>
<P>6.56   <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.8">Figure 6.8</A> shows that from
about 170 metres bOD to the base of the Permo-Triassic rocks, little or no
vertical gradient is apparent.  In the area covered by the Boreholes shown in
<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.8">Figure 6.8</A> this absence of vertical
gradient continues down through the upper 400 metres or so of the BVG.  In some
other Boreholes, for example Boreholes 2, 4 and 5, the top of Zone 2 is somewhat
deeper and appears to coincide with the top of the Brockram.  This pattern
suggests that, over much of the PRZ, there is little or no head gradient to
drive vertical flow in the upper portion of the BVG and that in some areas, this
pattern extends through the Brockram and up into the Sherwood Sandstone Group.</P>
<P>6.57   In Zone 3 <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.8">Figure 6.8</A> shows that
at depth within the BVG an increase in environmental head occurs.  In
<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.8">Figure 6.8</A> the boundary between Zones 2
and 3 is shown at 800 metres bOD.  The level of this boundary is not precisely
defined but it appears to lie between about 750 metres bOD and 900 metres bOD in
the area of these boreholes.</P>
<P><U>Regional Head Distributions</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.58"></A>6.58   Freshwater heads calculated from the borehole
monitoring data are used to indicate whether there is a gradient which might
give rise to components of flow in the horizontal direction.  The results
indicate a consistent pattern of head gradients towards the coast.</P>
<P>6.59   The gradient, which is regionally between 2 and 4% and locally up to
7% (in the PRZ), appears to be topographically related and is consistent
regardless of the stratigraphy.  Over areas covered by data, there appears to be
no potential for the landward ingress of groundwater at levels between 100
metres and 800 metres bOD.  Beneath this depth, data are limited but suggest
that near the coast there may be a gradient in the opposite direction, i.e.
towards the land.</P>
<P><B>Geochemistry</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.60"></A>6.60   The geochemical characteristics of the water
provide information on how the groundwater system has evolved over time,
including providing evidence of past groundwater flow directions and mixing
processes which are occurring within the system. The interpretation of
groundwater flow and mixing processes that arise from the geochemical studies
thus provide independent evidence that can be compared with the predictions of
groundwater flow derived from consideration of the physical charateristics of
hydraulic conductivity and head.</P>
<P>6.61   The scope of the geochemical studies in terms of the range of
analyses carried out has been described in <A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#ParaA8.1">Paragraphs
A.8.1</A> to A.8.4 and in Table A.9 in Appendix 1.  The manner in which chemical
tracers are used to correct for drill-fluid contamination has been described in
<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#ParaA4.4">Paragraphs A.4.4</A> to A.4.5 in Appendix 1 and
the extent to which the baseline geochemistry has been established has been
reviewed in Section B.3 of Appendix 2.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.62"></A>6.62   Nirex Report 525 identified three groundwater
regimes (Shown in Figure 13 of<I> Nirex Report 525</I> [COR/505]).  These were:</P>

<P>6.63   A detailed update of the hydrochemistry (i.e. the geochemistry of the
water) of Sellafield, was published by Nirex in July 1995 {S/95/008}.  This
report focused on interpreting the greatly increased amounts of data that have
become available since Nirex published the last interpretation of the
geochemistry in 1993 in <I>Nirex Report 524</I>, (Volume 3, Section 3)
[COR/517].</P>
<P>6.64   The newly available data are broadly consistent with the overall
interpretation presented in 1993 (<I>Nirex Report 524,</I> Volume 3, Section 3
[COR/517]) even though there is now some 2.5 times the volume of data available
as compared to 1993.  Thus, the interpretation has confirmed that there appear
to be the three major groundwater regimes identifiable across the site,
correlating with distinct components to the groundwater salinity.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.65"></A>6.65   However, the recent data have also indicated
that the freshwater can be subdivided into two types distinguished on the basis
of the stable oxygen isotope data {S/95/008}.  This newly identified type occurs
locally beneath the Coastal Plain Regime where the freshwater, on the basis of
the measured stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes, is different from the shallow
freshwater.  This is clearly shown by the additional data, ringed in yellow on
the lower part of
<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#FigB32">Figure B.3.2</A> (Appendix 2) derived from 1995
data, which was not present in the earlier 1993 data.  It is believed that this
deeper water was recharged under colder climate conditions than currently
exists, possibly during the Pleistocene.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.66"></A>6.66   The recognition of this fourth component, and
the way in which it has enabled all the groundwater compositions so far observed
at the site to be attributed to mixing between the four identified components,
represents a significant advance in the understanding of the geochemistry of the
Site.  This is because it provides confidence that the pattern of groundwater
type distribution has been revealed and that there are no longer any observed
compositions that cannot be explained in terms of well defined mixing
relationships.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.67"></A>6.67   The saline transition zone, which marks the
interface between the fresh water above and the saline water below, is
relatively sharp in the PRZ and generally occurs in the Brockram and basal
sandstones.  To the south and west of the PRZ the saline transition zone is more
diffuse.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.68"></A>6.68   A good indicator of the rate of groundwater
flow through the system is provided by the length of time that the water has
been resident in the ground.  Information can also be obtained for the residence
time of the solutes dissolved in the water.  (See
<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Table6.2">Table 6.2</A> for a description of the
geochemical indicators of groundwater residence times.)  The best evidence for
residence times for water and solutes in the BVG in the PRZ comes from stable
isotopes and chlorine-36 data respectively.  The stable isotopes (oxygen and
hydrogen) together with data from analysis of the noble gases in the water,
indicate the water has been recharged (entered the ground) under colder climate
conditions, during the Pleistocene (up to 1.6 million years ago).  The
chlorine-36 data indicate that the chloride in the water in the BVG in the PRZ
has had a long residence time, possibly over 1.5 million years.  Preliminary
helium data also indicate long residence times of similar magnitudes.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.69"></A>6.69   The latest interpretation of the geochemical
data is thus indicating:</P>

<P>6.72   The evidence of low groundwater flows in the BVG has been presented
above.  It remains therefore to consider the evidence for the presence of high
flows in the sandstones.</P>
<P>6.73   This evidence, again, comes from a variety of sources, as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER" ALIGN="LEFT">

<TD WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD>the hydrogeological data, supported by the geochemical results, has led to
the identification of a shallow, freshwater regime (Coastal Plain Regime) in
which the water has been shown to be chemically distinct from the deeper

groundwaters shown to exist at depth (<A HREF="#Para6.62">Paragraph 6.62</A>).</TD></TR>

freshwater flow system exists in the upper part of the Sherwood Sandstone Group

<P><B>III     REMAINING UNCERTAINTIES</B></P>
<P><B>Understanding and Prediction of Groundwater System</B></P>
<P>6.74   Nirex recognises the importance of the groundwater flow regime being
well understood and predictable (<I>PERA,</I> paragraph 6.3.1 [COR/501]).</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.75"></A>6.75   The extensive programme of investigations is
indicating a consistent pattern of groundwater conditions.  The  description of
the basic three groundwater regimes, comprising deep brine, deep saline water
and shallow freshwater, have remained essentially unchanged from an early stage
in the investigations.  In 1992, on this basis of only a limited reconnaissance
of the site, the three-regime system was identified in schematic form in <I>Nirex
Report 268 Sellafield Hydrogeology, August 1992 (&quot;Nirex Report 268&quot;)</I>
(Figure 3.3) [COR/521].  The regimes were described in more detail in 1993
(Figure 13 of<I> Nirex Report 525</I> [COR/505]).  It was noted that
information from the determination of groundwater chemistry was helping to
confirm the pattern of groundwater flow indicated independently by the
information on the groundwater pressures and hydraulic conductivity.  Finally,
as summarised in <A HREF="#Para6.60">Paragraphs 6.60</A> - 6.69 of my evidence,
the current interpretation of the groundwater regimes remains essentially
unchanged despite the substantial increase in the amount of available data from
the site.</P>
<P>6.76   Nirex has designed its investigations to take due account of the
features of the site to provide confidence that the significant ones are
recognised and characterised.  Care is taken to avoid undue reliance on any
single technique in the interpretation of the ground conditions.  This means
that significant features and characteristics of the site are invariably
investigated using a range of independent techniques. This provides assurance
that these significant features and characteristics are determined with
confidence.  An example quoted earlier in this section (<A HREF="#Para6.69">Paragraph
6.69</A>) was the use of four independent analyses, all of which gave consistent
results, for the estimation of residence times for groundwater and solutes. 
Another example is the conclusion of low groundwater flow through a small
sub-set of fractures in the BVG which is based on independent observations
arising from Full Sector Tests, flow zone characterisation, mineralogical
studies, Short Interval Hydraulic Testing, Fracture Network Testing and the
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test.</P>
<P>6.77   The level of detail with which it is now possible to describe the
features of the site shows that a high level of understanding of the groundwater
conditions has been developed. The basic nature of the groundwater flow system
has been established, but uncertainties remain to be addressed in respect of the
quantification of flows.</P>
<P>6.78   The prognosis of the site conditions, as presented by Nirex in 1989
when the decision was taken to investigate Sellafield (<I>PERA,</I> Section 8
[COR/501]), has been confirmed.  As new data are obtained they are fitting into
place with previous views about the site that had relied more heavily on
judgment.</P>
<P>6.79   The extent to which the groundwater flow regimes can be described
using mathematical models is a further aspect related to understanding and
predictability.  However, it is not adequate simply to be able to describe the
groundwater flow system using mathematical models.  It is important that the
model predictions are compared with independent field observations and
experimental measurements.  This is the principle of validation described in Dr
Holmes' evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>, <A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para5.8">Paragraphs
5.8</A> - 5.9).</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.80"></A>6.80   As recognised by Nirex in 1993, some of the
initial groundwater flow models were unable fully to reproduce certain aspects
of the independent field measurements (<I>Nirex Report 524, </I>Volume 3, page
8-5 [COR/517] and <I>Nirex Report 525</I>, page 22 [COR/505])</P>
<P>6.81   Some improvement in the match between models and independent
observations is being noted in the new models published in <I>Nirex 95</I>
[COR/522].  However, there are still some differences between the calculated and
observed salinities and heads.</P>
<P>6.82   The characteristics of the networks of connected fractures in the
ground can only be established by direct measurements of the rock in three
dimensions on length scales sufficient to cover the intersections and
connections of the real fractures.  This cannot be achieved without direct
access to the rocks underground from the RCF.</P>
<P><B>Summary of Remaining Uncertainties affecting Groundwater Flow</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.83"></A>6.83   A considerable amount of information and
understanding exists regarding the site and issues related to groundwater flow. 
However, as I have identified, there are some remaining uncertainties which
currently limit confidence in the assessments of post-closure performance needed
to enable a decision to be taken on whether or not Nirex should propose
development of a repository.</P>
<P>6.84   Some of these remaining uncertainties can be addressed from continued
surface-based investigation; others can be addressed in the laboratory.  These
are listed in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Table6.3">Table 6.3</A> (a).</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.85"></A>6.85   However, although the investigations carried
out so far have provided a considerable amount of understanding about the nature
and distribution of the flow zones in the Boreholes, there remains uncertainty
regarding the conceptual models which we need to develop to describe the way in
which these fractures form networks of connected fractures through which
groundwater flows.  This is because we cannot directly observe or characterise
these networks using boreholes from the surface even though we can infer some
information about them from the hydrogeological testing we have carried out.</P>
<P>6.86   Investigations from the surface are thus not able fully to address
the remaining uncertainties due to the inherent limitations of such measurements
made in Boreholes.  In particular:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER" ALIGN="LEFT">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD>the Boreholes are only able to sample the rock over a limited volume
defined by the length (or depth) of the hole and its diameter.  Many features,
such as fractures are thus inadequately sampled.  It is known that many of the
fractures observed in the rocks at the surface have lengths often measured in
metres.  The Boreholes are thus unable to provide any substantial information
about the variability of fractures at the length scales approaching the lengths
of individual fractures; and</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>ii.</TD>
<TD>although the presence of flow zones can be recognised in Boreholes, and the
behaviour of the networks of connected fractures examined by hydrogeological
tests (such as the Cross-Hole Hydraulic Testing and the Borehole RCF3 Pump
Test), the opportunity does not exist for studying and characterising the flow
zones themselves, except at the specific location where they happen to have been
intercepted by the borehole.  No direct evidence can thus be obtained about
their spatial variability and length, and the way they are connected except at
the scale of the borehole sample.</TD></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.87"></A>6.87   The RCF will allow these remaining
uncertainties to be addressed because it will allow the flow zones and the ways
in which they form networks of connected fractures to be directly observed and
characterised in the excavations created as shafts and galleries.  These will
provide observations at length scales very much longer than those provided by
the borehole cores.  They will also permit the networks of connected fractures
to be observed and characterised in three dimensions by permitting access to
them both through excavations and through the drilling of short, closely
targeted boreholes drilled from the underground excavations.  Through testing
and monitoring utilising closely spaced and targeted boreholes we will be able
to obtain a much more detailed and comprehensive understanding of these networks
of connected fractures than is possible using deep boreholes from the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.88"></A>6.88   It was noted in <A HREF="#Para6.40">Paragraph
6.40</A> that many of the responses observed in the Cross-Hole Hydraulic Testing
were extremely small and that many were close to the limits of resolution of the
monitoring equipment and of a similar magnitude to the natural short-term cyclic
fluctuations observed in the monitoring network dataset.  These small responses
were observed from the effects of drawdowns induced in Borehole 2 of between 100
and 200 metres in head. The drawdowns (reductions in groundwater pressures)
induced by the construction of the RCF will be significantly greater (up to 1000
metres) than those which will have been induced on the groundwater system by the
existing hydrogeological testing.  Such drawdowns will tend to reveal the
presence of any connections which exist between the BVG and the overlying
sandstones by inducing flow from the sandstones through the Brockram and into
the BVG which will be detected by the instrumentation network already installed
around the RCF shaft site (<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA11">Table A.11</A> in
Appendix 1).</P>
<P><B>7.   <A NAME="NATURAL">NATURAL AND INDUCED CHANGES TO THE GEOLOGICAL
BARRIER</A></B></P>
<P>7.1   It is important to be able to demonstrate that future changes, which
may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not create new
pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to the
engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair their
ability to retain radioactivity.</P>
<P><B>Natural Changes</B></P>
<P>Approach</P>
<P>7.2   A geological principle which guides much of the thinking on geological
change is that of uniformitarianism: that the present can be used to interpret
the past.  This principle leads directly to the concept that processes operating
at present and in the past will operate in the future, and produce similar
results over the timescales of interest to repository safety assessment studies.
</P>
<P>7.3   The current approach being adopted by Nirex is to concentrate efforts
on observing the effects on the system of past geological and climatic changes. 
This approach is supported by the <I>Nirex Review Panel</I> <I>Annual Report,
1994 </I>(section 3.1.1 (b), page 4) [COR/516], which states:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The approach adopted by Nirex, whereby current efforts are

<P>7.4   A wide range of geological, hydrogeological and geochemical studies
are being undertaken to develop an understanding of the long-term evolution of
the site as a guide to potential future changes.  The major components of these
studies are:</P>

<P>7.5   Tectonic and climatic processes are likely to affect any site in the
UK over the time periods we need to consider.  The issue is therefore one of
establishing a rational basis for estimating the impact of these changes so that
they can be given appropriate recognition in the assessment of the post-closure
performance of a repository.</P>
<P>Age of Faulting</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.6"></A>7.6   Traditionally, fault movements were dated
indirectly by determining the ages of rocks offset by the faults and the ages of
undisturbed, cross-cutting (e.g. dykes or mineral veins) or overlying strata. 
In recent years, a growing number of techniques have been applied to enable
direct dating of fault rocks using a similar approach to that adopted for dating
the fracture mineralisation (<A HREF="#Para6.24">Paragraphs 6.24</A> - 6.25).</P>
<P>7.7   Using these new techniques, two groups of fault rocks have been dated,
namely:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER" ALIGN="LEFT">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD> three samples from Fault 200 encountered in Boreholes 2 and 4; and</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD></TD>
<TD>ii.</TD>
<TD>three samples from Borehole 3 and 4 which shared many features but were
markedly different from the first group.</TD></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8   The samples from the first group gave ages for the fault wall rock
ranging from 255 to 315 million years.  Fault gouge samples were dated at
between 118 and 146 million years and were considered to represent minimum ages
for fault activation and reactivation along different planes in the same fault
zone.</P>
<P>7.9   An authigenic illite clay in the second group gave a minimum age of
212 million years, possibly representing a period of enhanced tectonic activity
during the opening of the East Irish Sea Basin in the Triassic.  The minimum age
of authigenic illite-smectite clay also in the second group was estimated to be
60 million years.  This is not thought to be related to a faulting episode, but
may be due to a thermal event at that time in the Tertiary (See
<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>).</P>
<P>7.10   Dating of the fault rocks and studies of the fracture mineralisation,
including that associated with the flow zones, thus supports the view that the
last major episode of faulting occurred over 100 million years ago and that the
network of flowing fractures has probably persisted in the rocks for around 200
million years.  This is not to say that younger fault movements have definitely
not occurred.  Indeed, geological evidence from surrounding parts of the UK
suggest movements may well have continued into the Tertiary and beyond. 
However, we see no evidence that these younger movements, if they have affected
the Sellafield rocks, have caused significant changes to the rocks relevant to
the potential of the site to host a repository.  Investigations are required in
the RCF to examine the rocks at depth for evidence of recent changes, although I
do not expect to observe any significant features.</P>
<P>Impacts of Glaciation</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.11"></A>7.11   During the latter part of the Quaternary, the
British Isles have been glaciated on several occasions.  About ten more
glaciations of comparable extent are anticipated in the next million years. 
<I>The Royal Society, November 1994</I> (Section 10.1.3 (i), page 156)
[COR/605] stated:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Over the next 10,000 - 100,000 years it is very probable that
global climate will change so as to produce glacial or periglacial conditions in
the UK, with a lowering of sea level and a major impact on the biosphere. &quot;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.12   The results of the Quaternary Characterisation studies available so

<TD></TD>
<TD>ii.</TD>
<TD>the Quaternary sediments show evidence of dislocations associated with ice
movement (glacitectonic structures).  However, despite extensive searching using
remote sensing and high resolution seismic surveys, no evidence has been found
of tectonic faults having involved both the bedrock and the Quaternary deposits
themselves.</TD></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.13   The palaeohydrogeological aspects of the geochemical studies (<A
HREF="#Para6.65">Paragraph 6.65</A>) have indicated that the deeper freshwater
component was possibly recharged in a cold (glacial or periglacial) phase of the
Pleistocene, with the shallower component being recharged since that time. 
However, no evidence has been found to indicate that there has been extensive
flushing of the water from depth during the last glaciation (10,000 to 26,000
years ago) since the chlorine-36 and helium data have indicated residence times
for solutes in the order of 1.5 million years.</P>
<P>Earthquakes</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.14"></A>7.14   This section examines the occurrence of
earthquakes in the UK and in the area around Sellafield.  On the basis of the
effects they have produced, it concludes that, although there is some level of
earthquake activity in the area around Sellafield, earthquakes are not expected
to have a significant effect on the physical stability of the site in terms of
its potential to host a repository.</P>
<P>7.15   Whilst it is important to take due consideration of earthquakes in
the assessment of the site, it is equally important to keep such studies in
perspective.  The <I>Nirex Review Panel Annual Report</I>, 1994 (Section 3.1.1
(a), page 4) [COR/516] stated:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The Panel holds the view that earthquakes are unlikely to be a
major threat to the performance of the Sellafield site.  However, because no
area of Britain may be considered totally immune, Nirex should maintain a
balanced view and focus on establishing whether the site is robust to the
effects of earthquakes.  This is best achieved through a consideration of the
geological record, and details of historical seismicity&quot;.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.16   Nirex have collated a considerable amount of data relevant to the
seismicity of the area around Sellafield through the site characterisation
programme and seismicity studies.  Work is continuing in all areas of study.</P>
<P>7.17   International safety guidelines relevant to the siting of nuclear
facilities are used as the basis for the Nirex studies on seismicity of the
Sellafield site.  <I>IAEA Safety Standards No 99, Safety principles and

<P>7.20   <I>The Royal Society, November 1994</I> [COR/605] (Paragraph 10.1.2,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The mainland of the UK is not close to an active plate boundary
and the evidence from the historical record of the last few hundred years shows
that it has been subject to only moderate or small earthquakes (up to about
magnitude 5.5) in that time.  However, on the timescale of interest to Nirex's
post-closure assessment this may not always be the case.  Infrequent earthquakes
with magnitudes exceeding 6.0 do occur in the interior of plates away from their
boundaries, and some of these may be associated with the loading and unloading
of ice caps that accompany climatic change.  The effects of earthquakes on a
potential repository site therefore need to be considered. &quot;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para7.21"></A>7.21   Nirex has initiated studies to evaluate the
nature of the tectonic and seismic disturbance which could affect a repository
at Sellafield.  The methodology for these studies is in accordance with <I>IAEA
Safety Series 50-SG-S1, Earthquakes and Associated Topics in relation to Nuclear
Power Plant siting, A safety Guide, Vienna, 1991</I> [GOV/508].</P>
<P>7.22   The geological structure interpreted from the extensive site
investigation studies has identified the main faults within the area around
Sellafield.  The identification of faults is important because earthquakes of
significant size generally occur on already-existing faults.  The identified
faults are being characterised and, as described in <A HREF="#Para7.6">Paragraphs
7.6</A> - 7.10, studies to date support the view that the last major episode of
faulting occurred over 100 million years ago.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.23"></A>7.23   A seismological database has been assembled
for the Sellafield area {SA/95/003}, which is based upon historical records and
instrumentally recorded earthquakes.  The 1786 Whitehaven earthquake of
magnitude 4.7MSA (MSA is the surface wave magnitude assessed from a
consideration of the felt area of the earthquake {SA/95/003}) is the most
significant earthquake for which records exist in the Sellafield area.  Over the
last four centuries, at least fifteen earthquakes would have been felt around
the Sellafield site although there is nothing in the historical and instrumental
records to indicate that any comparable event has occurred near the site since
1786 (See Drawing Nos. 10106 to 10108 in<I> Nirex Report SA/95/002</I>
[COR/518]).</P>
<P>7.24   Although it was not felt at Sellafield, the 1865 earthquake at
Rampside near Barrow is the most damaging earthquake that appears to have
occurred in West Cumbria.  It was of low magnitude (3.0 MSA) but near surface
(probably less than 1 km) and therefore generated relatively high intensities
(VII - VIII) over a small area.  The earthquake is believed to be unique among
British earthquakes in that it caused liquefaction of beach sands with the
expulsion of water.  There is no reason to suppose that any effects on deep
groundwater were involved that would be relevant to the assessment of repository
performance.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.25"></A>7.25   Nevertheless, Nirex is examining the risk
associated with hydrogeological changes due to seismicity. Palaeohydrogeological
studies of the fracture network will provide evidence on how the minerals and
their fluid inclusions in the fracture system have evolved.  Such studies do,
however, require access to the fracture system to provide samples of fault and
fracture infill material.  To characterise the faults and fractures and to
permit suitable and representative sample locations to be selected requires
access to the rock mass at depth.  This can only be provided in the RCF.  The
groundwater monitoring system, together with the Sellafield seismic network and
the acoustic monitoring equipment, will provide evidence as to whether changes
to the groundwater system occur in association with earthquakes recorded in the
local area.  As discussed in <A HREF="#Para6.71">Paragraphs 6.71</A> - 6.73,
the groundwater system at the Sellafield site provides dilution in the
sandstones for any water released from the BVG.  Hence, even if some deep water
was released in an earthquake this water would be subject to dilution in the
sandstones before reaching the surface.</P>

<P>7.32   Item i. has so far been addressed through the examination of the
fractures using boreholes drilled from the surface.  This technique is
restricted to locations where a borehole happens to encounter a significant
feature and limited to the size of the core sample (approximately 100 mm
diameter).  The RCF will permit significant fractures, once encountered, to be
examined in detail in three dimensions through a combination of excavation and
targeted drilling.  In this way information on such issues as length,
continuity, connectivity, orientation and variability in three dimensions can be
explored.</P>
<P>7.33   Measurements of excavation disturbance are required (to address item

disturbance are valid for the BVG.  These measurements can only be made in an

<P>7.34   Other matters that remain to be addressed are the continuing
monitoring of earthquakes and acoustic emission from the rocks and investigation
of the Quaternary deposits.  These can adequately be addressed using

<P><B>8.   <A NAME="DESIGN">DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE REPOSITORY</A></B></P>
<P><B>Introduction</B></P>
<P>If a repository is constructed at the site, decisions will be needed to
select the depth, location, layout and orientation of the repository vaults. 
This selection will be influenced by the nature, distribution and dimensions of
potentially important structures, such as flow zones, within the rock mass that
could control rock quality or groundwater flow.  This section of my evidence
explains the current understanding of these features and identifies the
remaining uncertainties which need to be addressed.</P>
<P><B>Geological and Hydrogeological Factors Influencing Repository Depth,
Location, Layout and Orientation</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.2"></A>8.2   The BVG was identified as the potential
repository host rock.  The position of the top of the BVG was, and is, defined
by the contours on the top of the Basement (See Drawing No. 10054 in<I> Nirex
Report SA/95/002</I> [COR/518]).</P>
<P>8.3   The initial results from Boreholes 2, 4 and 5 suggested the
possibility of slightly elevated hydraulic conductivity in the upper 100 metres
of the BVG.  (EPM 9 in Borehole 2, EPM 6 and 7 in Borehole 4 and EPM 9 in
Borehole 5: Drawing Nos. 10133, 10135 and 10136 in<I> Nirex Report SA/95/002</I>
[COR/518]).  This supported a previously developed view that a repository should
be located with at least 100 metres of BVG cover.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.4"></A>8.4   The top surface of the BVG falls in elevation
towards the west (<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure5.2">Figures 5.2</A> and
<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure5.3">5.3</A>).  Hence, in order to maintain the
nominal 100 metre cover of BVG over a repository, as the repository is moved
progressively west it would have to become deeper.  The measured rock stresses
show a linear increase with depth (<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA13">Table A.13</A> in
Appendix 1), the temperature increases with depth (20&#183;C at 500 metres
depth, thereafter increasing at 25&#183;C per 1000 metres) and the extent of the
excavation disturbance likely to develop around a repository is likely to
increase with depth. Construction costs will also tend to increase with depth,
partly because of the ground conditions and partly because of increased cost of
access (deeper shafts and/or longer access drifts).  Taking these factors into
account, the maximum depth for a repository was taken, for planning purposes, as
1000 metres below ground level, which approximated to 900 metres bOD.</P>
<P>8.5   To provide the nominal 100 metres of BVG cover above a repository, the
western limit of a potential repository location is thus defined by the 800
metres bOD contour on the top surface of the BVG (See Drawing No. 10054 in<I>Nirex
Report SA/95/002</I> [COR/518]).</P>
<P>8.6   The 800 metre bOD contour on the top of the BVG is approximately
coincident with the Fleming Hall Fault.  This is not only a large fault, with a
trace length of 4 km and a maximum throw (at base Permo-Triassic) of 355 metres,
but it also forms the eastern limit of the Carboniferous Limestone.  The
Carboniferous Limestone generally has a higher hydraulic conductivity than the
BVG (median value is 5 x 10-8 metres/second) and there is evidence from the
borehole core samples that the formation shows enhancement of hydraulic
conductivity by solution processes along fractures (<I>Nirex Report 524, </I>Volume
3, section 2.3.6, pages 2-10 [COR/517]).  There is also the known potential of
the Carboniferous Limestone to contain iron ore bodies.  The decision was
therefore taken to avoid the repository being located close to the Carboniferous
Limestone.  This factor thus defines the westward and northward extent of the
PRZ.</P>
<P>8.7   To the south-east of the Site area the Seascale Fault Zone occurs. 
This is a major east-south-east trending structure comprising a number of
individual faults.  Displacements measured at the base of the Permo-Triassic
range up to 170 m across an individual fault with the overall throw across the
fault zone in excess of 350 metres.</P>
<P>8.8   The current hydrogeological modelling (<I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522])
assumes that both the Fleming Hall and Seascale Fault Zones are significant
hydrogeological features with enhanced hydraulic conductivity associated with
them.  This supports the previous decision that a repository should avoid being
positioned immediately adjacent to these two fault zones.</P>
<P>8.9   Thus the position of possible locations for a repository in plan is
defined by the extent of the Carboniferous Limestone to the north, by the
Fleming Hall fault to the west and by the Seascale Fault to the south.  The
eastern limit is defined on environmental grounds by the boundary of the Lake
District National Park.  The boundary of the PRZ as now defined has been refined
in detail to reflect current land ownership, but remains essentially as defined
above on geological and hydrogeological grounds.</P>
<P>8.10   Having set the above constraints on the margins  of the PRZ, the top
of the BVG is noted to be at approximately 550 metres bOD in the southern corner
of the PRZ.  Thus, still maintaining the concept of a normal 100 metres of BVG
over a repository, the nominal highest level of a repository is 650 metres bOD. 
As explained in <A HREF="#Para8.4">Paragraph 8.4</A> above, the nominal lowest
level is 900 metres bOD.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.11"></A>8.11  Studies are continuing to select a preferred
position for a repository within the PRZ.  Geotechnical modelling {NGI Reports
931005-031 and 931005-51} has enabled some understanding to be gained on the
likely sensitivity of the behaviour of repository vaults to variations in depth,
layout and orientation of the repository in relation to variations in rock
quality.  As noted in <A HREF="#Para7.30">Paragraph 7.30</A>, there are
uncertainties related to this modelling in terms of validating the input
parameters for the rock mass and the outputs from the models in relation to the
actual behaviour of the BVG.</P>
<P>8.12   The investigations have indicated (<A HREF="#Para5.6">Paragraphs 5.6</A>
- 5.14 and <A HREF="#Para6.20">6.20</A> - 6.21) that the properties of the BVG
are variable.  Particular characteristics which are emerging are:</P>

<TD>the orientation characteristics of the fractures vary with depth and across
the PRZ.  Structural domains have been identified in which the fractures have

<P><A NAME="Para8.13"></A>8.13   A three-dimensional representational model of
the PRZ rock mass is currently being developed.  This incorporates interpreted
geological, hydrogeological, geotechnical and geochemical data to provide a
detailed description of the PRZ.  It takes as its basis the current geological
model of the PRZ which has, in turn, been developed from the integration of
borehole data, cross-hole seismic tomography surveys, seismic reflection surveys
and potential field data {S/95/005}.  Further refinement to the model will be
possible on completion of the interpretation of the trial 3-D seismic survey
carried out in 1994.</P>
<P>8.14   The model is inevitably based on partial data.  However, by taking
due regard of the uncertainties inherent in the model and by testing the various
alternative interpretations against independent measurements, confidence can be
built that the model is an adequate representation of reality.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.15"></A>8.15   The current model of the site incorporates a
number of judgments that cannot be adequately tested using data obtained from
the surface.  Of these, the most important relates to the nature and arrangement
of networks of connected flowing fractures in the rock.  Their distribution
within the rock mass and the extent to which they may be intersected by
repository vaults, and hence the extent to which it might be possible to locate
vaults to limit the intersections between these networks of connected fractures
and the repository vaults are further important considerations.</P>
<P>8.16   The model will be tested against direct measurements in the RCF. 
Initially, the RCF will test the model in the area of the shafts. 
Progressively, as galleries are driven out from the shafts and peripheral
drilling carried out, the model will be tested in the wider PRZ.  The rate at
which confidence will be built in the model of the wider PRZ will depend on the
extent to which it is found to be an adequate representation of the conditions
found in the RCF.</P>
<P><B>Summary of Remaining Uncertainties Affecting Repository Design and
Construction</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.17"></A>8.17   In Section 6 of my evidence I showed that the
main flow channels in the BVG are considered to consist of networks of connected
fractures.  As described in <A HREF="#Para6.8">Paragraphs 6.8</A> - 6.45, it is
the characterisation of the flowing fractures and features and, in particular,
the way in which these are connected so as to permit the movement of groundwater
through the BVG and into the overlying strata that constitutes the principal
area of remaining uncertainty.</P>
<P>8.18   There are some further investigations planned to be undertaken from
the surface that partially address some of the uncertainties.  These are
described in <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Table6.3">Table 6.3</A> (c).  However, in
much the same way as explained in
<A HREF="#Para6.83">Paragraphs 6.83</A> - 6.88 in relation to groundwater flow
and radionuclide transport, remaining uncertainties over the characteristics of
the flow zones, and particularly their large-scale characteristics, such as
their distribution through the PRZ, that cannot be determined from boreholes, is
currently limiting our ability to select an optimum position for a repository. 
In addition, as explained in <A HREF="#Para7.31">Paragraphs 7.31</A> - 7.34,
uncertainties over the extent of excavation disturbance and the relationship
between this and variations in rock properties within the PRZ also limits our
ability to select the optimum position for a repository.</P>
<P>8.19   These remaining uncertainties can only be addressed through
investigations carried out underground in the RCF.</P>
<P><B>9.   <A NAME="CONCLUSIONS">CONCLUSIONS</A></B></P>
<P><B>Introduction</B></P>
<P>9.1   This final section of my evidence draws together the various threads
presented earlier into a series of consolidated conclusions.  Firstly, I
summarise our current understanding of the geology and hydrogeology of the
Sellafield site in qualitative terms, recognising that it is only through the
process of safety assessment that the suitability of the site can be assessed in
relation to regulatory targets.  Secondly, I draw together the various remaining
uncertainties that exist concerning the geology and hydrogeology of the site
that need to be addressed in the RCF.</P>
<P><B>Summary of Current Understanding of Geology and Hydrogeology</B></P>
<P>9.2   Nirex has carried out an extensive and systematic investigation of the
geology and hydrogeology of the Sellafield site using a wide range of techniques
and technical specialists.  So far the investigations have been carried out
entirely from the surface.</P>
<P>9.3   Studies of the geology of the area have confirmed that the geological
sequence and structure are essentially as expected when the decision was taken
in 1989 to investigate the site.  The investigations have, however, added
substantial detail to the understanding of the geology.</P>
<P>9.4   Recognising that the main way in which radionuclides can be
transported away from a repository is by flow of groundwater, considerable
effort has been directed towards understanding the hydrogeology of the site. 
The site has favourable characteristics in respect of the two key functions
which the geological barrier must achieve (see <A HREF="#Para6.2">Paragraph 6.2</A>
above).  Firstly, there are low groundwater flows in the BVG which would host
the repository and, secondly, there would be substantial subsequent dilution of
any solutes in that water as it joins the active groundwater system in the
overlying sandstones.</P>
<P>9.5   These favourable characteristics of the site are being indicated by a
range of independent observations.  Thus, low flow of groundwater is indicated
by measurements of low hydraulic conductivity in the BVG, by observations that
flow is through a small sub-set of fractures, and by observations of groundwater
chemistry that indicate residence times for water and solutes in the BVG of
possibly up to 1.5 million years. </P>
<P>9.6   A provisional conclusion from the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test is that
there appears to be little connection between the BVG and the overlying
sandstones.</P>
<P>9.7   The groundwater system at the site is increasingly well understood and
capable of being described using simple mathematical models supported by a
number of independent datasets.  Good progress is being made in matching the
predictions from these models with independent field measurements.</P>
<P><B>Summary of Remaining Uncertainties that need to be addressed in the RCF</B></P>
<P>9.8   However, the surface-based investigations are not able fully to
address the remaining uncertainties due to the inherent limitations of
measurements made in Boreholes drilled from the surface.  Firstly, the Boreholes
are only able to sample the rock over a limited volume defined by the length (or
depth) of the hole and its diameter.  Many features, such as fractures, are thus
inadequately sampled.  Secondly, the Borehole testing is unable to provide
direct evidence concerning the spatial variability and length of the fractures,
and the way in which they form networks of connected fractures that control
groundwater flow.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.9"></A>9.9   It is the characterisation of the flow zones
and, in particular, the way in which these are connected so as to permit the
movement of groundwater through the BVG and into overlying strata, that
constitutes the principal area of remaining uncertainty</P>
<P>9.10   Uncertainties also exist regarding the extent to which current models
reliably predict the extent of excavation disturbance and the variations in rock
properties as they impact the selection of the position for a repository.  </P>
<P>9.11   These remaining uncertainties need to be addressed before a decision
can be made to propose a repository at the site.  They can only be addressed
through investigations in the RCF.</P>

<P><B>DR DAVID WILLIAM MELLOR will say:</B></P>
<P><B>1. <A NAME="PERSONAL">PERSONAL DETAILS</A></B></P>
<P>1.1 I have been the RCF Science Manager in the Science Department of United
Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex') since July 1993. I am responsible for developing
the programme of activities planned in the Rock Characterisation Facility
('RCF') to meet the needs of the site characterisation and research programmes.
I am a member of the Steering Committee of the Joint ANDRA, Nirex and SKB ZEDEX
Project at the Hard Rock Laboratory ('HRL') in &Auml;sp&ouml;, Sweden, which
comprises a series of underground experiments to measure excavation disturbance
effects on the rock mass.</P>
<P>1.2 I hold an upper second class honours degree in Geology from the
University of Manchester. Following postgraduate research I was awarded a Master
of Science degree in Geophysics from the University of Liverpool. I hold a
Doctor of Philosophy degree from the Earth Science department of the Open
University. This degree was sponsored and funded by British Petroleum ('BP') and
deals with the control of structure in a real porous medium over two phase fluid
movement. I am a Chartered Geologist and a Chartered Engineer. I am a Member of
the Institution of Mining Engineers and a Fellow of the Geological Society. I am
an external examiner for the HND, BSc and MSc courses in Environmental
Management at Farnborough College of Technology. I am the author of 18 technical
papers and a named inventor in 27 UK and international patents on measurement
technology used in geology, geophysics and fluid flow in porous media.</P>
<P>1.3 From 1975 until 1981 I was employed by the National Coal Board ('NCB')
as a Mine Geologist. In that capacity I was responsible for providing geological
and geophysical characterisation of underground tunnels, coal faces and access
drifts for mines in Yorkshire, Staffordshire, North Wales and Lancashire. This
included maintaining and operating the National Coal Board's portable
underground wireline geophysical logging unit for logging underground boreholes
in all UK coalfields. I was also responsible for inputs into deep drilling and
geophysical surveys for potential new mine sites in North Wales, Cheshire and
Staffordshire, and am a named inventor in NCB patents for inferring rock
properties from downhole geophysical logs. From 1981 until 1992 I was employed
by BP to manage a range of research and development projects in support of BP's
worldwide exploration and production operations in coal, oil, gas and minerals.
During this period I successively held the posts of Coal Geologist, Petroleum
Engineer, Head of Nuclear Geophysics, Head of Technical Services Group, Head of
Well Completions Group, Manager of Reservoir Appraisal Branch and Manager of
both Reservoir Appraisal and Reservoir Description Branches. From 1992 until
1993 I was a partner in an International Atomic Energy Agency funded consortium
which developed and built a prototype towed seabed spectrometer for monitoring
gamma radiation from nuclear powered vessels abandoned at sea by the Soviet
Union.<BR>
</P>
<P><B>2. <A NAME="SUMMARY">SUMMARY</A></B></P>
<P>2.1<B> </B>It is shown in the evidence of Drs Holmes, Chaplow and Hooper
that the RCF is needed to provide information to address uncertainties in three
main areas:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>Natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>Design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P>2.2 My evidence explains how the programmes of scientific activities and the
underground works for the RCF have been designed to deliver the information
which is required. This explanation is provided in four steps in my evidence:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a description of how the activities planned for Phase 1 will deliver
information in the first category, which is required to address the
uncertainties in the three main areas to enable Nirex to make the decision on
whether to propose a repository at Sellafield;
</LI>
<LI>a description of how the activities planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 will
deliver information in the second category, which is required to address the
uncertainties in the three main areas to inform a decision by the regulatory
authorities on whether to approve the start of disposal operations after
completion of repository construction and commissioning;
</LI>
<LI>the reasons for the design and approach to construction of the below ground
works of the RCF necessary to enable the scientific programme of activities; and
</LI>
<LI>the approach to planning and managing activities in the RCF.
</LI></UL>
<P><B>Phase 1 Science Programme</B></P>
<P>2.3 The activities planned for Phase 1 to deliver the information required
to enable Nirex to make the decision on whether to propose a repository at
Sellafield are explained in terms of the three main areas of uncertainties in
the following paragraphs.</P>
<P>Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport</P>
<P>2.4 Mapping will take place as an integral and continuous part of shaft and
gallery construction. This will provide observational information on the
following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the structural characteristics of the St Bees Sandstone and Brockram
exposed in the shaft walls, including the main features controlling groundwater
flow;
</LI>
<LI>the lengths, orientations, apertures and ways in which fractures forming
flow channels in the BVG are connected together, and the variability of these
characteristics exposed in the shaft walls;
</LI>
<LI>continuity of mapped structural characteristics and flow channels of the St
Bees Sandstone, Brockram and BVG between the North Shaft and South Shaft and
existing boreholes drilled from the surface; and
</LI>
<LI>continuity of mapped structural characteristics and flow channels of the St
Bees Sandstone, Brockram and BVG observed in the shafts and the same features
intersected at a distance in underground boreholes drilled from insets in the
shafts and galleries.
</LI></UL>
<P>2.5 Hydraulic measurements will take place as an integral and continuous
part of shaft and gallery construction. These will provide observational
information on the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>continuous measurement of the changes in groundwater pressure on the
groundwater pressure monitoring system;
</LI>
<LI>continuous monitoring of the inflows of groundwater to the shafts and
galleries;
</LI>
<LI>acquisition of groundwater samples from flow zones encountered in the
shafts and galleries;
</LI>
<LI>hydraulic testing of fractures intersected in underground boreholes drilled
out from insets in the shafts and galleries;
</LI>
<LI>acquisition of groundwater samples from fractures intersected in
underground boreholes drilled out from insets in the shafts and galleries; and
</LI>
<LI>monitoring during construction for groundwater ahead of the shaft by
testing the shaft sinker's probe holes.
</LI></UL>
<P>Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier</P>
<P>2.6 The mapping of the shafts during construction will provide access to
enable examination of fractures in the sandstones, Brockram and BVG for evidence
of their evolution and changes that may have occurred to them in the past as a
consequence of natural geological changes. This observational evidence will
include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>fracture intersection and cross-cutting (relative age) relationships; and
</LI>
<LI>sampling of fracture infill for mineralogical analysis and radiometric age
dating.
</LI></UL>
<P>The examination and sampling during mapping will concentrate largely on
groundwater flow channels. This is expected to allow the geological history of
flow patterns established from analysis of cores from surface-drilled boreholes
to be confirmed.</P>
<P>2.7 Construction of the shafts and galleries will create a zone of
disturbance around the excavations within which the mechanical and hydraulic
properties of the rock mass will change. These mechanical and hydraulic changes
within the excavation disturbance zone will be measured in the sandstones,
Brockram and BVG during shaft construction. A further experiment to measure the
mechanical and hydraulic changes within the excavation disturbance zone
surrounding a gallery in the BVG at the preferred repository horizon will be
carried out towards the end of Phase 1. These measurements are a practicable
means of validating that the site characteristics are such that excavation
disturbance will not significantly impair the containment performance of the
natural geological barrier in advance of the decision whether to propose the
development of a repository. Such measurements are based on practical experience
in other underground laboratories, including the ZEDEX Project in the &Auml;sp&ouml;
Hard Rock Laboratory in Sweden.</P>
<P>Design and Construction of the Repository</P>
<P>2.8 The validity of models that will be used to make extrapolations
throughout the BVG rocks in the PRZ of the distribution of networks of connected
fractures will be tested progressively during Phase 1. This will be achieved by
making a series of forward predictions of the expected geological and
hydrogeological characteristics of the BVG, and comparing these predictions with
observational data subsequently obtained from:</P>
<UL>
<LI>mapping the shafts;
</LI>
<LI>mapping the galleries;
</LI>
<LI>underground drilling from insets in the shafts and galleries;
</LI>
<LI>measurements of inflows to the excavations; and
</LI>
<LI>measurements of drawdown on the groundwater pressure monitoring system.
</LI></UL>
<P><B>Phase 2 and Phase 3 Science Programme</B></P>
<P>2.9 Completion of the Phase 1 Science programme could put Nirex in a
position to take a decision on whether to propose repository development, and
this is the working assumption for the RCF programme. If, for some reason, the
decision to propose repository development is not taken at the end of Phase 1,
then the nature of the science programme for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3,
would be reviewed and possibly revised. Under such circumstances the balance of
science activities might be expected to shift from a programme which currently
comprises predominately experimentation on processes within flow channels in the
BVG to one which further emphasises the testing of extrapolations of
distributions of networks of connected fractures within the BVG rocks of the
PRZ. </P>
<P>2.10 The activities currently planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 are explained
in terms of the three main areas of uncertainties in the following paragraphs:</P>
<P>Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport</P>
<P>2.11 It is expected that it may be necessary to fill out the information
supplied on groundwater flow and spreading in the geosphere in the safety
assessment prepared at the first key decision point. In order to achieve this,
it is envisaged that two large scale experiments may be required:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the SCD experiment which will characterise the flow of groundwater though
connected fractures in a region of BVG unaffected excavation disturbance and
which is approximately one million m<SUP>3</SUP> in volume; and
</LI>
<LI>the Ventilation Tunnel experiment which will measure the hydraulic
conductivity of the BVG including that of the excavation disturbed zone, over a
lengthscale of about 100 metres.
</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 Experiments within single fractures, and within zones of connected
fractures, will be carried out in Phase 2 and Phase 3 to measure rock matrix
diffusion in situ in the BVG. These measurements will be used to determine the
extent to which laboratory measurements of rock matrix diffusion are valid. Such
experiments will be comparable in outline to experiments conducted in
underground laboratories in other countries.</P>
<P>2.13 Groundwater samples from boreholes drilled from insets in the galleries
will be taken for analysis as part of the geochemical sampling programme
throughout Phase 2 and Phase 3. </P>
<P>2.14 Experiments to observe colloid transport within single fractures and
fracture zones will be undertaken for the subsequent development of simple,
empirically based models of colloid transport.</P>
<P>2.15 Experiments to study gas migration will be carried out in Phase 3 to
measure:</P>
<UL>
<LI>gas entry pressure into fractures; and
</LI>
<LI>two phase (i.e. gas and water) flow characteristics within fractures.
</LI></UL>
<P>Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier</P>
<P>2.16 Experiments to measure the effects of chemical disturbance to networks
of connected fractures arising from highly alkaline fluids will be carried out.
These experiments would be intended to build confidence in the trends of changes
to the rock properties already established in the laboratory.</P>
<P>2.17 Further work in measuring the mechanical and hydraulic changes within
the excavation disturbed zone will be carried out during Phase 2 and Phase 3.
This work will include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>measurement of the extent to which mechanical and hydraulic changes within
the zone of disturbance are sensitive to excavation direction in relation to the
maximum horizontal stress direction; and
</LI>
<LI>measurement of the mechanical and hydraulic changes within the zone of
disturbance when an excavation passes through a significant fault or fracture
zone.
</LI></UL>
<P>Design and Construction of the Repository</P>
<P>2.18 The validity of models that will be used to make extrapolations
throughout the BVG rocks in the PRZ of the distribution of networks of connected
fractures will continue to be tested during Phase 2 and Phase 3 by making
forward predictions of the expected geological and hydrogeological
characteristics of the BVG and comparing these with observational data
subsequently obtained from:</P>
<UL>
<LI>mapping the galleries;
</LI>
<LI>underground drilling from insets in the galleries;
</LI>
<LI>measurements of inflows to the excavations; and
</LI>
<LI>measurements of drawdown on the groundwater pressure monitoring system.
</LI></UL>
<P>2.19 The finalised location of the repository vaults in the rock mass would
be confirmed on the basis of underground drilling from the Phase 3 galleries,
possibly along the line of the vaults.</P>
<P>2.20 A series of experiments and demonstrations is planned to establish that
required properties of seal materials, such as fluidity, durability or
permeability (in set condition) may be achieved in situ for:</P>
<UL>
<LI>seals in shafts;
</LI>
<LI>seals in galleries parallel and perpendicular to the maximum horizontal
stress direction;
</LI>
<LI>seals in boreholes; and
</LI>
<LI>seals to fractures and the excavation disturbance zone.
</LI></UL>
<P>These experiments and demonstrations are comparable in outline to
experiments conducted in underground laboratories in other countries.</P>
<P><B>Design and Construction of the RCF</B></P>
<P>2.21 In order to obtain information on networks of connected fractures,
access to rocks at depth is required. Shaft access has been selected because
shafts are the most economic means of achieving access to rock at depth. In
order to provide a second and separate exit to the surface for safe working, two
shafts are needed for continuation of underground gallery construction and
scientific works beyond the shaft bottom area.</P>
<P>2.22 The method for shaft construction and gallery construction must be such
that it allows regular and routine access to the rock mass for scientific
measurements and observations which are needed. The only practical method of
achieving this is the drill and blast method. This method has also been selected
by other countries with underground research laboratories, including Sweden for
the access drift for the HRL at &Auml;sp&ouml; and Canada for the URL main
shaft.</P>
<P><B>Approach to Planning and Managing Activities in the RCF</B></P>
<P>2.23 There are a number of underground research laboratories in other
countries. Though they are not necessarily directly comparable to the RCF in
many respects, there are some lessons in general which have been learned which
are relevant to the planning and management of the RCF. One of the most
important is that it is essential to retain a degree of flexibility to adapt the
layout of the laboratory, the underground experiments, or both, to the
geological conditions as found underground. This has been incorporated into the
planning for, and management of, the RCF. The current layouts for the
underground excavations are therefore all indicative, rather than prescriptive,
at this stage.</P>
<P><B>3. <A NAME="SCOPE">SCOPE OF THE EVIDENCE</A></B></P>
<P>3.1 The purpose of my evidence is:</P>
<UL>
<LI>to describe the programme of activities planned for Phase 1 of the RCF to
provide information in the first category identified by Dr Hooper (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para6.5">para 6.5</A>) to enable Nirex to make a
decision on whether to propose a repository at Sellafield (Section 4);
</LI>
<LI>to describe the programme of activities planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 of
the RCF to provide information in the second category identified by Dr Hooper (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para6.6">para 6.6</A>) to inform a decision by the
regulatory authorities on whether to approve the start of disposal operations
after completion of repository construction and commissioning (Section  5);
</LI>
<LI>to provide the reasons for the design and approach to construction of the
below ground works of the RCF to enable the scientific programme of activities
(Section 6); and
</LI>
<LI>to present the approach to planning and managing activities in the RCF
(Section 7).
</LI></UL>
<P>3.2 In Section 4, I describe the activities which generate information which
is needed to address the uncertainties. This information is generated
continuously throughout Phase 1, and it is expected that a decision to propose a
repository at Sellafield could be taken at the end of Phase 1.</P>
<P>3.3 Section 5 of my evidence presents the current plans for experimental
activities necessary to address the remaining uncertainties on the assumption
that the decision has been taken to propose a repository at Sellafield at the
end of Phase 1. This section of my evidence also explains that if the decision
to propose repository development is not taken at the end of Phase 1, then the
nature of the science programme for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3 would be
reviewed and possibly revised, as indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para6.4">para 6.4</A>)</P>
<P><B><A NAME="PHASE1">4. PHASE 1 SCIENCE PROGRAMME</A></B></P>
<P>4.1 The programme of activities planned for Phase 1 will be described under
the following headings:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P><B>Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport</B></P>
<P>4.2 As identified in Dr Hooper's evidence, information is required from the
RCF to address two uncertainties within the main area of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport:</P>
<UL>
<LI>calculation of groundwater flow into the repository; and
</LI>
<LI>spreading in the geosphere.
</LI></UL>
<P>The programme of activities to address these two uncertainties will be
explained under these sub-headings in the following paragraphs.</P>
<P><U>Calculation of Groundwater Flow into the Repository</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 The information which is required from Phase 1 of
the RCF includes the lengths, orientations, apertures and ways in which
fractures forming flow channels in the Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG') are
connected together, and the variability of these characteristics. This
information will be generated from two groups of activities carried out during
Phase 1:</P>

<P>These two groups of measurements will be described under these sub-headings
in the following paragraphs.</P>
<P>i. Mapping</P>
<P>4.4 Observations and measurements will be made of geological conditions and
parameters at depth in the potential repository host rock. These will be
conducted within the underground shafts and galleries and boreholes drilled from
them into the surrounding rock mass, as stated in the <I>Rock Characterisation
Facility Environmental Statement, Nirex Report 600 </I>(&quot;<I>Environmental
Statement</I>&quot;) (para 1.54, page 12) [COR/101]. Most of these general
characterisation observations and measurements will be obtained as part of
mapping, carried out by teams of specialist contractors. Mapping of both shafts
will take place as a continuous and integral part of shaft construction. The
method of shaft mapping which will be used in the RCF shafts and galleries has
been developed in conjunction with Atomic Energy of Canada Limited ('AECL'),
based on their experience of mapping the walls of the rectangular shaft and the
circular shaft extension of their Underground Research Laboratory ('URL'). In
the RCF shafts, data collection will be by colour stereo photography of the
shaft walls and in situ mapping of the shaft walls using a photomosaic base, and
recording of geological, geotechnical and hydrogeological parameters on coded
field sheets. These parameters will be substantially the same as those already
in existence and used for core description and characterisation of the surface
based site characterisation programme described in Dr Chaplow's evidence. These
parameters will include the trace lengths, orientations, apertures and ways in
which fractures forming flow channels in the BVG are connected together, and the
variability of these characteristics exposed in the shaft walls. Mapping of the
shaft walls therefore extends established site characterisation methods and
experience and utilises experience and proven mapping techniques developed for
shafts and galleries in other, comparable national programmes of underground
characterisation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.5"></A>4.5 It may be possible to infer continuity between
connected fractures mapped in the BVG in the South Shaft, and connected
fractures mapped in the North Shaft or flow zones observed in existing boreholes
drilled from the surface. Such continuity, if observed, or confirmed by drilling
short boreholes from the Shafts to intersect the connected fractures, would
provide observational data on a lengthscale of tens or hundreds of metres.</P>
<P>ii. Hydraulic Measurements</P>
<P>4.6 Observation and measurements of groundwater inflows via fractures to the
shaft will be made as a routine part of geological mapping. The three
dimensional nature of the connections between some of these fractures can be
observed and recorded where the shaft intersects and exposes them, as part of
mapping. However, we need to extend our knowledge and understanding of the
hydraulic characteristics of these connections in three dimensions beyond the
limits of the shaft. This will be achieved by piecing together a number of
complementary observations, described in the following paragraphs.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.7"></A>4.7 The most extensive set of hydraulic measurements
during Phase 1 will be that made by the groundwater pressure monitoring system
installed in the existing boreholes which have been drilled previously from the
surface. This monitoring system will be operated continuously throughout the
life of the RCF. The monitoring system will record the groundwater pressure in
fractures present in the existing boreholes. Some of these fractures may be
connected in networks to fractures which the shafts will intersect. Under these
circumstances, the reduction in groundwater pressure (termed drawdown) in the
fractures exposed in the shafts would be evident as a reduction in pressure in
some of the fractures in the existing boreholes. The groundwater pressure
responses to shaft sinking recorded on the monitoring system therefore provide
important information on the hydraulic characteristics of networks of connected
fractures.</P>
<P>4.8 Throughout the construction of the shafts, the volume of effluent water
pumped out of the shaft will be monitored. In order to make estimates of the
amount of effluent water which is groundwater (and not water used for
construction purposes) the volumes of water introduced into the shaft for
construction purposes will also be monitored. To differentiate between
groundwater and water which is introduced for construction purposes in the
effluent water, the introduced water will be marked with a chemical tracer.
Drilling fluids used in the site characterisation programme have been traced
with lithium chloride and with potassium iodide to differentiate between
groundwater and drilling fluid in water samples obtained from the boreholes. The
tracer used in the water which is introduced into the shafts for construction
purposes will use a different tracer to those used in the surface based drilling
programme. These steps are necessary precautions and may be helpful, following
analysis of groundwater samples from the RCF, in identifying sources of
contamination in groundwater samples and pathways taken by groundwater which has
entered the shafts.</P>
<P>4.9 As part of the suite of hydraulic measurements for the RCF there will be
a geochemical sampling programme, the main objective of which will be to provide
high quality groundwater samples from well-characterised locations, as stated in
the <I>Environmental Statement </I>(para 1.62, page 13) [COR/101]. Groundwater
samples will be obtained throughout Phase 1, though the numbers of samples and
frequency of sampling may vary with depth. Groundwater samples will be collected
from flow zones in the shaft and from underground boreholes drilled out from the
shaft.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.10"></A>4.10 As a routine part of construction operations,
the shaft sinker will drill probe holes down and below the shaft, ahead of
construction. These probe holes will be hydraulically tested in order to
identify sources of groundwater beneath the shaft which might constitute
potential inrush hazards to construction operations. Where a probe hole
intersects a network of connected fractures, the hydraulic testing by the shaft
sinker of the probe hole may also cause a tell-tale response on the groundwater
pressure monitoring system. This complementary combination of in situ (i.e. in
the shaft) probe hole hydraulic testing and tell-tale response detected outside
the shaft will help to build the picture of the network of connected fractures.
Depending on which parts of the groundwater pressure monitoring system responded
by tell tale perturbations, this complementary method of interrogating fractures
may give information on the connectivity of fracture systems on lengthscales
over may tens, or even hundreds, of metres.</P>
<P>4.11 The drilling of additional probe boreholes from the shaft to further
characterise flow channels in such areas of interest could extend the
lengthscale of the information obtainable on hydraulic properties of the
fracture system.</P>
<P>4.12 Where the shaft sinker identifies a zone of potential groundwater
inflow beneath the shaft bottom, he will make an operational decision whether or
not to restrict inflows by injecting grout into the zone before sinking the
shaft through the zone. In order to inject grout into an identified zone, the
shaft sinker will drill a number (around 20 or so) of short grout injection
boreholes to intersect the zone. This is illustrated schematically for the South
Shaft in <A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. Grout, coloured with
a dye, would then be forced into each of these grout injection boreholes and
thereby into the network of connected fractures. As the shaft is subsequently
sunk through the grouted section, mapping of the shaft walls will reveal those
connected fractures into which the dyed grout has penetrated. Mapping this
section in detail will provide information in three dimensions about the
connected, hydraulically conductive fractures, including trace lengths,
orientations, apertures and ways in which fractures forming flow channels in the
BVG are connected together as illustrated schematically in
<A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure4.2">Figure 4.2</A>. The three dimensional nature
of these grout filled fractures can be further investigated by drilling cores
out of the shaft wall. This technique of injecting dyed grout and subsequently
mapping and coring grout filled fractures has been used successfully in the
Swedish Hard Rock Laboratory ('HRL') in &Auml;sp&ouml;. The construction
operations of probe hole testing and grouting, therefore, provide further
opportunities to obtain data which is complementary to that obtained from
mapping and drawdown monitoring which is required to quantify the lengths,
orientations, apertures and ways in which fractures forming flow channels in the
BVG are connected together and which cannot be obtained from surface boreholes
alone.</P>
<P>4.13 At any stage in shaft sinking Nirex may decide to suspend shaft sinking
operations to further investigate a particular feature of scientific interest,
such as flow channels. For example, should any particular probe hole give
unexpected or significant hydraulic responses on the groundwater pressure
monitoring system, then suspension of sinking operations would allow further
hydraulic testing and characterisation of the flow channel to be carried out. It
is difficult at this time to prescribe what these might be in any detail, but it
might, for example, be desirable to drill additional underground boreholes from
the shaft to intersect a network of connected fractures in order to characterise
it in more detail further away from the shaft. Alternatively, it may be
desirable under such circumstances to attempt a modified form of cross-hole
testing. Other reasons for temporary suspension of shaft sinking could include
the construction of an inset (short horizontal excavation) from the shaft into
the feature, or to one side of the feature for subsequent access into it by
underground boreholes. This flexibility to stop shaft sinking and concentrate
scientific efforts on features of interest is an important aspect of providing
the required information, and is consistent with the experience of other
national and international underground laboratories, as explained in more detail
in Section 7.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.14"></A>4.14 Further information complementary to that
obtained from geological mapping of the shaft walls, drawdown monitoring,
testing in probe holes and injection of dyed grout is planned to be obtained
from a period of underground diamond drilling termed Peripheral Drilling. This
comprises a programme of drilling of boreholes from the 650 metres bOD gallery
once shaft sinking has been completed. Peripheral Drilling will be carried out
for a period of nine months before the end of Phase 1 in order to further
characterise the lengths, orientations, apertures and ways in which fractures
forming flow channels in the BVG are connected together, and the variability of
these characteristics. These underground boreholes will be cored and
hydrogeologically tested. Geophysical logging and the installation of
instruments to monitor groundwater pressures and obtain groundwater samples will
be undertaken for each borehole. Peripheral Drilling will be used to explore and
characterise hydraulic properties of networks of connected fractures in regions
of the potential repository zone ('PRZ') not directly penetrated by the RCF
shafts. The use of underground diamond drilling and characterisation of
hydraulic properties of fractures is common to other national and international
programmes of site characterisation for deep disposal of radioactive wastes
which have an underground laboratory, and is an important way of testing the
validity of extrapolations throughout the BVG rocks in the PRZ of the
distributions of networks of connected fractures.</P>
<P><U>Spreading in the Geosphere</U></P>
<P>4.15 The information from the RCF on groundwater flow channels in the BVG
required in relation to calculations of groundwater flow through the repository
would also be required to address uncertainties concerning spreading in the
geosphere, for the reasons noted in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para6.30">para 6.30</A>).
</P>
<P>4.16 Information is also required from the St. Bees Sandstone. The
information which is required from the St. Bees Sandstone is the correlation of
the observed large scale geological structures encountered in the shaft with the
hydrogeological responses in monitoring boreholes in order to distinguish
between alternative conceptualisations of connected fracture systems. The
programme of activities planned for the St. Bees Sandstone sections of the shaft
is therefore essentially the same as that which has been described for the BVG
in paragraphs 4.3 to 4.13, including:</P>
<UL>
<LI>geological mapping during sinking;
</LI>
<LI>drawdown monitoring on the groundwater pressure monitoring system;
</LI>
<LI>probe hole testing; and
</LI>
<LI>injection of coloured grouts into networks of fractures in the sandstones
and subsequent mapping and photography of the excavation through the treated
zone.
</LI></UL>
<P>4.17 There are some differences, however, between the information which
would be obtained during sinking the shafts through the sandstones and that
which would be obtained during sinking through the BVG. These differences are
twofold:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the diameter of shaft is greater in the sandstones than the BVG; and
</LI>
<LI>the shaft sinker would have a higher density of probe holes in the
sandstones that the BVG.
</LI></UL>
<P>These two differences are explained in paragraphs 4.18 and 4.19.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.18"></A>4.18 A hydrostatic concrete lining will be
continuously formed during shaft sinking through the sandstones and Brockram.
The purpose of this lining is to reduce the inflows of water into the completed
shaft. The thickness of the concrete lining will be increased with increasing
depth in order to be able to withstand the groundwater pressure which also
increases with increasing depth. This means that the concrete lining is over a
metre thick towards the lower part of the St Bees Sandstone. Because the
internal finished diameter of the shaft is constant at 5 metres, the St Bees
Sandstone has to be excavated to a diameter of up to about 7.4 metres to
accommodate the thickness of the lining. This gives a much greater surface area
of exposure per metre length of shaft compared to an equivalent metre length of
borehole core (more than 70 times). There is therefore greater scope for
observing and recording structural features of the sandstones including the
trace lengths, orientations, apertures and ways in which fractures in the
sandstones are connected in three dimensions and relating these to inflow
characteristics than is possible from boreholes drilled from the surface.</P>
<P>4.19 Because the St Bees Sandstone typically has a higher hydraulic
conductivity than the BVG, the shaft sinker will proceed through them more
cautiously. The shaft sinker will be required to use a minimum of four probe
holes (one on each shaft quarterline) beneath the shaft in advance of
construction, to enable him to test for the presence of potential inflows. Each
probe hole in the sandstones is required to be a minimum of 40 metres in length
with an overlap of 10 metres with previously drilled probe holes. This probe
hole pattern would be continued through the sandstones and Brockram and into the
top of the BVG. There is, therefore, scope for characterising the main controls
on spreading in the geosphere in the sandstones by means of complementary
observations using the probe holes and the groundwater pressure monitoring
system, as described in paragraphs 4.3<B> </B>to 4.13.</P>
<P><B>Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier</B></P>
<P>4.20 The role of the RCF in respect of natural change is to provide access
to examine fractures in the sandstones, Brockram and BVG for evidence of their
evolution and changes that may have occurred to them in the past as a
consequence of natural geological changes. Dr Chaplow presents evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B><A
HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para7.25">para 7.25</A>) that the system of flowing
fractures has remained stable for a long period of time. During shaft sinking,
direct observations of associations of groundwater flows, mineral formation and
geological structures at depth will be undertaken in order to test the extent to
which this view is valid. The observations will be carried out during shaft
sinking as an integral part of mapping, and will take the form of:</P>
<UL>
<LI>observations and photography of fracture intersection and cross-cutting<B></B>(relative
age) relationships; and
</LI>
<LI>sampling of fracture infill for mineralogical analysis and radiometric age
dating.
</LI></UL>
<P>The observations will concentrate largely on recording and sampling
fractures which are significant for groundwater flow. This is expected to allow
the geological history of flow patterns established to date from analysis of
cores to be confirmed. This paleohydrogeological record will then be compared
with the present day flow patterns to test whether significant changes have
occurred in the past and may therefore occur in the future.</P>
<P>Excavation Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.21"></A>4.21 An extensive programme of activities to monitor
the excavation of the shafts and galleries is planned for the RCF, in order to
test the assumption that the hydraulic conductivity of the excavation
disturbance zone is not increased by more than a factor of a hundred over a
distance equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation. This programme
comprises the acquisition of data planned to be carried out during temporary
suspensions of shaft sinking operations:</P>
<UL>
<LI>monitoring of the in situ mechanical deformation of the disturbance zone by
convergence measurements (measurement of the reduction in diameter of the shafts
as the disturbance zone forms) and extensometer measurements (measurements of
radial displacements of points in underground boreholes drilled out from the
shaft), at stations in the sandstones, Brockram and BVG. Convergence and
extensometer measurements of deformation are common to a number of underground
laboratories in other countries, including the Canadian URL and the Swedish HRL
at &Auml;sp&ouml;;
</LI>
<LI>measurement of stress by overcoring techniques in the sandstones, Brockram
and BVG. The stress measurements will be taken close to the convergence
measurements where this is practicable. Measurement of stress by this technique
is common to a number of underground laboratories in other countries, including
the Canadian URL and the Swedish HRL at &Auml;sp&ouml;. The measurement of
stress by overcoring, and back-analysis of stress from convergence and
extensometer data, will validate the &quot;big picture&quot; of stress
magnitudes and directions for the sandstones, Brockram and BVG already built up
from a variety of techniques carried out in boreholes drilled from the surface.
These techniques include hydrofracture, overcoring and borehole breakout, as
described in Dr Chaplow's evidence (<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14a1.htm#TA13"><B>Table
A.13</B></A>, page A.35);
</LI>
<LI>regular measurements of the excavation profile (shape) using a technique
such as laser profiling. This will identify any tendency for the shaft
excavations to form non-circular deformation in response to structural fabric of
the rocks and/or contrasts in horizontal stress magnitude;
</LI>
<LI>measurement of the in situ development of the disturbance zone and the
consequent changes in mechanical behaviour and hydraulic conductivity of the
rock as the shaft passes through a previously instrumented section installed
from within the deeper of the two shafts. This will be achieved by means of &quot;before
and after&quot; mechanical and hydraulic testing in horizontal underground
boreholes drilled towards, and around, the &quot;target&quot; shaft location
from the deeper of the two shafts. This is a variation of the under-excavation
method used in the Canadian URL, and is similar to the basic methodology
developed for the ZEDEX (Zone of Excavation Disturbance EXperiment, referred to
in paragraph 4.23) Project in the HRL at &Auml;sp&ouml;; and
</LI>
<LI>monitoring the acoustic emission from detectors located in the surface
boreholes and in underground boreholes. The acoustic emission data is expected
to give an indication of the extent of the excavation disturbance by locating
the sources within the rock mass of micro-crack events. This should provide
information on the extent of the zone where joint movements occur, and has
proved useful in the Canadian URL and in the ZEDEX project in the HRL at &Auml;sp&ouml;.
</LI></UL>
<P>4.22 The monitoring outlined in the preceding paragraph is expected to give
estimates of the general mechanical nature of the disturbance zone around the
shafts. It should also provide general indications and upper bounds of the
changes in hydraulic conductivity which occur within the disturbance zone. By
their very nature, these estimates cannot be achieved using boreholes drilled
from the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.23"></A>4.23 A more comprehensive experiment aimed at
further quantifying the hydraulic changes which occur within the disturbed zone,
is planned to be carried out in a gallery towards the end of Phase 1. This
experiment is termed &quot;EDZ experiment number one&quot; and the form of the
experiment is similar to that jointly designed and managed by Nirex, SKB and
ANDRA in the ZEDEX programme in &Auml;sp&ouml;, as illustrated in the drill and
blast test drill configuration in the <I>&Auml;sp&ouml; Hard Rock Laboratory.
Test Plan for ZEDEX - Zone of Excavation Disturbance Experiment </I>(&quot;<I>ZEDEX
Test Plan&quot;) </I>(Figure 4-2, page 6) [NRX/16/1]. The experiment consists of
drilling several underground boreholes into the rock mass through which a
gallery will be subsequently excavated. These boreholes will be designed to pass
close to the gallery surface. The core retrieved from the borehole will be
described and characterised, and the boreholes will be tested using
geotechnical, geophysical and hydrogeological methods similar to those used in
surface-drilled boreholes and described in Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14a1.htm#Appendix1">Appendix 1</A>, ), and similar to the
methods used in the ZEDEX project in the HRL in &Auml;sp&ouml;. The programme of
hydrogeological testing gives the &quot;before construction&quot; baseline
hydraulic characteristics with which the &quot;after construction&quot;
measurements may be subsequently compared. Prior to excavating the gallery
through the characterised rock mass, instruments will be located in some of the
boreholes to measure mechanical changes within the rock mass in response to
excavation of the gallery. Construction of the gallery would then be allowed to
proceed through the instrumented region of rock. After every drill and blast
round fired, borehole instruments and convergence arrays in the gallery will be
used to quantify the extent and magnitude of mechanical changes within the
disturbance zone. When the gallery has been constructed through the instrumented
section, the &quot;after construction&quot; measurements of hydraulic
characteristics may be made.</P>
<P>4.24 The suite of &quot;before construction&quot; and &quot;after
construction&quot; hydraulic measurements will enable estimates of the magnitude
of the hydraulic conductivity changes within the excavation disturbance zone to
be made for that particular location depth, rock type and stress field. The &quot;after
construction&quot; behaviour of the disturbance zone, including hydraulic
conductivity, will be monitored throughout the life of the RCF. The nature and
extent of the disturbance zone measured in the borehole instruments and
convergence arrays at that particular location are expected to allow inferences
concerning upper bounds of the magnitude of the hydraulic properties of the
excavation disturbance zone to be made. It should also be possible to
extrapolate the hydraulic behaviour of the excavation disturbance zone measured
in that experiment to the general form and extent of the mechanical nature of
excavation disturbance zone built up progressively during shaft sinking, and
described in paragraph 4.21.</P>
<P><B>Design and Construction of the Repository</B></P>
<P>4.25 Phase 1 of the RCF will enable the testing to be carried out of the
validity of models used to make extrapolations throughout the BVG rocks of the
PRZ of the distribution of networks of connected fractures. This testing will be
used to confirm provisional views on the repository design parameters, in
particular depth, location, layout and orientation. This will be achieved by
making forward predictions of the expected geological and hydrogeological
characteristics of the BVG, and comparing these predictions with observational
data subsequently obtained from:</P>
<UL>
<LI>mapping the shafts;
</LI>
<LI>mapping the galleries;
</LI>
<LI>underground drilling from insets in the shafts and galleries;
</LI>
<LI>measurements of inflows to the excavations; and
</LI>
<LI>measurements of drawdown on the groundwater pressure monitoring system.
</LI></UL>
<P>4.26 Testing of our ability to make extrapolations in this way will be
carried out during shaft sinking and will continue to the point where the
decision on repository depth, and consequently RCF gallery depth, is made.</P>
<P><A NAME="PHASE2"></A><B>5. <A NAME="PHASE">PHASE 2 AND PHASE 3 SCIENCE
PROGRAMME</A></B></P>
<P>5.1 Completion of the Phase 1 Scientific programme could put Nirex in a
position to take a decision on whether to propose repository development, and
this is the working assumption for the RCF programme. If, for some reason, the
decision to propose repository development is not taken at the end of Phase 1,
then the nature of the science programme for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3,
would be reviewed and possibly revised. Under such circumstances the balance of
science activities might be expected to shift from one which currently comprises
predominately experimentation on processes within flow channels in the BVG to
one which further emphasises the testing of extrapolations of distributions of
networks of connected fractures within the BVG rocks of the PRZ.</P>
<P>5.2 Although there are limited opportunities to provide some information in
the second category during Phase 1, most work on the second category will begin
when the Phase 2 galleries have been completed. As shown in the working
programme for the RCF in <A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>, on
the current Nirex assumption of a start date for the RCF of about July 1996, as
stated in the <I>Description of the Rock Characterisation Facility </I>(&quot;<I>RCF
Description&quot;)</I> (para 3.3, page 4) [COR/111], this would mean that work
on the second category would start in the year 2000. The precise form of the
experiments that are eventually carried out will be determined by the nature of
the rock and associated features that are encountered and by the particular data
needs finalised nearer the time, as stated in the <I>Environmental Statement
</I>(para 1.51, page 12) [COR/101]<SUP>.</SUP></P>
<P>5.3 Details of the experiments required to provide the second category of
information will be firmed up, and periodically reviewed, during Phase 1,
founded on the four important operating principles set out in Dr Holmes'
evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B><A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para5.2">para 5.2</A> ).
Additionally, sources of knowledge and expertise which will be used in
developing the detail of these experiments will include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Nirex participation in other national and international programmes (for
example the HRL at &Auml;sp&ouml; in Sweden and the URL in Canada);
</LI>
<LI>use of contractors with direct experience in designing and implementing
experiments and reviewing and interpreting results of experiments in underground
laboratories in national and international laboratories;
</LI>
<LI>published literature; and
</LI>
<LI>peer review.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.4 The current outline plans for activities and experiments fall under the
same three headings as those used in the first category of information
requirements:</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier, and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P>The current outline plans for activities necessary to generate the second
category of information are described in the following paragraphs.</P>
<P><B>Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport</B></P>
<P>5.5 As set out in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para6.18">para 6.18</A>), information is required
on three potentially important processes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration
</LI></UL>
<P>Measurements in situ in the RCF form an important link to laboratory studies
already completed on transport processes within fractures, as stated in the <I>Environmental
Statement</I> (parac 1.60, page 13) [COR/101].</P>
<P>5.6 In addition to testing evaluations of processes having the potential to
affect the transport of radionuclides, the second category of information will
include that required to fill out the information supplied on groundwater flow
and on spreading and dilution in the geosphere in the safety assessment prepared
for the first decision point, as stated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para6.18">para 6.18</A>). It is currently envisaged
that two large scale experiments may be required to fill out this information on
groundwater flow, and these are the SCD experiment and the Ventilation Tunnel
experiment.</P>
<P>Site Characterisation and Demonstration Experiment</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The SCD experiment will characterise the flow of
groundwater through connected fractures in the BVG on a sufficiently large scale
to further increase confidence in extrapolations across the PRZ. The objective
of the experiment is to address the hydrogeological behaviour of connected
fractures in the BVG on a lengthscale of the order of around a hundred metres,
accessed from boreholes drilled from a dedicated gallery in Phase 2 in order to
develop increasingly detailed models of the flow through a region of previously
undisturbed BVG. The SCD experiment is broadly comparable in outline to the
approach used in the Stripa Project Site Characterisation and Validation
Programme described in the
<I>OECD-NEA International Stripa Project 1980-1992 Overview Volume I: Executive
Summary</I>. (&quot;<I>Stripa Project Overview&quot;)
</I>(para 4.4, page 37) [NRX/16/2] and that planned for the Canadian URL
Moderately Fractured Rock ('MFR') experiment, described in the <I>Program of
experiments for the operating phase of the Underground Research Laboratory</I> (&quot;<I>Experimental
Programme for the URL</I>&quot;)<I> </I>(para 3.2, page 7) [NRX/16/3]. The
current schematic layout for the SCD experiment is shown in
<A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.2">Figure 5.2</A>.</P>
<P>5.8 The experiment will be located in a volume of rock selected during Phase
1, or the early part of Phase 2. The location will be such that it is unaffected
by the disturbance zone of nearby excavations, and relatively unaffected by the
drawdown of nearby excavations. For planning purposes, the dedicated SCD roadway
is currently assumed to be located off the gallery which connects the two
shafts. The experiment will be conducted within a volume of BVG rock
approximately 100 metres by 100 metres by 100 metres in size, with an
approximate volume of about 1,000,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>. The experiment will
include drilling, instrumenting and testing a set of boreholes drilled from the
Phase 2 galleries to establish the geometry and hydrogeological properties of
the connected fractures within that rock. The value of the experiment lies in
developing a detailed characterisation of the hydrogeological behaviour of a
selected part of a fracture network for comparison with detailed numerical
models of the system. Comparisons are likely to be progressive and iterative
over the life of the experiment. Such detailed observations at these depths are
not practicable from surface drilled boreholes.</P>
<P>Ventilation Tunnel Experiment</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.9"></A>5.9 This experiment test will measure the hydraulic
conductivity of the BVG on a large scale and will involve construction of an
environmentally controlled gallery about 100 metres long, as stated in the <I>Environmental
Statement
</I>(para 1.59, page 13) [COR/101]. The gallery will have a hermetic seal at the
access point. Through this hermetic seal ducting would introduce dry air at a
known and controlled rate, temperature and pressure. The return air would be
passed through a de-humidifier unit to measure the moisture removed by the
circulating air stream. Any free liquid water would be collected in gullies and
drained back through the hermetic seal for measurement and sampling. By these
means a mass balance of water would be obtained which enables estimates of
hydraulic conductivity, including that of the excavation disturbance zone, of a
lengthscale of about 100 metres to be inferred. This experiment is likely to be
initiated during Phase 3, though it would be possible to bring it forward should
this become necessary. The experiment is broadly comparable to the Ventilation
Test carried out by NAGRA in the Grimsel Test Site in Switzerland, as described
in the<I> Nagra Bulletin Special Edition 1988</I> (pages 46 to 49) [NRX/16/4],
and is illustrated schematically in <A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>.
Such an experiment is not possible in boreholes drilled from the surface.</P>
<P>5.10 The experiment will be located in a volume of rock selected during
Phase 3, or possibly during Phase 2 if it were to be brought forward. For
planning purposes, the experiment is assumed to be located off the SSE gallery
in Phase 3.</P>
<P>Rock Matrix Diffusion</P>
<P>5.11 The RCF is required to give direct access to, and measurements in,
fractures identified on the basis of their groundwater flow properties, and to
make measurements in situ with relatively little disturbance of the rocks.</P>
<P>5.12 The water filled fractures of the BVG are variable, natural systems. In
order to undertake meaningful in situ measurements relevant to rock matrix
diffusion in them, therefore, it is important to characterise them before
experiments are initiated. This is planned to be done in two stages before the
particular process of interest is studied within the fracture system:</P>
<UL>
<LI>characterise the geometry of the fracture system; and subsequently
</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>characterise the hydraulic behaviour of the fracture system.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.13 This two stage characterisation is undertaken by drilling boreholes
into the fracture system from insets in the galleries. The geometry of the
fracture system may then be inferred using a number of complementary techniques
in these boreholes including mapping of the drill core, borehole televiewer
examination of the borehole fractures, and geophysical techniques such as
seismic tomography. Complete and accurate characterisation of the geometry of
the fracture system is not essential because these features can be more fully
determined by drilling out large diameter cores from, or excavating into, the
experimental site to better examine it once the experiment has been completed.
Undue damage to the fracture system to be examined can be avoided using
excavation techniques developed at the Canadian URL in which the rock mass is
excavated by drilling closely spaced holes and subsequently splitting the rock
mass with hydraulic wedges located in the drill holes.</P>
<P>5.14 Once the geometrical and hydraulic characterisation work has been
adequately achieved, the experimental work may begin.</P>
<P>5.15 The intention is to study rock matrix diffusion in more than one site
in the Phase 2 galleries. These sites are currently planned to be of two types:</P>
<UL>
<LI>single fracture experiments, in which an individual fracture would be
identified, characterised and used as the test bed to measure rock matrix
diffusion; and
</LI>
<LI>fracture zone experiments, in which connected networks of fractures would
be identified, characterised and used as the test bed to measure rock matrix
diffusion.
</LI></UL>
<P>In practice more than one potential single fracture site and potential
fracture zone sites may be evaluated in the Phase 2 galleries prior to selection
for subsequent experimentation. Well characterised single fracture and fracture
zone sites are also likely to form good test beds for other experiments in
addition to those addressing rock matrix diffusion, including colloid transport
and gas migration experiments.</P>
<P>5.16 The rock matrix diffusion experiments comprise:</P>
<UL>
<LI>injection of non-sorbing tracers into the fracture system and collection
from sample points (i.e. other boreholes drilled as part of the characterisation
steps). The shapes of the breakthrough curves allow further characterisation of
the geometric and hydraulic properties of the fracture;
</LI>
<LI>injection of sorbing tracers into the fracture system;
</LI>
<LI>comparison of the shapes of the breakthrough curves for non-sorbing and
sorbing tracers will provide an indication of the extent to which sorption may
be expected to occur in the fracture and surrounding rock;
</LI>
<LI>comparison of the shapes of the breakthrough curves for tracers (both
non-sorbing and sorbing) of different diffusivities will provide an indication
of the extent to which rock matrix diffusion may be expected to occur in real
fractures, in situ in the BVG; and
</LI>
<LI>excavation or coring of the experimental site to measure the manner in
which the tracers have become distributed, and also the extent to which the
tracers have diffused into the rock matrix. The excavation, or coring, also
provides the final confirmation of the geometrical properties (shape and
dimensions) of the test bed fracture system, and allows analysis of the extent
to which sorbing tracers have been retarded by the fracture system as a measure
of the extent to which rock matrix diffusion may be expected to occur in real
fractures, in situ in the BVG.
</LI></UL>
<P>Many of these techniques have been developed and used in the Stripa Project,
and variants of them are common to a range of experiments in several other
international and national underground laboratories. It is not practical to
carry out experiments of this type in rocks at these depths from boreholes
drilled from the surface.</P>
<P>Colloid Transport</P>
<P>5.17 To address the issue of the existence of colloids in groundwater
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para6.36">para 6.36</A>), samples from carefully
drilled underground boreholes will be taken for analysis as part of the
geochemical sampling programme, referred to in the
<I>Environmental Statement
</I>(para 1.62, page 13) [COR/101]. These boreholes will be drilled from insets
in the galleries of Phase 2 and Phase 3 and will also include the Peripheral
Drilling underground boreholes described in paragraph 4.14. By drilling without
the use of conventional drilling muds, much of the particulate matter which may
be problematic in obtaining good groundwater samples in boreholes drilled with
mud may be avoided. Alternative drilling fluids include deionised or distilled
water and previously collected groundwater. These waters may be kept in pressure
vessels under nitrogen to control the dissolved gas content. Such techniques
have been developed in underground laboratories, including the HRL at &Auml;sp&ouml;
in Sweden. </P>
<P>5.18 The experiments envisaged to study colloid transport are similar to the
single fracture and fracture zone experiments for rock matrix diffusion. The
difference is that, instead of injecting sorbing tracers to study the extent to
which rock matrix diffusion is likely to occur, a range of different colloidal
suspensions would be injected. This allows the breakthrough of different
colloids to be compared with the non-sorbing tracer benchmark. The benefits of
such an approach would include the generation of experimental data on real
colloid transport processes within real, well characterised fractures in situ in
the BVG for the subsequent development of simple empirically based models of
colloid transport as outlined in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para6.38">para 6.38</A>). It is not practical to
carry out experiments of this type in rocks at these depths from boreholes from
the surface.</P>
<P>Gas Migration</P>
<P>5.19 The approach to studying gas migration processes within water filled
fractures in the BVG is similar to that described for in situ studies of rock
matrix diffusion. Studies of gas migration and two phase flow in the RCF will
follow groundwater flow studies. They will need to be located where fractures
and flow through the fractures have been previously characterised, as stated in
the <I>Environmental Statement </I>(para 1.63, page 13) [COR/101]. In practice,
it may be most efficient to complete the rock matrix diffusion experiments and
then initiate gas migration experiments in the same fracture systems. This would
have the substantial advantage that the test bed for the gas measurements would
be well characterised in advance of the introduction of a gas phase into the
fracture. This is particularly important for studies of two phase flow (i.e. a
gas and a liquid together in the same porous medium) because gas is a much more
mobile phase than water and its behaviour can be best studied in a system which
is reasonably well characterised. It is not practical to carry out experiments
of this type in rocks at these depths from boreholes drilled from the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.20"></A>5.20 There are currently two types of experiments
considered important to addressing gas migration:</P>
<UL>
<LI>measurements of gas entry pressure into fractures, in which the gas
pressure is steadily increased until the gas/water meniscus is sufficiently
small to penetrate the water wetted and water filled fracture aperture; and
</LI>
<LI>measurements of the two-phase flow characteristics of the fracture system.
</LI></UL>
<P><B>Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier</B></P>
<P>5.21 The observations described in paragraph 4.20 which will be carried out
during shaft sinking will also continue in Phase 2 and Phase 3 as an integral
part of mapping during gallery construction. Additionally, information from the
RCF is required to address the following induced changes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>chemical disturbance; and
</LI>
<LI>excavation disturbance.
</LI></UL>
<P>The current outline plans for activities to provide the required information
are described under these headings in the following paragraphs.</P>
<P>Chemical Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.22"></A>5.22 The experiments currently envisaged to address
chemical disturbance may be regarded as a variant of the rock matrix diffusion
experiments.</P>
<P>5.23 The objective will be to inject highly alkaline fluids, representative
of those emanating from the repository backfill, into well characterised
fracture systems. The presence of the alkaline fluids will cause fluid-rock
chemical reactions which could ultimately change the mineralogy of the fracture
surface and as a consequence also change the hydraulic properties of the
fracture system. The main fluid-rock reactions involved are believed to be
relatively slow and the experiments would be designed to build confidence in the
trends of changes to the rock properties rather than determining the long-term
characteristics of the disturbance zone by direct measurement.</P>
<P>Excavation Disturbance</P>
<P>5.24 The current assumption by Nirex is that the extent and magnitude of the
hydraulic characteristics of the excavation disturbance zone ('EDZ') will be
adequately determined by the end of Phase 1 for the purposes of informing the
decision on whether to propose development of a repository. Further work may
still be required to demonstrate the variation in hydraulic properties in the
disturbed zone as a function of gallery orientation in relation to the maximum
horizontal stress direction, and in the presence of faults or significant
flowing features. Currently, two further types of EDZ experiments are envisaged
for Phase 2 and Phase 3:</P>
<P>Stress-Dependent EDZ Experiments</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.25"></A>5.25 During Phase 2, the current intention is to
identify locations for two galleries within the BVG to enable two further
experiments on the excavation disturbance zone to be carried out (EDZ
experiments number two and three). The form of the experiments would be
essentially the same as that described in paragraphs 4.23 to 4.24. The
fundamental difference is that one of the galleries would be excavated in a
direction parallel to the direction of maximum horizontal stress, currently
assumed to be an azimuth of 165&#176;, and the other would be at a right angle
to it. This approach would allow the relationship between stress direction and
the extent and magnitude of the mechanical and hydraulic characteristics of the
excavation disturbance to be measured. As with EDZ experiment number one
described in paragraphs 4.23 to 4.24, the disturbances will be monitored
periodically over the long term throughout the remaining life of the facility.
These two experiments will be located in a volume of rock selected during Phase
2 gallery construction. For planning purposes they are currently assumed to be
located off the SSE gallery.</P>
<P>Mine Through Experiment</P>
<P>5.26 The mine through experiment is intended to measure the hydraulic and
mechanical changes induced in a significant fault or fracture zone when mined
through. This is therefore a specialised form of EDZ experiment, and is aimed at
investigating the extent to which excavating repository vaults and access
tunnels through such features is likely to induce significant hydraulic and
mechanical changes in the rock mass. The experimental arrangement is similar to
that for the EDZ tests outlined in paragraphs 4.23 to 4.24. The exact location
for this work would be dependent upon confirmation from mapping Phase 3
galleries and from underground drilling in Phase 3. This work would therefore be
completed during the latter part of Phase 3. The outline of the experiment as
currently envisaged is broadly comparable in outline to the Mine By experiment
completed in the Canadian URL, described in the <I>Experimental Programme for
the URL </I>(para 3.9, page 18) [NRX/16/3]. This experiment would complete the
extensive suit of activities designed to characterise the disturbances to the
rock mass caused by excavations of a repository.</P>
<P><B>Design and Construction of the Repository</B></P>
<P>5.27 The testing of our ability to make extrapolations throughout the BVG
rocks in the PRZ of the distribution of networks of connected fractures will
continue throughout Phase 2 and Phase 3. This will continue to be achieved by
making forward predictions of the expected geological and hydrogeological
characteristics of the BVG, and comparing these predictions with observational
data subsequently obtained from:</P>
<UL>
<LI>mapping the galleries;
</LI>
<LI>underground drilling from insets in the galleries;
</LI>
<LI>measurements of inflows to the excavations; and
</LI>
<LI>measurements of drawdown on the groundwater pressure monitoring system.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.28 The finalised location, orientation and layout of the repository vaults
in the rock mass would be confirmed on the basis of underground drilling from
the Phase 3 galleries, possibly along the line of the vaults.</P>
<P>Sealing</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.29"></A>5.29 To ensure post-closure safety of a potential
repository, it is important to demonstrate that man-made openings underground
can be sealed against water flow. Experiments will therefore be carried out on
the emplacement of seals in galleries, shafts and boreholes and on grouting of
fracture zones, to establish that the required properties of seal materials,
such as fluidity, durability or permeability (in set conditions) may be achieved
in situ. Additionally, it may be important to investigate the practicalities of
sealing the zone of excavation disturbance around openings or sealing fracture
zones around man-made openings. It is currently planned that experiments will be
implemented for shafts, galleries and boreholes. It is not an aim to evaluate
longevity of any emplacement. The general form of the experiments, or
demonstrations, will be to monitor the emplacement of seals to a stringent
quality plan. This will be followed by a period of monitoring to evaluate their
effectiveness. Finally, seals will be carefully excavated to determine the
uniformity and quality of their emplacement.</P>
<P>5.30 The location for the shaft seal experiment has not been finalised, but
for planning purposes is currently assumed to be constructed from galleries from
the North Shaft during Phase 2, as shown schematically in
<A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.4">Figure 5.4</A>. The details of the experiment
have not been finalised, and will be developed during Phase 1 in the light of
developing experience and understanding of the geotechnical environment in the
BVG. The current form of the experiment is to construct an experimental shaft
between two observation galleries (the upper and lower shaft seal roadways of
<A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.4">Figure 5.4</A>). Within the experimental
shaft, the walls will be mapped in detail, and a plug, or seal, located
approximately centrally as illustrated in
<A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.5">Figure 5.5</A>. Grouting above and below the
plug may be deployed. The emplacement and grouting will be carried out very
carefully, to stringent Quality Assurance guidelines. Over time, the hydraulic
performance of the seal will be tested by pressuring from the pressure chamber,
separated from the seal by the lower bulkhead shown in
<A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.5">Figure 5.5</A> and monitoring for the passage
of fluids in the leakage observation chamber separated from the seal by the
upper bulkhead, also shown in <A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.5">Figure 5.5</A>.
The experiment will be completed with excavation of the seal towards the end of
Phase 3 to observe and record the efficiency of the original emplacement
procedures.</P>
<P>5.31 The gallery seal experiments are likely to be comparable in form to
those indicated for the shaft seal experiments. The location for the gallery
seal experiments has not been finalised, but for planning purposes is currently
assumed to be off the SSE gallery. The gallery seal experiments will be
performed in two galleries during Phase 2, one parallel to the maximum
horizontal stress direction, currently assumed to be an azimuth of about 165&#176;,
and the other at a right angle to this direction. This will enable the
effectiveness of gallery seals to be evaluated as a function of stress
direction. As with the shaft seal experiment, the gallery seal experiments will
be concluded with excavation of the seals towards the end of Phase 3 to evaluate
the efficiency of the original emplacement. The actual locations will be
confirmed during Phase 2.</P>
<P>5.32 The borehole seal experiments are likely to be broadly comparable in
form to the shaft and gallery seal experiments. For planning purposes, the
location for the borehole seal experiments is currently assumed to be off the
upper shaft seal roadway, as shown in <A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.6">Figure
5.6</A>. The seal will be emplaced during Phase 2, and excavated for detailed
examination towards the end of Phase 3, as illustrated schematically in
<A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.7">Figure 5.7</A>.</P>
<P>5.33 During construction of the South Shaft there will be opportunities to
examine the seal emplaced in the shaft centre-line borehole, RCF3 which will be
sealed before shaft sinking commences.</P>
<P>5.34 Experiments to evaluate sealing of the fractures and the excavation
disturbance zone are likely to be undertaken at the site of one or more of the
EDZ experiments planned for Phases 2 and 3 and described in paragraphs 5.25 and
5.26, following completion of the experiments.

<P>6.2 As stated in the &quot;<I>Description of the Rock Characterisation
</I>Facility&quot; (&quot;<I>RCF Description</I>&quot;)(para 3.2, page 4)
[COR/111] the RCF galleries are intended to be developed at the repository
horizon. The repository may be developed at any depth between 650 metres bOD and
900 metres bOD. The currently preferred repository horizon is 650 metres bOD and
this depth is currently used as the baseline planning depth for the RCF
galleries. If the RCF galleries are to be constructed as deep as 900 metres bOD
then the duration of the RCF Programme (shown in
<A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>) would extend by a period
currently assumed to be about 4 months, assuming the durations of Phase 2 and
Phase  3 remained constant.</P>
<P>6.3 Subject to the granting of planning permission, construction of the RCF
is planned to commence in about July 1996.</P>
<P>Site Establishment</P>
<P>6.4 Site Establishment would commence with a cut and fill earthworks
operation designed to form a level platform providing the minimum working area
requirements for the RCF. Drainage would be established and the access road
constructed at this stage. The various structures required for the RCF would be
built as the prepared platform is made available for them. Services connections
would be established. The Longlands Farm buildings would be converted for use as
a visitor reception area and offices. Throughout Site Establishment the
hydrogeological baseline monitoring from the surface boreholes described in Dr
Chaplow's evidence will continue.</P>
<P>Phase 1</P>
<P>6.5 The shafts will be constructed through Sherwood Sandstone, Brockram and
the BVG. It will be necessary to undertake some form of ground treatment during
construction to control potential inflows of water into the shafts. The
technique which is likely to be employed is grout injection. Information from
the RCF boreholes will be used by the shaft sinker to determine areas where
ground treatment would be likely to be required. Additionally, the shaft sinker
will drill and test probe holes in advance of excavation to confirm ground
treatment. As explained in more detail in Section 4, valuable scientific
information will be derived from these probe holes and the ground treatment
itself. The sections of both shafts which will penetrate the sandstones will be
lined with concrete to form a hydrostatic lining which will restrict water
inflows from the sandstones as stated in the <I>RCF Description </I>(para 3.5,
page 4) [COR/111].</P>
<P>6.6 It will take approximately 3&#189; years to construct the South Shaft
and North Shaft to provide access to the galleries at 650 metres. Access to this
horizon will require a 30 metre deep sump at the bottom of each shaft below the
gallery horizon, taking the shafts to 680 metres bOD. As indicated in paragraph
6.2, the RCF galleries could be developed at any depth between 650 metres bOD
and 900 metres bOD. Shaft access to galleries at 900 metres bOD, together with a
35 metre deep sump, would result in a maximum shaft depth of 935 metres bOD. A
number of scientific activities (described in more detail in section 4) will be
integrated with construction throughout shaft sinking, which may be summarised
as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>mapping (described in paragraphs 4.4 and 4.5);
</LI>
<LI>hydraulic measurements(described in paragraphs 4.6 to 4.13); and
</LI>
<LI>excavation monitoring (described in paragraph 4.21).
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.7"></A>6.7 At 650 metres bOD the shafts will be connected by
a gallery to establish a ventilation circuit (see
<A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure6.1">Figure 6.1</A>). A telemetry room will be
constructed, adjoining the connecting gallery. The telemetry room will house
computing equipment which is needed to transmit data from the experiments of
Phase 2 and Phase 3 to the offices on the surface via fibre optic cables
installed in the shafts. If an horizon significantly deeper that 650 metres bOD
were to be selected for the RCF galleries then a second gallery connecting the
shafts would be constructed at this deeper horizon. Thereafter a series of
experimental activities (described in more detail in section 4) is planned to be
undertaken:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Peripheral Drilling to enable hydraulic testing of conductive features in
the BVG (described in paragraph 4.14); and
</LI>
<LI>EDZ experiment number one to measure the hydraulic and mechanical response
to excavation (described in more detail in paragraphs 4.23 and 4.24).
</LI></UL>
<P>Phase 2</P>
<P>6.8 It is important to retain sufficient flexibility in the RCF layout to
access particular features of interest in the rock mass, either by underground
drilling or excavation. It will not be possible to identify all those features
until construction is underway. For this reason, the layout of Phase 2 shown in
<A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure6.2">Figures 6.2</A> and
<A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure6.3">6.3</A> is indicative of the likely
underground excavations. The importance of a flexible approach to the design and
construction underground layout to achieve the information which is required is
explained in detail in Section 7. It is possible that, in firming up the layout
of the Phase 2 galleries, the timing or duration of construction might change in
detail from that indicated in the RCF Programme shown in
<A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.</P>
<P>6.9 Three main galleries at the horizon identified during Phase 1, each
about 150 metres in length, will be constructed During construction, mapping,
hydraulic measurements and excavation monitoring will be carried out. This is
likely to take about 6 months. It will enable the remaining Phase 2 Science
Programme to take place, during which testing of the BVG will be carried out
over a period of approximately 21 months. It may be advantageous to initiate
some, or all, of the Phase 2 gallery construction towards the end of Phase 1.
The advantages are two fold. Firstly, it would provide earlier opportunities to
undertake mapping, hydraulic measurements and excavation monitoring of BVG in
the PRZ in areas away from the shaft bottom in order to inform the decision to
propose development of a repository. Secondly, it is more practical and cost
effective to continue with the construction work from shaft sinking, and the
shaft sinker may be retained for this purpose. The current programme (<A
HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>) assumes that all of the Phase 2
gallery construction is completed towards the end of Phase 1.</P>
<P>Phase 3</P>
<P>6.10 Subject to the possibility of changes to the underground layout
described in paragraph 6.8, this will commence with the extension of two of the
Phase 2 galleries up to 375 metres and 600 metres in length and the addition of
three more galleries up to 200 metres in length (see
<A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure6.2">Figure 6.2</A>). During construction, mapping,
hydraulic measurements and excavation monitoring will be carried out, and this
will take some 8 months to complete and would enable the Phase 3 Science
Programme to proceed, as stated in the <I>RCF Description </I>(para 3.10, page
6) [COR/111]. This will take approximately 3 years following completion of
gallery construction. <A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure6.3">Figure 6.3</A>
illustrates the development if the shafts are deepened.</P>
<P><B>Underground Access Options</B></P>
<P>Shafts Versus Drifts</P>
<P>6.11 The RCF could achieve underground access to the BVG at the preferred
depth of 735 metres (650 metres bOD) by either inclined drifts or vertical
shafts, as stated in the <I>Environmental Statement</I> (para 2.69, page 29)
[COR/101].</P>
<P>6.12 It is important to be able to assess ground conditions ahead of
construction of either inclined drifts or shafts in order to avoid possible
inundation by water or collapse of the excavations due to unforeseen ground
conditions. The geology ahead of excavation can be predicted for a shaft by
means of a shaft centreline borehole. It is not practicable to drill a long
inclined borehole for the purposes of comparable prediction ahead of
construction for inclined drifts because of the greater distance and inherent
difficulty in keeping the borehole on the drift centreline. It is considered
that vertical shafts, with conditions proven initially by vertical centreline
boreholes, would best meet the requirement to be able to predict ground
conditions ahead of construction for the RCF. In general, shafts provide a more
economic means of primary access to rock at depth for underground excavations of
the limited scale required for the RCF. For these reasons, the option for
vertical shafts to gain underground access to the RCF was chosen as stated in
the <I>Environmental Statement </I>(para 2.72, page 30) [COR/101].</P>
<P>Number of Shafts</P>
<P>6.13 In excavation terms, the RCF will be similar to a deep mine and safety
considerations have been addressed as if it were a mine. The Mines (Safety of
Exits) Regulations 1988 require at least two separate exits to the surface in
most situations. While a single shaft could be appropriate to very limited
amount of gallery construction and exploratory work close to the shaft, two
shafts were deemed necessary to meet the safety requirements for all the phases
of the RCF.</P>
<P>Timing of Shafts</P>
<P>6.14 The programme shown in <A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>
requires the construction of both shafts to be completed, along with the
connecting gallery, before Phase 2 construction begins. This will provide two
separate exits to the surface for the initiation of the Peripheral Drilling and
EDZ experiments of Phase 1, and for the Construction of the Phase 2 galleries.</P>
<P><B>Shaft Construction Method</B></P>
<P>6.15 Three methods of shaft construction were considered - boring, drilling
and conventional shaft sinking (drill and blast), as stated in the <I>Environmental
Statement </I>(para 2.76, page 30) [COR/101].</P>
<P>Shaft Boring</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.16"></A>6.16 Shaft boring, in which the machine is operated
by men working underground on the body of the machine - rather like a tunnel
boring machine - is not an established method of construction for shafts at
these depths where there are no pre-existing underground workings for spoil
clearance via a pilot hole. The use of shaft boring was discounted for this
reason, leaving two methods for consideration.</P>
<P>Shaft Drilling</P>
<P>6.17 Shaft drilling has not been widely used in the UK, but is an accepted
and routine practice in some countries, though usually to shallower depths than
the RCF. Shaft drilling is similar to borehole drilling where the hole (shaft)
is kept filled with water or drilling mud and the rock fragments are removed by
the circulating fluid.</P>
<P>6.18 It is an important functional requirement for the RCF that the
construction method selected enables regular and routine access to the shaft
walls for mapping and other scientific measurements and observations during the
shaft sinking operation. During construction of the shaft by drilling there
would be no opportunity for immediate access to the shaft walls and the option
of shaft drilling was therefore discounted for this reason.</P>
<P>The Drill and Blast Method</P>
<P>6.19 The elimination of boring and drilling as options for construction of
the shafts leaves drill and blast as the preferred method, as stated in the <I>Environmental
Statement </I>(para 2.90, page 31) [COR/101]. In this method, a cycle of
drilling and blasting operations is used to construct the shaft. The cycle
starts with the drilling of holes in the rock, normally to a pre-determined
pattern, which are then charged with explosives. For the RCF shafts, the
pre-determined pattern will be designed to keep blast-induced damage to the rock
mass as low as practicable, as explained in more detail in paragraphs 6.26 to
6.28. The explosives are then detonated. Following blasting, fume clearance and
spoil removal, the newly exposed walls of the shaft can be temporarily
supported. Where an in situ concrete lining is used, then this will normally be
installed every few cycles of drilling and blasting.</P>
<P>6.20 The proposed depth of the access shafts will be well within the
capability of the drill and blast method, and the experience of shaft sinking
contractors worldwide. The RCF will therefore present no particular or unusual
technical difficulties with sinking, lining operations, groundwater control or
equipping the shaft.</P>
<P>6.21 During shaft sinking by the drill and blast method there will be
opportunity for regular and routine access to the rock mass for mapping and
other scientific measurements and observations (described in more detail in
Section 4). The information which is required from the RCF is therefore
generated continuously throughout, and as an integral part of, the shaft
construction operations.</P>
<P>6.22 Several countries have constructed underground research laboratories as
a part of their programmes into the deep geological disposal of radioactive
waste. Those countries which are investigating saturated, fractured igneous
rocks include Canada and Sweden. Each of these countries has selected the drill
and blast method as the principal method of gaining access to their underground
laboratory. Through its existing agreements with, and participation in these
programmes, the practical experience gained from using the drill and blast
method in these programmes will be used in constructing the RCF.</P>
<P>Shaft Diameter</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 The shafts have to be of such a diameter as to
provide working space for the construction workers and to provide working space
for the scientists to map and undertake scientific measurements on the rock
mass. The selection of shaft diameter is based on the advice and practical
experience of Nirex's mining consultants and in-house mining engineers. Small
diameter shafts in the range 3 to 4 metres could be constructed by the drill and
blast method and would satisfy the ventilation, transportation and technical
requirements for the RCF. However, 5 metres is considered to be the minimum
practical diameter to provide a safe and efficient working environment for the
shaft sinking personnel. A 5 metre internal finished diameter was selected for
both shafts.</P>
<P>6.24 In order to ensure that an internal finished diameter of 5 metres is
achieved, it is essential to drill and blast a slightly larger diameter than 5
metres. This is because the blast holes have to be drilled at a slight angle
(the so-called look-out angle) away from the vertical, in order to allow
clearance between the drill and the shaft wall. The look-out angle on a 5 metre
diameter shaft is likely to result in a maximum working diameter in the BVG of
about 5.4 metres. As noted in paragraph 4.18, the maximum working diameter of
the excavation through the sandstones would be up to about 7.4 metres in order
to accommodate the thickness of the hydrostatic lining.</P>
<P>6.25 The option of providing a small diameter drilled shaft as the second
means of egress was considered. Such a shaft was constructed, for example, at
the Canadian URL. However, the Canadian facility is very significantly shallower
than the RCF permitting a 240 metre deep, small diameter shaft to be drilled for
ventilation and emergency access. This option was rejected for the RCF on the
grounds that it may not provide safe and effective access under all operating
conditions, as stated in the <I>Environmental Statement </I>(para 2.75, page
30) [COR/101].</P>
<P><B>Drill and Blast Approach</B></P>
<P>6.26 In general terms, creating an excavation in rock at depth by any method
is likely to cause a zone of disturbance to be created around the excavation.
Within this zone the mechanical and hydraulic properties will be different to
some extent to those which existed before the excavation was created.</P>
<P>6.27 Creating an excavation in rock at depth by the drill and blast method
in particular can further add to the level of disturbance in the rock mass
adjacent to the excavation, particularly in the first few tens of centimetres
into the rock mass from the wall or face of the excavation. These additional,
blast induced, changes are termed blast-induced damage.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.28"></A>6.28 In order to keep blast-induced damage to the
rock mass as low as is practicable, Nirex has used international blast
consultants to review blast damage mechanisms relevant to construction of the
RCF shafts, the influence of blast design parameters on damage to the rock mass
and the likely extent and degree of damage to the rock mass from blasting in
shaft construction. A blast design philosophy has been developed for the RCF
shafts which incorporates a cautious blasting technique in order to keep
blast-induced damage to the rock mass as low as is practicable. This approach is
similar to the use of careful blasting techniques to minimise rock damage used
by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) in the construction of the Canadian
URL circular shaft extension, as stated in <I>Geological Characterisation for
the Underground Research Laboratory Shaft Extension</I> (&quot;<I>Geological
Characterisation for the URL</I>&quot;) (para 4.3, page 10) [NRX/16/5]. The
approach is also comparable to that developed by ANDRA in a smooth blasting
experiment carried out in the Canadian URL in 1991. The main result of the ANDRA
experiment was to prove that it was possible to reduce the extension of the
damage zone significantly (from less than one metre to 10 or 20 centimetres)
using gas-energy explosives combined with appropriate blast designs, as stated
in <I>ZEDEX Test Plan</I> (para 3.2, page 2) [NRX/16/1].</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.29"></A>6.29 Shaft blasting for the RCF will be performed
using full face blasting, utilising blast designs similar to those used in the
circular shaft extension of the Canadian URL. Even with the use of cautious
blasting described in paragraph 28, the excavation process will introduce
induced fractures into the rock mass. In general terms, induced fractures are
likely to be recognisable as distinct from natural fractures by their symmetry
relative to the shape of the excavation and to remnants of the blasting centres,
and by their lack of (natural) mineral infillings and wall rock alteration, as
shown by the Canadian programme of mapping shafts constructed in hard, fractured
rock by the drill and blast method, as stated in <I>Geological Characterisation
for the URL</I> (para B.4.1, page B.3) [NRX/16/5].</P>
<P><B>Gallery Construction Method</B></P>
<P>6.30 The method selected for constructing the RCF galleries is also drill
and blast. There are no practical, economic alternatives to this method for such
a limited extent of underground layout. This method was also used to construct
galleries in the Canadian URL, in the Swedish Stripa Project and in the Swedish
HRL. </P>
<P><B>Gallery Orientation</B></P>
<P>6.31 As set out in Dr Chaplow's evidence (
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14a1.htm#TA13">Table A.13</A>, Appendix A.35)[<B>PE/NRX/14</B>],
there is a significant contrast in the magnitudes of the horizontal stresses.
The ratio of maximum to minimum horizontal stress is about 1.8 at 800 metres
depth, with the maximum horizontal stress direction averaging an azimuth of 165&#176;.
In order to make measurements and observations on the extent to which this
contrast in stress magnitude matters to the creation of excavations in the BVG,
and in particular to the behaviour of the excavation disturbance zone, some of
the Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries are planned to be aligned approximately
parallel to, and others to be aligned approximately perpendicular to this
average azimuth of 165&#176;. This accounts for the orientations of the current
indicative layout of Phase 2 and Phase 3 shown in
<A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure6.2">Figures 6.2</A> and
<A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure6.3">6.3</A>.</P>
<P><B>7. <A NAME="APPROACH">APPROACH TO PLANNING AND MANAGING ACTIVITIES IN
THE RCF</A></B></P>
<P>7.1 A recurring theme in the work of all national and international
underground programmes evaluating deep disposal of radioactive wastes is that it
is essential to retain a sufficient degree of flexibility to adapt the layout of
the laboratory, the underground experiments or both to the geological conditions
as found underground. For example, one of the main conclusions (<I>Stripa
Project Overview</I> (para 7.1, page 89) [NRX/16/2]) from the international
co-operative underground research programme at Stripa, Sweden is:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Due to variability and uncertainty in the geological environment,
the site characterisation process should be iterative and adaptive</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.2 The Canadian research programme in the URL similarly found flexibility
essential<I> (Experimental Programme for the URL</I> (para 1.2 page 2)
[NRX/16/3]):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Flexibility was included in the design to accommodate the actual
ground conditions found during construction. In application, our initial URL
designs were based on the early characterisation data. As our understanding of
the rock mass in which we were working improved with additional characterisation
data, we adapted the URL layouts.&quot; &quot;For example, the 240 Level tunnel
direction was changed to avoid excavating into Fracture Zone 2 (FZ2), and the
tunnel layout and cross section were changed twice to achieve more stability
under the in situ stress conditions. In the shaft extension, the cross section
was made circular to better carry the increasing rock stress conditions</I>.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 The Swedish &Auml;sp&ouml; HRL operated by SKB has also found
flexibility to be essential (<I>&Auml;sp&ouml; Hard Rock Laboratory Annual
Report 1993</I> (para 3.2.1., page 22) [NRX/16/6]):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Operating Phase of the &Auml;sp&ouml; HRL will soon commence
and it was found essential that the layout of the laboratory be adapted to the
experiments planned for the Operating Phase and that potential experiment sites
be identified</I>.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 Nirex's own experience in planning and implementing the joint
SKB/ANDRA/Nirex ZEDEX Project located underground in the HRL at &Auml;sp&ouml;
has also confirmed the need for flexibility in both the details of the
experimental design and the exact location of excavations suitable to host
specific experiments, as indicated in the <I>ZEDEX Test Plan</I> (para 4.1,
page 4) [NRX/16/1].</P>
<P>7.5. It is therefore prudent to plan and manage the RCF on the basis that
changes in underground layout and/or the detail of the scientific activities are
likely. For this reason flexibility to adapt the underground layout and the
integrated science and construction programme (described in sections 4 and 5) is
essential.</P>
<P><B>Sectors</B></P>
<P>7.6 One of the main requirements of the RCF is to study networks of
connected fractures which control the flow of groundwater. These networks are
thought to be not uniformly distributed through the rock. Consequently, some
regions of rock may have networks of connected fractures passing through them,
whilst other regions of rock may have no networks of connected fractures passing
through them. </P>
<P>7.7 The approach which has been adopted for providing a flexible method of
managing activities in the RCF is to divide the shafts and galleries up into
sectors. The basic idea behind sectors is that there may be more potential for
providing the required information in one sector compared with another sector.
The detailed programmes of scientific activities for individual sectors,
therefore, will vary from sector to sector, according to the information which
is required.</P>
<P>7.8 The different sectors for Phase 1 are shown in
<A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure7.1">Figure 7.1</A>, which illustrates the twelve
sectors identified for use in managing the scientific programme if the Phase 2
and Phase 3 galleries are to be developed at 650 metres bOD. Should the Phase 2
and Phase 3 galleries be developed at a deeper horizon, then additional sectors
will be required, as shown in <A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure7.2">Figure 7.2</A>.
The definition and reasoning behind the Phase 1 sector boundaries is summarised
in <A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure7.1">Figure 7.1</A>.</P>
<P>7.9 Nirex will release results from Phase 1 by sector, following completion
of work in each sector. Results from Phase 1 will therefore be released
progressively and continuously throughout shaft sinking. Results and experience
in completed sectors will be used iteratively to adapt work programmes and the
detailed design for excavation in successive sectors.</P>
<P><B>Sector Test Plans</B></P>
<P>7.10 A sector test plan sets out the scientific activities and experiments
which are to be undertaken in an individual sector in order to provide
information which is required to address the uncertainties identified in Dr
Hooper's evidence. To design the tests in the light of the most up to date
information so that the 'best' test is performed, each Sector Test Plan will be
developed progressively in outline form until three months before it is needed
for implementation. Whilst in outline status, the Sector Test Plans may be
revised and updated in the light of results and understanding from previously
completed sectors and from the continuing site characterisation programme. This
approach to refining the experiments and experimental layout makes use of
experience gained in planning and managing underground experiments in other
facilities, as in the example of the <I>ZEDEX Test Plan</I> (para 5.1, page 13)
[NRX/16/1]. The programme of activities described in Section 4 is therefore a
summary of how activities carried out in all the sectors shown in
<A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure7.1">Figure 7.1</A> (and
<A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure7.2">Figure 7.2</A> if the shafts access an horizon
deeper than 650 metres bOD) will produce information of the first category
identified as a requirement Dr Hooper's evidence.</P>
<P><B>Forward Predictions</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.11"></A>7.11 The key to understanding how the RCF will be
used to reduce uncertainties and increase confidence lies in forward prediction,
as noted in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para6.10">paras 6.10</A> to 6.12). A forward
prediction is a description of significant findings which are expected to be
made in a particular sector, or experiment, before the sector is excavated or
the experiment is begun. The observations and findings of the sector, or
experiment, are subsequently compared with the predictions which were made
beforehand. By making a range of forward predictions based on alternative
conceptual models it should be possible to eliminate those conceptual models
which are least consistent with actual observations and significant findings.</P>
<P>7.12 Each sector and experiment in all three phases of the RCF will have
forward predictions completed before the sector is excavated, or before the
experiment is initiated. Reduction of specific uncertainty and increase in
confidence will follow where there is a reasonable match between a forward
prediction and actual observations. This approach is common to other national
and international underground programmes evaluating deep disposal of radioactive
wastes.</P>
<P><B>Duration of Phases</B></P>
<P>7.13 The current description of the RCF, and the working programme shown in
<A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>, assumes that the decision by
Nirex to propose development of a repository may be taken at the end of Phase 1.
However, should this decision by deferred into Phase 2 or Phase 3, the layout
and the programme and durations of Phase 2 and Phase 3 might need to be revised.
For the current working programme, the durations of the three phases of the RCF
are:</P>
<P>Phase 1 Science Programme : 4 years 2 months</P>
<P>Phase 2 Science Programme : 2 years 3 months</P>
<P>Phase 3 Science Programme : 3 years 8 months</P>
<P>As explained in paragraph6.9, it may be advantageous to initiate some, or
all, of the Phase 2 gallery construction towards the end of Phase 1. The start
of the Phase 2 Science Programme therefore overlaps with the end of the Phase 1
Science Programme by some 9 months, as shown in
<A HREF="nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>. The current estimate of total
elapsed time for all 3 Phases of the RCF Science Programme is therefore 9 years
and 4 months. This is broadly in line with the durations of underground
programmes planned in other countries, as explained in Dr Holmes' evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>). These timescales may be
distinguished from those of generic laboratories (i.e. not specific to a
potential repository location) which are primarily concerned with the
development of techniques. Nirex participates in, or has links with, several of
these generic laboratories which has enabled us to gain knowledge and experience
of planning and managing underground characterisation.</P>

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of

</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally.

</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)
</I>(&quot;<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>&quot;)<I> </I> [COR/605]

<P>&quot;<I>We have been impressed by the quality of individual items of
scientific work undertaken and commissioned by Nirex, which command high respect

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex site characterisation work at Sellafield has been of very

<P>&quot;<I>However, there is no reason to modify the view expressed in the
Thirteenth Annual Report to the effect that the work carried out for Nirex by
contractors (who are the contributors to Report No. 524) would, on detailed
review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Committee would record, again, its view that the field work,
and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as

<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<TR>
<TD WIDTH="96">Finland</TD>
<TD WIDTH="480">Detailed characterisation of three candidate sites commenced in
1993 following preliminary investigations at five sites. A decision to select
one site for a stage of underground investigations is planned for the year 2000,
eight years after the commencement of detailed site characterisation. An
underground laboratory is planned to operate over a seven year period between
2003 and 2010 leading to a decision on whether to apply for a construction

<TD WIDTH="96">France</TD>
<TD WIDTH="480">Three potential sites are being investigated for a deep
repository. Detailed surface-based characterisation began in 1994 and, by way of
example, at one site it has comprised 15 boreholes at least 300m deep
complemented by geophysical studies. It is planned to commence construction of
rock characterisation facilities on at least two of the sites in 1996, i.e. two
years after commencement of detailed surface-based characterisation.  A decision
on whether to propose a repository at one of the sites is planned for 2006. This
decision would therefore be made some 12 years after commencement of detailed
site characterisation.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>Germany</TD>
<TD>Detailed surface-based characterisation of a salt dome at Gorleben was
carried out over a six year period between 1979 and 1985. These surface-based
investigations comprised four deep boreholes, 44 shallower boreholes and
geophysical surveys. Excavations to enable underground investigations to be
undertaken commenced in 1986, some seven years after commencement of detailed
site investigation. If suitability of the site is confirmed, it is planned to
construct a repository which could be operational by 2008.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>Spain</TD>
<TD>Choice of a site for detailed characterisation is planned for the year
2000. It is then planned that a 15 year programme, comprising surface-based
investigations followed by a rock characterisation facility, will be carried out
prior to decisions on repository construction.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>Sweden</TD>
<TD>It is planned to carry out detailed site characterisation, initially
comprising boreholes and surface-based geoscientific surveys at two sites over a
four year period commencing in 1995. An underground laboratory would then be
constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground
data collection would continue during the repository construction phase leading
to a final safety report.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>Switzerland</TD>
<TD>Detailed characterisation of two potential sites is planned to be carried
out in the period from 1994 to 2000. Subsequently, an underground laboratory is
planned for one site to provide sufficient geological data to allow an
application for a repository construction licence.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>USA</TD>
<TD>Comprehensive detailed surface-based characterisation began at Yucca
Mountain in Nevada in 1991 following its designation in 1987 by Federal statute
as the candidate repository site. Construction of an underground laboratory
commenced in 1993. It is planned that this will lead to a decision on an
application for a licence in 2001 and, if this is approved, repository
construction would start in 2004, 13 years after the commencement of detailed
site characterisation.

<P>1.4 The assertions made in the Objectors' proofs, and which form the

</P>
<P><B>'Sellafield is a poor site'</B>
</P>
<P>1.6 The assertions by the Objectors that Sellafield is a 'poor' site take a
number of forms, which are summarised as follows:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>The site does not conform to generic characteristics of
a potential repository site.</B></U>This is the assertion made primarily by
Professor Mather (PE/CCC/4, paragraph 3.1).  He asserts that there are a number
of 'requirements' for a potential repository site and that the Sellafield site,
by not matching up to these 'requirements', should be regarded as a 'poor' site
and abandoned.  Dr Salmon (PE/FOE/5) makes similar assertions (paragraph 2.21,
page 17).
</TD></TR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">ii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>There are 'better' sites elsewhere in UK at which
further investigations should be concentrated.</B></U>This is a major assertion
by Professor Mather (PE/CCC/4, paragraphs 4.6 and 4.7) which follows from his
earlier assertion that Sellafield is a 'poor' site and should be abandoned. 
Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, because they adopt the position that
further investigations are required at Sellafield before construction of an RCF,
only refer in passing to the possibility that there may be 'better' sites
elsewhere.  Dr Haszeldine (PE/GNP/3, paragraph 16.10) suggests that alternative
sites be considered and investigated.  Mr Reeves (PE/FOE/4, paragraphs 2.2, 3.2,
4.4 and 8.7) asserts that other sites in the UK should be investigated to
provide a basis for selection of the optimal disposal site.  Dr Allison
(PE/FOE/7, paragraph 4.17) also asserts that alternative sites should be
investigated.

that it will never be possible to adequately characterise it.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>1.7 I disagree that Sellafield is a 'poor' site for a repository and firmly
believe that the results so far of the investigations and studies indicate that
the site shows good potential as a repository site.  I believe this because:

<P>1.8 The Objectors' assertions that Sellafield is a 'poor' site are based on
three flawed approaches, as follows:

Nirex's view is that the suitability of any particular site must be based on a
safety assessment of the predicted performance of the complete repository system
at that site.  Such an approach is not followed by the Objectors in asserting
that Sellafield is a 'poor' site based upon both qualitative 'criteria' which
were intended to assist in the early stages of area selection (for example
PE/CCC/4, paragraph 3.1; PE/FOE/5, paragraph 2.4) and qualitative
hydrogeological 'criteria' (for example PE/CCC/4, paragraph 6.2.9; PE/GNP/3,
paragraph 12.5);

(PE/CCC/4, paragraph 6.7.1) and patterns of groundwater flow (PE/CCC/4,

</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><B>'The RCF will not take us forward'</B>
</P>
<P>1.9 There are two main themes within the Objectors' evidence that can be
grouped under this general heading, namely:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>the RCF will not provide sufficient information</B></U>to
establish whether the site will prove suitable for a repository because it is
impossible ever to characterise a complex site to the extent required (for
example PE/CCC/4, paragraph 5.7; PE/FOE/2, paragraph 5.1; PE/FOE/7, paragraph
4.14); and

<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>the RCF will not provide important information</B></U>(for
example, on the regional hydrogeology PE/CCC/4, paragraph 7.2) needed to assess
the suitability of the site.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><U>Sufficiency of Information</U>
</P>
<P>1.10 I disagree with the first theme on the grounds of a fundamental
difference in the apparent approach of the Objectors and Nirex as to how to
treat spatial variability (heterogeneity, or 'complexity') in constructing
groundwater flow and radionuclide transport models.  Whilst the Objectors
appear, on the whole, to expect precise deterministic characterisation of the
whole flow system to be necessary to build an adequate model, Nirex is adopting
state-of-the-art geostatistical techniques which use a stochastic description of
the flow system built on a limited programme of observations and experiments. 
The Nirex approach is held in common with most organisations concerned with
evaluating flow and transport in heterogeneous systems.
</P>
<P><U>Importance of Information</U>
</P>
<P>1.11 A particular issue raised by the Objectors is that the RCF will not
provide information on issues of importance to the establishment of the
potential of the site to host a repository.  For example, the extent to which
the RCF will provide information on the regional hydrogeology has been
questioned (PE/CCC/4, paragraph 7.2).  I do not agree with this assertion.
</P>
<P><B>'The RCF is Premature'</B>
</P>
<P>1.12 A consistent theme within the Objectors' evidence is that the RCF is
premature.  Two main assertions are made, namely:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>Further work is required before an RCF is constructed.</B></U>Dr
Haszeldine (PE/GNP/3, paragraphs 5.6, 9.8, 14.1, 14.22 and 16.6), Drs Green and
Western (PE/FOE/1, paragraphs 9.7 and 10.5), Professor Smythe (PE/FOE/3,
paragraphs 7.9, 8.7, 9.10, 10.3 and 10.8), Mr Reeves (PE/FOE/4, paragraph 8.5),
Dr Salmon (PE/FOE/5, paragraphs 5.5 and 6.1-6.6), Dr Hencher (PE/FOE/6,
paragraphs 6.20, 10.8, 11.8 and 12.3) and Dr Allison (PE/FOE/7, paragraphs 4.43
and 6.20) all assert to varying extents, that additional work needs to be
undertaken before construction of an RCF at Sellafield should commence.  In
asserting that additional work is required to characterise the site prior to
construction of an RCF, the Objectors are presumably conceding that the site may
hold sufficient promise ultimately to justify construction of an RCF and hence,
hold potential as a repository site.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">ii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>The hydrogeological baseline conditions have not been
established.</B></U>This argument (PE/FOE/4, paragraph 8.5; PE/FOE/5, paragraph
5.5) is used to assert that additional periods of monitoring are required of 4
or 5 years to establish baseline and therefore, that the RCF is premature.  The
subject of baseline is addressed in <A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#Appendix2">Appendix 2</A>
of <B>PE/NRX/14</B> and in section 10 of this supplementary proof.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>1.13 The RCF is an important part, but nonetheless only a part, of an
integrated programme of site characterisation activities.  Thus further
surface-based investigations, laboratory tests, interpretation and modelling are
being undertaken in parallel with the RCF (see <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Table6.3">Table
6.3</A>, <B>PE/NRX/14</B>).  Those investigations which are required before the
RCF construction starts have either been carried out, are in progress or are
planned for completion prior to commencement of the RCF.  There are other
investigations which are located outside the area of influence of the RCF which
can proceed in parallel with the RCF and do not therefore need to be undertaken
before RCF construction commences.
</P>
<P>1.14 I believe that baseline conditions have been established.  This has
been confirmed by a review undertaken for Nirex by Professor Lloyd (Professor of
Hydrogeology at University of Birmingham) [NRX/14/3].  A further two years of
monitoring will be undertaken before RCF construction commences.
</P>
<P><B>Technical Issues</B>
</P>
<P><U>Generic characteristics of a potential repository site</U>
</P>
<P>1.15 Professor Mather, in paragraph 3.1 (PE/CCC/4, page 5) states that there
are
<I>&quot;requirements of a geological barrier&quot;</I> and lists a series of
characteristics which he states are those listed in paragraphs 3.2.6 and 3.2.7
of Nirex Report 71 (<I>PERA</I>) [COR/501].
</P>
<P>1.16 Dr Salmon (PE/FOE/5) seeks to make a similar point in section 2 of his
evidence.  At paragraph 2.4 (page 6) he identifies what he states to be <I>&quot;key
hydrogeological criteria for the assessment of environmental suitability for
radioactive waste disposal&quot;</I>.  He then concludes in paragraph 2.21 (page
17) that <I>&quot;I consider that the Sellafield site does not satisfy at least
two of the hydrogeological criteria previously considered as necessary
pre-requisites for the construction of a deep radioactive waste repository&quot;</I>.
</P>
<P>1.17 The issue of geological criteria is addressed at
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12s1.htm#Para6.24">paragraphs 6.24</A> to 6.28 of Mr
Folger's supplementary proof (<B>PE/NRX/12/S1</B>).  As indicated there, the
suitability of any particular site must be based on a safety assessment of the
predicted performance of the complete repository system of the site, not on
criteria for site performance in relation to particular attributes.
</P>
<P>1.18 A similar point arises from sections 3 and 4 of Professor Mather's
evidence (PE/CCC/4) in which he asserts that:

<P>1.21 These are the characteristics of the environments described by
Bredehoeft and Maini (CCC/4/1).
</P>
<P>1.22 I disagree with the approach taken by Professor Mather and Dr Salmon in
seeking to compare conditions at Sellafield with secondary qualitative criteria
set up to assist is identifying suitable generic sites for investigation.  The
appropriate basis for assessing the suitability of a site that has been
investigated is by carrying out safety assessment studies and comparing the
results with regulatory requirements.  Nirex has presented a preliminary
assessment for the groundwater pathway at Sellafield in  Nirex 95 [COR/522]. 
Nevertheless, Sellafield does demonstrate the characteristics of a BUSC site
described at paragraph 6.3.3 in Nirex Report 71 [COR/501] and of the examples
given in the Bredehoeft and Maini paper (CCC/4/1).
</P>
<P><U>Alternative Sites</U>
</P>
<P>1.23 Professor Mather makes a number of statements about Sellafield and
possible alternative sites in paragraphs 4.6 and 4.7 of his evidence (PE/CCC/4).
 In particular he asserts that the Tremadoc rocks in the area of East Central
England are likely to be far less complex than the BVG.  I am not aware of any
evidence to support this view, and he refers to none.
</P>
<P>1.24 In respect of Professor Mather's <I>&quot;inherently less robust&quot;</I>
(paragraph 4.6, PE/CCC/4) point it is acknowledged that there could be other
sites that would offer lower levels of post-closure radiological risk to an
individual, but the pursuit of risks below the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> design target is
not a requirement of government policy or the regulators (see Mr Folger's
supplementary proof (<B>PE/NRX/12/S1</B>)
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12s1.htm#Para6.3">paragraphs 6.3</A> to 6.5).  However,
whereas we now have a very substantial base of knowledge  on the characteristics
of the site at Sellafield, knowledge of the alternatives described by Professor
Mather is comparatively sparse.  It cannot be assumed therefore that any
specific alternatives would necessarily be more robust in radiological terms.
</P>
<P>1.25 Dr Haszeldine (paragraph 16.10, PE/GNP/3), Mr Reeves (paragraphs 2.2,
3.2, 4.4 and 8.7, PE/FOE/4), and Dr Allison ( paragraph 4.17, PE/FOE/7) all
state their view that alternative, unspecified sites should be investigated.  No
evidence, other than their assertions that Sellafield is a 'poor' or 'marginal'
site, is presented by them to support the investigation of these unspecified
alternative sites.
</P>
<P><U>Complexity</U>
</P>
<P>1.26 Professor Mather (PE/CCC/4, for example paragraph 8.6), Dr Kokelaar
(paragraphs 3.3, 4.1 and 5.1; PE/FOE/2), Dr Allison (paragraph 4.14; PE/FOE/7)
and Dr Salmon (paragraph 2.8, PE/FOE/5) make repeated claims that the Sellafield
site is complex.  Complexity is something that must be addressed in a safety
assessment and which influences the design of the investigation programme and
modelling approach, it is not a disqualifier of a site.  Natural complexity has
been addressed in an appropriate way by Nirex.
</P>
<P><U>Geology</U>
</P>
<P>1.27 Dr Kokelaar states his view (paragraph 5.1; PE/FOE/2) that the BVG has
exceptional geological complexity that renders prediction of the 3-D
distribution of the rocks and fractures extremely difficult.  His evidence
exaggerates the complexities.  The taking of a variety of features of the BVG in
the Lake District and implying that they all apply to the local area of the RCF
and PRZ is misleading.
</P>
<P>1.28 Professor Smythe, by selectively presenting information, has sought to
undermine the geological interpretations presented by Nirex in order to justify
the need for a 3-D seismic survey (paragraphs 10.2 and 10.8; PE/FOE/3).  Not
only is it considered that the claims made by Professor Smythe concerning the
interpretations of the structural geology are unjustified, but he has also
failed to appreciate that the evidence presented by Nirex already includes
proposals to carry out such a survey prior to the commencement of RCF
construction.
</P>
<P><U>Groundwater flow through fractured rock</U>
</P>
<P>1.29 Professor Mather and Dr Haszeldine have asserted that only a single
fracture in the rock could render the site unsuitable and, by applying
inappropriate secondary hydrogeological 'criteria' have sought to demonstrate
that the Sellafield site is unsuitable (paragraph 6.29, PE/CCC/4; paragraph
12.5, PE/GNP/3).
</P>
<P>1.30 They  have used an inappropriate basis for relating small scale
measurements in boreholes to the large scale characteristics of the rock mass as
a whole in order to represent the site in a way that is incompatible with large
scale measurements made at the site.
</P>
<P>1.31 Dr Haszeldine has reported some alternative groundwater flow modelling
and sought to demonstrate that it indicates results which are significantly
different from those reported by Nirex (PE/GNP/3, paragraph 7.27).
</P>
<P>On the basis of a review of the modelling work undertaken by Dr Haszeldine
it is concluded that the differences he reports between his modelling and that
undertaken by Nirex arise for the following reasons:

Haszeldine's models would produce results broadly comparable to those presented
in much more detail by Nirex in Nirex 95 [COR/522].  These results indicate that
the site is likely to meet the regulatory safety requirements.

the site is likely to meet regulatory safety requirements.  Hence there is no
reason why the RCF should not proceed to provide the necessary information to
allow Nirex to decide whether to proceed with a planning application for a
repository.

<P>1.36 My review of the Objectors' assertions that further surface-based
investigations are required before the RCF is constructed has revealed that
their recommendations are already largely included in the integrated programme
of site characterisation works being undertaken by Nirex and that, where
necessary, these can be completed before the programmed date for commencement of
the RCF or can proceed in parallel with the RCF.

<P><U>Comparison with investigation practices elsewhere</U>
</P>
<P>1.45 Dr Haszeldine and Professor Smythe seek to draw comparisons between the
Nirex investigations and the practices in the oil industry to seek to
demonstrate that the approach and timescales adopted by Nirex are inappropriate
(PE/FOE/3, paragraph 7.14 and PE/GNP/3, paragraph 6.3).
</P>
<P>1.46 The programme presented by Dr Haszeldine for the Nirex investigations
is wrong and understates the duration of the Nirex scientific programme.  The
duration of the Nirex investigations is longer than he quotes for investigations
in the oil industry.
</P>
<P>1.47 The investigation practices adopted by Nirex and the oil industry are
substantially similar, the differences reflecting that Nirex is assessing the
suitability of a site for a radioactive waste repository and not exploring for
oil or gas.
</P>
<P><U>Conclusions</U>
</P>
<P>1.48 My supplementary proof has demonstrated the inappropriate use by the
Objectors of geological and hydrogeological 'criteria' in an attempt to suggest
that the Sellafield site has little potential as a repository site.
</P>
<P>1.49 The results of the investigations carried out by Nirex have been
translated through the Nirex 95 studies [COR/522] into assessments of risk that
can be compared with regulatory safety requirements.  These studies indicate
that the site has good potential as a repository site.
</P>
<P>1.50 I have indicated that those surface-based investigations which are
relevant to the assessment of the site to host a repository are planned or are
programmed by Nirex either to be completed prior to commencement of the RCF,
where necessary or appropriate, or to proceed in parallel with the RCF where
this is appropriate.
</P>
<P>1.51 Baseline hydrogeological conditions have been established and a further
two years of monitoring will be completed before commencement of RCF shaft
sinking.  There is no justification for the duration of monitoring claimed, by
the Objectors, as being required before the RCF commences.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>The site does not conform to generic characteristics of
a potential repository site.</B></U>This is the assertion made primarily by
Professor Mather (PE/CCC/4, paragraph 3.1).  He asserts that there are a number
of 'requirements' for a potential repository site and that the Sellafield site,
by not matching up to these 'requirements', should be regarded as a 'poor' site
and abandoned.  Dr Salmon (PE/FOE/5) makes similar assertions (paragraph 2.21,
page 17).  This point is dealt with in section 3 of this supplementary proof.

by Professor Mather (PE/CCC/4, paragraphs 4.6 and 4.7) which follows from his
earlier assertion that Sellafield is a 'poor' site and should be abandoned. 
Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, because they adopt the position that
further investigations are required at Sellafield before construction of an RCF,
only refer in passing to the possibility that there may be 'better' sites
elsewhere.  Dr Haszeldine (PE/GNP/3, paragraph 16.10) suggests that alternative
sites be considered and investigated.  Mr Reeves (PE/FOE/4, paragraphs 2.2, 3.2,
4.4 and 8.7) asserts that other sites in the UK should be investigated to
provide a basis for selection of the optimal disposal site.  Dr Allison
(PE/FOE/7, paragraph 4.17) also asserts that alternative sites should be
investigated.  This point is dealt with in sections 4 and 5 of this

</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>2.6 I disagree that Sellafield is a 'poor' site for a repository and firmly

the site shows good potential as a repository site.  I believe this because:

Nirex's view is that the suitability of any particular site must be based on a
safety assessment of the predicted performance of the complete repository system
at that site.  Such an approach is not followed by the Objectors in asserting
that Sellafield is a 'poor' site based upon both qualitative 'criteria' which
were intended to assist in the early stages of area selection (for example
PE/CCC/4, paragraph 3.1; PE/FOE/5, paragraph 2.4) and hydrogeological 'criteria'
(for example PE/CCC/4, paragraph 6.2.9; PE/GNP/3, paragraph 12.5);

</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><U>Sufficiency of Information</U>
</P>
<P>2.9 I disagree with the first theme on the grounds of a fundamental
difference in the apparent approach of the Objectors and Nirex as to how to
treat spatial variability (heterogeniety, or 'complexity') in constructing
groundwater flow and radionuclide transport models.  Whilst the Objectors
appear, on the whole, to expect precise deterministic characterisation of the
whole flow system to be necessary to build an adequate model, Nirex is adopting
state-of-the-art statistical techniques which use a stochastic description of
the flow system built on a limited programme of observations and experiments. 
The Nirex approach is held in common with most organisations concerned with
evaluating flow and transport in heterogeneous systems.  This is discussed in
detail in section 5 of this proof.
</P>
<P><U>Importance of information</U>
</P>
<P>2.10 A particular issue raised by the Objectors is that the RCF will not
provide information on issues of importance to the establishment of the
potential of the site to host a repository.  For example, the extent to which
the RCF will provide information on the regional hydrogeology has been
questioned (PE/CCC/4, paragraph 7.2).  I do not agree with this assertion and
state my reasons in <A HREF="#Para8.79">paragraphs 8.79</A> to 8.88 of this
supplementary proof.
</P>
<P><B>'The RCF is Premature'</B>
</P>
<P>2.11 A consistent theme within the Objectors' evidence is that the RCF is
premature.  Two main assertions are made, namely:

undertaken before construction of an RCF at Sellafield should commence.  In
asserting that additional work is required to characterise the site prior to
construction of an RCF, the Objectors are presumably conceding that the site may
hold sufficient promise to ultimately justify construction of an RCF and hence,
hold potential as a repository site.

<P>2.12 The RCF is an important part, but nonetheless only a part, of an

the RCF construction starts have either been carried out, are in progress or are
planned for completion prior to the commencement of the RCF.  There are other
investigations which are located outside the area of influence of the RCF which
can proceed in parallel with the RCF and do not therefore need to be undertaken
before RCF construction commences.  These issues are addressed in  section 8of
this supplementary proof  in paragraphs <A HREF="#Para8.89">8.89</A> to 8.95.

<P>2.13 I believe that baseline conditions have been established.  This has

<P><B>Qualitative 'Criteria' - General</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para3.1"></A>3.1 Professor Mather, in paragraph 3.1 (PE/CCC/4,
page 5) states that there are
<I>&quot;requirements of a geological barrier&quot;</I> and lists a series of
characteristics which he states are those listed in paragraphs 3.2.6 and 3.2.7
of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501].  In fact, his list is his own interpretation of that
given in paragraphs 3.2.6 and 3.2.7 of  <I>PERA</I>.
</P>
<P>3.2 Dr Salmon (PE/FOE/5)  makes a similar point in section 2 of his
evidence.  At paragraph 2.4 (page 6) he identifies what he states to be <I>&quot;key
hydrogeological criteria for the assessment of environmental suitability for
radioactive waste disposal&quot;</I>.  He then concludes in paragraph 2.21 (page
17) that <I>&quot;I consider that the Sellafield site does not satisfy at least
two of the hydrogeological criteria previously considered as necessary
pre-requisites for the construction of a deep radioactive waste repository&quot;</I>.
</P>
<P>3.3 The issue of geological 'criteria' is addressed at
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12s1.htm#Para6.24">paragraph 6.24</A> to 6.28 of Mr
Folger's supplementary proof of evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12/S1</B>).   As indicated
there, the suitability of any particular site must be based on a safety
assessment of the predicted performance of the complete repository system at the
site, not on criteria for site performance in relation to particular attributes.
</P>
<P><B>Sellafield as a BUSC Site</B>
</P>
<P>3.4 A similar point arises from sections 3 and 4 of Professor Mather's
evidence (PE/CCC/4) in which he indicates that, &quot;<I>The 'BUSC' concept</I>
[low permeability basement under sedimentary cover]<I> (Figure 1c) was
identified</I>
<I>as</I> <I>providing the best overall performance of land-based options with
respect to post-closure radiological safety</I>&quot;<I> </I>(PE/CCC/4,
paragraph 3.3, page 9), but asserts that the Sellafield site <I>&quot;has none
of the hydrogeological characteristics associated with the BUSC concept&quot;</I>
(PE/CCC/4, paragraph 4.4, page 11).
</P>
<P>3.5 Specifically, Professor Mather seeks to cast doubt on the suitability of
the Sellafield site generally by claiming in paragraph 4.4 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;The geological situation is markedly different in the Sellafield
'variant', where basement rocks crop out some 2.5 km away from the potential
repository site.  Groundwater recharge to these rocks at outcrop will provide a
driving force for groundwater to flow through the repository volume.  Thus, from
first principles, Sellafield has an inherent flaw in comparison to the original
BUSC concept, with a much greater potential for groundwater circulation within
the basement rocks.  In fact, Sellafield bears no relationship to a BUSC site
nor can it be considered as a 'variant'.  It has none of the hydrogeological
characteristics associated with the BUSC concept, and its designation as a BUSC
'variant' appears to be an attempt to force it to fit one of the hydrogeological
environments defined in Nirex Report No 71 (COR/501).&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><U>Point 3.6.i</U>
</P>
<P>3.7 In a similar way to that discussed at paragraphs 3.1 and 3.3 above
regarding generic characteristics of repository sites, Professor Mather is
suggesting that comparison between an actual site and qualitative
characteristics of generic sites, in this case the BUSC concept, is an
appropriate method of assessing the suitability of the site.  For the same
reasons as those summarised in  paragraph 3.3 above, Professor Mather's approach
is inappropriate.  Conclusions on the suitability of an actual site must be
based on a safety assessment of the complete repository system at the site.
</P>
<P><U>Point 3.6 ii</U>
</P>
<P>3.8 In <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], Nirex described the geological setting of a
BUSC environment as (paragraph 6.3.3, page 42):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;(d) Low Permeability Basement Under Sedimentary Cover (BUSC):
groundwater movement will dominantly occur in the sedimentary cover, with little
anticipated connection to the basement rocks of low intrinsic permeability.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.9 While expressing reservations about inter-relationships between flow
regimes, Professor Mather at paragraph 6.6.7 of PE/CCC/4 appears  implicitly to
accept the overall conceptual model of the Sellafield site in which groundwater
flow is dominantly in the sedimentary cover with an underlying lower
permeability basement through his statement that <I>&quot;It is concluded that
the conceptual model of the hydrogeology proposed by Nirex is a useful
simplification&quot;</I></P>
<P>3.10 That groundwater flow at Sellafield is dominantly occurring in the
sedimentary cover, and there is little anticipated connection to the basement
rocks of low intrinsic permeability are both conclusions in my evidence (<A
HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.70">paragraphs 6.70</A> to 6.73 on pages 45-47 of <B>PE/NRX/14</B>).
</P>
<P>3.11 The same conclusions are reached from the modelling undertaken in Nirex
95 [COR/522].  In section 2.1.3 on page 2.5 of Volume 3 it states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The largest groundwater flows are in the Near-Surface Calder
Sandstone and the Near-Surface St Bees Sandstone......There are weak fluxes of
groundwater between these units and the underlying rocks, which have lower
permeability.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para3.12"></A>3.12 Hence, while suitability of a site is not a
question of whether or not it conforms to a particular definition of BUSC, it is
the case that Sellafield demonstrates those characteristics identified with BUSC
in<I> PERA</I> [COR/501].
</P>
<P><U>Point 3.6 iii</U>
</P>
<P>3.13 In paragraph 3.4 of PE/CCC/4 Professor Mather indicates that the BUSC
concept originates from a paper by Bredehoeft and Maini (CCC/4/1).  Bredehoeft
and Maini do not use the term 'Basement under sedimentary cover' and therefore
do not provide a definition of the term.  In fact there is no widely agreed
definition.  Nirex's view of the key characteristics of the BUSC concept is
given at paragraph 6.3.3 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] as reproduced at paragraph
3.8 above.
</P>
<P>3.14 In paragraph 3.4 CCC/4/1, Professor Mather appears to be incorrect in
describing Bredehoeft and Maini's assessment by stating:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;In the example they give the cover rocks are shales with a
downward hydraulic gradient isolating groundwater beneath.  This contrasts
markedly with the situation in which the cover rocks are permeable sandstones
used as an aquifer.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.15 Bredehoeft and Maini give two examples, neither of which matches
Professor Mather's description.  The first example of a coastal site is a direct
analogue of the Sellafield situation; the second example is of an inland site
and is similar to Nirex's generic BUSC environment as described in paragraph
6.3.3 of PERA [COR/501].  In both examples, permeable sandstone aquifers are a
component of the cover sequence.

<P><B>Conclusion</B>
</P>
<P>3.18 To summarise, therefore, I disagree with the approach taken by
Professor Mather and Dr Salmon in seeking to compare conditions at Sellafield
with secondary qualitative &quot;criteria&quot; set up to assist in identifying
suitable generic sites for investigation.  The appropriate basis for assessing
the suitability of a site that has been extensively investigated is by carrying
out safety assessment studies and comparing the results with regulatory
requirements.  Nevertheless, Sellafield does demonstrate the characteristics of
a BUSC environment described at paragraph 6.3.3 in <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and of
the examples given in the Bredehoeft and Maini paper (CCC/4/1).
</P>
<P><A NAME="Alternative"></A><B>4. ALTERNATIVE SITES</B></P>
<P>4.1 In paragraph 4.6 of his evidence (PE/CCC/4, pages 11 and 13), Professor
Mather describes Sellafield as &quot;<I>inherently less robust</I>&quot; than
the large area of  East Anglia and east-central England identified in <I>PERA</I>
[COR/501] as potentially suitable BUSC rocks.  At paragraph 4.7 he indicates
that, &quot;<I>The Tremadoc rocks in the area of East Central England defined
by Chapman, McEwen and Beale (1986) (COR/614) are likely to be far less complex
that the BVG</I> ....&quot;.
</P>
<P>4.2 In relation to Professor Mather's comparison of the characteristics of
the BVG and the Tremadoc rocks, he does not present any evidence to support his
view that the Tremadoc rocks &quot;<I>are likely to be far less complex than
the BVG</I>&quot; and I am not aware that any such evidence exists.  Since the
compilation of the description of the possible basement geology that underpinned
the work presented in <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and COR/614, there has been
extensive interpretation of geophysical surveys over the area, and these have
indicated more variety and complexity in the nature of the basement rocks than
then considered.  There has been very limited deep drilling and this has only
penetrated a few metres into the basement rocks.  It has confirmed their variety
and structural complexity.  Much of this research has been published by the
British Geological Survey and others (see for example,  <I>The contribution of
palaeontological data to an understanding of the early Palaeozoic  framework of
Eastern England </I>[NRX/14/4]).  The main observations are summarised as
follows:</P>

<TD WIDTH="800">These rocks comprise mudrocks (mudstones, shales and
siltstones), sandstones, volcanic rocks and igneous intrusives.  The so-called
Tremadoc rocks are the time equivalents of the Skiddaw Group, the volcanic rocks
are, in part, time equivalents of the Borrowdale Group.  Rocks of similar age
and lithology to the Windermere Group have also been proved.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">iii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">The boreholes are insufficient in number to allow confident

<TD WIDTH="800">The rocks are folded, and metamorphosed, and in terms of their
fold structure, cleavage, fracture density and the presence of fault-zones and
shear-zones are directly comparable to the similar age Skiddaw, Borrowdale and
Windermere Groups of the Lake District or the Lower Palaeozoic rocks of the
Brabant Massif of Belgium.  NRX/14/4 (published in 1991) describes some of the
Tremadoc rocks encountered in the boreholes drilled in the Midlands.  The author
uses phases such as <I>&quot;Dips are steep, between 70&#176; and vertical. 
The Tremadoc strata are folded and faulted, and high proportion of beds are
inverted&quot;</I> and <I>&quot;Dips are steep (60&#176; to vertical) and there

<P>4.3 It is unlikely, therefore, that the Tremadoc rocks in the area of
east-central England are far less complex than the BVG.
</P>
<P>4.4 More generally, data on the hydrogeological characteristics of deep
basement rocks in the UK are sparse as recognised in a recent report
commissioned from the British Geological Survey by Nirex (<I>Use of a &quot;groundwater
return index&quot; in site selection for deep radioactive waste repositories: a
review of the RWMAC/ACSNI proposal</I> [NRX/14/5]).  The conclusions of this BGS
review include the following statements in section 4 on pages 10 and 11:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;(iii) In application to deep, low permeability formations
potentially suitable for radioactive waste disposal, values of hydrogeological
indices are particularly difficult to estimate because of the scarcity of
reliable data, especially for hydraulic conductivity.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>(iv) Hydraulic conductivity data for such formations are particularly
lacking (in the UK as elsewhere) and subject to particular uncertainty, because
of the difficulties in predicting the influence of faults and other fractures&quot;.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.5 In respect of Professor Mather's <I>&quot;inherently less robust&quot;</I>
point it is acknowledged that there could be other sites that would offer lower
levels of post-closure radiological risk to an individual, but the pursuit of
risks below the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> design target is not a requirement of
government policy or the regulators (see Mr Folger's supplementary proof (<B>PE/NRX/12/S1</B>)
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12s1.htm#Para6.3">paragraph 6.3</A> to 6.5).  However,
whereas we now have a very substantial base of knowledge  on the characteristics
of the site at Sellafield, knowledge of the alternatives described by Professor
Mather is comparatively sparse.  It cannot be assumed therefore that any
specific alternatives would necessarily be more robust in radiological terms.

Sellafield Site.  For example at paragraph 5.7 on page 16 of PE/CCC/4 he states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;the complex nature of the geology, and particularly the faulting,
makes the controls on groundwater flow much more difficult to define.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.2 Similarly, in his conclusions he again refers to complexity.  In
paragraph 8.6 on page 44 he states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The distribution of the various rock types in the BVG show the
presence of a complex pile of variably faulted rocks and it is only in a very
limited area that any coherent picture has emerged.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.3 In paragraph 8.8 he states that the conceptual model is simplistic and
hides the complex inter-relationships between the various groundwater regimes. 
Finally, in  paragraph 8.9 he states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The RCF will allow a more detailed understanding of the fracture
network in the near-field, but because of the complexity and unpredictability of
the hydrogeology, it may not advance the overall understanding of the controls
on groundwater flow.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.4 Despite Professor Mather's repeated reference to 'complexity', he
neither defines what he means by complexity, nor does he clearly establish its
significance.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 Dr Allison (PE/FOE/7) at paragraph 4.14, page 20
makes similar statements about the complexity of the Sellafield site.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.6"></A>5.6 A simple definition of 'complexity' is something
that is complicated or difficult to understand.  I believe that any natural
geological system, if investigated in the detail to which Sellafield has been
investigated, would reveal natural complexity at some scales.  The issue is
therefore whether this natural complexity can be understood in sufficient detail
to enable the suitability of the site to be established. A more complex site may
require a more extensive investigation than a less complex site, but providing
the site was capable of being understood, complexity would  be a matter of
resources available for investigation.
</P>
<P>5.7 Paragraph 4.8 of the HMIP background document submitted to the Inquiry
dated 22 September (PE/HMP/1) indicates, <I>&quot;The proposed RCF site has a
complex geological structure and this would need to be addressed thoroughly in
any future application that Nirex might submit under RSA 1993&quot;</I>.  This
suggests that the regulatory view accords with that expressed at
<A HREF="#Para5.6">paragraph 5.6</A> above: that complexity is something to be
addressed, not a disqualifier of a site.
</P>
<P><B>Sufficiency of Information</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 A central difference between the positions of the
Objectors and Nirex in respect of complexity and the appropriate response in
investigation and modelling is that, whilst the Objectors suggest that very
detailed and specific characterisation of rock properties is essential
throughout the system, Nirex, in common with current state-of-the-art practice
in addressing flow and transport in deep groundwater systems, has chosen to
follow a largely stochastic approach.  The arguments which Nirex presents for
adopting this approach develop as follows:

Such models use statistical techniques to simulate the properties of the rock
volume under study and are conditioned by the observations. The models should
have an appropriate level of complexity, sufficient to capture the aspects of
interest in the system without unnecessary detail.  A number of such
'stochastic' techniques exist for producing realisations of fracture fields (or
hydraulic conductivity or transmissivity fields) which replicate the observed
behaviour of the system at the scale at which it is being observed and which may
also be conditioned to duplicate specific point measurements.

being studied.  They can also be used to predict the 'effective' properties of
that rock at a much larger scale ('upscaling').  In the large scale model the
effects of the detailed structure are taken into account implicitly through the
use of appropriate effective properties and the system description is therefore
much simpler.  These models do not represent the details of flow and transport
at the small scale, which do not matter on the scale of interest, but if the
upscaling procedure has been developed correctly, they will predict overall bulk

<P>The rationale developed above has been tested in a number of major
programmes in a variety of rock types and at various scales, for example at
Stripa at RCF scale, and at the WIPP site in the USA at 100's km<SUP>2</SUP>
scale.  From the above it can be seen that careful observation and
experimentation at various scales, combined with model building and testing and
a mix of stochastic and deterministic techniques will allow sufficient
information to be gathered to allow an adequate level of site description at the
scales required for safety assessment modelling.

<P><A NAME="Geology"></A><B>6. GEOLOGY</B></P>
<P>6.1 Two of the Objectors' proofs deal primarily with geology and geological
investigations.  These are the proofs by Dr Kokelaar (PE/FOE/2) and Professor
Smythe (PE/FOE/3).  These proofs are reviewed in turn in the following
paragraphs.
</P>
<P><B>Dr Kokelaar (PE/FOE/2)</B>
</P>
<P>6.2 Dr Kokelaar states his view (paragraph 5.1, page 11, PE/FOE/2) that the
<I>&quot;Borrowdale Volcanic Group has exceptional geological complexity that
renders prediction of its 3D distribution of rocks and fractures extremely
difficult&quot;</I>.  From this he concludes (paragraph 5.2, page 11, PE/FOE/2)
that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Accurate characterization can only be derived by drilling
boreholes so closely that the drilling would constitute substantial interference
with the system.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.3 He states in paragraph 4.7, page 9 of PE/FOE/2 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Observational data from a sub-surface facility, such as the
proposed RCF, could be obtained directly through observation of the rock exposed
through excavation or indirectly through boreholes drilled from the sub-surface.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.4 Dr Kokelaar adds in paragraph 4.8 on page 10 of PE/FOE/2 that access at
depth will not resolve the difficulties associated with the high level of
complexity of the Borrowdale Volcanic System.
</P>
<P>6.5 Thus, Dr Kokelaar appears to be stating a view that the geology of the
BVG cannot be adequately characterised except by closely spaced boreholes.
</P>
<P>6.6 Dr Kokelaar, while having substantial experience of studying volcanic
rocks and the BVG, appears to have used the factual information in a way which
exaggerates the complexities.  The taking of a variety of features of the BVG in
the Lake District and implying that they all apply to the local area of the RCF
and PRZ is misleading.
</P>
<P>6.7 Dr Kokelaar's evidence emphasises the difficulties of obtaining a
completely deterministic description of the geology.  However, he seems not to
have appreciated that such a wholly deterministic description of the geology is
not required in order to be able to develop acceptable models of the site for
assessing the post-closure performance of a repository (see <A HREF="#Para5.8">paragraphs
5.8</A> to 5.10 of this supplementary proof).
</P>
<P>6.8 In paragraph 3.3 (page 7, PE/FOE/2), Dr Kokelaar makes generalisations
over a large area, states that they apply to the area <I>&quot;in and around
the PRZ&quot;</I>, and applies them indiscriminately, and without justification,
to demonstrate
<I>&quot;extreme 3-D geological complexity&quot;</I></P>
<P>6.9 In the first bullet point of paragraph 3.3 on page 7 (PE/FOE/2), Dr
Kokelaar refers to <I>&quot;substantial primary lateral variations of thickness
and character&quot;</I> of the many constituent rock units.  This generalisation
can be contrasted with the statement made in <A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para5.10">paragraphs
5.10</A> and 5.11 of my proof (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>) in which I report the
establishment of a subdivision of the BVG <I>&quot;which can be correlated
between boreholes over a distance of several kilometres&quot;</I>. 
</P>
<P>6.10 Dr Kokelaar's second bullet point states that <I>&quot;caldera-forming
gravitational collapse was incremental and haphazard&quot;</I>.  Leaving aside
the issue of whether there is evidence of this on the broad scale, there is
certainly no evidence to demonstrate that the RCF/PRZ area is located near a
caldera margin.
</P>
<P>6.11 Dr Kokelaar's third bullet point refers to soft-state deformation being
far less ordered and hence less predictable that solid-state tectonic
deformation.  Indeed, such structures may be abundant.  However, these
structures are generally healed and are not hydrogeologically significant. 
Hence, there is little to suggest that such features, and their geological
complexity, have any significant influence on the hydrogeological properties of
the rock mass.
</P>
<P>6.12 The statement of fact on faulting which forms the fourth bullet point
is not disputed.  However, the extent to which such faulting affects the
hydrogeology of the site is not addressed at all by Dr Kokelaar.
</P>
<P>6.13 The final bullet point refers to jointing in the BVG.  This has been
described in detail by Nirex.  Again, Dr Kokelaar appears to be assuming that
the description of these features needs to be addressed on a deterministic
basis, rather than the stochastic basis that will inevitably apply to such small
scale fractures (see paragraph 5.8 of this supplementary proof).
</P>
<P><B>Professor Smythe (PE/FOE/3)</B>
</P>
<P>6.14 The evidence presented by Professor Smythe (PE/FOE/3) can be summarised
as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;An essential prerequisite for hydrogeological modelling is to
establish the geological structure accurately both in and around the PRZ&quot;
</I>(paragraph 10.2. page 50, PE/FOE/3);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The current geological interpretation is simply not robust, and will
therefore not provide a reliable foundation for hydrogeological modelling of the
site&quot; </I>(paragraph 10.2, page 50, PE/FOE/3); and
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;the 3-D seismic survey should be properly completed or a new
survey undertaken, properly validated, and adequately peer reviewed.  This work
should be undertaken before the hydrogeological modelling work is completed and
before the location for the RCF is finalised.  The results from the 3-D seismic
model and those from the hydrogeological modelling should be demonstrated to be
properly compatible before work on the RCF starts.&quot; </I>(paragraph 10.8,
page 52, PE/FOE/3).

structures which are likely to be treated deterministically in the
hydrogeological model are robustly defined.  Thus, whilst it is not disputed
that a 3-D seismic survey will probably provide a greater definition of smaller
scale structures within the BVG than is currently available, it is not certain
that such added definition will have any relevance to the hydrogeological
modelling of the site, and hence justify the environmental impact and high cost
of such a survey.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">iii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">Professor Smythe has not appreciated that one of the primary
reasons why Nirex is interested in carrying out a 3-D seismic survey is to
enable the rock properties, not just the geological structure, to be mapped at

model of the PRZ referred to in <A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para8.13">paragraph 8.13</A>
of my evidence (page 65,
<B>PE/NRX/14</B>).  Final decisions on the 3-D seismic survey are awaiting the
results of the interpretation of the results of the trial survey carried out for
Nirex with input from Glasgow University and Professor Smythe.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>6.16 At paragraph 4.6 (page 20, PE/FOE/3), Professor Smythe states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The advent of two-dimensional (2-D) seismic imaging, together with
more drilling, has resulted in a radically improved and more detailed, but not
fundamentally different picture of the subsurface.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.17 Professor Smythe then lists a series of data sources and presents a
series of cross sections in his Figure 1.  He appears to have selected these
sections, which are not all from the same transect, to show the greatest
possible differences.  Nevertheless, the sections show that broadly the
subsurface geology has indeed remained fundamentally similar with more
structural detail becoming apparent as additional data have been acquired. 
However, Professor Smythe, having stated in paragraph 4.6 of PE/FOE/3 that the
interpretation has not fundamentally changed, at paragraph 4.8 of PE/FOE/3
states that <I>&quot;the geological interpretation is being substantially
revised every year or so&quot;</I>.  These two statements, in such close
proximity, appear to contradict each other.
</P>
<P>6.18 Professor Smythe has presented a large amount of detail concerning
seismic surveys in his sections 5 to 8 (PE/FOE/3) which appears to be aimed at
undermining the quality of the investigation work and the interpretations
carried out of them.  As such, Professor Smythe's evidence contradicts the
statements made by other independent reviewers (<A
HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para5.5">paragraphs 5.5</A> and 5.6 on pages 15 and 16
of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>).
</P>
<P>6.19 At paragraphs 2.13 and 2.18 (PE/FOE/3), Professor Smythe draws
attention to inconsistencies between data sets and interpretations presented by
Nirex and uses this to justify in paragraph 2.18 the need for 3-D seismic
surveys in the Site and even the District areas.  In making these assertions he
has not taken full account of the work on the structure of the PRZ presented in
the summary report {Nirex Report S/95/005} referenced in
<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para5.9">paragraph 5.9</A> of my evidence (page 21 of <B>PE/NRX/14</B>)
or of the detailed underpinning report on the geological structure of the PRZ
{BGS Technical Report No. WA/95/47C, June 1995} referenced in the summary
report.  The introduction to Report S/95/005 on page 1 includes the following
statements:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;1.2 The general structural and tectonic setting of the area around
Sellafield was reviewed in Nirex Report No. 520.  Nirex Report No. 524, Volume 2
considered the 3D structure of the Region and District.  Since the issue of
those reports many new data have been acquired.  These include the geological
data from the RCF, RCM and PRZ boreholes, and the associated geophysical (VSPs,
cross-hole seismic tomograms, wireline imagery and other wireline log rock mass
property data) and hydrogeological investigations.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>1.4 A full account of the detailed GIT (Nirex Geological Integration
Team) interpretations underpinning this report is given in BGS Report No.
WA/95/47C.  The interpretation was carried out in two phases; an initial phase
in which individual datasets were interpreted either partially or fully
independently of other data, and a second phase in which the primary data
interpretations were combined to produce an integrated understanding of the
geological structure...&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.20 Thus, by selectively presenting information, Professor Smythe has
sought to undermine the geological interpretations presented by Nirex in order
to justify the need for a 3-D seismic survey.  Not only is it considered that
the claims made by Professor Smythe concerning the interpretations of the
structural geology are unjustified, but he has also failed to appreciate that
the evidence presented by Nirex already includes proposals, subject to the
results of the 3-D trial survey, to carry out such a survey prior to the
commencement of RCF construction.

<P><A NAME="GroundwaterFlow"></A><B>7. GROUNDWATER FLOW THROUGH FRACTURED
ROCK</B></P>
<P><B>General Considerations</B>
</P>
<P>7.1 Professor Mather states in paragraph 6.2.9 on page 21 (PE/CCC/4):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The results of the hydraulic testing show that 10% of tested zones
in the BVG have hydraulic conductivities two orders of magnitude or more above
the threshold of 1 x 10<SUP>-9</SUP> ms<SUP>-1</SUP> below which values are
normally regarded as impermeable from a waste disposal viewpoint.  The fact that
the bulk of the BVG has a lower hydraulic conductivity is irrelevant as  only
one hairline crack in a bottle is necessary for all the contents to leak out. 
Depending on how the zones are interconnected and the hydraulic gradient to
which they are subjected, significant groundwater flow is possible.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.2 Dr Haszeldine (PE/GNP/3) at paragraph 12.5 on page 36 seeks to make a
similar point:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;I attempted to define a limit to regional BVG permeability, above
which the ultimate Repository should be considered unsafe.  This was arbitrarily
defined as being unsafe if water flow could return from the PRZ to the earth's
surface within 10,000 yr.  It is extremely important to note that this limit is
not a statistical distribution as currently used by Nirex, but an absolute limit
- if only one fracture has a permeability above this limit, the system is
fundamentally flawed.  It is difficult to imagine how a small RCF can give site
specific measurements of all fractures in the larger region to the required
accuracy and precision.  Thus the RCF cannot act as an adequate site
investigation tool.  I find that the limit to BVG permeability is 1 x 10<SUP>-9</SUP>
ms<SUP>-1</SUP> (3 x 10<SUP>-2</SUP> ma<SUP>-1</SUP>).  This is at least 40
times lower than the maximum permeability measured by Nirex.&quot;</I>

<P>7.5 There does not appear to be any disagreement over the hydraulic
conductivity values measured and reported by Nirex.
</P>
<P><U>Issue ii - Hydrogeological 'Criteria'</U>
</P>
<P>7.6 I disagree with the adoption of secondary quantitative criteria for
assessment of the suitability of the site.  This important issue is discussed
further in <A HREF="#Para7.12">paragraphs 7.12</A> to 7.18 below.
</P>
<P><U>Issue iii - Significance of Single Fractures</U>
</P>
<P>7.7 I disagree with the statements they make about the significance of
single fractures.  These may be relevant if one was looking at thin layers, such
as liners at conventional landfill sites.  They are not, however, relevant to
the Nirex situation in which we are considering the large scale properties of
blocks of rock many hundreds of metres thick through which water must flow. 
This point is made in my proof (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>) at
<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.16">paragraph 6.16</A>.
</P>
<P><U>Issue iv - Fracture Connectivity</U>
</P>
<P>7.8 I agree with the concept that the behaviour of the rock mass and its
ability to transmit water are controlled by the way the fractures are
interconnected and the hydraulic gradient to which they are subjected.  However,
it does not follow necessarily that significant groundwater flow is possible. 
This would only be the case if there was a well connected system of fractures
with a high hydraulic conductivity.  It is essential to determine the actual
characteristics of the rock mass to determine the extent of the flow.  This is
discussed further at <A HREF="#Para7.19">paragraphs 7.19</A> to 7.27 below.
</P>
<P><U>Issue v - Adequate Characterisation of Fractures</U>
</P>
<P>7.9 This statement may be true if the requirement was to make
<I>&quot;specific measurement of all fractures in the larger region&quot;</I>. 
This is not the purpose of the RCF.  This was discussed in <A HREF="#Para5.8">paragraphs
5.8</A> to 5.10 above.
</P>
<P><U>Issue vi - Permeability 'Limits'</U>
</P>
<P>7.10 I disagree with this statement for two reasons.  Firstly it is
inappropriate to adopt a secondary quantitative 'criterion' for assessment of
the suitability of the site (see paragraphs <A HREF="#Para3.1">3.1</A> to 3.3
and <A HREF="#Para7.12">paragraphs 7.12</A> to 7.18 below).  Secondly, it is
inappropriate to use point measurements of hydraulic conductivity as the basis
for assessing the large scale hydraulic conductivity of the rock mass.  This is
directly related to Issue iii above and is further discussed at paragraphs
<A HREF="#Para7.19">paragraphs 7.19</A> to 7.27 below.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.12"></A>7.12 Dr Haszeldine in paragraph 12.5 (PE/GNP/3)
states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;This </I>[regional BVG permeability] <I>was arbitrarily defined
as being unsafe if water flow could return from the PRZ to the earth's surface
within 10,000 yr.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.13 Having arbitrarily (and without justification) adopted this basic
criterion of a 10,000 year return time, Dr Haszeldine then judges the
acceptability of the site by comparing the results he has obtained from his
modelling for his central case and a number of variants calculations with this
criterion.  The variant case considered by Dr Haszeldine based on the adoption
of the modal values for BVG and sandstone hydraulic conductivity produced travel
times of 200,000 years.  The case discussed by Dr Haszeldine in which a 10,000
year travel time was obtained was an extreme case in which the regional
hydraulic conductivity of the BVG was set to the highest measured value (a
factor of 100 times greater than the value used in their other calculations) and
the hydraulic conductivity of the Calder Sandstone was set to a low value.  Data
from Sellafield (Figure 10 on page 17 of Nirex Report 525 [COR/505]) indicates
that the combination of these two extremes is very unlikely (see
<A HREF="#Para7.34">paragraphs 7.34</A> to 7.38 below).
</P>
<P>7.14 Using his 10,000 year criterion, Dr Haszeldine derives an 'acceptable'
upper bound for the hydraulic conductivity for the BVG.  He states in paragraph
12.5 of PE/GNP/3 on page 36:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;I find that the limit of BVG permeability is 1 x 10<SUP>-9</SUP>
ms<SUP>-1</SUP>.  This is at least 40 times lower than the maximum permeability
measured by Nirex.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.15 His criterion for acceptability is arbitrary (as accepted by Dr
Haszeldine at paragraph 12.5 of PE/GNP/3) and, I would assert, unjustified.
</P>
<P>7.16 Professor Mather also defines, (Paragraph 6.2.9 on page 21 of PE/CCC/4)
a &quot;threshold&quot; value of 10<SUP>-9 </SUP>ms<SUP>-1</SUP>, below which
rocks are normally regarded as impermeable from a waste disposal viewpoint.  He
cites GOV/136, a DoE Waste Management Paper entitled Landfill Design,
Construction and Operational Practice. Among other things, GOV/136 gives
guidance relating to the selection, properties and performance of low
permeability liners that could be installed in landfill facilities.  The
intention is to promote landfill practices that will achieve stabilisation
within one generation (defined as 30 to 50 years). 
</P>
<P>7.17 Given this clarification, it is inappropriate to apply the guidelines
quoted to the long term performance of the geosphere of a radioactive waste
facility.  A more appropriate comparison would be with the performance of the
engineered barriers of the Nirex repository system.  This is predicted to be
significantly in excess of the requirements for low permeability liners
installed in landfill facilities [GOV/136].
</P>
<P>7.18 The likelihood of measured values of permeability (hydraulic
conductivity) greater than 10<SUP>-9</SUP> ms<SUP>-1</SUP> in the basement
rocks was recognised in PERA [COR/501] at Table 8.2.  Whether such values can be
judged as acceptable, or otherwise, can only be made in the context of an
evaluation of the overall post-closure performance assessment of a repository. 
This must include consideration of transport through the geosphere, involving
processes such as dispersion and successive dilution, which contribute to
reducing the release of radionuclides from the geosphere.
</P>
<P><B>Upscaling</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.19"></A>7.19 The derivation of effective parameters is
described in Volume 2 of Nirex 95 [COR/522].  This is not a new concept within
the Nirex investigations.  For example, modelling work related to the BVG as a
discrete fracture network was described in some detail in section 6.5 of Volume
3 of Nirex Report 524 [COR/517] in December 1993 (pages 6.26 - 6.35).
</P>
<P>7.20 There are two main ways in which large scale effective parameters can
be determined, both of which have been utilised by Nirex:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">by the process of 'upscaling' whereby measurements taken over
small scales are used to infer large scale effective properties.  This is
achieved by Nirex through the use of a range of techniques (page 11, Nirex
Report S/94/004 [COR/510]).  An example is the use of discrete fracture network
modelling techniques in which models are produced which reproduce the
measurements made in small scale borehole tests and in which the models are then
used to estimate large scale effective parameters; and

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">ii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">by interpretation of measurements of hydrogeological tests that
interrogate a large volume of rock containing the range of natural variability. 
An example of this is the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test (<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.41">paragraphs
6.41</A> - 6.45 of
<B>PE/NRX/14</B>).  Also, the drawdown experiment in Phase 1 of the RCF, in
which the response of the regional groundwater system to RCF shaft excavation,
will constitute the largest scale of testing carried out so far.  The drawdowns
induced by the construction of the RCF will be significantly greater than those
which will have been imposed on the groundwater system by the existing
hydrogeological testing (<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.88">paragraph 6.88</A> of
<B>PE/NRX/14</B>).
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>7.21 Volume 2 of Nirex 95 [COR/522] presents in detail the methodology used
to derive a probability distribution function of effective permeability based
upon progressive upscaling from field data.  Different categories of flow
channels through which groundwater flows within each hydrogeological unit were
defined (e.g. paragraph 2.2 on page 2.1 and of Volume 2 on Nirex 95 [COR/522]). 
The models used to derive the effective parameters are illustrated in Figure 5.3
of Volume 2 of Nirex 95 [COR/522] and the probability distribution functions
that characterise the uncertainty in effective permeabilities on a regional
scale of the hydrogeological units used in the modelling are listed in Figure
5.1 of the same document.
</P>
<P>7.22 The base case values of the effective hydrogeological parameters are
then summarised in Table 2.1 of Volume 3 of Nirex 95 [COR/522].
</P>
<P>7.23 The models used in the Nirex 95 [COR/522] calculations incorporated
zones of hydraulically connected fractures which extended over scales of 50
metres to 5 kilometres.  These are termed Type II features in Nirex 95
[COR/522].  The models therefore explicitly incorporate features which will
permit the preferential flow of groundwater over long distances.  These features
had hydraulic conductivity values which ranged from 10<SUP>-11</SUP> ms<SUP>-1</SUP>
to 10<SUP>-7</SUP> ms<SUP>-1</SUP>.  Additionally, larger scale Type III
features were built into the models in the location of known major fault zones. 
These had generally higher values of hydraulic conductivity than the Type II
features.  As a result, the Nirex 95 [COR/522] models allow the preferential
flow of groundwater along selected features both within the BVG, and cutting
across the hydrogeological boundaries between the BVG and its overlying units. 
The hydraulic connectivity permitted by these modelling assumptions is thus
significant.
</P>
<P>7.24 More recent information on the large scale properties of the BVG are
now available. These arise from the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, which has involved
a three month pumping test in a selected zone of the BVG.  This zone was located
in the Sides Farm Member, between 638.9 metres bOD and 681.6 metres bOD.  It
contained two identified flow zones.  As seen in Drawing No. 10089 in Nirex
Report SA/95/002 [COR/518] and <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.2">Figures 6.2</A>
and <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.5">6.5</A> of <B>PE/NRX/14</B>, the zone
selected is one of the most productive sections within Borehole RCF3 and
contains the principal flow zones in the BVG encountered in this borehole.
</P>
<P>7.25 The models used for upscaling in Nirex 95 [COR/522], and a number of
alternative conceptual and numerical models of the fracture network in the BVG,
are being tested by comparison of model predictions with the results of the
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test.  This is a stringent test of the models because three
months of pumping on the most productive zone in the borehole tests a much
larger volume of rock than the earlier borehole measurements on which the
fracture network models were based.
</P>
<P>7.26 Preliminary analyses of the result of these comparisons suggests that
the fracture network model giving the best comparisons is likely to have a lower
connectivity within the BVG than that predicted in Nirex 95 [COR/522].  This is
because it includes variations in fracture apertures within the Type II
features.  Such variations were not included in the parameterisation of Type II
features for Nirex 95 [COR/522].  Thus the system may be less well connected
than assumed in Nirex 95 [COR/522].
</P>
<P>7.27 Thus, it is concluded that the approach to treatment of hydraulic
conductivity values proposed by Professor Mather and Dr Haszeldine in their
proofs, whilst probably appropriate to the consideration of flow through thin
layers, such as landfill liners, is not appropriate to flow through sequences of
rock many hundreds of metres thick for assessment of the performance of a deep
repository.
</P>
<P><B>Alternative Groundwater Flow Modelling</B>
</P>
<P>7.28 In section 12 of his proof (PE/GNP/3), Dr Haszeldine presents the
results of groundwater flow modelling carried out by Glasgow University.  The
results of this modelling have been published in two papers referenced as
GNP/3/4 and GNP/3/6.  In paragraph 12.1 on page 35 of his proof Dr Haszeldine
claims that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;My approach and results were significantly different to that
pursued by Nirex.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.29 Recognising the statement made by Dr Haszeldine, Nirex has undertaken a
systematic review of his modelling work as reported in the two papers cited by
him (GNP/3/4 and GNP/3/6) to establish whether and, if so, to what extent, his
results are actually significantly different from those of Nirex in a manner
which might have a bearing on the potential of the Sellafield site to meet
regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>7.30 On the basis of a systematic review of the modelling work undertaken by
Dr Haszeldine it is concluded that the differences he reports between his
modelling and that undertaken by Nirex arise for the following reasons:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">

<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>

<TD WIDTH="800">the failure by Dr Haszeldine to acknowledge the difference

</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>7.31 It is my assessment that if realistic parameters were used, Dr
Haszeldine's models would produce results broadly comparable to those presented
in much more detail by Nirex in Nirex 95 [COR/522].
</P>
<P><U>Conceptual Model</U>
</P>
<P>7.32 The conceptual model adopted by Dr Haszeldine could not be fully
evaluated due to the lack of detail contained in his published papers.  However,
although in general the conceptualisation appeared to be a reasonable first
attempt at describing the Sellafield regional groundwater flow field, it was
noted that the parameters adopted did not accord with those presented in Nirex
Report 524 [COR/517].  This is discussed in the following paragraphs.
</P>
<P><U>Geological Structure</U>
</P>
<P>7.33 The geological sequence used by Dr Haszeldine contains some differences
to that adopted by Nirex.  His model explicitly incorporates a large conductive
feature that originates at the surface and terminates immediately adjacent and
down groundwater gradient of the proposed repository.  Dr Haszeldine terms this
the 'Fleming Hall Fault Zone'.  A comparison of the structural cross section
used in their work corresponds with interpretations presented in 1992 in Nirex
Report 263 [COR/502].  Since the publication of this report in 1992 considerably
more information has been gathered and a revised structural interpretation was
presented in Nirex Report 524 [COR/517].  As a result of these changes, a
structural feature similar to that proposed in Dr Haszeldine's model is not
located near the PRZ.
</P>
<P><U>Hydraulic Parameters</U>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.34"></A>7.34 The models illustrated in Figures 6a and 7a of
GNP/3/4 and which show particle tracks along the modelled faults directly to the
surface have hydraulic parameters which are considered unrealistic.  Dr
Haszeldine and his co-author note in the caption to Figure 6 (GNP/3/4, page 93)
that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;BVG conductivity is the maximum measured in site investigation
boreholes...The Calder Sandstone set to low conductivity.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.35 There are also some more subtle, but none the less significant
discrepancies between the values for hydraulic conductivity used by Dr
Haszeldine and those given in Nirex Report 524 [COR/517] particularly for the
Carboniferous Limestone and Brockram Formations.  Dr Haszeldine has selected
conductivity values approximately one order of magnitude lower than the values
reported by Nirex from the field measurements.  Because these geological units
contribute to the hydraulic separation between the upper sedimentary rocks and
the BVG, this discrepancy is significant.
</P>
<P>7.36 The range of hydraulic conductivity values assigned by Dr Haszeldine to
the BVG is a subset of the reported test results in Nirex Report 525 [COR/505]
and contains only the high and median values.  The selection of fault
conductivities and porosities also differ from those in Nirex Report 524
[COR/517].  Values of porosity utilised by Dr Haszeldine are also seen to be
different, in some cases by up to 100%, from the reported test results.
</P>
<P>7.37 Thus Dr Haszeldine has selectively taken data and results from Nirex
Report 524 (published in December 1993) [COR/517] and Nirex Report 263
(published in March 1992 on the basis of significantly more limited data)
[COR/502].
</P>
<P>7.38 The values of BVG and Calder Sandstone hydraulic conductivity used by
Dr Haszeldine in his central case significantly increase the predicted flow
velocity in the repository region, as compared to the median value.  The values
for the Brockram hydraulic conductivity adopted by Dr Haszeldine would tend to
produce lower flow and transport across that formation relative to the median
value.  These two factors combine together to focus groundwater flow in the
model into the imposed fault.  Thus, by careful selection of parameters for his
central case model, Dr Haszeldine has imposed a particular pattern of
groundwater flow.
</P>
<P><U>Regional hydraulic conductivity</U>
</P>
<P>7.39 There is an important distinction between the hydraulic conductivity
values used in the model, which are regional effective values, and the measured
hydraulic conductivity values which are essentially point values.  The measured
values can be expected to cover a wide range and to include some quite high
values in the 'tails' of the distribution due to the natural heterogeneity in
the rocks (see section 8 of this supplementary proof).  However, the regional
value, which will determine the overall flow rate, will be some average of the
local values depending on the connectivity as well as the conductivity of the
individual fractures.  Thus the existence of a few high measurements does not
automatically imply a high probability that Dr Haszeldine's arbitrary criterion
will be breached.  This issue has been discussed in <A HREF="#Para7.12">paragraphs
7.12</A> to 7.18 above.
</P>
<P><U>The results</U>
</P>
<P>7.40 Although the model adopted by Dr Haszeldine for his central case
comprises a pessimistic and unrealistic end member of the many models formed by
possible geometric aspects and hydrogeological characteristics at the potential
repository, this model predicted long groundwater return times of 10,000 to
15,000 years depending on modelled repository depths (Figures 6a and 7a of
GNP/3/4, pages 93 and 94).  The second set of models illustrated in Figures 6b
and 7b of GNP/3/4, in which the BVG conductivity was reduced to 3.8 x 10<SUP>-10</SUP>
ms<SUP>-1</SUP>, closer to the median value of 1 x 10<SUP>-10</SUP> ms<SUP>-1</SUP>
(<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.1">Figures 6.1</A>, <B>PE/NRX/14</B>), and
hence provided a much more realistic representation of the hydraulic
conductivity contrast between the BVG and the sandstone, not only produced a
significantly longer estimate of groundwater return time (200,000 years), but
also indicated a marine discharge (under current sea level conditions) for the
water rather than a terrestrial discharge given by the models which suppressed
the conductivity contrast between the BVG and the sandstone.
</P>
<P>7.41 The selection of a geological structure and hydraulic parameters by Dr
Haszeldine has produced an extreme and pessimistic model of the Sellafield site.
 The model parameters, in particular, suppress the effects of the hydraulic
conductivity contrast between the BVG and the sandstone and focus groundwater
flow into a geological fault that has been imposed on the model immediately
downstream of the repository represented in the model.  Adoption of a more
realistic value for the hydraulic conductivity of the BVG reproduces the pattern
of groundwater flow shown in the Nirex 95 studies [COR/522] with marine
discharge to the west of the PRZ (assuming current sea level conditions).

groundwater pressures and hydraulic conductivity.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.9 The statements made by Nirex (see paragraph 8.7 above) clearly indicate
that the groundwater regimes were defined on the basis of the processes
occurring within these regimes and that the geochemical information has helped
to confirm the pattern of groundwater flow.  Professor Mather is thus wrong in
his paragraph 6.5.2 (page 29, PE/CCC/4) in which he seeks to indicate that the
regimes are defined on the basis of salinity.  Furthermore, the groundwater
salinities quoted by Professor Mather, assigned in that way to the regimes, are
not, as indicated by him, taken from Nirex Report 525 [COR/505], nor are they as
quoted in subsequent Nirex reports.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.10"></A>8.10 Professor Mather is also wrong in his assertion
(PE/CCC/4, paragraph 6.6.7) that the model <I>&quot;hides the complex
inter-relationships between the various regimes&quot;</I>.  Professor Mather
confines his attention to a single figure (his Figure 4, PE/CCC/4) which is a
schematic representation of the broad features of the groundwater system.  He
ignores the detailed discussion of conceptual models in Nirex 95 [COR/522] and
of the hydrogeochemistry in Nirex Report S/95/008 [COR/525].  Hence, it is
inevitable that he regards the model represented in his Figure 4 (PE/CCC/4) as
simplistic.  Nirex's description of conceptual models in Nirex 95 [COR/522] is
comprehensive and detailed.  The hydrogeochemical conceptual model in Nirex
Report S/95/008 [COR/525] is able to explain all of the compositions of
groundwater and, as stated in <A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.66">paragraph 6.66</A>

a marginal choice for radioactive waste disposal&quot;</I>.  The inappropriate
use of hydrogeological 'criteria' has been addressed in sections 2, 3 and 7 of

<B>PE/NRX/14</B>).  The data obtained from the boreholes has been used to
generate stochastic fracture network models.  Uncertainty in the data, due to
the impracticability of characterising all fractures, is reflected in the
stochastic nature of the models and the range of conceptual and numerical models
which have been explored by Nirex in developing Nirex 95 [COR/522];

considerable.  The Nirex models recognises that there is a potential for
groundwater flow and this is clearly indicated in Nirex 95 [COR/522].  Use of
the term 'considerable' by Dr Salmon is subjective and unquantified whereas the
results of the Nirex 95 studies [COR/522] provide quantitative estimates of
groundwater circulation. Furthermore, they indicate that the site is likely to
meet regulatory requirements.  Thus, it is considered inappropriate to state
that the potential is 'considerable';

generally have lateral and upward components in the PRZ and to the west of the

downward flow; that is the nature of the hydrological cycle.  The issue of
'upward flow' is further addressed in <A HREF="#Para8.45">paragraphs 8.45</A>
to 8.47 of this supplementary proof.  The significance of any upward gradients
is only relevant when taken in the context of hydraulic conductivity, in order

from the cross-hole hydraulic testing and the drilling of Boreholes PRZ1, PRZ2

<P><U>Issue  iii - the use of elicited data instead of measured data.  </U>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.17"></A>8.17 At paragraph 2.13 on page 9 of PE/FOE/5, Dr
Salmon describes the way in which Nirex has conceptualised the fractures within
the groundwater flow model presented in Nirex 95 [COR/522].  In the last
sentence of the paragraph, in referring to the parameters used to describe the
characteristics of these fractures, he states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Of these, all except fracture orientations can not be adequately
quantified by the field characterisation programme alone, and reliance has
instead had to be placed on the elicitation of probability density functions
(PDF's) for the uncertainty about the mean and variance associated with the
distribution  of these parameters {S/95/012}, from a group of experts assembled
by Nirex (COR/508).&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.18 It needs to be emphasised that the elicitation of parameter values for
modelling is based on data from the site characterisation programme.  At page
5.4 of Volume 1 of Nirex 95 [COR/522], the extent to which field data was used
as part of the elicitation process is made clear.  It states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Information on the orientation of the fractures can be obtained
from the field data [5.2].  Of the remaining parameters, it was considered most
appropriate to elicit distributions of fracture spacing, fractures length and
channelling fraction from the expert group, which were able to make reference,
in the course of the elicitation, to observations of the spacing of fractures
and flowing zones in the boreholes and to outcrop studies of fracture length&quot;.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.19 As stated in section 4 of Volume 2 of Nirex 95  [COR/522], fracture
transmissivities were not elicited, but were derived by requiring models to be
consistent with field data. The elicitation process is a structured and
appropriate response to dealing with uncertainties in field data. 
</P>
<P>8.20 At paragraph 2.7 (PE/FOE/5, page 7), Dr Salmon refers to the
independent review of the Nirex investigations at Sellafield by the Royal
Society Study Group, and provides a quote from COR/605, the Royal Society Study
Group Report.  The quote he uses is:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The development of conceptual hydrogeological models and their
translation into numerical models (and hence radionuclide transport) are some of
the most difficult tasks for Nirex in working towards detailed PCPAs for
Sellafield&quot;.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.21 He then states in paragraph 2.8 (PE/FOE/5) that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;This is because </I>'tests have shown that the hydrogeological
system at Sellafield is complex'<I> (FOE/5/6).  This complexity is discussed in
more detail below&quot;.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.22 The quotation from the Royal Society Study Group Report is to be found
on page 143, column 1, of COR/605 from which it can be seen that Dr Salmon has
taken his quote from the summary of section 8 of the report.  The section in the
main body of the report is found on page 135, column 1, first full paragraph, of
COR/605.  This paragraph puts a somewhat different complexion on the assertions
made by Dr Salmon.  The paragraph states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Three points need emphasis.  First, the development of conceptual
hydrogeological models and their translation into numerical models of
groundwater flow are among the most difficult scientific problems Nirex have to
face at Sellafield.  Second, the underlying scientific work has been of high
quality.  Third, participants in the study had to work with a set of site
characterisation data considerably smaller than that available now (mid-1994),
and much less extensive than that which will be available when the site
characterisation programme is nearing completion, including tracer and other
tests in the RCF.  We therefore examined the work of the expert group with a
view to assessing the methodology rather than the soundness of the results.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.23 Dr Salmon's subsequent assertion in paragraph 2.8 (PE/FOE/5) that the
Royal Society Study Group Report comments were made because of the complexity of
the site seems difficult to understand as the statement about the complexity of
the hydrogeological system is not taken from the Royal Society Report [COR/605],
instead it is taken from a paper on the design of the RCF.
</P>
<P>8.24 Dr Salmon returns to this theme of elicitation at paragraph 3.17 on
page 25 of PE/FOE/5, where he states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The Royal Society (COR/605) concluded that the elicitation
procedure, whereby experts used both limited site data and general data, is </I>'unlikely
to lead to defensible sets of parameter values'<I>.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para8.25"></A>8.25 The section of the Royal Society Study Group
Report [COR/605] that is relevant is section 8.2.4 commencing on page 134. 
Firstly, in the first paragraph of this section the Royal Society Study Group
make it clear that the Nirex study they are referring to was the one carried out
in early 1993 and was based on limited data (in effect, although not
specifically stated, this was the data in Nirex Report 268 [COR/521] based only
on the results from Boreholes 1, 2, 3 and 4).  Secondly, in the second paragraph
of page 135 (quoted in full in paragraph 9.11 above), the Royal Society Study
Group Report makes it clear that more data were available at the time they
reported and which had not been available when the elicitation study was carried
out.  They also made it clear that more data would become available,
particularly from the RCF.  Finally, in the second paragraph in column 2 on page
135 [COR/605], from which Dr Salmon's quote is taken, the Royal Society Study
Group is making the point that elicitation in the absence of site-specific data
is unlikely to lead to defensible sets of parameter values, but that <I>&quot;ideally
this would be largely replaced by one of scale-up calculations based on
extensive field data&quot;</I>.  This is indeed the approach being adopted by
Nirex.
</P>
<P>8.26 By the use of selective quotations, and by confusing comments made on a
much earlier elicitation study (known to be based on limited data) with his own
comments made on the conceptual model development reported in Nirex 95
[COR/522], Dr Salmon has misrepresented the extent to which Nirex 95 has been
based on actual field data.  He has also apparently ignored the points made both
in my evidence (<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.83">paragraph 6.83</A> to 6.88 of <B>PE/NRX/14</B>)
and by the Royal Society Study Group that the RCF has an important role in
providing the required additional data.
</P>
<P><U>Issue  iv - Dr Salmon's interpretation of the hydrogeological field
tests differs from that presented by Nirex. </U>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.27"></A>8.27 At paragraph 2.19 (PE/FOE/5) Dr Salmon comments
on the results of various hydrogeological testing programmes.  Apart from Dr
Salmon's discussion of  the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, I do not disagree with the
comments he makes and find them to be substantially as given in my evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.35">paragraphs 6.35</A> to 6.45).  In commenting on
the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, Dr Salmon has confused the borehole interference
effects observed in the boreholes with the results of the pump test.  These
interference effects are described in Appendix 2 to my evidence (<A
HREF="nrx14a1.htm#ParaB2.8">paragraphs B.2.8</A> to B.2.10 on pages B.4 and B.5
of Appendix 2 to <B>PE/NRX/14</B>) and illustrated in
<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#FigB21">Figure B.2.1</A> (Appendix 2,
<B>PE/NRX/14</B>).  They are also described in somewhat more detail in
paragraphs 7.21 to 7.29 of Nirex Report S/95/007 [COR/524]. 
<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#FigB21">Figure B.2.1</A> in Appendix 2 of <B>PE/NRX/14</B>
shows these interference effects and the smooth responses observed in the
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test after January 1995.  These two datasets have been used
in complementary ways to provide information on hydrogeological conditions in
the PRZ.
</P>
<P>8.28 In paragraph 2.20 of his evidence (PE/FOE/5, page 14), Dr Salmon states
that his interpretation of the field tests differ in both substance and tone
from those presented in my evidence.  I do not agree that the two
interpretations differ in substance although they may differ in tone.
</P>
<P><U>Paragraph 2.20 - first bullet point</U>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.29"></A>8.29 In the first bullet point on page 14 (PE/FOE/4)
Dr Salmon disputes that the fracture network may be less well connected than
previously considered.  I stand by my original statement and point to the
description of the fracture networks as presented in Nirex 95 [COR/522] as
justification.  It is important to recall that Nirex 95 was based on the data
presented in Nirex Report 524 [COR/517] which pre-dates the hydrogeological
testing to which we are now referring. (See the third paragraph of the Preface
to Nirex 95 [COR/522].)
</P>
<P>8.30 The extent to which the Nirex 95 models represented fracture
connectivity is best illustrated by Figures 2.1, 5.3 and 5.5 in Volume 2 of
Nirex 95 [COR/522].  These illustrate the ways in which fractures are
represented in the model and show:

<P>8.31 Thus, for example, Figure 5.5 in Volume 2 of Nirex 95 [COR/522]
specifically shows the way in which the Basal Deep St Bees Sandstone, the
section containing the siltstone and claystone bands later identified as the
North Head Member, was shown as containing transmissive fractures and major
faults cutting it.  Thus the model recognised the possibility of connections
through this part of the sequence connecting the Brockram to the higher parts of
the sandstone sequence.  In contrast to this, later work (for example paragraph
8.6 of Nirex Report S/95/007 [COR/524]) has shown that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The North Head Member is identified as an interval at the base of
the St Bees Sandstone with distinctive geological and hydrogeological properties
from the overlying St Bees Sandstone.  The claystone bed at the top of the North
Head Member is considered to be a possible low permeability control on flow
between the North Head Member and the overlying sandstone.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para8.32"></A>8.32 The preliminary results from the Borehole RCF3
Pump Test (Brockram Phase) have shown that the North Head Member attenuates the
hydraulic responses to pumping in the Brockram.  No responses were observed in
the sequence above the North Head Member.  As a result of this, it is possible
to conclude that in the vicinity of Borehole RCF3, any sub-vertical joints and
fractures that may occur within the Brockram and extend up into the sandstones
do not result in a strong hydraulic connection between the Brockram/North Head
Member, and the upper stratigraphic units of the sandstones. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.33"></A>8.33 Further information which helps to confirm this
limited connectivity in the vicinity of Borehole RCF3 is provided by the
monitoring of salinity in the different stages of the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test. 
The sandstone test was located just above the saline transition zone; the water
pumped from the hole remained fresh.  The Brockram test was located immediately
below the saline transition zone; the pumped water remained saline.
</P>
<P>8.34 The basis of my statement in <A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.70">paragraph
6.70</A> of <B>PE/NRX/14</B> is thus the comparison of  judgements made in the
Nirex 95 models with the observations made in the testing.  This enhancement in
our understanding of the connectivity within the system will be incorporated
into the groundwater models which we will be developing as a next stage from
Nirex 95 and as the basis for developing the predictions for the RCF shaft
drawdown experiment.
</P>
<P>8.35 Dr Salmon appears to criticise the Fracture Network Testing on page 15
of his proof (PE/FOE/5, paragraph 2.20).  He refers to the <I>&quot;inability
of such testing to identify connections within the fracture system in lateral
directions away from a borehole&quot;</I>.  Dr Salmon is correct in recognising
that the Fracture Network Testing does not identify lateral connections; it is
not designed to do so.  It is part of an integrated programme of post completion
testing as described in <A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA8">Table A.8</A> on page A.27 of
Appendix 1 to my proof (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>).  This refers to the fact that the
Fracture Network Testing was designed to <I>&quot;provide complete coverage of
the section of the borehole within the Borrowdale Volcanic Group&quot;</I>.  By
testing a continuous section of borehole with test sections both containing and
not containing identified flow zones (<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.5">Figure
6.5</A> of <B>PE/NRX/14</B>) it was possible to provide statistical coverage of
the BVG.  This testing needs to be viewed in association with the other major
programmes of post completion testing (<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA8">Table A.8</A>,
Appendix 1,
<B>PE/NRX/14</B>) namely the Short Interval Hydraulic Testing, the Cross-Hole
Hydraulic Testing and the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test.  The Cross-Hole Hydraulic
Testing, the Borehole RCF3 Pump test, and ultimately the RCF shaft drawdown
experiment are the parts of the testing programme specifically designed to
investigate lateral connections.
</P>
<P><U>Paragraph 2.20 - second bullet point</U>
</P>
<P>8.36 On page 15 of PE/FOE/5, Dr Salmon appears to be confusing the results
of the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test with the information from the observation of
interferences between boreholes during drilling reported in Nirex Report
S/95/007 [COR/524].  The two sets of data are not incompatible, although the
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test is able to reveal the connections in a more systematic
manner, as discussed in <A HREF="#Para8.27">paragraphs 8.27</A> and 8.32 above.
Dr Salmon also comments, on page 15 (PE/FOE/5), that I have failed to explain
the existence of the <I>&quot;unusually low environmental heads&quot;</I> in
the BVG <I>&quot;which may indicate some vertical connectivity with the cover
rocks&quot;</I>.  Reference to the descriptions of the models in Nirex 95
[COR/522] should have indicated to Dr Salmon that the possibility of such
connections are explicitly recognised in Nirex 95 by the incorporation of both
Type II and Type III features in the model.  Furthermore, it should be again
pointed out that Nirex 95 indicates that the site is likely to be able to meet
regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P><U>Paragraph 2.20 - Third bullet point</U>
</P>
<P>8.37 The point made by Dr Salmon at the top of page 16 of PE/FOE/5 related
to hydrochemistry is dealt with in section 10 of this supplementary proof. 
However, at the end of that paragraph on page 16, Dr Salmon makes the remark
that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;It is also quite possible that any differences in water quality
are lost or reduced as deeper groundwater moves to the surface, via processes
such as dilution&quot;.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.38 In making this remark Dr Salmon is recognising the favourable
characteristic of the Sellafield site in offering dilution of waters which may
leave the BVG as stated in <A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.71">paragraphs 6.71</A> to
6.73 of my evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>).
</P>
<P><U>Paragraph 2.20 - Fourth bullet point</U>
</P>
<P>8.39 On page 16 of PE/FOE/5, Dr Salmon comments that the head distributions
are not as consistent as I had implied.  He is correct in identifying some
heterogeneity in the heads observed in the boreholes.  This can be seen by the
small-scale variability of the heads in Figure 6.8 of PE/FOE/14 and more clearly
by the plots of environmental heads with depth shown for the individual
boreholes in Drawing Nos. 100111 to 10131 of Nirex Report SA/95/002 [COR/518]. 
Indeed, this heterogeneity is a characteristic feature of fractured rock masses.
</P>
<P><U>Paragraph 2.20 - Fifth bullet point</U>
</P>
<P>8.40 In the final bullet point of paragraph 2.20 on page 17 of PE/FOE/5, Dr
Salmon seeks to dismiss the geochemical information on the grounds that there
are <I>&quot;relatively few samples&quot;</I>.  He then concludes that <I>&quot;Therefore
the possibility of flowpaths with relatively short travel times cannot be
discounted&quot;</I>.  There are two points arising from this conclusion. 
Firstly, the possibility of there being such flowpaths out of the BVG has been
specifically recognised by the Nirex 95 models.  For example, Table 2.3 in
Volume 3 of Nirex 95 [COR/522] shows the travel times for different pathways. 
Paths B and C show significantly shorter travel times than Path A for flow to
the top of the BVG because of the pathline intersecting one of the Type II
features.  Secondly, as stated in <A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para8.15">paragraphs 8.15</A>
and <A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para9.9">9.9</A> of my evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>) the
RCF is required to investigate the nature and distribution of these networks of
connected fractures.  One of the reasons, as stated in
<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para8.15">paragraph 8.15</A> of <B>PE/NRX/14</B>, is to
determine the extent to which it might be possible to locate vaults to limit the
intersections between the networks of connected fractures and the repository
vaults.
</P>
<P>8.41 In respect of Dr Salmon's comment that relatively few samples have been
obtained, <A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#Appendix1">Appendices 1</A> and
<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#Appendix2">2</A> of <B>PE/NRX/14</B> summarise the
substantial programme of geochemical sampling that has been carried out.
</P>
<P><U>Issue v - There must be some doubt that Nirex will ever be able to
predict groundwater flow with confidence</U>
</P>
<P>8.42 Given the substantial progress made so far in understanding and
modelling groundwater flow at Sellafield, I cannot agree with the comment made
by Dr Salmon in paragraph 2.21 on page 17 (PE/FOE/5) that there must be some
doubt that Nirex will ever be able to predict groundwater flow with confidence. 
He has presented no evidence to support such an assertion.  Furthermore, his
references to the complexity of the site and 'other site criteria' are
reiterations of his inappropriate use of qualitative 'criteria' (see sections 2
and 3 of this supplementary proof).
</P>
<P><U>Closing comments on Dr Salmon's conclusions to his section 2 (PE/FOE/5)</U>
</P>
<P>8.43 I disagree with the conclusions reached by Dr Salmon on page 18 of
PE/FOE/5 (paragraphs 2.22 and 2.23) because:

<P><U>Upward Flow</U>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.45"></A>8.45 The existence of head gradients at the site is
a feature of the site which has long been appreciated.  Paragraph 8.14.5 of
<I>PERA</I> [COR/501] recognised the possibility of <I>&quot;the propagation
of groundwater heads into the basement.&quot;</I>  Our understanding of head
gradients at Sellafield is described in the section of my evidence dealing with
'Groundwater Heads and Gradients' (<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.48">paragraphs 6.48</A>
to 6.59 on pages 39 to 42 of
<B>PE/NRX/14</B>).
</P>
<P>8.46 In just the same way as other hydrogeological 'criteria' cannot be used
to assess the site, similarly head gradients cannot be used in this way. 
However, the impacts of head gradients have been examined in Nirex 95 [COR/522]
in calculations that have indicated that the performance of a repository is
likely to meet regulatory requirements (see, for example, the variant
calculations in sections 7.3 and 7.4 of Volume 3 of Nirex 95 [COR/522]).  This
is because the low hydraulic conductivity in the BVG, coupled with the potential
for dilution in the overlying cover rocks leads to an acceptable performance of
the site.
</P>
<P>8.47 Professor Mather (paragraph 6.7.1, PE/CCC/4) suggests that there is
evidence from hydrogeochemical data suggesting upward flow.  This is discussed
in section 9 of this supplementary proof.
</P>
<P><U>Potential for flow into the PRZ</U>
</P>
<P>8.48 Dr Haszeldine (paragraph 8.2 and Figures 8.1 a, and b, PE/GNP/3)
interprets contours of environmental head to infer potential for horizontal
flow.  This is incorrect as the potential for horizontal flow is given by
freshwater heads (<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.8">paragraph 6.8</A>, <B>PE/NRX/14</B>).
 This is explained in more detail in section 4.4.3 (page 4-4) and Figure 4.2 in
Volume 3 of Nirex Report 524 [COR/517].  Dr Haszeldine has also omitted to
record the statement made at the foot of page 4-7 of Nirex Report 524, Volume 3
[COR/517] in which the diagrams that he has interpreted are explained with the
comment that they are
<I>&quot;intended to demonstrate only that groundwater heads in this region of
the BVG are variable&quot;</I>.
</P>
<P>8.49 The variable nature of the heads in a fractured rock such as the BVG is
a feature of such systems.  It is therefore questionable as to whether such
local data can reliably be used, in the way Dr Haszeldine has, to infer regional
patterns.
</P>
<P>8.50 A regional interpretation of the head data is presented in
<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.58">paragraphs 6.58</A> to 6.59 of <B>PE/NRX/14</B>
which indicates that a consistent pattern of head gradients towards the coast is
recognised in the area.  A more regional interpretation of data, such as that
presented in Figure 8.1b of PE/GNP/3 would indicate flow diverging from the PRZ,
the opposite to the pattern suggested by Dr Haszeldine.Dr Haszeldine (paragraphs
8.2 and 8.3, PE/GNP/3) suggests the presence of a 'flow axis' associated with
the structural crest of a NE-SW trending fault block.  In paragraph 8.4
(PE/GNP/3) this idea is given the status of <I>&quot;the main subsurface axis
of flow potential of (sic) meteoric water moving from the Lake District towards
the coast&quot;</I>.
</P>
<P>8.51 This idea is, of course, only relevant if Dr Haszeldine's assertions
about converging groundwater flow are supported, which, as stated above, they
are not.  In any case, the main sub-surface route for meteoric water flow from
the fells towards the coast is in the Sherwood Sandstone Group.
</P>
<P>8.52 In paragraph 8.4 (PE/GNP/3), Dr Haszeldine claims that the PRZ is in
the worst position within the Site from the standpoint of hydrogeological
containment.  This conclusion is based on the spurious idea of the &quot;subsurface
flow axis&quot;.  The basis for selecting the PRZ is explained in
<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para8.2">paragraphs 8.2</A> to 8.10 of <B>PE/NRX/14</B>.
</P>
<P><U>Location of Discharge</U>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.53"></A>8.53 Professor Mather states (Paragraph 6.6.5,
PE/CCC/4):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;discharge in the shore zone is a more realistic assumption for
modelling purposes than discharge offshore into the Irish Sea.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.54 Professor Mather implies that it was assumed by Nirex that discharge
was offshore and into the Irish Sea, and that this assumption was built into the
models used, for example, for the calculations of groundwater flow presented in
Volume 3 of Nirex 95 [COR/522].  This is not the case.  The locations of
discharges are predicted as an output from the modelling, they are not an input
to the modelling.
</P>
<P>8.55 Figure 2.6b of Volume 3 of Nirex 95 [COR/522] illustrates that the
models used in Nirex 95 do indeed predict some level of terrestrial discharge
under the current groundwater conditions.  As stated on page 2.12 of Volume 3 of
Nirex 95 [COR/522]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;the main region of radionuclide discharge is from about a hundred
metres offshore to about a kilometre offshore. This region is just beyond the
main region of groundwater discharge which extends to about a hundred metres
offshore&quot;.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.56 The peak of groundwater discharge from the Calder sandstone and
Quaternary deposits is very close to the coast, and the discharge falls off
quite quickly with distance offshore.
</P>
<P>8.57 These predictions are consistent with a number of observations made at
the site, including those quoted by Professor Mather and resulting from the 1977
- 1979 studies of Holmes and Hall [CCC/4/3].  
</P>
<P>8.58 Nirex has undertaken sampling of  freshwater spring discharges from
foreshores in the vicinity of the site.  This confirms the view that some
groundwater from the near surface groundwater flow systems will discharge on the
coast.  
</P>
<P>8.59 However, consideration of the chloride profiles for the two Nirex
boreholes drilled near the coast (Boreholes 3 and 13A) (Appendix C, Nirex Report
S/95/008 [COR/524]) indicate a substantial (300 - 400 metres) thickness of fresh
and brackish waters.  This would imply that a fair proportion of the fresher
waters moving in the upper part of the sandstones and comprising the Coastal
Plain Regime is discharging offshore. 
</P>
<P><B>Numerical Groundwater Flow Modelling</B>
</P>
<P>8.60 For the Objectors, numerical groundwater flow modelling is primarily
addressed by three proofs that I am responding to in this supplementary proof:
Dr Haszeldine (PE/GNP/3), Dr Salmon (PE/FOE/5) and Dr Hencher (PE/FOE/6).  Dr
Haszeldine has presented some of his own modelling; this has been addressed in
section 7 of this supplementary proof.  Within the following part of section 8,
I address the issues raised by Dr Salmon and Dr Hencher on aspects of numerical
modelling.  I also describe some aspects of the recent and current
hydrogeological modelling being undertaken by Nirex, in addition to that
described in Nirex 95 [COR/95] to demonstrate the range and extent of the work
being carried out.
</P>
<P><U>Dr Salmon (PE/FOE/5)</U>
</P>
<P>8.61 In section 3 of his evidence (PE/FOE/5) Dr Salmon criticises the
modelling work undertaken by Nirex and, in paragraph 3.33 on page 33 recommends
that additional modelling work should be undertaken which is likely to take at
least another year to complete before the RCF is contemplated.  As Mr Folger has
stated in his supplementary proof (<B>PE/NRX/12/S1</B>) at
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12s1.htm#Para4.3">paragraph 4.3</A> on page 6, the revised
schedule for the RCF <B> </B>shows commencement of the RCF South Shaft in
December 1997, some two years hence.  Thus, even if Nirex accepted all the
recommendations made by Dr Salmon for additional modelling, the work could be
completed well ahead of commencement of shaft sinking.  Dr Salmon's argument
that the RCF is premature is thus irrelevant.

<P>8.66 These issues are taken together in the paragraphs that follow.
</P>
<P>8.67 In section 5 of his proof (PE/FOE/6), Dr Hencher, in paragraph 5.5 on
page 11 recognises the importance of a stochastic approach to fracture flow. The
role of this in characterising the site is described previously in this
supplementary proof (section 5).<B></B>Dr Hencher states in paragraph 5.5:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Channel flow generally follows a complex and tortuous path between
the two rock walls of a single fracture and along the intersection of different
fractures.  The interaction of fractures may allow the development of a
continuous flow path through the rock mass.  As discussed later, the statistical
potential for fractures to intersect on the basis of their perceived typical
geometries within the rock mass is the starting point and main controlling
factor within mathematical models of discrete fracture networks.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.68 This observation contrasts with the themes of the proofs by both Dr
Kokelaar (PE/FOE/2) and Professor Smythe (PE/FOE/3) who argue that a
deterministic approach is required in which rock units, faults and fractures
need to be located individually and precisely as the basis for hydrogeological
modelling.  Thus, for example at paragraph 10.2 in Professor Smythe's evidence
(PE/FOE/3, page 50) he states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;An essential prerequisite for hydrogeological modelling is to
establish the geological structure accurately both in and around the PRZ. 
Inconsistencies in the current interpretation show that major faults, as well a
minor geological structures, are likely to have been misinterpreted and/or not
identified.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.69 The Nirex approach is to recognise that characterisation and modelling
of the hydrogeology of a site requires a combination of the deterministic and
stochastic approach.  Thus on page 5-1 of Volume 3 of  Nirex Report 524
[COR/517] it is stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;A general premise underlies work on the hydrogeology of fractured
rocks.  It is assumed that water bearing fractures of all sizes exist within a
region being investigated.  Even though the distribution of fracture sizes may
be single or multi-modal (Figure 5.1a) it is further assumed that there are more
small fractures than large (in terms of extensiveness).  It is often assumed
that it is possible to explicitly identify the most extensive fractures, and
that they will have consistent assignable properties.  This has the effect of
dividing the hydrogeological system into a large-scale deterministic sub-system
alongside a smaller scale probabilistic sub-system (Figures 5.1b and c).  The
division is based on the values of fracture extensiveness, fracture
transmissivity and the certainty of identification and parameter assignment. 
The values at which the division is chosen vary from rock to rock, site to site
and progress during an investigation.  Certain large scale (regional) structural
features may influence hydraulic properties as much as lithological variation
and these have also to be considered.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.70 This same approach is described in section 1 of Volume 1 of Nirex 95
[COR/522].  On page 1.2 it states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;All hydrogeological modelling is based on representation, which
are usually simplifications (abstractions) of the underlying conceptual
model.....The numerical models aim to treat the important aspects of the system
in a way that is realistic, but is at an appropriate level of complexity,
without unnecessary detail.  Thus, for example, when groundwater flow in a
fractured rock on a regional scale is to be modelled, it would not be practical
to represent explicitly the extremely large numbers of fractures such a model
would involve.  In any case, such a model would provide far more detail than is
required.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.71 In paragraph 5.6 of his proof (PE/FOE/6) on page 11, Dr Hencher refers
to the heterogeneous response of oil wells.  He then goes on in paragraph 5.7 to
interpret this observation as being due to <I>&quot;the complex and variable
nature of fluid flow within fractured rock&quot;</I>.  The natural heterogeneity
in fractured rocks is indeed a feature of these materials and needs to be
explicitly dealt with.  This is clearly recognised in the conceptual and
numerical modelling work presented in Nirex 95 [COR/522].  Providing such
heterogeneity is dealt with in an appropriate manner it can simply be regarded
as a characteristic of the system rather than  being regarded as a source of
particular difficulty.
</P>
<P>8.72 In heterogeneous rock masses, as stated above, it is not necessary to
explicitly characterise and understand each and every fracture in order to
understand groundwater flow through the system.  It is, however, essential in
interpreting the results of small scale observations and measurements made
within the system, to recognise that these results will themselves reflect the
natural heterogeneity of the system.  Statements made in several of the
Objectors' proofs referring to a perceived lack of predictability of the system
at Sellafield reflect the lack of appreciation of three important aspects of
dealing with low permeability, heterogeneous systems, namely:

<P>8.73 Spatial variability has also been discussed in section 5 above.
</P>
<P>8.74 Dr Hencher does, however, state in paragraphs 3.5 and 3.6 of his
evidence (PE/FOE/6, page 6):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;It will be argued that until Nirex are able to demonstrate that
they understand data from existing sites and ongoing planned activities in
generic laboratories, they should not disturb the site at Sellafield, perhaps
irrevocably.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is concluded that to proceed to the RCF stage of repository
development prior to satisfactory completion of underlying generic research work
and validation of numerical models would be premature and ill-conceived.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.75 Dr Hencher is proposing an approach to the investigation of the site
which is different to that proposed by the Royal Society Study Group.  In their
report [COR/605] on page 110 they state (emphasis added):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;There are two routes forward and we expect Nirex to pursue both of
them: a continued effort to improve physical understanding of the relationship
between fracturing and water flow, and how these might change under possible
future conditions; and a palaeohydrogeological approach to the problem based on
observed present-day groundwater geochemistry and its relationship to historical
flow conditions.</I>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>The RCF will yield valuable information for the two approaches
outlined above, as well as providing data on the potential effects of repository

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.76 Fracture flow modelling is widely recognised as being an appropriate
technique for modelling groundwater flow and transport in low-permeability
fractured rocks.  It is used within the Swedish, US, Swiss, Finnish and Japanese
national radioactive waste disposal programmes, and of course the UK programme.

</P>
<P><U>Summary on Nirex Hydrogeological Modelling Studies</U>
</P>
<P>8.77 Several opposition proofs (for example PE/FOE/5, paragraph 3.25)
criticise Nirex for not using a wider range of models.  In fact a wide range of
conceptual and mathematical models are used.  Previous work is described in
section 6 of Volume 3 of Nirex Report 524 [COR/517] and in Nirex 95 [COR/522]. 
</P>
<P>8.78 Ongoing modelling studies are outlined in <A HREF="#Para8.89">paragraphs
8.89</A> to 8.102 of this supplementary proof.  Results from these studies are
still being assimilated and have not yet been published.  However, preliminary
analysis indicates that the models consistently predict low flow in the BVG and
further advances have been made in reproducing the distributions of pressure
head and salinity.

<P><B>The role of the RCF in understanding the regional hydrogeology</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.79"></A>8.79 In paragraph 7.2 (PE/CCC/4, page 43) Professor
Mather states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The RCF .... will add little to our knowledge of the regional
picture fundamental to an understanding of the controls on groundwater flow.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.80 Professor Mather accepts for the RCF solely that (paragraph 7.2, page
42, PE/CCC/4):-

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The RCF will enable the scale over which these networks are
observed to be up-rated from that of the borehole to that of the shafts and

will allow a more detailed understanding of the fracture network than it is
possible to obtain from surface boreholes and remote geophysical
measurements,......&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.81 He justifies his claim that the RCF will not assist in understanding
the hydrogeology by appealing to his review of the results of the Nirex
hydrogeological investigations and continuing that (paragraph 7.2 pages 42/43):-
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;...... the complexity and unpredictability of the hydrogeology
which has been highlighted in Section 6 of this Proof of Evidence means that
Nirex may well be able to get no nearer to obtaining a comprehensive
understanding of the networks of fractures and the controls of groundwater flow
than they are at present.  The RCF will provide data on the near-field and will
add little to our knowledge of the regional picture fundamental to an
understanding of the controls on groundwater flow.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.82 I do not agree with the assertions made by Professor Mather that the
RCF will not address issues related to the regional hydrogeology and set out in
the following paragraphs the reasons why I disagree with him.
</P>
<P>8.83 Regional hydrogeology is a term applied to the large-scale (kilometres
to tens of kilometres) pattern of groundwater movement in a flow system whose
boundaries and driving forces can be reasonably well defined and related to
geological and geographical features.
</P>
<P>8.84 Our current understanding of the regional hydrogeology of the
Sellafield area comes from a combination of hydraulic and hydrochemical data
from deep boreholes and studies of both present-day and historic records of
surface hydrology and sandstone hydrogeology (see section 10 of this
supplementary proof for information on the extent of this historical data). 
Most recently, this understanding was used to construct the regional flow model
which figures centrally in Nirex 95 [COR/522].
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.85"></A>8.85 The RCF programme addresses many issues apart
from regional hydrogeology, but it will provide four main contributions to the
current understanding:

were derived by the process of 'upscaling' to be tested by applying the
techniques to data obtained at the 10 metre and 100 metre length scale.  The RCF
experiments provide the means of testing and evaluating the assumptions and

specific issues in more detail than previously feasible (see
<A HREF="#Para10.39">paragraph 10.39</A> below).  Long-term monitoring of water
chamistry associated with specific features or fracture sets and specific
lithologies can be carried out by collection of inflows to sampling
installations in the walls of galleries or shafts or from boreholes drilled out
from them.

rocks by imposing a hydraulic signal which will affect many hundreds of millions

to the regional level.  The Borehole RCF3 Pump Test was a smaller scale version
of the same concept and tested six alternative models of flow in the BVG and two
in the overlying cover rocks.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>8.86 This latter aspect of the investigations, regarding the shaft drawdown
data, is consistent with that recommended by RWMAC in 1991 where they commented
on the Nirex site investigation programme that (RWMAC, Twelfth Annual Report,
1991, [GOV/404], page 11, paragraph 2.10):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;However, groundwater flow in basement-type rocks is dominated by
flow along fractures and it is unlikely that even several boreholes and the most
careful geophysics will be able to locate with any certainty all the important
groundwater channels.  Better awareness of the extent of the hydraulic coupling
between the groundwater in the cover sandstones and the basement below will be
obtained from observations of the response of the groundwater system to the
progressive stages of excavation of the shafts, and then the tunnels, associated
with the repository.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The reference to the repository is because this statement was made by the
RWMAC before the decision was taken to break-out the RCF as a separate activity.
 The comments regarding the usefulness of data from monitoring the response of
the groundwater system to excavation of shafts and galleries apply equally well
to the RCF as they did in 1991 to the repository.
</P>
<P>8.87 The RCF is not the only contributor to understanding of the regional
hydrogeology. An integrated programme of regional investigations has been
underway since 1991.  The first two stages of this programme involved collecting
historical data and data from the Nirex deep boreholes.  This has involved
gathering meteorological, spring, river and stream, mine working and pre-Nirex
borehole data.  The current stage is concerned with setting up automated
monitoring networks to collect meteorological, hydrological and groundwater data
(see description of Regional Hydrogeological Surveys in
<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA2">Table A.2</A>, Appendix 1,
<B>PE/NRX/14</B>).  These networks will also be used to monitor the impact of
RCF construction.
</P>
<P>8.88 The forward programme of deep borehole drilling and testing (<A
HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.3">Table 6.3</A>,
<B>PE/NRX/14</B>) will contribute further to understanding of the regional
hydrogeology.
</P>
<P><B>Recommendations for further investigations</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.89"></A>8.89 In section 5 of his evidence (PE/FOE/5) Dr
Salmon presents a series of recommendations for further surface-based
investigation studies and modelling.  Mr Reeves (PE/FOE/4, paragraph 8.5) also
presents recommendations for further investigations.  In paragraph 5.2 on page
46 (PE/FOE/5) Dr Salmon states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The need for further surface-based investigations and modelling
has been a central thread of my Evidence.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.90 Dr Salmon concludes (PE/FOE/5, paragraph 6.1, page 52):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;I consider that a RCF should not proceed until the work that I
have recommended has been satisfactorily completed, including a proper peer
review and due regard being paid to any subsequent comments&quot;.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.91 In Dr Salmon's final conclusion on page 53 (PE/FOE/5) at paragraph 6.6
he states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;In conclusion, I appreciate the eventual need for a RCF as part of
a repository development programme, but consider that the Sellafield RCF
planning application is premature.  Given the hydrogeological complexity of
Sellafield I also consider that Nirex should commence surface investigations at
other, more hydrogeologically favourable sites&quot;.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.92 In his final conclusion, Dr Salmon appears to recognise that the
Sellafield site may be shown to be a suitable repository site.  He is basing his
objection largely on the issue of prematurity.  The issue of alternative sites
has been addressed in section 4 of this supplementary proof.
</P>
<P>8.93 At paragraph 5.3 on pages 46 and 47 (PE/FOE/5) he sets out seven &quot;aims&quot;
for this further work that he recommends.  In paragraph 5.5 he sets out in more
detail examples of the types of investigations he considers are required.  He
concludes in paragraph 5.6 (PE/FOE/5) that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;I estimate that these tasks (excluding that for aim 6 which needs
to be further defined by Nirex) will take five or six years to complete.  Most
of this period is devoted to the establishment of baseline conditions.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.94 I do not disagree substantially with the statements made by Dr Salmon
concerning the range of additional surface-based work since all the aims raised
by him are already incorporated into Nirex's overall programme as explained
below.  I do, however, disagree with his views on timing, both with regard to
the length of time required to establish baseline hydrogeological conditions and
the extent to which the work can proceed in parallel with the RCF. The time
required to establish baseline conditions is dealt with in section 10 of this
supplementary proof.  Much of the other work described by Dr Salmon can proceed
in parallel with the schedule for the RCF.  These aims are discussed  below.
</P>
<P><U>Aim 1: to define further the geological sequence and hydrogeology in
three dimensions</U>
</P>
<P>8.95 Dr Salmon suggests two further boreholes on land and suggests that
there may be a case for one or more deep offshore boreholes to better
characterise the main potential radionuclide discharge area (see also Mr Reeves
PE/FOE/4, paragraph 7.3).  <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Table6.3">Table 6.3</A> in my
evidence (PE/FOE/14) summarises the planned programme of further surface-based
investigations.  This includes up to two boreholes to the south of the PRZ in
the area between Boreholes 2 and 11.  These are shown as 'drilling into the
Seascale Fault Zone'.  It is anticipated that this work can be carried out by
inclined drilling from the Borehole 11 site, but consideration is also being
given to whether it would be most appropriate to carry out this drilling from an
alternative site.  Up to four boreholes (Boreholes 15 to 18) are already planned
to investigate the saline transition zone, including in the area to the west of
the site on the predicted pathlines for groundwater flow that has passed through
the repository. Work on the first two of these boreholes is currently delayed as
Cumbria County Council have deferred a decision on the planning application. 
Drilling onshore is preferred for two reasons.  Firstly, it provides easier
access for long-term testing and monitoring, and secondly, it is considerably
cheaper than drilling offshore.  Information from drilling offshore needs to be
shown to have a significant benefit to our confidence in the evaluation of the
repository system before a commitment should be made. Currently, such a
commitment cannot be justified.  Regarding drilling to the north-west of
Borehole RCF3, Nirex does not consider that such a borehole is required, given
the scope for investigation from the RCF itself. Thus the proposals made by Dr
Salmon have been included within Nirex's future  programme of work.  As the
additional boreholes are at some considerable distance from the RCF, in areas
unlikely to be influenced by the RCF, there is no reason why this work should
not proceed in parallel with the RCF.
</P>
<P><U>Aim 2: to determine baseline environmental head and geochemical
conditions</U>
</P>
<P>8.96 This issue is dealt with in section 10 of this supplementary proof.
</P>
<P><U>Aim 3: to test further the connectivity of strata and fractures</U>
</P>
<P>8.97 Dr Salmon states that the scope for further cross-borehole tests and
pump tests is limited.  Nirex is currently analysing the results of the Borehole
RCF 3 Pump Test and considering tracer tests.  The monitoring system installed
in the deep boreholes is designed to allow sampling of groundwater for
monitoring of chemical variation and detection of tracers.  The need for further
tests will be reviewed in the light of results to date and further work will be
planned to complement testing associated with the phased RCF development.  Tests
of the connectivity of strata and fractures around the RCF and Potential
Repository Zone are best done by monitoring the disturbance due to activities
such as the controlled disturbance to the groundwater from shaft sinking.  This
will particularly measure the connectivity between the fracture networks in the
BVG and the porous strata in the cover sequence.
</P>
<P><U>Aim 4 : to refine the model in an attempt to enable it adequately to
replicate existing groundwater conditions and the effect of any field testing</U>
</P>
<P>8.98 Nirex generally agrees - this is what we are doing with our ongoing
hydrogeological characterisation and modelling and the RCF is a further
development of this process.  We are not just refining one model but are
developing and testing a range of models to develop understanding of the
hydrogeological system.  None of this activity needs to delay RCF construction
as the phased RCF activities will help to refine, develop and validate the
models and their prediction of responses to RCF development.
</P>
<P><U>Aim 5 : to model the impact of the proposed RCF construction on baseline
conditions and the PCPA</U>
</P>
<P>8.99 Nirex agrees - such modelling is part of our planned programme.  As
Salmon accepts, it is part of model development as discussed above.  This is
programmed in as part of the experimentation and modelling related to the phased
RCF development.
</P>
<P><U>Aim 6 : to assess the effectiveness of sealing techniques</U>
</P>
<P>8.100 This is part of Nirex's ongoing research.  Current laboratory results
will be further developed once the RCF is developed.
</P>
<P><U>Aim 7 : to begin to develop more appropriate modelling strategies for
determining the long-term safety case of any future repository proposals</U>
</P>
<P>8.101 The current strategy is an appropriate one for this stage of the
investigation (Nirex S/94/004 [COR/510]).  However, further developments are
planned, e.g. to take account of new data from the analysis of the Borehole RCF3
Pump Test and to investigate particular issues.  Such plans are highlighted in
Section 3 of Nirex Report S/94/004 [COR/510].
</P>
<P>8.102 Thus, all the work suggested as being necessary by Dr Salmon, and
more, is already in hand or planned by Nirex as part of an integrated programme
of site characterisation of which the RCF forms a part.  There are no reasons
for this work to delay the granting of planning permission for the RCF.

of this section.
</P>
<P><B>Lack of geochemical boreholes</B>
</P>
<P>9.5 In paragraph 6.5.1 (PE/CCC/4), Professor Mather states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The lack of a programme of boreholes drilled specifically to
obtain hydrogeochemical data is one of the major deficiencies of the current
borehole programme.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.6 Nirex has drilled both deep and shallow boreholes at the Sellafield site
to gain a regional understanding of the groundwater flow and hydrochemical
patterns across the site. These boreholes have had multiple objectives, as a
number of features have been required to be explored by each borehole.  The
collection of groundwater samples from the Sellafield boreholes, in particular
in the BVG, is further complicated by the generally low groundwater flow. This
restricts the amount of water available for collection in any given period of
time. Rigorous procedures have been applied to the collection and evaluation of
groundwater samples, in order to ensure that the best feasible quality has been
achieved, and that any contamination resulting from the drilling of the borehole
or from other sample collection effects can be assessed and corrected for in
determining in-situ groundwater compositions. These issues have been previously
discussed in my Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>, Appendix 1,
<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#ParaA4.4">Sections A4.4</A> - A4.6).
</P>
<P>9.7 The subject of the reliability of the geochemical data from the deep
boreholes was a matter about which the Royal Society Study Group showed
considerable interest.  Information was presented to the Study Group by Nirex
specialists and, as a result, on page 105 of their report [COR/605] the Study
Group states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Nirex have thus demonstrated a capability to obtain high quality
hydrochemical samples from existing boreholes.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.8 This information, presented to the Royal Society Study Group, was
subsequently written up as a technical report for Nirex {Nirex Report 701} which
is referenced in Nirex Report S/95/008 [COR/525].  Professor Mather makes no
mention of having consulted this report.
</P>
<P>9.9 The second point concerning Professor Mather's comments on geochemical
boreholes is that Nirex has applied on 30 May 1995 for planning permission to
drill two boreholes (Boreholes 15 and 16).  The covering letters to Cumbria
County Council (Ref: DB/ah/PZ/PP/225 and 226) that accompanied these
applications state <I>&quot;The primary objective of these boreholes is to
extend the current understanding of the geochemical conditions as indicators of
past and present groundwater flow and mixing&quot;</I>.  Cumbria County Council
has deferred making a decision on this application.

</P>
<P><B>The saline transition zone and groundwater mixing in the PRZ</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.11"></A>9.11 In paragraph 6.5.5 of PE/CCC/4, Professor
Mather indicates that the saline transition zone in the PRZ is not sharp and
goes on to argue that this is
<I>&quot;clear evidence to support an upward flow from the BVG into the SSG in
the area of the PRZ&quot;</I>.  The following paragraphs 9.12 to 9.20 establish
that the saline transition zone is relatively sharp and occurs in the Brockram
and basal sandstones, which may be the result of the proximity to relatively
high permeability contrasts between the sandstones and the Brockram.
</P>
<P>9.12 In paragraph 6.5.5 (PE/CCC/4), Professor Mather questions the statement
made in my proof of evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>, <A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.67">paragraphs
6.67</A>) that the saline interface zone is relatively sharp in the PRZ.  He
states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;However, this is only because of the arbitrary definition of the
transition zone as the range over which the electrical conductivity of the
groundwater changes from less than 10 to over 17 mS cm<SUP>-1</SUP> (at 20&#176;
C) (see paragraph 3.2 of {Nirex Science Report S/95/008}).&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.13 Reference to paragraph 3.2 in Nirex Report S/95/008 [COR/525] indicates
that the statement made was:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The transition from brackish waters to saline waters is known as
the saline transition zone (STZ) and has been defined as the depth range over
which the electrical conductivity of the groundwater changes from less than 10
to over 17 mS/cm (at 20&#176; C).  The upper value is equivalent to 10 g/l of
total dissolved solids or about 6 g/l chloride.  Definitions of fresh and
increasingly saline waters are given in the glossary.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.14 The glossary in Nirex Report S/95/008 [COR/525] on page G2 states the
definitions used for fresh, brackish, and saline waters, and brines.  It is
stated that these definitions are based on the published work of Davis (1964)
and Carpenter (1978).  Thus, the definitions of salinity used by Nirex are
certainly not arbitrary and are based on standard texts.
</P>
<P>9.15 This interpretation of the salinity distribution at Sellafield is
presented in section 3 of Nirex Report S/95/008 [COR/525].  The summary, as
given in paragraph 3.10 on page 16 states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;A unified representation of the saline transition zone and other
salinity variations across the site has been achieved and is presented.  The
saline transition zone in the Potential Repository Zone is relatively sharp and
occurs in the Brockram and basal sandstones.  This is possibly the result of
proximity to the relatively high permeability contrasts between the sandstones
and Brockram in the locality.  To the south and west of the Potential Repository
Zone, the saline transition zone is more diffuse.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.16 The pattern of salinity in the upper part of the BVG is consistent with
the current understanding of the site, which suggests that, in the boreholes
drilled in the PRZ, zones of slightly higher hydraulic conductivity are
indicated  in the upper part of the BVG as compared with deeper BVG.
</P>
<P>9.17 Professor Mather uses his Figure 3 (page 32 of PE/CCC/4) and states
that this <I>&quot;proves how spectacularly wrong&quot;</I> Nirex were in
refuting his earlier suggestions of estimates of upward flow made in ERM  Report
ITA/7 [COR/608].  Professor Mather's Figure 3 is a reproduction of Figure 3.1 in
Nirex Report S/95/008 [COR/525].  Professor Mather does not point out that the
original figure was labelled as a &quot;Composite plot of Cl concentration vs.
depth for the PRZ&quot; and that it contained data from a total of nine separate
boreholes.  He also does not point out that the plots for the individual
boreholes are contained in Appendix C to the same report (S/95/008 [COR/525]).
Professor Mather is overemphasising the implications of salinity levels in
excess of 20 mg/l being observed in the base of the sandstones by not placing
these observations in context.
</P>
<P>9.18 The observations of high salinities in the lower part of the St Bees
Sandstone referred to in paragraph 6.5.6 of Professor Mather's evidence
(PE/CCC/4) are based on a limited number of samples.  The samples showing high
salinities are obtained from the North Head Member at the base of the St Bees
Sandstone.  The chloride versus depth profiles for the individual boreholes in
Appendix C of Nirex Report S/95/008 [COR/525] shows how these individual samples
relate to the interpreted position of the saline transition zone in each of
these boreholes.  Examination of the information presented by Nirex indicates
that over substantial parts of the PRZ, the saline transition zone is sharp, but
is actually located within the North Head Member of the St Bees Sandstone rather
than at the top of the BVG or within the Brockram. The interpretation of this
information presented in Nirex Report S/95/008 [COR/525] is that 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;the saline transition zone in the Potential Repository Zone is
relatively sharp and occurs in the Brockram and basal sandstones. This is
possibly the result of proximity to the relatively high permeability contrasts
between the sandstones and Brockram in the locality.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.19 As discussed previously, (<A HREF="#Para8.32">paragraphs 8.32</A>),
the inferences drawn in Nirex Report S/95/007 [COR/524] are that the North Head
Member has distinctive geological and hydrogeological properties from the
overlying St Bees Sandstone and is considered to be a possible low permeability
control on flow between the North Head Member and the overlying sandstones. The
conclusion is therefore that the North Head Member contributes to the
permeability contrast between the upper stratigraphic units of the sandstone and
the lower formations, and hence the saline transition zone in the PRZ exists in
part within the North Head Member.
</P>
<P>9.20 Detailed examination of the hydrochemical data, in conjunction with
other evidence presented by Nirex therefore indicates that it is inappropriate
for Professor Mather to conclude that the observed salinity profiles are
indicators of significant upwards flow.  At present, although the existence of a
groundwater mixing profile is evident, it is not possible to use the geochemical
data alone to speculate about the extent of this mixing.  Further data, from the
RCF Phase 1 work, are considered essential to quantify this rigorously.
</P>
<P><B>Geochemical indicators of residence times have been over-interpreted</B>
</P>
<P>9.21 In paragraph 6.5.10 on page 35 of PE/CCC/4, Professor Mather states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;It is my view that the noble gas data are over-interpreted&quot;.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.22 Professor Mather makes other comments in section 6.5 of his evidence
(PE/CCC/4), as does Dr Haszeldine in section 11 of his evidence (PE/GNP/3) that
the information on residence times for groundwater have been over-interpreted by
Nirex.  At paragraph 11.6 (page 29, PE/GNP/3), Dr Haszeldine states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;it is difficult to envisage how water samples from these Nirex
boreholes can be confidently interpreted to yield single ages.&quot;</I>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Thus any analysis of water from such a BVG flow system will

<P>9.26 Nirex is aware of this interpretation and this is why residence times
are quoted as mean residence times.  A range of sample types are analysed,
including core pore fluids and fluids sampled during well testing (<A
HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA4">Table A4</A>, page A21, Appendix 1, <B>PE/NRX/14</B>). 
The majority of samples analysed for groundwater residence indicators are those
taken from well testing in the boreholes. These sample the flow system around
the borehole. In the BVG, these samples are dominated by flow from the fracture
system.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;It is possible that rates of regional flows of subsurface waters
in the future could be much more rapid than any inferred today.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.28 This statement is made on the basis that Dr Haszeldine suggests in
section 10 of his evidence that data for hydrogen and oxygen isotope and noble

glacial periods when the regional permeability of the BVG might have been much
greater than its present value.

glaciation.  He assumes that the observed hydrogen and oxygen isotopic ratios
and low noble gas recharge temperatures indicate that groundwater was recharged
under glacial conditions.  Nirex Report S/95/008 (paragraph 5.3, page 26,

interspersed with warm periods, giving the impression that warm (temperate)
climate states were common in the Pleistocene.  In fact, the dominant climate
states were colder than today's temperate climate, but only rarely glacial (see
Table on page 22 of Nirex Report S/95/003 [COR/527]).

<P>9.31 In paragraph 10.2 (page 26, PE/GNP/3) Dr Haszeldine asserts that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;it is apparent that there is little evidence for water recharge
into the BVG in warm period climates, such as today&quot;.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.32 He then goes on to argue that recharge to the BVG may have been
restricted to colder (i.e. glacial) periods, and presents a cartoon in Figure
10.2 of PE/GNP/3 that suggests that this was due both to increased heads under
the ice and to opening of fractures due to ice loading.  This is how he makes
the connection between the stable isotope data and the idea that the BVG
permeability (<I>&quot;transmissivities&quot;</I>)  may have been higher during
past glaciations.
</P>
<P>9.33 His own evidence (paragraph 11.4, page 29, PE/GNP/3) emphasises his
view regarding the effect of mixing on isotopic indicators of groundwater age,
and stable isotopes are no exception.  If the Nirex view that temperate climate
conditions were the exception rather than the rule in the Pleistocene is
accepted (see paragraph 9.30 above), we would not expect to find spatially
distinct groundwater zones with stable isotopic signatures of temperate recharge
events pre-dating the last (late Devensian) glaciation, as Dr Haszeldine seems
to expect.
</P>
<P>9.34 In fact, isotopically heavy water characterises the brine in the BVG in
Borehole 3.  In Nirex Report S/95/008 (paragraph 5.8, page 28, [COR/525]), it is
said that this <I>&quot;might indicate recharge prior to the last glacial epoch&quot;</I>
i.e. before the Pleistocene, possibly associated with Tertiary tectonic events.
</P>
<P>9.35 Thus there is no evidence, only speculation by Dr Haszeldine that there
was preferential and enhanced recharge to the BVG during glacial periods.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;I consider that it would be a sensible precaution to define
baseline conditions as being established when relatively stable or predictable
heads and geochemistry has been observed over a period of four or five years at

<P>10.4 Mr Reeves (paragraph 8.5, page 42, PE/FOE/4) states:

<P>10.5 Similar views are stated by Drs Green and Western (PE/FOE/1, paragraph

<P>10.6 The Nirex position, as stated in <A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#Appendix2">Appendix

recognisable in all boreholes as shown by constant head with time or systematic
seasonal variations (<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#ParaB2.16">paragraph B.2.16</A>,
Appendix 2, <B>PE/NRX/14</B>).  It has been further pointed out that monitoring
will continue and further baseline data will become available prior to
commencement of shaft excavation (a further 2 years approximately).  A review of
baseline conditions carried out for Nirex in September 1995 by Professor Lloyd,
(Professor of Hydrogeology, University of Birmingham) has confirmed the Nirex
view that baseline has been established [NRX/14/3].

</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>10.11 These issues are discussed in turn below.
</P>
<P><U>Data availability</U>
</P>
<P>10.12 At paragraph 7.7 (page 31, PE/FOE/4), Mr Reeves comments on the extent
of the data available in the sandstones and drift.  He is incorrect in his
assertions concerning the limited amount of data.  There are 16 boreholes with
data from 1974 and there are at least 17 drift boreholes with more than 9 years
of data {Nirex Report 233, Table 2.11}.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para10.13"></A>10.13 In the early 1980s extensive investigations
into the water resources of west Cumbria were conducted by the North West Water
Authority, and subsequently by BNFL.  As a results of this there are 41
observation wells with more than 10 years records, and 24 observation wells with
more than 5 years records.  The results of 13 aquifer pumping tests are
available from this investigation, which included monitoring the effects of the
development on water levels in the Drift, and on flows from springs and in the
River Calder {Nirex Report 233, Table 3.2}.  It is noted that the hydrographs
presented by Mr Reeves from Cumbria (Figure 5, PE/FOE/4) display substantially
the same pattern of water levels as the hydrograph he presents for Shropshire
(Figure 1, PE/FOE/4), except the 1976 drought was less intense in coastal
Cumbria than it was in the Midlands.  This demonstrates that the Cumbria
hydrographs are comparable to the national trends in water level changes.
</P>
<P>10.14 As part of the development of nuclear facilities in the area,
investigations of the relationships between water levels in the drift and
underlying sandstone were conducted at Drigg and Sellafield.  Professor Mather
refers to the Sellafield investigations in CCC/4/3.
</P>
<P>10.15 The above data show that the investigations of groundwater conditions
in west Cumbria, although not performed specifically in connection with the
Nirex work, were of a duration and intensity that bears comparison with
investigations for groundwater schemes elsewhere in the UK and is greater than
suggested by Mr Reeves.
</P>
<P><U>Comparison with regional groundwater schemes</U>
</P>
<P>10.16 In section 5 of his evidence (PE/FOE/4), Mr Reeves draws comparisons
between the Nirex data acquisition programme, and a number of data acquisition
programmes associated with different projects.  In particular, three groundwater
schemes are cited: Thames, Shropshire and the Fylde, the latter two exploiting
the Sherwood Sandstone Group, as found at Sellafield.  All three of these
schemes are very large, designed to impact water resources on a regional or
national scale.  They involve groundwater abstractions rather larger than the
total flow of the River Calder in west Cumbria.  The likely scale of impact can
be expected to be much greater than the groundwater impact of the RCF, yet it
can be seen that the number of observation wells and the timescale of
observations are in fact similar to those for the Sellafield area, as described
above.
</P>
<P>10.17 Thus compared with other investigations of comparable scale, Nirex has
a comparable amount of data from many of its monitoring installations.  As
stated in my evidence (Appendix 2, <A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#ParaB2.16">paragraph
B.2.16</A>-17, <B>PE/NRX/14</B>) the baseline has been established and a
further two years of monitoring will be available before excavation of the RCF
South Shaft is due to commence.  As far as we are aware, there is no tradition
of requiring five years data from specially installed monitoring.
</P>
<P><U>Objectives and Duration of monitoring</U>
</P>
<P>10.18 Natural systems are seldom static, but exist in a state of
fluctuation.  The objective of monitoring over a period of time, rather than
taking just a single measurement, is to characterise this fluctuation with time.
</P>
<P>10.19 Natural changes to groundwater systems occur over a complete spectrum
of timescales.  As described in Appendix 2 of <B>PE/NRX/14</B> (<A
HREF="nrx14a1.htm#ParaB2.11">paragraph B.2.11</A> to B.2.15  on pages B.5 and
B.6), Nirex has already characterised gravitational effects (occurring on cycles
of 12 hours 25 minutes), barometric effects (24 hours to several days), seasonal
effects (1 year), synoptic effects (occurring over several years) and has
possibly identified solar effects (22 years).  In addition, there is evidence
for long-term synoptic effects (about 50 year cycles), climatic effects (100
years to 100,000 years), and tectonic effects (100,000 years plus), all of which
are applicable on a much larger scale than just west Cumbria.
</P>
<P>10.20 Given this continuous spectrum, there is no clear point at which to
stop monitoring and it is therefore necessary to form a judgement as to what is
sufficient.  Some fluctuations can be directly measured and determined on a site
specific basis, others, such as, for example, climatic effects and tectonic
effects must be established by other means and the uncertainties associated with
such estimates taken account of in the safety assessments of the site.
</P>
<P>10.21 There are two clear uses for the variability recorded in long-term
monitoring data:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">the characteristics of the variations can be interpreted in
terms of the hydrogeological properties of the site; and
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">ii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">the natural variability needs to be subtracted from
artificially induced changes, such as pump testing and the drawdown caused by
RCF shaft excavation, in order to measure correctly the size of these changes.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>10.22 In terms of hydrogeological properties it can be shown by
consideration of the diffusion equation that longer timescale fluctuations
directly increase information on hydraulic conductivity.  In progressing from
daily fluctuations to annual fluctuations there is a significant gain in
information of around 2.5 orders of magnitude, whereas further progress to
short-term synoptic fluctuations gives a further increase of only a further 0.5
orders of magnitude.  In order to characterise cyclic fluctuations, it is
necessary to observe one cycle if the period is known, rather more cycles if it
is unknown.
</P>
<P>10.23 In terms of correcting observations for natural fluctuations, if the
fluctuations have been explained in terms of hydrogeological properties, the
corrections can be made on this basis alone.  Otherwise, it will be necessary to
measure the natural fluctuations in their own right.  It is helpful if the trend
can be correlated with trends in boreholes independent of the imposed
disturbance.  For the longer term effects, which are of more than local
significance, the correlation boreholes need not be local.  The good correlation
of water levels between Cumbria and Shropshire (<A HREF="#Para10.13">paragraphs
10.13</A> above) is an example of this.
</P>
<P>10.24 Mr Reeves' assertion that at least five years' data are necessary can
be examined in the light of the above discussion.  Five years' data are clearly
more than adequate to characterise fluctuations up to the scale of annual
fluctuations.  Nearly all the likely information on hydrogeological properties
can be extracted from annual fluctuations.  Five years' data are inadequate to
characterise synoptic variations; this can be seen clearly by moving a five year
window over the hydrographs presented by Mr Reeves (Figures 1 and 5 in
PE/FOE/4).  To characterise such variations, of the order of twenty years' data
are required.  However, this yields little extra hydrogeological information,
and the trends within this can be characterised by less than five years' data. 
Correlations with other boreholes can also be used.
</P>
<P>10.25 It is also relevant to consider the use that can be made of long-term
monitoring data, for example that presented by Mr Reeves (Figures 8 and 9 in
Appendix 1 to PE/FOE/4).  Figure 9 shows a fairly consistent mean head, about
which annual fluctuations occur.  The only major excursion is in 1988.  The long
record has increased confidence that there are no long-term trends in this
dataset, but has added little information beyond that captured by the first one
or two years' data.  The hydrograph in Figure 8 (Appendix 1, PE/FOE/4) shows the
impact of shaft sinking followed by an almost straight line recovery onto which
is superimposed the annual fluctuations.  These annual fluctuations are rather
larger than in Figure 9.  The excursion in 1988 is clearly visible.  The record
prior to shaft sinking is only about 6 months in duration in Figure 8 and is too
short to establish whether the amplitude of annual fluctuations has been changed
by the shaft sinking.  However, it is not clear that the long record of data
post-sinking has added much information over that gained in the first one or two
years.
</P>
<P><U>Conclusion</U>
</P>
<P>10.26 The baseline groundwater conditions have been established at
Sellafield.  A further two years of monitoring will be available before
commencement of the RCF South Shaft excavation commences.  There is no
justification for the arbitrary assertions by Dr Salmon and Mr Reeves that a
further 4 or 5 years of monitoring is required before commencement of the RCF.
</P>
<P><B>Geochemical Conditions</B>
</P>
<P>10.27 At paragraph 6.5.1 (PE/CCC/4), Professor Mather states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The lack of a programme of boreholes drilled specifically to
obtain hydrogeochemical data is one of the major deficiencies of the current
borehole programme.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>10.28 Dr Wogelius (PE/FOE/8) makes a related assertion at paragraph 9.9:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Many aspects of the geochemistry of the site as it stands are
currently poorly understood.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>10.29 However, he does not go on to say what these are or why he believes
they are poorly understood.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para10.30"></A>10.30 These witnesses call into question whether
sufficient geochemical information has been collected prior to RCF excavation. 
In the following section I explain why baseline hydrochemical information is
only required for certain purposes, why sufficient geochemical information, of
sufficient quality, is already available for these purposes and why further
planned work to improve the baseline will be unaffected by the excavation of the
RCF.  I also explain why the RCF offers the only means to obtain baseline
hydrochemical data relevant for other purposes.
</P>
<P><U>Objective of Hydrochemical Observations</U>
</P>
<P>10.31 Hydrogeochemical baseline information is required at the current stage
of investigations principally to assist with the development of the regional
groundwater flow model. The main components of the hydrogeochemical data used to
do this have been salinity and other major chemical component data (to help
identify the processes leading to the distribution of the main bodies of water
present) and isotopic data (which give indications of origins and movement of
these waters; so-called palaeohydrogeological information).
</P>
<P>10.32 At later stages in the programme, requirements for hydrogeochemical
data will become more specific in terms of targetting hydrogeological features
or regions of interest or in terms of evaluating specific mechanisms and
pathways.
</P>
<P><U>Data used in Current Regional Model</U>
</P>
<P>10.33 The principal source of data used to draw the current hydrogeochemical
baseline has been water samples taken from cores and during hydraulic testing of
the deep boreholes. These samples were all contaminated to varying extents by
drilling fluids but it has been possible to make analytical corrections to
provide good quality data which are 'fit for purpose'. This is described in
detail in Appendix 2 (<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#B3">B.3</A>) of my Proof of Evidence
(<B>PE/NRX/14</B>) and the views of the Royal Society Study Group on data
quality were stated earlier, at
<A HREF="#Para9.3">paragraph 9.3</A> of this proof.

discussed below.

<P><U>Future Programme</U>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para10.36"></A>10.36 Specifically 'geochemical' boreholes
(currently, boreholes 15-18 into the sandstones), in which collection of
hydrochemical data takes precedence over other measurements, are planned to
enhance understanding in volumes of rock where the conceptual regional
hydrogeological model is sensitive. These may include the saline transition
zone, other regions of groundwater mixing and discharge zones.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para10.37"></A>10.37 Continued sampling of existing and planned
deep boreholes will provide progressively less contaminated samples for isotopic
analysis which will enable the construction of a model of regional
palaeohydrogeology. This will considerably strengthen the regional flow model.
At present, this work is in its early stages.

<P>10.38 Sampling of entirely undisturbed conditions within the PRZ will not be

<TD WIDTH="800">Very detailed hydrochemical characterisation of undisturbed PRZ
groundwaters with a view to evaluation of their impact on the proposed

repository excavations themselves (to which the RCF is analogous).  In
particular, the evolution of pore-waters in the cementitious engineered barriers
and the wastes and the interactions of the consequent chemical 'plume' with the
rock will need to be demonstrably understood. Monitoring of the hydrochemical
disturbance caused by the excavations,such as the RCF, is of considerably
greater significance in evaluating the future behaviour of the PRZ than is
information on its undisturbed state.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><A NAME="Para10.39"></A>10.39 In addition to these points it must be

composition of more transmissive features/regions as the drawdown progresses
will provide valuable information on flow patterns in the PRZ region. This
latter approach has been used successfully to study the impacts of major

analogous to those existing prior to disturbance by the RCF will be encountered.
It must also be borne in mind that the response time of the hydrogeochemistry to
drawdown and excavation will vary depending on the hydraulic properties of the
rock or of the feature intersected. Low transmissivity parts of the deep BVG are
expected to remain essentially unaffected chemically and be accessible for
sampling for a considerable period.

<TD WIDTH="800">Faulting that has been active during the past 60 million years
is <U>not</U> the only explanation for the change in orientation of apparent
uplift contours.  Expulsion of warm mineralised fluids at the basin margin is a
more likely explanation for locally enhanced values of apparent uplift - and the
process is as proposed by Dr Haszeldine and others for the origin of the
hematite ore bodies of the south Cumbria area.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>11.11 Nevertheless, Dr Haszeldine associates this apparent discontinuity
with the Lake District Boundary Fault, comments that this structure is an
extensional fault and, subsequently, (paragraphs 7.5 to 7.7, PE/GNP/3) draws an
association between extensional faulting and groundwater expulsion.
</P>
<P>11.12 The evidence for regional uplift in the Lake District is not disputed.
 Nirex has presented this information in a number of reports.  However, Dr
Haszeldine fails to make the point that uplift occurred everywhere else in
Britain.  Section 6.1.4 of Volume 1 of Nirex Report 524 [COR/517] on page 37
states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Uplift at about the Cretaceous-Tertiary is ubiquitous in Britain.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>11.13 Dr Haszeldine also fails to recognise that this latest period of
movement on the Lake District Boundary Fault, would not have been extensional,
as he implies, but compressional.  This is explained on page 38 of Volume 1 of
Nirex Report 524 [COR/517] where it is stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Further evidence of basin inversion superimposed upon a broad,
regional uplift is provided by the seismic reflection data with examples of
fault reversal and local anticlinal folding.  Compression, orientated roughly
N-, is consistent with the fact that NE-trending structures, such as the
Maryport and Lagman faults, were preferentially reversed.  This resulted in
inversion of the Solway Firth Basin and northern part of the Langman Basin which
appear to have been buttressed against the Ramsay-Whitehaven Ridge.  In the
vicinity of Sellafield, any displacements on the LDBFZ would have been markedly
transpressional.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>11.14 The 'LDBFZ' is the Lake District Boundary Fault Zone. 
'Transpressional, as stated in the Glossary of Volume 1 of Nirex Report 524
[COR/517] means <I>&quot;Action of compressive stress oblique to the trend of a
fault.  Results in oblique-reverse displacement of the fault.&quot;</I>  In
other words, it is not extensional.
</P>
<P>11.15 Thus, Dr Haszeldine is being somewhat misleading in stating that the
Lake District Boundary Fault is an extensional fault.  Whilst it formed
originally in an extensional regime, it latest movements were not extensional.
</P>
<P><B>Features within the glacial sediments</B>
</P>
<P>11.16 Nirex is investigating possible neotectonic features and attempting to
distinguish such evidence from the relatively common glacitectonic structural
features due to internal deformation of the Quaternary by the movement across it
of ice sheets.  These have produced compressional and extensional dislocations. 
The section in Volume 1 of Nirex Report 524 (page 11) [COR/517] to which Dr
Haszeldine may be referring in paragraph 7.4 (page 18, PE/GNP/3) is
comprehensive and sufficient to show that we are addressing the subject and it
is not a major omission as he claims:-
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>&quot;2.5 Neotectonics and seismic hazard</B></I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Since the preparation of Nirex Report Number 263, there have been
further investigations of seismological, geophysical, geological and remotely
sensed features, to determine whether they may indicate neotectonic activity. 
In particular, potentially faulted offsets of rockhead and Quaternary sediments
have been interpreted from onshore and offshore seismic reflection data.  No
firm field evidence of neotectonic activity has been found in the onshore
district although sites which might be the most likely to reveal such evidence
have been identified for further study.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Tectonic Regime in the UK</B>
</P>
<P>11.17 Dr Haszeldine states in paragraph 7.7 (PE/GNP/3) that Britain is in an
extensional regime.  He is incorrect in this assertion.  His mistake may have
arisen from misleading statements in the references he quotes (GNP/3/7 and
GOV/613).
</P>
<P>11.18 In the 1992 HMIP Report (page 30, section 2.7.2, British Earthquakes,
paragraph 1 [GOV/613]), Dr Muir Wood is initially definitive that Britain, in
contrast to other intraplate regions, is in an extensional regime but, on
refering to section 3, the evidence for extension is admitted to be minor with
evidence for strike-slip faulting predominant (page 63, section 3.2.5
[GOV/613]).  More specifically, for western Britain, including the Sellafield
area, it is accepted that the regime is not extensional.
</P>
<P>11.19 By the early 1990's, observations of present day stress fields by
earthquake focal mechanism studies, <I>in situ</I> stress measurements and
borehole break-out analyses had shown that the European stress state was
generally not extensional, but in a similar compressional state to other
intraplate areas.  In a summary paper on &quot;Regional Patterns of Tectonic
Stress in Europe&quot;, Muller <I>et al</I>, 1992 (Figure 3, page 11,787
[NRX/14/6]) provided maps of stress indicators.  On a generalised stress map 
they classified these as compressional or extensional.  <I>&quot;Inward
directed arrows indicate the maximum horizontal compression directions in
regions of dominantly compressive stress regimes (either thrust or strike-slip
faulting).  Outward directed arrows indicate the least horizontal stress in
regions of extension.&quot;</I>  Areas of dominant extension were only present
in Italy, Greece and Turkey.  All other areas were dominantly compressional,
with a limited number of local extensional zones as in the Rhine graben and in
uplift zones following melting of thick ice sheets. Even basins formed in an
extensional regime, such as the North Sea, were generally in a situation of
present-day compression.  All but two of the many stress indicators in Britain
were compressional.  One of these extensional indicators was in eastern England
near the Wash, the other was in the SW Scottish Highlands, in the area of
maximum ice load during the Pleistocene.
</P>
<P>11.20 In the HMIP report [GOV/613] reference is made to an article (King,
page 90) on fault plane solutions for the 1979 Carlisle earthquake.  This was
not discussed in detail but is relevant to Sellafield as the nearest earthquake
of moderate size that had been instrumentally monitored in detail and results
analysed to determine the stress pattern.  One mechanism was thrust/reverse
faulting, the other mainly strike-slip, i.e. neither were extensional.  King
favoured the reverse faulting solution but later more detailed analysis by the
BGS {SA/95/003}, including the aftershock data, preferred an oblique strike slip
mechanism.
</P>
<P>11.21 Subsequently, as part of the Nirex Seismic Hazard Assessment,
[SA/95/003], the data for the 1979 Carlisle (Longtown) earthquake were
re-analysed and confirmed the strike slip solution.  Additionally, analysis of
the 1993 Grange-over-Sands earthquake, at 3.0 M<SUB>L</SUB> the largest
earthquake recorded by the BNFL/Nirex monitoring and the closest earthquake of
moderate size to Sellafield, indicated strike-slip with a small component of
reverse movement.  Such a mechanism was found to generally apply to the great
majority of earthquake fault plane solutions in the area.  Pure reverse or
normal faulting is minor and associated with the smaller earthquakes.  It was
noted ([11] p 48 paragraph 2) that:<I> &quot;At or above this magnitude (3M<SUB>L</SUB>),
focal mechanisms elsewhere in Britain invariably appear to be strike-slip&quot;</I>.
</P>
<P>11.22 Therefore, earthquake analysis confirms that the stress regime at
seismogenic depth in the Sellafield area is not extensional but generally
strike-slip and similar to that in the majority of Britain and north-west
Europe.  Thus, Dr Haszeldine is incorrect in stating that the tectonic regime in
Britain is extensional.
</P>
<P><B>Effect of Earthquakes on Groundwater</B>
</P>
<P>11.23 Dr Haszeldine (paragraph 7.5, PE/GNP/3) states that earthquakes can
pump water to the surface as a consequence of their aftermath.  He quotes
information from GNP/3/7 in support of his statements.  He then extends his
argument to the UK quoting information from GOV/613 in his paragraph 7.7.
</P>
<P>11.24 In the 1992 DoE/HMIP Report [GOV/613], Muir Wood and Woo suggest that
normal fault earthquakes can have a major effect on groundwater whereas reverse
fault earthquakes do not produce significant effects.  Strike-slip earthquakes
were found to produce a variety of responses and this was considered to be due
to the associated component of normal or reverse faulting.
</P>
<P>11.25 The relevant extract for strike-slip earthquakes is (page 16
[GOV/613]):

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;2.4 Strike-slip Faults</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>2.4.1 General remarks</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>As might be predicted from the findings concerning normal and reverse
fault earthquakes, strike-slip fault displacements are found to cause a
diversity of responses.  Many strike-slip faults are accompanied by some
component of normal or reverse displacement, and it is evident that this can be
of particular importance in dictating the resulting hydrological signatures.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>11.26 Dr Haszeldine draws an analogy in paragraphs 7.5 and 7.6 (PE/GNP/3)
between the reported effects of the 1959 Hegben Lake earthquake and the 1983
Borah Peak earthquake.  His diagrams (7.5 and 7.6) both, however, refer to the
Hegben Lake event.  He does not mention that both events were large earthquakes
on normal faults in an extensional regime and were therefore not analogues for
potential effects at Sellafield.  Section 2.2 on page 5 of  GOV/613 is headed &quot;Normal
Fault Earthquakes&quot; and contains the quote:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;In the past 35 years there have been three major onland normal
fault earthquakes in countries with a well developed programme of
hydrogeological monitoring:  the two most recent large normal fault earthquakes
in the USA (the 1959/8/17 Hebgen Lake earthquake (M7.3) in Montana, and the M<SUB>s</SUB>
7.0 1983/10/28 Borah Peak earthquake 250 km away in Idaho), and the M<SUB>s</SUB>
6.9 1980/11/23 earthquake in southern Italy.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Hydrogeological effects of UK Earthquakes</B>
</P>
<P>11.27 Reference to <A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para7.14">paragraphs 7.14</A> to 7.25
of <B>PE/NRX/14</B> indicates that the seismicity of the UK is low and that
over the last few hundred years has only been subjected to moderate or small
earthquakes (up to about magnitude 5.5).  Thus, it is scientifically
questionable to suggest that the effects of a magnitude 7.3 earthquake can be
realistically mapped onto Cumbria in the way that Dr Haszeldine has sought to do
in his Figures 7.5 and 7.6 (PE/GNP/3).
</P>
<P>11.28 Dr Muir Wood and G Woo in a 1992 report for DoE/HMIP [GOV/613] stated
in the abstract that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Britain is shown to be a slowly deforming region of active crustal
extension, in which increases in springflow and rises in the water-table have
been noted following even relatively small earthquakes of the past 150 years. 
Hence earthquake-induced changes in hydrology will need to be accounted for in
estimating the performance of proposed British radioactive waste repositories.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>11.29 They applied their analysis to the Sellafield site and concluded that
([GOV/613], page 79, section 4.5.1, paragraph 5):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Hence there are tectonic arguments for suspecting that faults of
the LDBFZ may currently be active.  The hydrological signature of the 1865
Rampside earthquake provides further corroboration that at least some faults of
this system are liable to undergo shallow normal fault displacements.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and that (page 80):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;However current evidence suggests that the fault-bounded West
Cumbrian coast may be tectonically active, and that seismic pumping of
groundwater may occur around Sellafield.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>11.30 As Britain is not in an extensional regime, the claimed mechanism for
significant hydrogeological effects predicted by Dr Muir Wood's hypothesis will
not apply.  The examples he presents, [GOV/613] Appendix B, of British
earthquakes that affected the hydrogeological regime are:

<P>11.32 The Rampside effects were not of deep groundwater expulsion, but of
near surface effects due to beach sand liquefaction.
</P>
<P><U>Colchester, 1884</U>
</P>
<P>11.33 After the Colchester earthquake ([GOV/613] B2), there were limited
short term effects in the immediate area but also more widespread and
long-lasting hydrological changes up to 25 km away.  Water levels within the
Chalk rose by up to 7.5 feet in wells to 420 feet depths over periods up to 40
days following the earthquake.  The majority of changes in water level were
rises but the level fell in one well.  The widespread nature of the changes
probably does reflect earthquake strain effects on the fissured Chalk aquifer. 
The Colchester earthquake was in SE England adjacent to the southern North Sea
basin and so there could be an extensional component to the local stress regime.
 Therefore the changes to the local water table following the Colchester
earthquake probably indicate effects that would not apply to the Sellafield
area.
</P>
<P><U>Recent Review of earthquake effects on groundwater</U>
</P>
<P>11.34 A recent study (Rojstaczer, Wolf and Michel; Nature, 373, pages
237-239, 1995) has concluded that earthquakes do not expel water from depths of
several kilometres.  Instead earthquakes can cause near-surface permeability
enhancements that produce persistent and widespread changes to the groundwater. 
These include changes to the water table and groundwater outflow to streams. 
Measurement of the groundwater chemistry after earthquakes in California showed
that near surface water was involved in changes to the stream and spring flow.
</P>
<P>11.35 Inferred changes to the permeability were about one order of
magnitude.  Measurements of the permeability of all the hydrogeological units at
Sellafield have indicated a range of values over several orders of magnitude. 
Modelling of the groundwater pathway for the post-closure performance assessment
(Nirex 95 [COR/522]) has used a range of permeability values.  A general
increase of one order of magnitude in the average near surface permeability was
not found to produce significantly different results.

<P>11.37 Dr Haszeldine, by selectively quoting information from a limited
number of sources has sought to draw conclusions about the tectonics of the
Sellafield area and concerning possible impacts of earthquakes on the
hydrogeology of the area.  In doing this he has failed to take account of the
published information and has misrepresented information, for example, by
seeking to draw a comparison between large, normal fault earthquakes in the USA
and small earthquakes in the UK in a compressional stress regime.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Comparisons"></A><B>12. COMPARISONS WITH INVESTIGATION PRACTICES
ELSEWHERE.</B></P>
<P><B>Comparisons with the Oil Industry</B>
</P>
<P>12.1 Several Objectors' proofs draw comparisons between the Nirex
investigations and the practices adopted within the oil industry.  Dr Haszeldine
(PE/GNP/3, section 6, pages 15-17) draws comparisons in terms of timescale and
approach. A similar theme relating to approach to investigations is picked up by
Professor Smythe (PE/FOE/3, paragraph 7.14).
</P>
<P>12.2 Professor Smythe and Dr Haszeldine both seek to criticise the Nirex
approach to investigations claiming that it does not follow oil company practice
which they regard as a model for Nirex to emulate (PE/FOE/3, paragraphs 7.14 and
9.6; PE/GNP/3, paragraph 6.3).
</P>
<P>12.3 The first point that must be made is that Nirex is not exploring to
identify and exploit an oil deposit.  The oil industry seeks to locate oil and
gas deposits which are confined to specific locations dependent upon very
specific combinations of geological features and processes.  Nirex, on the other
hand, is exploring a specific location to determine its suitability to host a
repository.  Fluid flow technology for the oil industry tends to be aimed at
high flow rates and high permeability rocks.  Nirex, on the other hand, is
looking primarily at low flow rates in low permeability rocks.  In these
respects, the oil industry is not a direct analogy to the work being undertaken
by Nirex.
</P>
<P>12.4 Nevertheless, the Nirex approach has drawn on a wide range of expertise
and experience from the hydrocarbons industry, notably through such contractors
as British Geological Survey, GeoScience Ltd, J. Arthur and Associates Ltd,
Schlumberger GeoQuest Ltd and others, all with direct experience of working in
the hydrocarbons industry.  Meetings have been held with both Shell and BP to
exchange technical knowledge and experience, and this information exchange
continues.
</P>
<P>12.5 At paragraph 6.7 of his evidence (Pages 16-17, PE/GNP/3), Dr Haszeldine
states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Choice of site and Planning Application for the RCF could be
considered analogous to deciding to proceed with oil field development in a
particular location.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>12.6 The only decision Nirex has made is to apply to construct an RCF.  In
terms of the exploration analogy that Dr Haszeldine persists with, this may be
seen as just another tool for obtaining data and testing predictions analogous
to the change in the hydrocarbons industry from drilling exploration wells to an
appraisal well - it is definitely not analogous to a decision to proceed with
the development of an oil field.  This would be equivalent to commencement of
construction of a repository and first oil would be equivalent to first waste
emplacement in a repository.
</P>
<P>12.7 Dr Haszeldine's presentation of the Nirex programme is wrong (his
Figure 6.7, PE/GNP/3).  He shows the boreholes starting in late 1992.  The
borehole drilling started with Borehole 1 in mid 1989.  The RCF programme
described by Dr Haszeldine is not the same as that presented as
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A> in Dr Mellor's
evidence (<B>PE/NRX/16</B>).  Dr Mellor shows the RCF programme commencing in
mid 1996, seven years after the start of drilling as compared to the 15 months
shown by Dr Haszeldine.  Dr Mellor shows the RCF science programme completed in
early 2006; Dr Haszeldine shows it to be completed by the end of 2001.  The
programme shown by Dr Haszeldine for the development of a complex or difficult
oil field concludes with first oil production some 18 years after start of work.
 The equivalent end point for the Nirex programme is first waste emplacement in
a repository.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#Para9.22">paragraph 9.22</A>, page 61) states that
this may be possible in the first half of 2011.  Mr Folger's supplementary proof
(<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12s1.htm#Para4.3">paragraph 4.3</A>, page 8, <B>PE/NRX/12/S1</B>)
presents a revised programme indicating the earliest date for first waste
emplacement as the first half of 2012.  This is 23 years after start of
drilling.  This is longer than the 18 years quoted by Dr Haszeldine for an
oilfield and substantially longer than the 9.25 years he shows in his Figure 6.7
(PE/GNP/3) for the <I>'Nirex drilling plan'</I>.
</P>
<P>12.8 Detailed examination of the Nirex investigation programme reveals close
similarities with the practice in the hydrocarbons industry.  The adoption of a
progressive, step-wise methodology from the regional reconnaissance scale
towards the District and then the Site and finally the PRZ is a clear example.
</P>
<P>12.9 The acquisition of seismic reflection data similarly followed standard
exploration procedures.  Hydrocarbon exploration normally begins with wide
ranging 2-D seismic reflection surveys and exploratory drilling, moving later,
where justified, to development drilling and, in many, but by no means all
cases, to targeted 3-D seismic surveys.

<P><B>Principal Points of Disagreement</B>
</P>
<P>1.4 The assertions made in the Objectors' proofs, and which form the
principal points of disagreement, fall essentially into three categories:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">Sellafield is a 'poor' site for a repository and hence there is
no need for the RCF;

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">ii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">the RCF will not take us significantly forward; and

<TR>
<TD></TD>
<TD>iii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">an application to construct an RCF at Sellafield is premature.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>1.5 These three categories of issues are briefly reviewed in turn in the
following paragraphs, the reasons why I disagree with the Objectors are stated
and indications are given as to where the individual points of disagreement are
addressed in the body of this supplementary proof.
</P>
<P><B>'Sellafield is a poor site'</B>
</P>
<P>1.6 The assertions by the Objectors that Sellafield is a 'poor' site take a
number of forms, which are summarised as follows:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>The site does not conform to generic characteristics of
a potential repository site.</B></U>This is the assertion made primarily by
Professor Mather (PE/CCC/4, paragraph 3.1).  He asserts that there are a number
of 'requirements' for a potential repository site and that the Sellafield site,
by not matching up to these 'requirements', should be regarded as a 'poor' site
and abandoned.  Dr Salmon (PE/FOE/5) makes similar assertions (paragraph 2.21,
page 17).
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">ii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>There are 'better' sites elsewhere in UK at which
further investigations should be concentrated.</B></U>This is a major assertion
by Professor Mather (PE/CCC/4, paragraphs 4.6 and 4.7) which follows from his
earlier assertion that Sellafield is a 'poor' site and should be abandoned. 
Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, because they adopt the position that
further investigations are required at Sellafield before construction of an RCF,
only refer in passing to the possibility that there may be 'better' sites
elsewhere.  Dr Haszeldine (PE/GNP/3, paragraph 16.10) suggests that alternative
sites be considered and investigated.  Mr Reeves (PE/FOE/4, paragraphs 2.2, 3.2,
4.4 and 8.7) asserts that other sites in the UK should be investigated to
provide a basis for selection of the optimal disposal site.  Dr Allison
(PE/FOE/7, paragraph 4.17) also asserts that alternative sites should be
investigated.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">iii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>The site is complex.</B></U>Professor Mather 
(PE/CCC/4, paragraph 5.7), Dr Kokelaar (PE/FOE/2, paragraph 5.1) and Dr Allison
(PE/FOE/7, paragraph 4.14), assert that the site is so complex and unpredictable
that it will never be possible to adequately characterise it.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>1.7 I disagree that Sellafield is a 'poor' site for a repository and firmly
believe that the results so far of the investigations and studies indicate that
the site shows good potential as a repository site.  I believe this because:
</P>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">the results of the investigations carried out so far have

<TD WIDTH="800">ssessments of the likely performance of the total repository,

provide confidence that a repository could be developed at Sellafield which
would meet regulatory requirements.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>1.8 The Objectors' assertions that Sellafield is a 'poor' site are based on
three flawed approaches, as follows:

<TR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>the inappropriate use of geological and hydrogeological
'criteria'</B></U>for the assessment of site suitability.  As set out in
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12s1.htm#Para6.26">paragraph 6.26</A> of <B>PE/NRX/12/S1</B>,
Nirex's view is that the suitability of any particular site must be based on a
safety assessment of the predicted performance of the complete repository system
at that site.  Such an approach is not followed by the Objectors in asserting
that Sellafield is a 'poor' site based upon both qualitative 'criteria' which
were intended to assist in the early stages of area selection (for example
PE/CCC/4, paragraph 3.1; PE/FOE/5, paragraph 2.4) and qualitative
hydrogeological 'criteria' (for example PE/CCC/4, paragraph 6.2.9; PE/GNP/3,
paragraph 12.5);

6.2.9 and PE/GNP/3, paragraph 12.5), interpretation of salinity profiles
(PE/CCC/4, paragraph 6.7.1) and patterns of groundwater flow (PE/CCC/4,
paragraph 6.6.5; PE/GNP/3, paragraphs 8.1 to 8.4))
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><B>'The RCF will not take us forward'</B>
</P>
<P>1.9 There are two main themes within the Objectors' evidence that can be
grouped under this general heading, namely:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>the RCF will not provide sufficient information</B></U>to
establish whether the site will prove suitable for a repository because it is
impossible ever to characterise a complex site to the extent required (for
example PE/CCC/4, paragraph 5.7; PE/FOE/2, paragraph 5.1; PE/FOE/7, paragraph
4.14); and
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">ii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>the RCF will not provide important information</B></U>(for
example, on the regional hydrogeology PE/CCC/4, paragraph 7.2) needed to assess
the suitability of the site.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><U>Sufficiency of Information</U>
</P>
<P>1.10 I disagree with the first theme on the grounds of a fundamental
difference in the apparent approach of the Objectors and Nirex as to how to
treat spatial variability (heterogeneity, or 'complexity') in constructing
groundwater flow and radionuclide transport models.  Whilst the Objectors
appear, on the whole, to expect precise deterministic characterisation of the
whole flow system to be necessary to build an adequate model, Nirex is adopting
state-of-the-art geostatistical techniques which use a stochastic description of
the flow system built on a limited programme of observations and experiments. 
The Nirex approach is held in common with most organisations concerned with
evaluating flow and transport in heterogeneous systems.
</P>
<P><U>Importance of Information</U>
</P>
<P>1.11 A particular issue raised by the Objectors is that the RCF will not
provide information on issues of importance to the establishment of the
potential of the site to host a repository.  For example, the extent to which
the RCF will provide information on the regional hydrogeology has been
questioned (PE/CCC/4, paragraph 7.2).  I do not agree with this assertion.
</P>
<P><B>'The RCF is Premature'</B>
</P>
<P>1.12 A consistent theme within the Objectors' evidence is that the RCF is
premature.  Two main assertions are made, namely:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>Further work is required before an RCF is constructed.</B></U>Dr
Haszeldine (PE/GNP/3, paragraphs 5.6, 9.8, 14.1, 14.22 and 16.6), Drs Green and
Western (PE/FOE/1, paragraphs 9.7 and 10.5), Professor Smythe (PE/FOE/3,
paragraphs 7.9, 8.7, 9.10, 10.3 and 10.8), Mr Reeves (PE/FOE/4, paragraph 8.5),
Dr Salmon (PE/FOE/5, paragraphs 5.5 and 6.1-6.6), Dr Hencher (PE/FOE/6,
paragraphs 6.20, 10.8, 11.8 and 12.3) and Dr Allison (PE/FOE/7, paragraphs 4.43
and 6.20) all assert to varying extents, that additional work needs to be
undertaken before construction of an RCF at Sellafield should commence.  In
asserting that additional work is required to characterise the site prior to
construction of an RCF, the Objectors are presumably conceding that the site may
hold sufficient promise ultimately to justify construction of an RCF and hence,
hold potential as a repository site.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">ii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>The hydrogeological baseline conditions have not been
established.</B></U>This argument (PE/FOE/4, paragraph 8.5; PE/FOE/5, paragraph
5.5) is used to assert that additional periods of monitoring are required of 4
or 5 years to establish baseline and therefore, that the RCF is premature.  The
subject of baseline is addressed in <A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#Appendix2">Appendix 2</A>
of <B>PE/NRX/14</B> and in section 10 of this supplementary proof.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>1.13 The RCF is an important part, but nonetheless only a part, of an
integrated programme of site characterisation activities.  Thus further
surface-based investigations, laboratory tests, interpretation and modelling are
being undertaken in parallel with the RCF (see <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Table6.3">Table
6.3</A>, <B>PE/NRX/14</B>).  Those investigations which are required before the
RCF construction starts have either been carried out, are in progress or are
planned for completion prior to commencement of the RCF.  There are other
investigations which are located outside the area of influence of the RCF which
can proceed in parallel with the RCF and do not therefore need to be undertaken
before RCF construction commences.
</P>
<P>1.14 I believe that baseline conditions have been established.  This has
been confirmed by a review undertaken for Nirex by Professor Lloyd (Professor of
Hydrogeology at University of Birmingham) [NRX/14/3].  A further two years of
monitoring will be undertaken before RCF construction commences.

<P>1.15 Professor Mather, in paragraph 3.1 (PE/CCC/4, page 5) states that there
are
<I>&quot;requirements of a geological barrier&quot;</I> and lists a series of
characteristics which he states are those listed in paragraphs 3.2.6 and 3.2.7
of Nirex Report 71 (<I>PERA</I>) [COR/501].
</P>
<P>1.16 Dr Salmon (PE/FOE/5) seeks to make a similar point in section 2 of his
evidence.  At paragraph 2.4 (page 6) he identifies what he states to be <I>&quot;key
hydrogeological criteria for the assessment of environmental suitability for
radioactive waste disposal&quot;</I>.  He then concludes in paragraph 2.21 (page
17) that <I>&quot;I consider that the Sellafield site does not satisfy at least
two of the hydrogeological criteria previously considered as necessary
pre-requisites for the construction of a deep radioactive waste repository&quot;</I>.
</P>
<P>1.17 The issue of geological criteria is addressed at
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12s1.htm#Para6.24">paragraphs 6.24</A> to 6.28 of Mr
Folger's supplementary proof (<B>PE/NRX/12/S1</B>).  As indicated there, the
suitability of any particular site must be based on a safety assessment of the
predicted performance of the complete repository system of the site, not on
criteria for site performance in relation to particular attributes.
</P>
<P>1.18 A similar point arises from sections 3 and 4 of Professor Mather's
evidence (PE/CCC/4) in which he asserts that:

<P>1.21 These are the characteristics of the environments described by
Bredehoeft and Maini (CCC/4/1).
</P>
<P>1.22 I disagree with the approach taken by Professor Mather and Dr Salmon in
seeking to compare conditions at Sellafield with secondary qualitative criteria
set up to assist is identifying suitable generic sites for investigation.  The
appropriate basis for assessing the suitability of a site that has been
investigated is by carrying out safety assessment studies and comparing the
results with regulatory requirements.  Nirex has presented a preliminary
assessment for the groundwater pathway at Sellafield in  Nirex 95 [COR/522]. 
Nevertheless, Sellafield does demonstrate the characteristics of a BUSC site
described at paragraph 6.3.3 in Nirex Report 71 [COR/501] and of the examples
given in the Bredehoeft and Maini paper (CCC/4/1).
</P>
<P><U>Alternative Sites</U>
</P>
<P>1.23 Professor Mather makes a number of statements about Sellafield and
possible alternative sites in paragraphs 4.6 and 4.7 of his evidence (PE/CCC/4).
 In particular he asserts that the Tremadoc rocks in the area of East Central
England are likely to be far less complex than the BVG.  I am not aware of any
evidence to support this view, and he refers to none.
</P>
<P>1.24 In respect of Professor Mather's <I>&quot;inherently less robust&quot;</I>
(paragraph 4.6, PE/CCC/4) point it is acknowledged that there could be other
sites that would offer lower levels of post-closure radiological risk to an
individual, but the pursuit of risks below the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> design target is
not a requirement of government policy or the regulators (see Mr Folger's
supplementary proof (<B>PE/NRX/12/S1</B>)
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12s1.htm#Para6.3">paragraphs 6.3</A> to 6.5).  However,
whereas we now have a very substantial base of knowledge  on the characteristics
of the site at Sellafield, knowledge of the alternatives described by Professor
Mather is comparatively sparse.  It cannot be assumed therefore that any
specific alternatives would necessarily be more robust in radiological terms.
</P>
<P>1.25 Dr Haszeldine (paragraph 16.10, PE/GNP/3), Mr Reeves (paragraphs 2.2,
3.2, 4.4 and 8.7, PE/FOE/4), and Dr Allison ( paragraph 4.17, PE/FOE/7) all
state their view that alternative, unspecified sites should be investigated.  No
evidence, other than their assertions that Sellafield is a 'poor' or 'marginal'
site, is presented by them to support the investigation of these unspecified
alternative sites.
</P>
<P><U>Complexity</U>
</P>
<P>1.26 Professor Mather (PE/CCC/4, for example paragraph 8.6), Dr Kokelaar
(paragraphs 3.3, 4.1 and 5.1; PE/FOE/2), Dr Allison (paragraph 4.14; PE/FOE/7)
and Dr Salmon (paragraph 2.8, PE/FOE/5) make repeated claims that the Sellafield
site is complex.  Complexity is something that must be addressed in a safety
assessment and which influences the design of the investigation programme and
modelling approach, it is not a disqualifier of a site.  Natural complexity has
been addressed in an appropriate way by Nirex.
</P>
<P><U>Geology</U>
</P>
<P>1.27 Dr Kokelaar states his view (paragraph 5.1; PE/FOE/2) that the BVG has
exceptional geological complexity that renders prediction of the 3-D
distribution of the rocks and fractures extremely difficult.  His evidence
exaggerates the complexities.  The taking of a variety of features of the BVG in
the Lake District and implying that they all apply to the local area of the RCF
and PRZ is misleading.
</P>
<P>1.28 Professor Smythe, by selectively presenting information, has sought to
undermine the geological interpretations presented by Nirex in order to justify
the need for a 3-D seismic survey (paragraphs 10.2 and 10.8; PE/FOE/3).  Not
only is it considered that the claims made by Professor Smythe concerning the
interpretations of the structural geology are unjustified, but he has also
failed to appreciate that the evidence presented by Nirex already includes
proposals to carry out such a survey prior to the commencement of RCF
construction.
</P>
<P><U>Groundwater flow through fractured rock</U>
</P>
<P>1.29 Professor Mather and Dr Haszeldine have asserted that only a single
fracture in the rock could render the site unsuitable and, by applying
inappropriate secondary hydrogeological 'criteria' have sought to demonstrate
that the Sellafield site is unsuitable (paragraph 6.29, PE/CCC/4; paragraph
12.5, PE/GNP/3).
</P>
<P>1.30 They  have used an inappropriate basis for relating small scale
measurements in boreholes to the large scale characteristics of the rock mass as
a whole in order to represent the site in a way that is incompatible with large
scale measurements made at the site.
</P>
<P>1.31 Dr Haszeldine has reported some alternative groundwater flow modelling
and sought to demonstrate that it indicates results which are significantly
different from those reported by Nirex (PE/GNP/3, paragraph 7.27).
</P>
<P>On the basis of a review of the modelling work undertaken by Dr Haszeldine
it is concluded that the differences he reports between his modelling and that
undertaken by Nirex arise for the following reasons:

<P>1.33 It is my assessment that if realistic parameters were used, Dr
Haszeldine's models would produce results broadly comparable to those presented
in much more detail by Nirex in Nirex 95 [COR/522].  These results indicate that
the site is likely to meet the regulatory safety requirements.

reason why the RCF should not proceed to provide the necessary information to
allow Nirex to decide whether to proceed with a planning application for a

necessary, these can be completed before the programmed date for commencement of

<P><U>Comparison with investigation practices elsewhere</U>
</P>
<P>1.45 Dr Haszeldine and Professor Smythe seek to draw comparisons between the
Nirex investigations and the practices in the oil industry to seek to
demonstrate that the approach and timescales adopted by Nirex are inappropriate
(PE/FOE/3, paragraph 7.14 and PE/GNP/3, paragraph 6.3).
</P>
<P>1.46 The programme presented by Dr Haszeldine for the Nirex investigations
is wrong and understates the duration of the Nirex scientific programme.  The
duration of the Nirex investigations is longer than he quotes for investigations
in the oil industry.
</P>
<P>1.47 The investigation practices adopted by Nirex and the oil industry are
substantially similar, the differences reflecting that Nirex is assessing the
suitability of a site for a radioactive waste repository and not exploring for
oil or gas.
</P>
<P><U>Conclusions</U>
</P>
<P>1.48 My supplementary proof has demonstrated the inappropriate use by the
Objectors of geological and hydrogeological 'criteria' in an attempt to suggest
that the Sellafield site has little potential as a repository site.
</P>
<P>1.49 The results of the investigations carried out by Nirex have been
translated through the Nirex 95 studies [COR/522] into assessments of risk that
can be compared with regulatory safety requirements.  These studies indicate
that the site has good potential as a repository site.
</P>
<P>1.50 I have indicated that those surface-based investigations which are
relevant to the assessment of the site to host a repository are planned or are
programmed by Nirex either to be completed prior to commencement of the RCF,
where necessary or appropriate, or to proceed in parallel with the RCF where
this is appropriate.
</P>
<P>1.51 Baseline hydrogeological conditions have been established and a further
two years of monitoring will be completed before commencement of RCF shaft
sinking.  There is no justification for the duration of monitoring claimed, by
the Objectors, as being required before the RCF commences.

<P><B>Principal Points of Disagreement</B>
</P>
<P>2.3 The assertions made in the Objectors' proofs, and which form the
principal points of disagreement, fall essentially into three categories:

<P>2.4 These three categories of issues are briefly reviewed in turn in the

and indications are given as to where the individual points of disagreement are
addressed in the body of this supplementary proof.
</P>
<P><B>'Sellafield is a poor site'</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para2.5"></A>2.5 The assertions by the Objectors that Sellafield
is a 'poor' site take a number of forms, which are summarised as follows:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">

<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>The site does not conform to generic characteristics of
a potential repository site.</B></U>This is the assertion made primarily by
Professor Mather (PE/CCC/4, paragraph 3.1).  He asserts that there are a number
of 'requirements' for a potential repository site and that the Sellafield site,
by not matching up to these 'requirements', should be regarded as a 'poor' site
and abandoned.  Dr Salmon (PE/FOE/5) makes similar assertions (paragraph 2.21,
page 17).  This point is dealt with in section 3 of this supplementary proof.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">ii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>There are 'better' sites elsewhere in UK at which
further investigations should be concentrated.</B></U>This is a major assertion
by Professor Mather (PE/CCC/4, paragraphs 4.6 and 4.7) which follows from his
earlier assertion that Sellafield is a 'poor' site and should be abandoned. 
Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, because they adopt the position that
further investigations are required at Sellafield before construction of an RCF,
only refer in passing to the possibility that there may be 'better' sites
elsewhere.  Dr Haszeldine (PE/GNP/3, paragraph 16.10) suggests that alternative
sites be considered and investigated.  Mr Reeves (PE/FOE/4, paragraphs 2.2, 3.2,
4.4 and 8.7) asserts that other sites in the UK should be investigated to
provide a basis for selection of the optimal disposal site.  Dr Allison
(PE/FOE/7, paragraph 4.17) also asserts that alternative sites should be
investigated.  This point is dealt with in sections 4 and 5 of this
supplementary proof.

(PE/CCC/4, paragraph 5.7), Dr Kokelaar (PE/FOE/2, paragraph 5.1) and Dr Allison

that it will never be possible to characterise it adequately.  This point is
dealt with in section 5 of this supplementary proof.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>2.6 I disagree that Sellafield is a 'poor' site for a repository and firmly
believe that the results so far of the investigations and studies indicate that
the site shows good potential as a repository site.  I believe this because:

<P>2.7 The Objectors' arguments that Sellafield is a 'poor' site are based on

Nirex's view is that the suitability of any particular site must be based on a
safety assessment of the predicted performance of the complete repository system
at that site.  Such an approach is not followed by the Objectors in asserting
that Sellafield is a 'poor' site based upon both qualitative 'criteria' which
were intended to assist in the early stages of area selection (for example
PE/CCC/4, paragraph 3.1; PE/FOE/5, paragraph 2.4) and hydrogeological 'criteria'
(for example PE/CCC/4, paragraph 6.2.9; PE/GNP/3, paragraph 12.5);

</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><B>'The RCF will not take us forward'</B>
</P>
<P>2.8 There are two main themes within the Objectors' evidence that can be
grouped under this general heading, namely:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>the RCF will not provide sufficient information</B></U>
to establish whether the site will prove suitable for a repository because it is
impossible ever to characterise a complex site to the extent required (for
example PE/CCC/4, paragraph 5.7; PE/FOE/2, paragraph 5.1; PE/FOE/7, paragraph
4.14); and

<TR>

<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>the RCF will not provide important information</B></U>
(for example, on the regional hydrogeology, PE/CCC/4, paragraph 7.2) needed to
assess the suitability of the site.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><U>Sufficiency of Information</U>
</P>
<P>2.9 I disagree with the first theme on the grounds of a fundamental
difference in the apparent approach of the Objectors and Nirex as to how to
treat spatial variability (heterogeniety, or 'complexity') in constructing
groundwater flow and radionuclide transport models.  Whilst the Objectors
appear, on the whole, to expect precise deterministic characterisation of the
whole flow system to be necessary to build an adequate model, Nirex is adopting
state-of-the-art statistical techniques which use a stochastic description of
the flow system built on a limited programme of observations and experiments. 
The Nirex approach is held in common with most organisations concerned with
evaluating flow and transport in heterogeneous systems.  This is discussed in
detail in section 5 of this proof.
</P>
<P><U>Importance of information</U>
</P>
<P>2.10 A particular issue raised by the Objectors is that the RCF will not
provide information on issues of importance to the establishment of the
potential of the site to host a repository.  For example, the extent to which
the RCF will provide information on the regional hydrogeology has been
questioned (PE/CCC/4, paragraph 7.2).  I do not agree with this assertion and
state my reasons in <A HREF="#Para8.79">paragraphs 8.79</A> to 8.88 of this
supplementary proof.
</P>
<P><B>'The RCF is Premature'</B>
</P>
<P>2.11 A consistent theme within the Objectors' evidence is that the RCF is
premature.  Two main assertions are made, namely:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>Further work is required before an RCF is constructed.</B></U>
 Dr Haszeldine (PE/GNP/3, paragraphs 5.6, 9.8, 14.1, 14.22 and 16.6), Drs Green
and Western (PE/FOE/1, paragraphs 9.7 and 10.5), Professor Smythe (PE/FOE/3,
paragraphs 7.9, 8.7, 9.10, 10.3 and 10.8), Mr Reeves (PE/FOE/4, paragraph 8.5),
Dr Salmon (PE/FOE/5, paragraphs 5.5 and 6.1-6.6), Dr Hencher (PE/FOE/6,
paragraphs 6.20, 10.8, 11.8 and 12.3) and Dr Allison (PE/FOE/7, paragraphs 4.43
and 6.20) all assert to varying extents, that additional work needs to be
undertaken before construction of an RCF at Sellafield should commence.  In
asserting that additional work is required to characterise the site prior to
construction of an RCF, the Objectors are presumably conceding that the site may
hold sufficient promise to ultimately justify construction of an RCF and hence,
hold potential as a repository site.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">ii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>The hydrogeological baseline conditions have not been

5.5) is used to assert that additional periods of monitoring are required of 4
or 5 years to establish baseline and therefore, that the RCF is premature.  The
subject of baseline is addressed in <A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#Appendix2">Appendix 2</A>
of <B>PE/NRX/14</B> and in section 10 of this supplementary proof.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>2.12 The RCF is an important part, but nonetheless only a part, of an
integrated programme of site characterisation activities.  Thus further
surface-based investigations, laboratory tests, interpretation and modelling are
being undertaken in parallel with the RCF (see <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Table6.3">Table
6.3</A>, <B>PE/NRX/14</B>).  Those investigations which are required <U>before</U>
the RCF construction starts have either been carried out, are in progress or are
planned for completion prior to the commencement of the RCF.  There are other
investigations which are located outside the area of influence of the RCF which
can proceed in parallel with the RCF and do not therefore need to be undertaken
before RCF construction commences.  These issues are addressed in  section 8of
this supplementary proof  in paragraphs <A HREF="#Para8.89">8.89</A> to 8.95.
</P>
<P>2.13 I believe that baseline conditions have been established.  This has
been confirmed by a review undertaken for Nirex by Professor Lloyd (Professor of
Hydrogeology at University of Birmingham) [NRX/14/3].  A further two years of
monitoring will be undertaken before RCF construction commences.
</P>
<P>2.14 Sections 3 to 5 provide my response to the three main areas of
disagreement described above in <A HREF="#Para2.5">paragraph 2.5</A>.  The
remaining sections of this supplementary proof (6 to 12) deal with specific
technical points surrounding these main areas and are broken down into topical
areas, as follows:

<P>2.16 This section of my supplementary proof responds to the points made

(PE/GNP/3, paragraph 12.5) concerning the treatment of groundwater flow through
fractured rocks.  Their inappropriate use of hydrogeological 'criteria', their
treatment of 'upscaling' and the alternative groundwater flow modelling reported

REPOSITORY SITE</B></P>
<P><B>Qualitative 'Criteria' - General</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para3.1"></A>3.1 Professor Mather, in paragraph 3.1 (PE/CCC/4,
page 5) states that there are
<I>&quot;requirements of a geological barrier&quot;</I> and lists a series of
characteristics which he states are those listed in paragraphs 3.2.6 and 3.2.7
of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501].  In fact, his list is his own interpretation of that
given in paragraphs 3.2.6 and 3.2.7 of  <I>PERA</I>.
</P>
<P>3.2 Dr Salmon (PE/FOE/5)  makes a similar point in section 2 of his
evidence.  At paragraph 2.4 (page 6) he identifies what he states to be <I>&quot;key
hydrogeological criteria for the assessment of environmental suitability for
radioactive waste disposal&quot;</I>.  He then concludes in paragraph 2.21 (page
17) that <I>&quot;I consider that the Sellafield site does not satisfy at least
two of the hydrogeological criteria previously considered as necessary
pre-requisites for the construction of a deep radioactive waste repository&quot;</I>.
</P>
<P>3.3 The issue of geological 'criteria' is addressed at
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12s1.htm#Para6.24">paragraph 6.24</A> to 6.28 of Mr
Folger's supplementary proof of evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12/S1</B>).   As indicated
there, the suitability of any particular site must be based on a safety
assessment of the predicted performance of the complete repository system at the
site, not on criteria for site performance in relation to particular attributes.
</P>
<P><B>Sellafield as a BUSC Site</B>
</P>
<P>3.4 A similar point arises from sections 3 and 4 of Professor Mather's
evidence (PE/CCC/4) in which he indicates that, &quot;<I>The 'BUSC' concept</I>
[low permeability basement under sedimentary cover]<I> (Figure 1c) was
identified</I>
<I>as</I> <I>providing the best overall performance of land-based options with
respect to post-closure radiological safety</I>&quot;<I> </I>(PE/CCC/4,
paragraph 3.3, page 9), but asserts that the Sellafield site <I>&quot;has none
of the hydrogeological characteristics associated with the BUSC concept&quot;</I>
(PE/CCC/4, paragraph 4.4, page 11).
</P>
<P>3.5 Specifically, Professor Mather seeks to cast doubt on the suitability of
the Sellafield site generally by claiming in paragraph 4.4 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;The geological situation is markedly different in the Sellafield
'variant', where basement rocks crop out some 2.5 km away from the potential
repository site.  Groundwater recharge to these rocks at outcrop will provide a
driving force for groundwater to flow through the repository volume.  Thus, from
first principles, Sellafield has an inherent flaw in comparison to the original
BUSC concept, with a much greater potential for groundwater circulation within
the basement rocks.  In fact, Sellafield bears no relationship to a BUSC site
nor can it be considered as a 'variant'.  It has none of the hydrogeological
characteristics associated with the BUSC concept, and its designation as a BUSC
'variant' appears to be an attempt to force it to fit one of the hydrogeological
environments defined in Nirex Report No 71 (COR/501).&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.6 The statements made by Professor Mather are contested on three grounds:

</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><U>Point 3.6.i</U>
</P>
<P>3.7 In a similar way to that discussed at paragraphs 3.1 and 3.3 above
regarding generic characteristics of repository sites, Professor Mather is
suggesting that comparison between an actual site and qualitative
characteristics of generic sites, in this case the BUSC concept, is an
appropriate method of assessing the suitability of the site.  For the same
reasons as those summarised in  paragraph 3.3 above, Professor Mather's approach
is inappropriate.  Conclusions on the suitability of an actual site must be
based on a safety assessment of the complete repository system at the site.
</P>
<P><U>Point 3.6 ii</U>
</P>
<P>3.8 In <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], Nirex described the geological setting of a
BUSC environment as (paragraph 6.3.3, page 42):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;(d) Low Permeability Basement Under Sedimentary Cover (BUSC):
groundwater movement will dominantly occur in the sedimentary cover, with little
anticipated connection to the basement rocks of low intrinsic permeability.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.9 While expressing reservations about inter-relationships between flow
regimes, Professor Mather at paragraph 6.6.7 of PE/CCC/4 appears  implicitly to
accept the overall conceptual model of the Sellafield site in which groundwater
flow is dominantly in the sedimentary cover with an underlying lower
permeability basement through his statement that <I>&quot;It is concluded that
the conceptual model of the hydrogeology proposed by Nirex is a useful
simplification&quot;</I></P>
<P>3.10 That groundwater flow at Sellafield is dominantly occurring in the
sedimentary cover, and there is little anticipated connection to the basement
rocks of low intrinsic permeability are both conclusions in my evidence (<A
HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.70">paragraphs 6.70</A> to 6.73 on pages 45-47 of <B>PE/NRX/14</B>).
</P>
<P>3.11 The same conclusions are reached from the modelling undertaken in Nirex
95 [COR/522].  In section 2.1.3 on page 2.5 of Volume 3 it states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The largest groundwater flows are in the Near-Surface Calder
Sandstone and the Near-Surface St Bees Sandstone......There are weak fluxes of
groundwater between these units and the underlying rocks, which have lower
permeability.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para3.12"></A>3.12 Hence, while suitability of a site is not a
question of whether or not it conforms to a particular definition of BUSC, it is
the case that Sellafield demonstrates those characteristics identified with BUSC
in<I> PERA</I> [COR/501].
</P>
<P><U>Point 3.6 iii</U>
</P>
<P>3.13 In paragraph 3.4 of PE/CCC/4 Professor Mather indicates that the BUSC
concept originates from a paper by Bredehoeft and Maini (CCC/4/1).  Bredehoeft
and Maini do not use the term 'Basement under sedimentary cover' and therefore
do not provide a definition of the term.  In fact there is no widely agreed
definition.  Nirex's view of the key characteristics of the BUSC concept is
given at paragraph 6.3.3 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] as reproduced at paragraph
3.8 above.
</P>
<P>3.14 In paragraph 3.4 CCC/4/1, Professor Mather appears to be incorrect in
describing Bredehoeft and Maini's assessment by stating:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;In the example they give the cover rocks are shales with a
downward hydraulic gradient isolating groundwater beneath.  This contrasts
markedly with the situation in which the cover rocks are permeable sandstones
used as an aquifer.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.15 Bredehoeft and Maini give two examples, neither of which matches
Professor Mather's description.  The first example of a coastal site is a direct
analogue of the Sellafield situation; the second example is of an inland site
and is similar to Nirex's generic BUSC environment as described in paragraph
6.3.3 of PERA [COR/501].  In both examples, permeable sandstone aquifers are a
component of the cover sequence.

<P><B>Conclusion</B>
</P>
<P>3.18 To summarise, therefore, I disagree with the approach taken by
Professor Mather and Dr Salmon in seeking to compare conditions at Sellafield
with secondary qualitative &quot;criteria&quot; set up to assist in identifying
suitable generic sites for investigation.  The appropriate basis for assessing
the suitability of a site that has been extensively investigated is by carrying
out safety assessment studies and comparing the results with regulatory
requirements.  Nevertheless, Sellafield does demonstrate the characteristics of
a BUSC environment described at paragraph 6.3.3 in <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and of
the examples given in the Bredehoeft and Maini paper (CCC/4/1).
</P>
<P><A NAME="Alternative"></A><B>4. ALTERNATIVE SITES</B></P>
<P>4.1 In paragraph 4.6 of his evidence (PE/CCC/4, pages 11 and 13), Professor
Mather describes Sellafield as &quot;<I>inherently less robust</I>&quot; than
the large area of  East Anglia and east-central England identified in <I>PERA</I>
[COR/501] as potentially suitable BUSC rocks.  At paragraph 4.7 he indicates
that, &quot;<I>The Tremadoc rocks in the area of East Central England defined
by Chapman, McEwen and Beale (1986) (COR/614) are likely to be far less complex
that the BVG</I> ....&quot;.
</P>
<P>4.2 In relation to Professor Mather's comparison of the characteristics of
the BVG and the Tremadoc rocks, he does not present any evidence to support his
view that the Tremadoc rocks &quot;<I>are likely to be far less complex than
the BVG</I>&quot; and I am not aware that any such evidence exists.  Since the
compilation of the description of the possible basement geology that underpinned
the work presented in <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and COR/614, there has been
extensive interpretation of geophysical surveys over the area, and these have
indicated more variety and complexity in the nature of the basement rocks than
then considered.  There has been very limited deep drilling and this has only
penetrated a few metres into the basement rocks.  It has confirmed their variety
and structural complexity.  Much of this research has been published by the
British Geological Survey and others (see for example,  <I>The contribution of
palaeontological data to an understanding of the early Palaeozoic  framework of
Eastern England </I>[NRX/14/4]).  The main observations are summarised as
follows:</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">

<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">ii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">These rocks comprise mudrocks (mudstones, shales and
siltstones), sandstones, volcanic rocks and igneous intrusives.  The so-called
Tremadoc rocks are the time equivalents of the Skiddaw Group, the volcanic rocks
are, in part, time equivalents of the Borrowdale Group.  Rocks of similar age
and lithology to the Windermere Group have also been proved.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">iii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">The boreholes are insufficient in number to allow confident
prediction of the likely basement rock at any one point or to map its lithology
in the subsurface.  Published subsurface geological maps of the area are
generalised and conjectural.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">iv.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">The rocks are folded, and metamorphosed, and in terms of their
fold structure, cleavage, fracture density and the presence of fault-zones and
shear-zones are directly comparable to the similar age Skiddaw, Borrowdale and
Windermere Groups of the Lake District or the Lower Palaeozoic rocks of the
Brabant Massif of Belgium.  NRX/14/4 (published in 1991) describes some of the
Tremadoc rocks encountered in the boreholes drilled in the Midlands.  The author
uses phases such as <I>&quot;Dips are steep, between 70&#176; and vertical. 
The Tremadoc strata are folded and faulted, and high proportion of beds are
inverted&quot;</I> and <I>&quot;Dips are steep (60&#176; to vertical) and there
is evidence of slickensiding [the polishing of faults surfaces due to movement]&quot;</I>.

<TD WIDTH="800">Some of the Tremadoc rocks have relatively high organic

</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>4.3 It is unlikely, therefore, that the Tremadoc rocks in the area of
east-central England are far less complex than the BVG.
</P>
<P>4.4 More generally, data on the hydrogeological characteristics of deep
basement rocks in the UK are sparse as recognised in a recent report
commissioned from the British Geological Survey by Nirex (<I>Use of a &quot;groundwater
return index&quot; in site selection for deep radioactive waste repositories: a
review of the RWMAC/ACSNI proposal</I> [NRX/14/5]).  The conclusions of this BGS
review include the following statements in section 4 on pages 10 and 11:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;(iii) In application to deep, low permeability formations
potentially suitable for radioactive waste disposal, values of hydrogeological
indices are particularly difficult to estimate because of the scarcity of
reliable data, especially for hydraulic conductivity.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>(iv) Hydraulic conductivity data for such formations are particularly
lacking (in the UK as elsewhere) and subject to particular uncertainty, because
of the difficulties in predicting the influence of faults and other fractures&quot;.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.5 In respect of Professor Mather's <I>&quot;inherently less robust&quot;</I>
point it is acknowledged that there could be other sites that would offer lower
levels of post-closure radiological risk to an individual, but the pursuit of
risks below the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> design target is not a requirement of
government policy or the regulators (see Mr Folger's supplementary proof (<B>PE/NRX/12/S1</B>)
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12s1.htm#Para6.3">paragraph 6.3</A> to 6.5).  However,
whereas we now have a very substantial base of knowledge  on the characteristics
of the site at Sellafield, knowledge of the alternatives described by Professor
Mather is comparatively sparse.  It cannot be assumed therefore that any
specific alternatives would necessarily be more robust in radiological terms.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Complexity"></A><B>5. COMPLEXITY</B></P>
<P><B>General Considerations</B>
</P>
<P>5.1 Professor Mather makes repeated reference to the complexity of the
Sellafield Site.  For example at paragraph 5.7 on page 16 of PE/CCC/4 he states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;the complex nature of the geology, and particularly the faulting,
makes the controls on groundwater flow much more difficult to define.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.2 Similarly, in his conclusions he again refers to complexity.  In
paragraph 8.6 on page 44 he states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The distribution of the various rock types in the BVG show the
presence of a complex pile of variably faulted rocks and it is only in a very
limited area that any coherent picture has emerged.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.3 In paragraph 8.8 he states that the conceptual model is simplistic and
hides the complex inter-relationships between the various groundwater regimes. 
Finally, in  paragraph 8.9 he states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The RCF will allow a more detailed understanding of the fracture
network in the near-field, but because of the complexity and unpredictability of
the hydrogeology, it may not advance the overall understanding of the controls
on groundwater flow.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.4 Despite Professor Mather's repeated reference to 'complexity', he
neither defines what he means by complexity, nor does he clearly establish its
significance.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 Dr Allison (PE/FOE/7) at paragraph 4.14, page 20
makes similar statements about the complexity of the Sellafield site.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.6"></A>5.6 A simple definition of 'complexity' is something
that is complicated or difficult to understand.  I believe that any natural
geological system, if investigated in the detail to which Sellafield has been
investigated, would reveal natural complexity at some scales.  The issue is
therefore whether this natural complexity can be understood in sufficient detail
to enable the suitability of the site to be established. A more complex site may
require a more extensive investigation than a less complex site, but providing
the site was capable of being understood, complexity would  be a matter of
resources available for investigation.
</P>
<P>5.7 Paragraph 4.8 of the HMIP background document submitted to the Inquiry
dated 22 September (PE/HMP/1) indicates, <I>&quot;The proposed RCF site has a
complex geological structure and this would need to be addressed thoroughly in
any future application that Nirex might submit under RSA 1993&quot;</I>.  This
suggests that the regulatory view accords with that expressed at
<A HREF="#Para5.6">paragraph 5.6</A> above: that complexity is something to be
addressed, not a disqualifier of a site.
</P>
<P><B>Sufficiency of Information</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 A central difference between the positions of the
Objectors and Nirex in respect of complexity and the appropriate response in
investigation and modelling is that, whilst the Objectors suggest that very
detailed and specific characterisation of rock properties is essential
throughout the system, Nirex, in common with current state-of-the-art practice
in addressing flow and transport in deep groundwater systems, has chosen to
follow a largely stochastic approach.  The arguments which Nirex presents for
adopting this approach develop as follows:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">

can be made at various scales of observation and within different regions of the

<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">iii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">Knowledge of all the properties which display variability is
not necessarily important when constructing a safety case as many rock
properties need not be considered directly in safety assessment models.  For
example, very detailed lithological description of the rock may be of minor
significance compared to detailed understanding of fracture characteristics, the
analysis of which is one of the main aims of the RCF.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">iv.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">Measurements of fracture characteristics are made at various
scales by direct observation and by hydraulic and tracer testing.  This allows
models of their flow and transport properties at those scale to be developed. 
Such models use statistical techniques to simulate the properties of the rock
volume under study and are conditioned by the observations. The models should
have an appropriate level of complexity, sufficient to capture the aspects of
interest in the system without unnecessary detail.  A number of such
'stochastic' techniques exist for producing realisations of fracture fields (or
hydraulic conductivity or transmissivity fields) which replicate the observed
behaviour of the system at the scale at which it is being observed and which may
also be conditioned to duplicate specific point measurements.

<TD WIDTH="800">Such models can be constructed and tested in an RCF at a
variety of scales (1m, 10m, 100m).  The extent to which they are related to each
other provides information on the larger scale variability of the rock formation
being studied.  They can also be used to predict the 'effective' properties of
that rock at a much larger scale ('upscaling').  In the large scale model the
effects of the detailed structure are taken into account implicitly through the
use of appropriate effective properties and the system description is therefore
much simpler.  These models do not represent the details of flow and transport
at the small scale, which do not matter on the scale of interest, but if the
upscaling procedure has been developed correctly, they will predict overall bulk
fluxes through the system as a whole (e.g. at a regional scale).

<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">vi.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">It is important to test the models at various scales in order

safety assessment transport calculations) do not depend on some unobserved
variability present at an intermediate scale.  The RCF will allow observations
and testing at a variety of scales.  In addition, some aspects of safety
assessment modelling may require the deployment of relatively small-scale models
to evaluate specific features of the repository design.

are represented explicitly.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>The rationale developed above has been tested in a number of major
programmes in a variety of rock types and at various scales, for example at
Stripa at RCF scale, and at the WIPP site in the USA at 100's km<SUP>2</SUP>
scale.  From the above it can be seen that careful observation and
experimentation at various scales, combined with model building and testing and
a mix of stochastic and deterministic techniques will allow sufficient
information to be gathered to allow an adequate level of site description at the
scales required for safety assessment modelling.
</P>
<P>Finally, I point out that the RCF will not be the only source of information
used to develop and test the flow and transport models discussed.  The programme
of regional investigations will continue in parallel with the RCF and will
provide additional information.

<P><A NAME="Geology"></A><B>6. GEOLOGY</B></P>
<P>6.1 Two of the Objectors' proofs deal primarily with geology and geological
investigations.  These are the proofs by Dr Kokelaar (PE/FOE/2) and Professor
Smythe (PE/FOE/3).  These proofs are reviewed in turn in the following
paragraphs.
</P>
<P><B>Dr Kokelaar (PE/FOE/2)</B>
</P>
<P>6.2 Dr Kokelaar states his view (paragraph 5.1, page 11, PE/FOE/2) that the
<I>&quot;Borrowdale Volcanic Group has exceptional geological complexity that
renders prediction of its 3D distribution of rocks and fractures extremely
difficult&quot;</I>.  From this he concludes (paragraph 5.2, page 11, PE/FOE/2)
that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Accurate characterization can only be derived by drilling
boreholes so closely that the drilling would constitute substantial interference
with the system.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.3 He states in paragraph 4.7, page 9 of PE/FOE/2 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Observational data from a sub-surface facility, such as the
proposed RCF, could be obtained directly through observation of the rock exposed
through excavation or indirectly through boreholes drilled from the sub-surface.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.4 Dr Kokelaar adds in paragraph 4.8 on page 10 of PE/FOE/2 that access at
depth will not resolve the difficulties associated with the high level of
complexity of the Borrowdale Volcanic System.
</P>
<P>6.5 Thus, Dr Kokelaar appears to be stating a view that the geology of the
BVG cannot be adequately characterised except by closely spaced boreholes.
</P>
<P>6.6 Dr Kokelaar, while having substantial experience of studying volcanic
rocks and the BVG, appears to have used the factual information in a way which
exaggerates the complexities.  The taking of a variety of features of the BVG in
the Lake District and implying that they all apply to the local area of the RCF
and PRZ is misleading.
</P>
<P>6.7 Dr Kokelaar's evidence emphasises the difficulties of obtaining a
completely deterministic description of the geology.  However, he seems not to
have appreciated that such a wholly deterministic description of the geology is
not required in order to be able to develop acceptable models of the site for
assessing the post-closure performance of a repository (see <A HREF="#Para5.8">paragraphs
5.8</A> to 5.10 of this supplementary proof).
</P>
<P>6.8 In paragraph 3.3 (page 7, PE/FOE/2), Dr Kokelaar makes generalisations
over a large area, states that they apply to the area <I>&quot;in and around
the PRZ&quot;</I>, and applies them indiscriminately, and without justification,
to demonstrate
<I>&quot;extreme 3-D geological complexity&quot;</I></P>
<P>6.9 In the first bullet point of paragraph 3.3 on page 7 (PE/FOE/2), Dr
Kokelaar refers to <I>&quot;substantial primary lateral variations of thickness
and character&quot;</I> of the many constituent rock units.  This generalisation
can be contrasted with the statement made in <A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para5.10">paragraphs
5.10</A> and 5.11 of my proof (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>) in which I report the
establishment of a subdivision of the BVG <I>&quot;which can be correlated
between boreholes over a distance of several kilometres&quot;</I>. 
</P>
<P>6.10 Dr Kokelaar's second bullet point states that <I>&quot;caldera-forming
gravitational collapse was incremental and haphazard&quot;</I>.  Leaving aside
the issue of whether there is evidence of this on the broad scale, there is
certainly no evidence to demonstrate that the RCF/PRZ area is located near a
caldera margin.
</P>
<P>6.11 Dr Kokelaar's third bullet point refers to soft-state deformation being
far less ordered and hence less predictable that solid-state tectonic
deformation.  Indeed, such structures may be abundant.  However, these
structures are generally healed and are not hydrogeologically significant. 
Hence, there is little to suggest that such features, and their geological
complexity, have any significant influence on the hydrogeological properties of
the rock mass.
</P>
<P>6.12 The statement of fact on faulting which forms the fourth bullet point
is not disputed.  However, the extent to which such faulting affects the
hydrogeology of the site is not addressed at all by Dr Kokelaar.
</P>
<P>6.13 The final bullet point refers to jointing in the BVG.  This has been
described in detail by Nirex.  Again, Dr Kokelaar appears to be assuming that
the description of these features needs to be addressed on a deterministic
basis, rather than the stochastic basis that will inevitably apply to such small
scale fractures (see paragraph 5.8 of this supplementary proof).
</P>
<P><B>Professor Smythe (PE/FOE/3)</B>

<P>6.14 The evidence presented by Professor Smythe (PE/FOE/3) can be summarised
as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;An essential prerequisite for hydrogeological modelling is to
establish the geological structure accurately both in and around the PRZ&quot;
</I>(paragraph 10.2. page 50, PE/FOE/3);

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The current geological interpretation is simply not robust, and will

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;the 3-D seismic survey should be properly completed or a new
survey undertaken, properly validated, and adequately peer reviewed.  This work
should be undertaken before the hydrogeological modelling work is completed and
before the location for the RCF is finalised.  The results from the 3-D seismic
model and those from the hydrogeological modelling should be demonstrated to be
properly compatible before work on the RCF starts.&quot; </I>(paragraph 10.8,

structures which are likely to be treated deterministically in the
hydrogeological model are robustly defined.  Thus, whilst it is not disputed
that a 3-D seismic survey will probably provide a greater definition of smaller
scale structures within the BVG than is currently available, it is not certain
that such added definition will have any relevance to the hydrogeological
modelling of the site, and hence justify the environmental impact and high cost
of such a survey.

<TD WIDTH="800">Professor Smythe has not appreciated that one of the primary
reasons why Nirex is interested in carrying out a 3-D seismic survey is to
enable the rock properties, not just the geological structure, to be mapped at

<P>6.16 At paragraph 4.6 (page 20, PE/FOE/3), Professor Smythe states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The advent of two-dimensional (2-D) seismic imaging, together with
more drilling, has resulted in a radically improved and more detailed, but not
fundamentally different picture of the subsurface.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.17 Professor Smythe then lists a series of data sources and presents a
series of cross sections in his Figure 1.  He appears to have selected these
sections, which are not all from the same transect, to show the greatest
possible differences.  Nevertheless, the sections show that broadly the
subsurface geology has indeed remained fundamentally similar with more
structural detail becoming apparent as additional data have been acquired. 
However, Professor Smythe, having stated in paragraph 4.6 of PE/FOE/3 that the
interpretation has not fundamentally changed, at paragraph 4.8 of PE/FOE/3
states that <I>&quot;the geological interpretation is being substantially
revised every year or so&quot;</I>.  These two statements, in such close
proximity, appear to contradict each other.
</P>
<P>6.18 Professor Smythe has presented a large amount of detail concerning
seismic surveys in his sections 5 to 8 (PE/FOE/3) which appears to be aimed at
undermining the quality of the investigation work and the interpretations
carried out of them.  As such, Professor Smythe's evidence contradicts the
statements made by other independent reviewers (<A
HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para5.5">paragraphs 5.5</A> and 5.6 on pages 15 and 16
of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>).
</P>
<P>6.19 At paragraphs 2.13 and 2.18 (PE/FOE/3), Professor Smythe draws
attention to inconsistencies between data sets and interpretations presented by
Nirex and uses this to justify in paragraph 2.18 the need for 3-D seismic
surveys in the Site and even the District areas.  In making these assertions he
has not taken full account of the work on the structure of the PRZ presented in
the summary report {Nirex Report S/95/005} referenced in
<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para5.9">paragraph 5.9</A> of my evidence (page 21 of <B>PE/NRX/14</B>)
or of the detailed underpinning report on the geological structure of the PRZ
{BGS Technical Report No. WA/95/47C, June 1995} referenced in the summary
report.  The introduction to Report S/95/005 on page 1 includes the following
statements:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;1.2 The general structural and tectonic setting of the area around
Sellafield was reviewed in Nirex Report No. 520.  Nirex Report No. 524, Volume 2
considered the 3D structure of the Region and District.  Since the issue of
those reports many new data have been acquired.  These include the geological
data from the RCF, RCM and PRZ boreholes, and the associated geophysical (VSPs,
cross-hole seismic tomograms, wireline imagery and other wireline log rock mass
property data) and hydrogeological investigations.</I>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>1.4 A full account of the detailed GIT (Nirex Geological Integration
Team) interpretations underpinning this report is given in BGS Report No.
WA/95/47C.  The interpretation was carried out in two phases; an initial phase
in which individual datasets were interpreted either partially or fully
independently of other data, and a second phase in which the primary data
interpretations were combined to produce an integrated understanding of the
geological structure...&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.20 Thus, by selectively presenting information, Professor Smythe has
sought to undermine the geological interpretations presented by Nirex in order
to justify the need for a 3-D seismic survey.  Not only is it considered that
the claims made by Professor Smythe concerning the interpretations of the
structural geology are unjustified, but he has also failed to appreciate that
the evidence presented by Nirex already includes proposals, subject to the
results of the 3-D trial survey, to carry out such a survey prior to the
commencement of RCF construction.

<P>7.1 Professor Mather states in paragraph 6.2.9 on page 21 (PE/CCC/4):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The results of the hydraulic testing show that 10% of tested zones
in the BVG have hydraulic conductivities two orders of magnitude or more above
the threshold of 1 x 10<SUP>-9</SUP> ms<SUP>-1</SUP> below which values are
normally regarded as impermeable from a waste disposal viewpoint.  The fact that
the bulk of the BVG has a lower hydraulic conductivity is irrelevant as  only
one hairline crack in a bottle is necessary for all the contents to leak out. 
Depending on how the zones are interconnected and the hydraulic gradient to
which they are subjected, significant groundwater flow is possible.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.2 Dr Haszeldine (PE/GNP/3) at paragraph 12.5 on page 36 seeks to make a
similar point:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;I attempted to define a limit to regional BVG permeability, above
which the ultimate Repository should be considered unsafe.  This was arbitrarily
defined as being unsafe if water flow could return from the PRZ to the earth's
surface within 10,000 yr.  It is extremely important to note that this limit is
not a statistical distribution as currently used by Nirex, but an absolute limit
- if only one fracture has a permeability above this limit, the system is
fundamentally flawed.  It is difficult to imagine how a small RCF can give site
specific measurements of all fractures in the larger region to the required
accuracy and precision.  Thus the RCF cannot act as an adequate site
investigation tool.  I find that the limit to BVG permeability is 1 x 10<SUP>-9</SUP>
ms<SUP>-1</SUP> (3 x 10<SUP>-2</SUP> ma<SUP>-1</SUP>).  This is at least 40
times lower than the maximum permeability measured by Nirex.&quot;</I>

<P>7.4 These issues are dealt with in turn in the following paragraphs.
</P>
<P><U>Issue i - Measurements of Hydraulic Conductivity</U>
</P>
<P>7.5 There does not appear to be any disagreement over the hydraulic
conductivity values measured and reported by Nirex.
</P>
<P><U>Issue ii - Hydrogeological 'Criteria'</U>
</P>
<P>7.6 I disagree with the adoption of secondary quantitative criteria for
assessment of the suitability of the site.  This important issue is discussed
further in <A HREF="#Para7.12">paragraphs 7.12</A> to 7.18 below.
</P>
<P><U>Issue iii - Significance of Single Fractures</U>
</P>
<P>7.7 I disagree with the statements they make about the significance of
single fractures.  These may be relevant if one was looking at thin layers, such
as liners at conventional landfill sites.  They are not, however, relevant to
the Nirex situation in which we are considering the large scale properties of
blocks of rock many hundreds of metres thick through which water must flow. 
This point is made in my proof (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>) at
<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.16">paragraph 6.16</A>.
</P>
<P><U>Issue iv - Fracture Connectivity</U>
</P>
<P>7.8 I agree with the concept that the behaviour of the rock mass and its
ability to transmit water are controlled by the way the fractures are
interconnected and the hydraulic gradient to which they are subjected.  However,
it does not follow necessarily that significant groundwater flow is possible. 
This would only be the case if there was a well connected system of fractures
with a high hydraulic conductivity.  It is essential to determine the actual
characteristics of the rock mass to determine the extent of the flow.  This is
discussed further at <A HREF="#Para7.19">paragraphs 7.19</A> to 7.27 below.
</P>
<P><U>Issue v - Adequate Characterisation of Fractures</U>
</P>
<P>7.9 This statement may be true if the requirement was to make
<I>&quot;specific measurement of all fractures in the larger region&quot;</I>. 
This is not the purpose of the RCF.  This was discussed in <A HREF="#Para5.8">paragraphs
5.8</A> to 5.10 above.
</P>
<P><U>Issue vi - Permeability 'Limits'</U>
</P>
<P>7.10 I disagree with this statement for two reasons.  Firstly it is
inappropriate to adopt a secondary quantitative 'criterion' for assessment of
the suitability of the site (see paragraphs <A HREF="#Para3.1">3.1</A> to 3.3
and <A HREF="#Para7.12">paragraphs 7.12</A> to 7.18 below).  Secondly, it is
inappropriate to use point measurements of hydraulic conductivity as the basis
for assessing the large scale hydraulic conductivity of the rock mass.  This is
directly related to Issue iii above and is further discussed at paragraphs
<A HREF="#Para7.19">paragraphs 7.19</A> to 7.27 below.

<P><B>Hydrogeological Criteria</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.12"></A>7.12 Dr Haszeldine in paragraph 12.5 (PE/GNP/3)
states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;This </I>[regional BVG permeability] <I>was arbitrarily defined
as being unsafe if water flow could return from the PRZ to the earth's surface
within 10,000 yr.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.13 Having arbitrarily (and without justification) adopted this basic
criterion of a 10,000 year return time, Dr Haszeldine then judges the
acceptability of the site by comparing the results he has obtained from his
modelling for his central case and a number of variants calculations with this
criterion.  The variant case considered by Dr Haszeldine based on the adoption
of the modal values for BVG and sandstone hydraulic conductivity produced travel
times of 200,000 years.  The case discussed by Dr Haszeldine in which a 10,000
year travel time was obtained was an extreme case in which the regional
hydraulic conductivity of the BVG was set to the highest measured value (a
factor of 100 times greater than the value used in their other calculations) and
the hydraulic conductivity of the Calder Sandstone was set to a low value.  Data
from Sellafield (Figure 10 on page 17 of Nirex Report 525 [COR/505]) indicates
that the combination of these two extremes is very unlikely (see
<A HREF="#Para7.34">paragraphs 7.34</A> to 7.38 below).
</P>
<P>7.14 Using his 10,000 year criterion, Dr Haszeldine derives an 'acceptable'
upper bound for the hydraulic conductivity for the BVG.  He states in paragraph
12.5 of PE/GNP/3 on page 36:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;I find that the limit of BVG permeability is 1 x 10<SUP>-9</SUP>
ms<SUP>-1</SUP>.  This is at least 40 times lower than the maximum permeability
measured by Nirex.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.15 His criterion for acceptability is arbitrary (as accepted by Dr
Haszeldine at paragraph 12.5 of PE/GNP/3) and, I would assert, unjustified.
</P>
<P>7.16 Professor Mather also defines, (Paragraph 6.2.9 on page 21 of PE/CCC/4)
a &quot;threshold&quot; value of 10<SUP>-9 </SUP>ms<SUP>-1</SUP>, below which
rocks are normally regarded as impermeable from a waste disposal viewpoint.  He
cites GOV/136, a DoE Waste Management Paper entitled Landfill Design,
Construction and Operational Practice. Among other things, GOV/136 gives
guidance relating to the selection, properties and performance of low
permeability liners that could be installed in landfill facilities.  The
intention is to promote landfill practices that will achieve stabilisation
within one generation (defined as 30 to 50 years). 
</P>
<P>7.17 Given this clarification, it is inappropriate to apply the guidelines
quoted to the long term performance of the geosphere of a radioactive waste
facility.  A more appropriate comparison would be with the performance of the
engineered barriers of the Nirex repository system.  This is predicted to be
significantly in excess of the requirements for low permeability liners
installed in landfill facilities [GOV/136].
</P>
<P>7.18 The likelihood of measured values of permeability (hydraulic
conductivity) greater than 10<SUP>-9</SUP> ms<SUP>-1</SUP> in the basement
rocks was recognised in PERA [COR/501] at Table 8.2.  Whether such values can be
judged as acceptable, or otherwise, can only be made in the context of an
evaluation of the overall post-closure performance assessment of a repository. 
This must include consideration of transport through the geosphere, involving
processes such as dispersion and successive dilution, which contribute to
reducing the release of radionuclides from the geosphere.
</P>
<P><B>Upscaling</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.19"></A>7.19 The derivation of effective parameters is
described in Volume 2 of Nirex 95 [COR/522].  This is not a new concept within
the Nirex investigations.  For example, modelling work related to the BVG as a
discrete fracture network was described in some detail in section 6.5 of Volume
3 of Nirex Report 524 [COR/517] in December 1993 (pages 6.26 - 6.35).
</P>
<P>7.20 There are two main ways in which large scale effective parameters can
be determined, both of which have been utilised by Nirex:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">by the process of 'upscaling' whereby measurements taken over
small scales are used to infer large scale effective properties.  This is
achieved by Nirex through the use of a range of techniques (page 11, Nirex
Report S/94/004 [COR/510]).  An example is the use of discrete fracture network
modelling techniques in which models are produced which reproduce the
measurements made in small scale borehole tests and in which the models are then
used to estimate large scale effective parameters; and
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">ii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">by interpretation of measurements of hydrogeological tests that
interrogate a large volume of rock containing the range of natural variability. 
An example of this is the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test (<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.41">paragraphs
6.41</A> - 6.45 of
<B>PE/NRX/14</B>).  Also, the drawdown experiment in Phase 1 of the RCF, in
which the response of the regional groundwater system to RCF shaft excavation,
will constitute the largest scale of testing carried out so far.  The drawdowns
induced by the construction of the RCF will be significantly greater than those
which will have been imposed on the groundwater system by the existing
hydrogeological testing (<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.88">paragraph 6.88</A> of
<B>PE/NRX/14</B>).
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>7.21 Volume 2 of Nirex 95 [COR/522] presents in detail the methodology used
to derive a probability distribution function of effective permeability based
upon progressive upscaling from field data.  Different categories of flow
channels through which groundwater flows within each hydrogeological unit were
defined (e.g. paragraph 2.2 on page 2.1 and of Volume 2 on Nirex 95 [COR/522]). 
The models used to derive the effective parameters are illustrated in Figure 5.3
of Volume 2 of Nirex 95 [COR/522] and the probability distribution functions
that characterise the uncertainty in effective permeabilities on a regional
scale of the hydrogeological units used in the modelling are listed in Figure
5.1 of the same document.
</P>
<P>7.22 The base case values of the effective hydrogeological parameters are
then summarised in Table 2.1 of Volume 3 of Nirex 95 [COR/522].
</P>
<P>7.23 The models used in the Nirex 95 [COR/522] calculations incorporated
zones of hydraulically connected fractures which extended over scales of 50
metres to 5 kilometres.  These are termed Type II features in Nirex 95
[COR/522].  The models therefore explicitly incorporate features which will
permit the preferential flow of groundwater over long distances.  These features
had hydraulic conductivity values which ranged from 10<SUP>-11</SUP> ms<SUP>-1</SUP>
to 10<SUP>-7</SUP> ms<SUP>-1</SUP>.  Additionally, larger scale Type III
features were built into the models in the location of known major fault zones. 
These had generally higher values of hydraulic conductivity than the Type II
features.  As a result, the Nirex 95 [COR/522] models allow the preferential
flow of groundwater along selected features both within the BVG, and cutting
across the hydrogeological boundaries between the BVG and its overlying units. 
The hydraulic connectivity permitted by these modelling assumptions is thus
significant.
</P>
<P>7.24 More recent information on the large scale properties of the BVG are
now available. These arise from the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, which has involved
a three month pumping test in a selected zone of the BVG.  This zone was located
in the Sides Farm Member, between 638.9 metres bOD and 681.6 metres bOD.  It
contained two identified flow zones.  As seen in Drawing No. 10089 in Nirex
Report SA/95/002 [COR/518] and <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.2">Figures 6.2</A>
and <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.5">6.5</A> of <B>PE/NRX/14</B>, the zone
selected is one of the most productive sections within Borehole RCF3 and
contains the principal flow zones in the BVG encountered in this borehole.
</P>
<P>7.25 The models used for upscaling in Nirex 95 [COR/522], and a number of
alternative conceptual and numerical models of the fracture network in the BVG,
are being tested by comparison of model predictions with the results of the
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test.  This is a stringent test of the models because three
months of pumping on the most productive zone in the borehole tests a much
larger volume of rock than the earlier borehole measurements on which the
fracture network models were based.
</P>
<P>7.26 Preliminary analyses of the result of these comparisons suggests that
the fracture network model giving the best comparisons is likely to have a lower
connectivity within the BVG than that predicted in Nirex 95 [COR/522].  This is
because it includes variations in fracture apertures within the Type II
features.  Such variations were not included in the parameterisation of Type II
features for Nirex 95 [COR/522].  Thus the system may be less well connected
than assumed in Nirex 95 [COR/522].
</P>
<P>7.27 Thus, it is concluded that the approach to treatment of hydraulic
conductivity values proposed by Professor Mather and Dr Haszeldine in their
proofs, whilst probably appropriate to the consideration of flow through thin
layers, such as landfill liners, is not appropriate to flow through sequences of
rock many hundreds of metres thick for assessment of the performance of a deep
repository.
</P>
<P><B>Alternative Groundwater Flow Modelling</B>
</P>
<P>7.28 In section 12 of his proof (PE/GNP/3), Dr Haszeldine presents the
results of groundwater flow modelling carried out by Glasgow University.  The
results of this modelling have been published in two papers referenced as
GNP/3/4 and GNP/3/6.  In paragraph 12.1 on page 35 of his proof Dr Haszeldine
claims that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;My approach and results were significantly different to that
pursued by Nirex.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.29 Recognising the statement made by Dr Haszeldine, Nirex has undertaken a
systematic review of his modelling work as reported in the two papers cited by
him (GNP/3/4 and GNP/3/6) to establish whether and, if so, to what extent, his
results are actually significantly different from those of Nirex in a manner
which might have a bearing on the potential of the Sellafield site to meet
regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>7.30 On the basis of a systematic review of the modelling work undertaken by
Dr Haszeldine it is concluded that the differences he reports between his
modelling and that undertaken by Nirex arise for the following reasons:

<P>7.31 It is my assessment that if realistic parameters were used, Dr
Haszeldine's models would produce results broadly comparable to those presented
in much more detail by Nirex in Nirex 95 [COR/522].
</P>
<P><U>Conceptual Model</U>
</P>
<P>7.32 The conceptual model adopted by Dr Haszeldine could not be fully
evaluated due to the lack of detail contained in his published papers.  However,
although in general the conceptualisation appeared to be a reasonable first
attempt at describing the Sellafield regional groundwater flow field, it was
noted that the parameters adopted did not accord with those presented in Nirex
Report 524 [COR/517].  This is discussed in the following paragraphs.
</P>
<P><U>Geological Structure</U>
</P>
<P>7.33 The geological sequence used by Dr Haszeldine contains some differences
to that adopted by Nirex.  His model explicitly incorporates a large conductive
feature that originates at the surface and terminates immediately adjacent and
down groundwater gradient of the proposed repository.  Dr Haszeldine terms this
the 'Fleming Hall Fault Zone'.  A comparison of the structural cross section
used in their work corresponds with interpretations presented in 1992 in Nirex
Report 263 [COR/502].  Since the publication of this report in 1992 considerably
more information has been gathered and a revised structural interpretation was
presented in Nirex Report 524 [COR/517].  As a result of these changes, a
structural feature similar to that proposed in Dr Haszeldine's model is not
located near the PRZ.

surface have hydraulic parameters which are considered unrealistic.  Dr
Haszeldine and his co-author note in the caption to Figure 6 (GNP/3/4, page 93)
that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;BVG conductivity is the maximum measured in site investigation
boreholes...The Calder Sandstone set to low conductivity.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.35 There are also some more subtle, but none the less significant
discrepancies between the values for hydraulic conductivity used by Dr
Haszeldine and those given in Nirex Report 524 [COR/517] particularly for the
Carboniferous Limestone and Brockram Formations.  Dr Haszeldine has selected
conductivity values approximately one order of magnitude lower than the values
reported by Nirex from the field measurements.  Because these geological units
contribute to the hydraulic separation between the upper sedimentary rocks and
the BVG, this discrepancy is significant.
</P>
<P>7.36 The range of hydraulic conductivity values assigned by Dr Haszeldine to
the BVG is a subset of the reported test results in Nirex Report 525 [COR/505]
and contains only the high and median values.  The selection of fault
conductivities and porosities also differ from those in Nirex Report 524
[COR/517].  Values of porosity utilised by Dr Haszeldine are also seen to be
different, in some cases by up to 100%, from the reported test results.
</P>
<P>7.37 Thus Dr Haszeldine has selectively taken data and results from Nirex
Report 524 (published in December 1993) [COR/517] and Nirex Report 263
(published in March 1992 on the basis of significantly more limited data)
[COR/502].
</P>
<P>7.38 The values of BVG and Calder Sandstone hydraulic conductivity used by
Dr Haszeldine in his central case significantly increase the predicted flow
velocity in the repository region, as compared to the median value.  The values
for the Brockram hydraulic conductivity adopted by Dr Haszeldine would tend to
produce lower flow and transport across that formation relative to the median
value.  These two factors combine together to focus groundwater flow in the
model into the imposed fault.  Thus, by careful selection of parameters for his
central case model, Dr Haszeldine has imposed a particular pattern of
groundwater flow.
</P>
<P><U>Regional hydraulic conductivity</U>
</P>
<P>7.39 There is an important distinction between the hydraulic conductivity
values used in the model, which are regional effective values, and the measured
hydraulic conductivity values which are essentially point values.  The measured
values can be expected to cover a wide range and to include some quite high
values in the 'tails' of the distribution due to the natural heterogeneity in
the rocks (see section 8 of this supplementary proof).  However, the regional
value, which will determine the overall flow rate, will be some average of the
local values depending on the connectivity as well as the conductivity of the
individual fractures.  Thus the existence of a few high measurements does not
automatically imply a high probability that Dr Haszeldine's arbitrary criterion
will be breached.  This issue has been discussed in <A HREF="#Para7.12">paragraphs
7.12</A> to 7.18 above.
</P>
<P><U>The results</U>
</P>
<P>7.40 Although the model adopted by Dr Haszeldine for his central case
comprises a pessimistic and unrealistic end member of the many models formed by
possible geometric aspects and hydrogeological characteristics at the potential
repository, this model predicted long groundwater return times of 10,000 to
15,000 years depending on modelled repository depths (Figures 6a and 7a of
GNP/3/4, pages 93 and 94).  The second set of models illustrated in Figures 6b
and 7b of GNP/3/4, in which the BVG conductivity was reduced to 3.8 x 10<SUP>-10</SUP>
ms<SUP>-1</SUP>, closer to the median value of 1 x 10<SUP>-10</SUP> ms<SUP>-1</SUP>
(<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.1">Figures 6.1</A>, <B>PE/NRX/14</B>), and
hence provided a much more realistic representation of the hydraulic
conductivity contrast between the BVG and the sandstone, not only produced a
significantly longer estimate of groundwater return time (200,000 years), but
also indicated a marine discharge (under current sea level conditions) for the
water rather than a terrestrial discharge given by the models which suppressed
the conductivity contrast between the BVG and the sandstone.
</P>
<P>7.41 The selection of a geological structure and hydraulic parameters by Dr
Haszeldine has produced an extreme and pessimistic model of the Sellafield site.
 The model parameters, in particular, suppress the effects of the hydraulic
conductivity contrast between the BVG and the sandstone and focus groundwater
flow into a geological fault that has been imposed on the model immediately
downstream of the repository represented in the model.  Adoption of a more
realistic value for the hydraulic conductivity of the BVG reproduces the pattern
of groundwater flow shown in the Nirex 95 studies [COR/522] with marine
discharge to the west of the PRZ (assuming current sea level conditions).

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;It is concluded that the conceptual model of the hydrogeology

<P>8.6 In paragraph 6.5.2 (page 29, PE/CCC/4) Professor Mather refers to the

<P><I>&quot;Encouraging progress has been made in determination of groundwater
chemistry.  The chemical composition of the waters provide an indication of the
origin, history and age of the waters.  This information helps to confirm the

groundwater pressures and hydraulic conductivity.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.9 The statements made by Nirex (see paragraph 8.7 above) clearly indicate
that the groundwater regimes were defined on the basis of the processes
occurring within these regimes and that the geochemical information has helped
to confirm the pattern of groundwater flow.  Professor Mather is thus wrong in
his paragraph 6.5.2 (page 29, PE/CCC/4) in which he seeks to indicate that the
regimes are defined on the basis of salinity.  Furthermore, the groundwater
salinities quoted by Professor Mather, assigned in that way to the regimes, are
not, as indicated by him, taken from Nirex Report 525 [COR/505], nor are they as
quoted in subsequent Nirex reports.

<P><A NAME="Para8.10"></A>8.10 Professor Mather is also wrong in his assertion
(PE/CCC/4, paragraph 6.6.7) that the model <I>&quot;hides the complex
inter-relationships between the various regimes&quot;</I>.  Professor Mather
confines his attention to a single figure (his Figure 4, PE/CCC/4) which is a
schematic representation of the broad features of the groundwater system.  He
ignores the detailed discussion of conceptual models in Nirex 95 [COR/522] and
of the hydrogeochemistry in Nirex Report S/95/008 [COR/525].  Hence, it is
inevitable that he regards the model represented in his Figure 4 (PE/CCC/4) as
simplistic.  Nirex's description of conceptual models in Nirex 95 [COR/522] is
comprehensive and detailed.  The hydrogeochemical conceptual model in Nirex
Report S/95/008 [COR/525] is able to explain all of the compositions of
groundwater and, as stated in <A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.66">paragraph 6.66</A>

a simplification in which  complexities are being hidden.

<P><U>Issue  iii - the use of elicited data instead of measured data.  </U>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.17"></A>8.17 At paragraph 2.13 on page 9 of PE/FOE/5, Dr
Salmon describes the way in which Nirex has conceptualised the fractures within
the groundwater flow model presented in Nirex 95 [COR/522].  In the last
sentence of the paragraph, in referring to the parameters used to describe the
characteristics of these fractures, he states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Of these, all except fracture orientations can not be adequately
quantified by the field characterisation programme alone, and reliance has
instead had to be placed on the elicitation of probability density functions
(PDF's) for the uncertainty about the mean and variance associated with the
distribution  of these parameters {S/95/012}, from a group of experts assembled
by Nirex (COR/508).&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.18 It needs to be emphasised that the elicitation of parameter values for
modelling is based on data from the site characterisation programme.  At page
5.4 of Volume 1 of Nirex 95 [COR/522], the extent to which field data was used
as part of the elicitation process is made clear.  It states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Information on the orientation of the fractures can be obtained
from the field data [5.2].  Of the remaining parameters, it was considered most
appropriate to elicit distributions of fracture spacing, fractures length and
channelling fraction from the expert group, which were able to make reference,
in the course of the elicitation, to observations of the spacing of fractures
and flowing zones in the boreholes and to outcrop studies of fracture length&quot;.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.19 As stated in section 4 of Volume 2 of Nirex 95  [COR/522], fracture
transmissivities were not elicited, but were derived by requiring models to be
consistent with field data. The elicitation process is a structured and
appropriate response to dealing with uncertainties in field data.

independent review of the Nirex investigations at Sellafield by the Royal

Group Report.  The quote he uses is:

on page 143, column 1, of COR/605 from which it can be seen that Dr Salmon has
taken his quote from the summary of section 8 of the report.  The section in the
main body of the report is found on page 135, column 1, first full paragraph, of
COR/605.  This paragraph puts a somewhat different complexion on the assertions
made by Dr Salmon.  The paragraph states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Three points need emphasis.  First, the development of conceptual
hydrogeological models and their translation into numerical models of
groundwater flow are among the most difficult scientific problems Nirex have to
face at Sellafield.  Second, the underlying scientific work has been of high
quality.  Third, participants in the study had to work with a set of site
characterisation data considerably smaller than that available now (mid-1994),
and much less extensive than that which will be available when the site
characterisation programme is nearing completion, including tracer and other
tests in the RCF.  We therefore examined the work of the expert group with a
view to assessing the methodology rather than the soundness of the results.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.23 Dr Salmon's subsequent assertion in paragraph 2.8 (PE/FOE/5) that the
Royal Society Study Group Report comments were made because of the complexity of
the site seems difficult to understand as the statement about the complexity of
the hydrogeological system is not taken from the Royal Society Report [COR/605],
instead it is taken from a paper on the design of the RCF.
</P>
<P>8.24 Dr Salmon returns to this theme of elicitation at paragraph 3.17 on
page 25 of PE/FOE/5, where he states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The Royal Society (COR/605) concluded that the elicitation
procedure, whereby experts used both limited site data and general data, is </I>'unlikely
to lead to defensible sets of parameter values'<I>.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para8.25"></A>8.25 The section of the Royal Society Study Group
Report [COR/605] that is relevant is section 8.2.4 commencing on page 134. 
Firstly, in the first paragraph of this section the Royal Society Study Group
make it clear that the Nirex study they are referring to was the one carried out
in early 1993 and was based on limited data (in effect, although not
specifically stated, this was the data in Nirex Report 268 [COR/521] based only
on the results from Boreholes 1, 2, 3 and 4).  Secondly, in the second paragraph
of page 135 (quoted in full in paragraph 9.11 above), the Royal Society Study
Group Report makes it clear that more data were available at the time they
reported and which had not been available when the elicitation study was carried
out.  They also made it clear that more data would become available,
particularly from the RCF.  Finally, in the second paragraph in column 2 on page
135 [COR/605], from which Dr Salmon's quote is taken, the Royal Society Study
Group is making the point that elicitation in the absence of site-specific data
is unlikely to lead to defensible sets of parameter values, but that <I>&quot;ideally
this would be largely replaced by one of scale-up calculations based on
extensive field data&quot;</I>.  This is indeed the approach being adopted by
Nirex.
</P>
<P>8.26 By the use of selective quotations, and by confusing comments made on a
much earlier elicitation study (known to be based on limited data) with his own
comments made on the conceptual model development reported in Nirex 95
[COR/522], Dr Salmon has misrepresented the extent to which Nirex 95 has been
based on actual field data.  He has also apparently ignored the points made both
in my evidence (<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.83">paragraph 6.83</A> to 6.88 of <B>PE/NRX/14</B>)
and by the Royal Society Study Group that the RCF has an important role in
providing the required additional data.
</P>
<P><U>Issue  iv - Dr Salmon's interpretation of the hydrogeological field
tests differs from that presented by Nirex. </U>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.27"></A>8.27 At paragraph 2.19 (PE/FOE/5) Dr Salmon comments
on the results of various hydrogeological testing programmes.  Apart from Dr
Salmon's discussion of  the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, I do not disagree with the
comments he makes and find them to be substantially as given in my evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.35">paragraphs 6.35</A> to 6.45).  In commenting on
the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, Dr Salmon has confused the borehole interference
effects observed in the boreholes with the results of the pump test.  These
interference effects are described in Appendix 2 to my evidence (<A
HREF="nrx14a1.htm#ParaB2.8">paragraphs B.2.8</A> to B.2.10 on pages B.4 and B.5
of Appendix 2 to <B>PE/NRX/14</B>) and illustrated in
<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#FigB21">Figure B.2.1</A> (Appendix 2,
<B>PE/NRX/14</B>).  They are also described in somewhat more detail in
paragraphs 7.21 to 7.29 of Nirex Report S/95/007 [COR/524]. 
<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#FigB21">Figure B.2.1</A> in Appendix 2 of <B>PE/NRX/14</B>
shows these interference effects and the smooth responses observed in the
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test after January 1995.  These two datasets have been used
in complementary ways to provide information on hydrogeological conditions in
the PRZ.
</P>
<P>8.28 In paragraph 2.20 of his evidence (PE/FOE/5, page 14), Dr Salmon states
that his interpretation of the field tests differ in both substance and tone
from those presented in my evidence.  I do not agree that the two
interpretations differ in substance although they may differ in tone.
</P>
<P><U>Paragraph 2.20 - first bullet point</U>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.29"></A>8.29 In the first bullet point on page 14 (PE/FOE/4)
Dr Salmon disputes that the fracture network may be less well connected than
previously considered.  I stand by my original statement and point to the
description of the fracture networks as presented in Nirex 95 [COR/522] as
justification.  It is important to recall that Nirex 95 was based on the data
presented in Nirex Report 524 [COR/517] which pre-dates the hydrogeological
testing to which we are now referring. (See the third paragraph of the Preface
to Nirex 95 [COR/522].)
</P>
<P>8.30 The extent to which the Nirex 95 models represented fracture
connectivity is best illustrated by Figures 2.1, 5.3 and 5.5 in Volume 2 of
Nirex 95 [COR/522].  These illustrate the ways in which fractures are
represented in the model and show:

<P>8.31 Thus, for example, Figure 5.5 in Volume 2 of Nirex 95 [COR/522]
specifically shows the way in which the Basal Deep St Bees Sandstone, the
section containing the siltstone and claystone bands later identified as the
North Head Member, was shown as containing transmissive fractures and major
faults cutting it.  Thus the model recognised the possibility of connections
through this part of the sequence connecting the Brockram to the higher parts of
the sandstone sequence.  In contrast to this, later work (for example paragraph
8.6 of Nirex Report S/95/007 [COR/524]) has shown that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The North Head Member is identified as an interval at the base of
the St Bees Sandstone with distinctive geological and hydrogeological properties
from the overlying St Bees Sandstone.  The claystone bed at the top of the North
Head Member is considered to be a possible low permeability control on flow
between the North Head Member and the overlying sandstone.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para8.32"></A>8.32 The preliminary results from the Borehole RCF3
Pump Test (Brockram Phase) have shown that the North Head Member attenuates the
hydraulic responses to pumping in the Brockram.  No responses were observed in
the sequence above the North Head Member.  As a result of this, it is possible
to conclude that in the vicinity of Borehole RCF3, any sub-vertical joints and
fractures that may occur within the Brockram and extend up into the sandstones
do not result in a strong hydraulic connection between the Brockram/North Head
Member, and the upper stratigraphic units of the sandstones. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.33"></A>8.33 Further information which helps to confirm this
limited connectivity in the vicinity of Borehole RCF3 is provided by the
monitoring of salinity in the different stages of the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test. 
The sandstone test was located just above the saline transition zone; the water
pumped from the hole remained fresh.  The Brockram test was located immediately
below the saline transition zone; the pumped water remained saline.
</P>
<P>8.34 The basis of my statement in <A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.70">paragraph
6.70</A> of <B>PE/NRX/14</B> is thus the comparison of  judgements made in the
Nirex 95 models with the observations made in the testing.  This enhancement in
our understanding of the connectivity within the system will be incorporated
into the groundwater models which we will be developing as a next stage from
Nirex 95 and as the basis for developing the predictions for the RCF shaft
drawdown experiment.
</P>
<P>8.35 Dr Salmon appears to criticise the Fracture Network Testing on page 15
of his proof (PE/FOE/5, paragraph 2.20).  He refers to the <I>&quot;inability
of such testing to identify connections within the fracture system in lateral
directions away from a borehole&quot;</I>.  Dr Salmon is correct in recognising
that the Fracture Network Testing does not identify lateral connections; it is
not designed to do so.  It is part of an integrated programme of post completion
testing as described in <A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA8">Table A.8</A> on page A.27 of
Appendix 1 to my proof (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>).  This refers to the fact that the
Fracture Network Testing was designed to <I>&quot;provide complete coverage of
the section of the borehole within the Borrowdale Volcanic Group&quot;</I>.  By
testing a continuous section of borehole with test sections both containing and
not containing identified flow zones (<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.5">Figure
6.5</A> of <B>PE/NRX/14</B>) it was possible to provide statistical coverage of
the BVG.  This testing needs to be viewed in association with the other major
programmes of post completion testing (<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA8">Table A.8</A>,
Appendix 1,
<B>PE/NRX/14</B>) namely the Short Interval Hydraulic Testing, the Cross-Hole
Hydraulic Testing and the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test.  The Cross-Hole Hydraulic
Testing, the Borehole RCF3 Pump test, and ultimately the RCF shaft drawdown
experiment are the parts of the testing programme specifically designed to
investigate lateral connections.
</P>
<P><U>Paragraph 2.20 - second bullet point</U>
</P>
<P>8.36 On page 15 of PE/FOE/5, Dr Salmon appears to be confusing the results
of the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test with the information from the observation of
interferences between boreholes during drilling reported in Nirex Report
S/95/007 [COR/524].  The two sets of data are not incompatible, although the
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test is able to reveal the connections in a more systematic
manner, as discussed in <A HREF="#Para8.27">paragraphs 8.27</A> and 8.32 above.
Dr Salmon also comments, on page 15 (PE/FOE/5), that I have failed to explain
the existence of the <I>&quot;unusually low environmental heads&quot;</I> in
the BVG <I>&quot;which may indicate some vertical connectivity with the cover
rocks&quot;</I>.  Reference to the descriptions of the models in Nirex 95
[COR/522] should have indicated to Dr Salmon that the possibility of such
connections are explicitly recognised in Nirex 95 by the incorporation of both
Type II and Type III features in the model.  Furthermore, it should be again
pointed out that Nirex 95 indicates that the site is likely to be able to meet
regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P><U>Paragraph 2.20 - Third bullet point</U>
</P>
<P>8.37 The point made by Dr Salmon at the top of page 16 of PE/FOE/5 related
to hydrochemistry is dealt with in section 10 of this supplementary proof. 
However, at the end of that paragraph on page 16, Dr Salmon makes the remark
that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;It is also quite possible that any differences in water quality
are lost or reduced as deeper groundwater moves to the surface, via processes
such as dilution&quot;.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.38 In making this remark Dr Salmon is recognising the favourable
characteristic of the Sellafield site in offering dilution of waters which may
leave the BVG as stated in <A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.71">paragraphs 6.71</A> to
6.73 of my evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>).
</P>
<P><U>Paragraph 2.20 - Fourth bullet point</U>
</P>
<P>8.39 On page 16 of PE/FOE/5, Dr Salmon comments that the head distributions
are not as consistent as I had implied.  He is correct in identifying some
heterogeneity in the heads observed in the boreholes.  This can be seen by the
small-scale variability of the heads in Figure 6.8 of PE/FOE/14 and more clearly
by the plots of environmental heads with depth shown for the individual
boreholes in Drawing Nos. 100111 to 10131 of Nirex Report SA/95/002 [COR/518]. 
Indeed, this heterogeneity is a characteristic feature of fractured rock masses.
</P>
<P><U>Paragraph 2.20 - Fifth bullet point</U>
</P>
<P>8.40 In the final bullet point of paragraph 2.20 on page 17 of PE/FOE/5, Dr
Salmon seeks to dismiss the geochemical information on the grounds that there
are <I>&quot;relatively few samples&quot;</I>.  He then concludes that <I>&quot;Therefore
the possibility of flowpaths with relatively short travel times cannot be
discounted&quot;</I>.  There are two points arising from this conclusion. 
Firstly, the possibility of there being such flowpaths out of the BVG has been
specifically recognised by the Nirex 95 models.  For example, Table 2.3 in
Volume 3 of Nirex 95 [COR/522] shows the travel times for different pathways. 
Paths B and C show significantly shorter travel times than Path A for flow to
the top of the BVG because of the pathline intersecting one of the Type II
features.  Secondly, as stated in <A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para8.15">paragraphs 8.15</A>
and <A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para9.9">9.9</A> of my evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>) the
RCF is required to investigate the nature and distribution of these networks of
connected fractures.  One of the reasons, as stated in
<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para8.15">paragraph 8.15</A> of <B>PE/NRX/14</B>, is to
determine the extent to which it might be possible to locate vaults to limit the
intersections between the networks of connected fractures and the repository
vaults.
</P>
<P>8.41 In respect of Dr Salmon's comment that relatively few samples have been
obtained, <A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#Appendix1">Appendices 1</A> and
<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#Appendix2">2</A> of <B>PE/NRX/14</B> summarise the
substantial programme of geochemical sampling that has been carried out.
</P>
<P><U>Issue v - There must be some doubt that Nirex will ever be able to
predict groundwater flow with confidence</U>
</P>
<P>8.42 Given the substantial progress made so far in understanding and
modelling groundwater flow at Sellafield, I cannot agree with the comment made
by Dr Salmon in paragraph 2.21 on page 17 (PE/FOE/5) that there must be some
doubt that Nirex will ever be able to predict groundwater flow with confidence. 
He has presented no evidence to support such an assertion.  Furthermore, his
references to the complexity of the site and 'other site criteria' are
reiterations of his inappropriate use of qualitative 'criteria' (see sections 2
and 3 of this supplementary proof).
</P>
<P><U>Closing comments on Dr Salmon's conclusions to his section 2 (PE/FOE/5)</U>
</P>
<P>8.43 I disagree with the conclusions reached by Dr Salmon on page 18 of

<P><U>Upward Flow</U>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.45"></A>8.45 The existence of head gradients at the site is
a feature of the site which has long been appreciated.  Paragraph 8.14.5 of
<I>PERA</I> [COR/501] recognised the possibility of <I>&quot;the propagation
of groundwater heads into the basement.&quot;</I>  Our understanding of head
gradients at Sellafield is described in the section of my evidence dealing with
'Groundwater Heads and Gradients' (<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.48">paragraphs 6.48</A>
to 6.59 on pages 39 to 42 of
<B>PE/NRX/14</B>).
</P>
<P>8.46 In just the same way as other hydrogeological 'criteria' cannot be used
to assess the site, similarly head gradients cannot be used in this way. 
However, the impacts of head gradients have been examined in Nirex 95 [COR/522]
in calculations that have indicated that the performance of a repository is
likely to meet regulatory requirements (see, for example, the variant
calculations in sections 7.3 and 7.4 of Volume 3 of Nirex 95 [COR/522]).  This
is because the low hydraulic conductivity in the BVG, coupled with the potential
for dilution in the overlying cover rocks leads to an acceptable performance of
the site.
</P>
<P>8.47 Professor Mather (paragraph 6.7.1, PE/CCC/4) suggests that there is
evidence from hydrogeochemical data suggesting upward flow.  This is discussed
in section 9 of this supplementary proof.
</P>
<P><U>Potential for flow into the PRZ</U>
</P>
<P>8.48 Dr Haszeldine (paragraph 8.2 and Figures 8.1 a, and b, PE/GNP/3)
interprets contours of environmental head to infer potential for horizontal
flow.  This is incorrect as the potential for horizontal flow is given by
freshwater heads (<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.8">paragraph 6.8</A>, <B>PE/NRX/14</B>).
 This is explained in more detail in section 4.4.3 (page 4-4) and Figure 4.2 in
Volume 3 of Nirex Report 524 [COR/517].  Dr Haszeldine has also omitted to
record the statement made at the foot of page 4-7 of Nirex Report 524, Volume 3
[COR/517] in which the diagrams that he has interpreted are explained with the
comment that they are
<I>&quot;intended to demonstrate only that groundwater heads in this region of
the BVG are variable&quot;</I>.
</P>
<P>8.49 The variable nature of the heads in a fractured rock such as the BVG is
a feature of such systems.  It is therefore questionable as to whether such
local data can reliably be used, in the way Dr Haszeldine has, to infer regional
patterns.
</P>
<P>8.50 A regional interpretation of the head data is presented in
<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.58">paragraphs 6.58</A> to 6.59 of <B>PE/NRX/14</B>
which indicates that a consistent pattern of head gradients towards the coast is
recognised in the area.  A more regional interpretation of data, such as that
presented in Figure 8.1b of PE/GNP/3 would indicate flow diverging from the PRZ,
the opposite to the pattern suggested by Dr Haszeldine.Dr Haszeldine (paragraphs
8.2 and 8.3, PE/GNP/3) suggests the presence of a 'flow axis' associated with
the structural crest of a NE-SW trending fault block.  In paragraph 8.4
(PE/GNP/3) this idea is given the status of <I>&quot;the main subsurface axis
of flow potential of (sic) meteoric water moving from the Lake District towards
the coast&quot;</I>.
</P>
<P>8.51 This idea is, of course, only relevant if Dr Haszeldine's assertions
about converging groundwater flow are supported, which, as stated above, they
are not.  In any case, the main sub-surface route for meteoric water flow from
the fells towards the coast is in the Sherwood Sandstone Group.
</P>
<P>8.52 In paragraph 8.4 (PE/GNP/3), Dr Haszeldine claims that the PRZ is in
the worst position within the Site from the standpoint of hydrogeological
containment.  This conclusion is based on the spurious idea of the &quot;subsurface
flow axis&quot;.  The basis for selecting the PRZ is explained in
<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para8.2">paragraphs 8.2</A> to 8.10 of <B>PE/NRX/14</B>.
</P>
<P><U>Location of Discharge</U>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.53"></A>8.53 Professor Mather states (Paragraph 6.6.5,
PE/CCC/4):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;discharge in the shore zone is a more realistic assumption for
modelling purposes than discharge offshore into the Irish Sea.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.54 Professor Mather implies that it was assumed by Nirex that discharge
was offshore and into the Irish Sea, and that this assumption was built into the
models used, for example, for the calculations of groundwater flow presented in
Volume 3 of Nirex 95 [COR/522].  This is not the case.  The locations of
discharges are predicted as an output from the modelling, they are not an input
to the modelling.
</P>
<P>8.55 Figure 2.6b of Volume 3 of Nirex 95 [COR/522] illustrates that the
models used in Nirex 95 do indeed predict some level of terrestrial discharge
under the current groundwater conditions.  As stated on page 2.12 of Volume 3 of
Nirex 95 [COR/522]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;the main region of radionuclide discharge is from about a hundred
metres offshore to about a kilometre offshore. This region is just beyond the
main region of groundwater discharge which extends to about a hundred metres
offshore&quot;.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.56 The peak of groundwater discharge from the Calder sandstone and
Quaternary deposits is very close to the coast, and the discharge falls off
quite quickly with distance offshore.
</P>
<P>8.57 These predictions are consistent with a number of observations made at
the site, including those quoted by Professor Mather and resulting from the 1977
- 1979 studies of Holmes and Hall [CCC/4/3].  
</P>
<P>8.58 Nirex has undertaken sampling of  freshwater spring discharges from
foreshores in the vicinity of the site.  This confirms the view that some
groundwater from the near surface groundwater flow systems will discharge on the
coast.  
</P>
<P>8.59 However, consideration of the chloride profiles for the two Nirex
boreholes drilled near the coast (Boreholes 3 and 13A) (Appendix C, Nirex Report
S/95/008 [COR/524]) indicate a substantial (300 - 400 metres) thickness of fresh
and brackish waters.  This would imply that a fair proportion of the fresher
waters moving in the upper part of the sandstones and comprising the Coastal

<P><B>Numerical Groundwater Flow Modelling</B>
</P>
<P>8.60 For the Objectors, numerical groundwater flow modelling is primarily
addressed by three proofs that I am responding to in this supplementary proof:
Dr Haszeldine (PE/GNP/3), Dr Salmon (PE/FOE/5) and Dr Hencher (PE/FOE/6).  Dr
Haszeldine has presented some of his own modelling; this has been addressed in
section 7 of this supplementary proof.  Within the following part of section 8,
I address the issues raised by Dr Salmon and Dr Hencher on aspects of numerical
modelling.  I also describe some aspects of the recent and current
hydrogeological modelling being undertaken by Nirex, in addition to that
described in Nirex 95 [COR/95] to demonstrate the range and extent of the work
being carried out.
</P>
<P><U>Dr Salmon (PE/FOE/5)</U>
</P>
<P>8.61 In section 3 of his evidence (PE/FOE/5) Dr Salmon criticises the
modelling work undertaken by Nirex and, in paragraph 3.33 on page 33 recommends
that additional modelling work should be undertaken which is likely to take at
least another year to complete before the RCF is contemplated.  As Mr Folger has
stated in his supplementary proof (<B>PE/NRX/12/S1</B>) at
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12s1.htm#Para4.3">paragraph 4.3</A> on page 6, the revised
schedule for the RCF <B> </B>shows commencement of the RCF South Shaft in
December 1997, some two years hence.  Thus, even if Nirex accepted all the
recommendations made by Dr Salmon for additional modelling, the work could be
completed well ahead of commencement of shaft sinking.  Dr Salmon's argument
that the RCF is premature is thus irrelevant.

<P>8.66 These issues are taken together in the paragraphs that follow.
</P>
<P>8.67 In section 5 of his proof (PE/FOE/6), Dr Hencher, in paragraph 5.5 on
page 11 recognises the importance of a stochastic approach to fracture flow. The
role of this in characterising the site is described previously in this
supplementary proof (section 5).<B></B>Dr Hencher states in paragraph 5.5:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Channel flow generally follows a complex and tortuous path between
the two rock walls of a single fracture and along the intersection of different
fractures.  The interaction of fractures may allow the development of a
continuous flow path through the rock mass.  As discussed later, the statistical
potential for fractures to intersect on the basis of their perceived typical
geometries within the rock mass is the starting point and main controlling
factor within mathematical models of discrete fracture networks.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.68 This observation contrasts with the themes of the proofs by both Dr
Kokelaar (PE/FOE/2) and Professor Smythe (PE/FOE/3) who argue that a
deterministic approach is required in which rock units, faults and fractures
need to be located individually and precisely as the basis for hydrogeological
modelling.  Thus, for example at paragraph 10.2 in Professor Smythe's evidence
(PE/FOE/3, page 50) he states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;An essential prerequisite for hydrogeological modelling is to
establish the geological structure accurately both in and around the PRZ. 
Inconsistencies in the current interpretation show that major faults, as well a
minor geological structures, are likely to have been misinterpreted and/or not
identified.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.69 The Nirex approach is to recognise that characterisation and modelling
of the hydrogeology of a site requires a combination of the deterministic and
stochastic approach.  Thus on page 5-1 of Volume 3 of  Nirex Report 524
[COR/517] it is stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;A general premise underlies work on the hydrogeology of fractured
rocks.  It is assumed that water bearing fractures of all sizes exist within a
region being investigated.  Even though the distribution of fracture sizes may
be single or multi-modal (Figure 5.1a) it is further assumed that there are more
small fractures than large (in terms of extensiveness).  It is often assumed
that it is possible to explicitly identify the most extensive fractures, and
that they will have consistent assignable properties.  This has the effect of
dividing the hydrogeological system into a large-scale deterministic sub-system
alongside a smaller scale probabilistic sub-system (Figures 5.1b and c).  The
division is based on the values of fracture extensiveness, fracture
transmissivity and the certainty of identification and parameter assignment. 
The values at which the division is chosen vary from rock to rock, site to site
and progress during an investigation.  Certain large scale (regional) structural
features may influence hydraulic properties as much as lithological variation
and these have also to be considered.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.70 This same approach is described in section 1 of Volume 1 of Nirex 95
[COR/522].  On page 1.2 it states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;All hydrogeological modelling is based on representation, which
are usually simplifications (abstractions) of the underlying conceptual
model.....The numerical models aim to treat the important aspects of the system
in a way that is realistic, but is at an appropriate level of complexity,
without unnecessary detail.  Thus, for example, when groundwater flow in a
fractured rock on a regional scale is to be modelled, it would not be practical
to represent explicitly the extremely large numbers of fractures such a model
would involve.  In any case, such a model would provide far more detail than is
required.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.71 In paragraph 5.6 of his proof (PE/FOE/6) on page 11, Dr Hencher refers
to the heterogeneous response of oil wells.  He then goes on in paragraph 5.7 to
interpret this observation as being due to <I>&quot;the complex and variable
nature of fluid flow within fractured rock&quot;</I>.  The natural heterogeneity
in fractured rocks is indeed a feature of these materials and needs to be
explicitly dealt with.  This is clearly recognised in the conceptual and
numerical modelling work presented in Nirex 95 [COR/522].  Providing such
heterogeneity is dealt with in an appropriate manner it can simply be regarded
as a characteristic of the system rather than  being regarded as a source of
particular difficulty.
</P>
<P>8.72 In heterogeneous rock masses, as stated above, it is not necessary to
explicitly characterise and understand each and every fracture in order to
understand groundwater flow through the system.  It is, however, essential in
interpreting the results of small scale observations and measurements made
within the system, to recognise that these results will themselves reflect the
natural heterogeneity of the system.  Statements made in several of the
Objectors' proofs referring to a perceived lack of predictability of the system
at Sellafield reflect the lack of appreciation of three important aspects of
dealing with low permeability, heterogeneous systems, namely:

<P>8.73 Spatial variability has also been discussed in section 5 above.
</P>
<P>8.74 Dr Hencher does, however, state in paragraphs 3.5 and 3.6 of his
evidence (PE/FOE/6, page 6):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;It will be argued that until Nirex are able to demonstrate that
they understand data from existing sites and ongoing planned activities in
generic laboratories, they should not disturb the site at Sellafield, perhaps
irrevocably.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is concluded that to proceed to the RCF stage of repository
development prior to satisfactory completion of underlying generic research work
and validation of numerical models would be premature and ill-conceived.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.75 Dr Hencher is proposing an approach to the investigation of the site
which is different to that proposed by the Royal Society Study Group.  In their
report [COR/605] on page 110 they state (emphasis added):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;There are two routes forward and we expect Nirex to pursue both of
them: a continued effort to improve physical understanding of the relationship
between fracturing and water flow, and how these might change under possible
future conditions; and a palaeohydrogeological approach to the problem based on
observed present-day groundwater geochemistry and its relationship to historical
flow conditions.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>The RCF will yield valuable information for the two approaches
outlined above, as well as providing data on the potential effects of repository
construction on the BVG, and allowing progress to be made on repository design.

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.76 Fracture flow modelling is widely recognised as being an appropriate
technique for modelling groundwater flow and transport in low-permeability
fractured rocks.  It is used within the Swedish, US, Swiss, Finnish and Japanese
national radioactive waste disposal programmes, and of course the UK programme.

</P>
<P><U>Summary on Nirex Hydrogeological Modelling Studies</U>
</P>
<P>8.77 Several opposition proofs (for example PE/FOE/5, paragraph 3.25)
criticise Nirex for not using a wider range of models.  In fact a wide range of
conceptual and mathematical models are used.  Previous work is described in
section 6 of Volume 3 of Nirex Report 524 [COR/517] and in Nirex 95 [COR/522]. 
</P>
<P>8.78 Ongoing modelling studies are outlined in <A HREF="#Para8.89">paragraphs
8.89</A> to 8.102 of this supplementary proof.  Results from these studies are
still being assimilated and have not yet been published.  However, preliminary
analysis indicates that the models consistently predict low flow in the BVG and
further advances have been made in reproducing the distributions of pressure
head and salinity.
</P>
<P><B>The role of the RCF in understanding the regional hydrogeology</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.79"></A>8.79 In paragraph 7.2 (PE/CCC/4, page 43) Professor
Mather states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The RCF .... will add little to our knowledge of the regional
picture fundamental to an understanding of the controls on groundwater flow.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.80 Professor Mather accepts for the RCF solely that (paragraph 7.2, page
42, PE/CCC/4):-
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The RCF will enable the scale over which these networks are
observed to be up-rated from that of the borehole to that of the shafts and

will allow a more detailed understanding of the fracture network than it is
possible to obtain from surface boreholes and remote geophysical
measurements,......&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.81 He justifies his claim that the RCF will not assist in understanding
the hydrogeology by appealing to his review of the results of the Nirex
hydrogeological investigations and continuing that (paragraph 7.2 pages 42/43):-
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;...... the complexity and unpredictability of the hydrogeology
which has been highlighted in Section 6 of this Proof of Evidence means that
Nirex may well be able to get no nearer to obtaining a comprehensive
understanding of the networks of fractures and the controls of groundwater flow
than they are at present.  The RCF will provide data on the near-field and will
add little to our knowledge of the regional picture fundamental to an
understanding of the controls on groundwater flow.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.82 I do not agree with the assertions made by Professor Mather that the
RCF will not address issues related to the regional hydrogeology and set out in
the following paragraphs the reasons why I disagree with him.
</P>
<P>8.83 Regional hydrogeology is a term applied to the large-scale (kilometres
to tens of kilometres) pattern of groundwater movement in a flow system whose
boundaries and driving forces can be reasonably well defined and related to
geological and geographical features.
</P>
<P>8.84 Our current understanding of the regional hydrogeology of the
Sellafield area comes from a combination of hydraulic and hydrochemical data
from deep boreholes and studies of both present-day and historic records of
surface hydrology and sandstone hydrogeology (see section 10 of this
supplementary proof for information on the extent of this historical data). 
Most recently, this understanding was used to construct the regional flow model
which figures centrally in Nirex 95 [COR/522].
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.85"></A>8.85 The RCF programme addresses many issues apart
from regional hydrogeology, but it will provide four main contributions to the
current understanding:

<TD WIDTH="800">The <B>shaft drawdown data</B> will allow the comparison and
testing of different models of flow in both the BVG and the overlying cover
rocks by imposing a hydraulic signal which will affect many hundreds of millions
of cubic metres of rock.  The information from these tests can be readily scaled
to the regional level.  The Borehole RCF3 Pump Test was a smaller scale version
of the same concept and tested six alternative models of flow in the BVG and two
in the overlying cover rocks.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>8.86 This latter aspect of the investigations, regarding the shaft drawdown
data, is consistent with that recommended by RWMAC in 1991 where they commented
on the Nirex site investigation programme that (RWMAC, Twelfth Annual Report,
1991, [GOV/404], page 11, paragraph 2.10):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;However, groundwater flow in basement-type rocks is dominated by
flow along fractures and it is unlikely that even several boreholes and the most
careful geophysics will be able to locate with any certainty all the important
groundwater channels.  Better awareness of the extent of the hydraulic coupling
between the groundwater in the cover sandstones and the basement below will be
obtained from observations of the response of the groundwater system to the
progressive stages of excavation of the shafts, and then the tunnels, associated
with the repository.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The reference to the repository is because this statement was made by the
RWMAC before the decision was taken to break-out the RCF as a separate activity.
 The comments regarding the usefulness of data from monitoring the response of
the groundwater system to excavation of shafts and galleries apply equally well
to the RCF as they did in 1991 to the repository.
</P>
<P>8.87 The RCF is not the only contributor to understanding of the regional
hydrogeology. An integrated programme of regional investigations has been
underway since 1991.  The first two stages of this programme involved collecting
historical data and data from the Nirex deep boreholes.  This has involved
gathering meteorological, spring, river and stream, mine working and pre-Nirex
borehole data.  The current stage is concerned with setting up automated
monitoring networks to collect meteorological, hydrological and groundwater data
(see description of Regional Hydrogeological Surveys in
<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA2">Table A.2</A>, Appendix 1,
<B>PE/NRX/14</B>).  These networks will also be used to monitor the impact of
RCF construction.
</P>
<P>8.88 The forward programme of deep borehole drilling and testing (<A
HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.3">Table 6.3</A>,
<B>PE/NRX/14</B>) will contribute further to understanding of the regional
hydrogeology.
</P>
<P><B>Recommendations for further investigations</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.89"></A>8.89 In section 5 of his evidence (PE/FOE/5) Dr
Salmon presents a series of recommendations for further surface-based
investigation studies and modelling.  Mr Reeves (PE/FOE/4, paragraph 8.5) also
presents recommendations for further investigations.  In paragraph 5.2 on page
46 (PE/FOE/5) Dr Salmon states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The need for further surface-based investigations and modelling
has been a central thread of my Evidence.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.90 Dr Salmon concludes (PE/FOE/5, paragraph 6.1, page 52):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;I consider that a RCF should not proceed until the work that I
have recommended has been satisfactorily completed, including a proper peer
review and due regard being paid to any subsequent comments&quot;.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.91 In Dr Salmon's final conclusion on page 53 (PE/FOE/5) at paragraph 6.6
he states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;In conclusion, I appreciate the eventual need for a RCF as part of
a repository development programme, but consider that the Sellafield RCF
planning application is premature.  Given the hydrogeological complexity of
Sellafield I also consider that Nirex should commence surface investigations at
other, more hydrogeologically favourable sites&quot;.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.92 In his final conclusion, Dr Salmon appears to recognise that the
Sellafield site may be shown to be a suitable repository site.  He is basing his
objection largely on the issue of prematurity.  The issue of alternative sites
has been addressed in section 4 of this supplementary proof.
</P>
<P>8.93 At paragraph 5.3 on pages 46 and 47 (PE/FOE/5) he sets out seven &quot;aims&quot;
for this further work that he recommends.  In paragraph 5.5 he sets out in more
detail examples of the types of investigations he considers are required.  He
concludes in paragraph 5.6 (PE/FOE/5) that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;I estimate that these tasks (excluding that for aim 6 which needs
to be further defined by Nirex) will take five or six years to complete.  Most
of this period is devoted to the establishment of baseline conditions.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.94 I do not disagree substantially with the statements made by Dr Salmon
concerning the range of additional surface-based work since all the aims raised
by him are already incorporated into Nirex's overall programme as explained
below.  I do, however, disagree with his views on timing, both with regard to
the length of time required to establish baseline hydrogeological conditions and
the extent to which the work can proceed in parallel with the RCF. The time
required to establish baseline conditions is dealt with in section 10 of this
supplementary proof.  Much of the other work described by Dr Salmon can proceed
in parallel with the schedule for the RCF.  These aims are discussed  below.
</P>
<P><U>Aim 1: to define further the geological sequence and hydrogeology in
three dimensions</U>
</P>
<P>8.95 Dr Salmon suggests two further boreholes on land and suggests that
there may be a case for one or more deep offshore boreholes to better
characterise the main potential radionuclide discharge area (see also Mr Reeves
PE/FOE/4, paragraph 7.3).  <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Table6.3">Table 6.3</A> in my
evidence (PE/FOE/14) summarises the planned programme of further surface-based
investigations.  This includes up to two boreholes to the south of the PRZ in
the area between Boreholes 2 and 11.  These are shown as 'drilling into the
Seascale Fault Zone'.  It is anticipated that this work can be carried out by
inclined drilling from the Borehole 11 site, but consideration is also being
given to whether it would be most appropriate to carry out this drilling from an
alternative site.  Up to four boreholes (Boreholes 15 to 18) are already planned
to investigate the saline transition zone, including in the area to the west of
the site on the predicted pathlines for groundwater flow that has passed through
the repository. Work on the first two of these boreholes is currently delayed as
Cumbria County Council have deferred a decision on the planning application. 
Drilling onshore is preferred for two reasons.  Firstly, it provides easier
access for long-term testing and monitoring, and secondly, it is considerably
cheaper than drilling offshore.  Information from drilling offshore needs to be
shown to have a significant benefit to our confidence in the evaluation of the
repository system before a commitment should be made. Currently, such a
commitment cannot be justified.  Regarding drilling to the north-west of
Borehole RCF3, Nirex does not consider that such a borehole is required, given
the scope for investigation from the RCF itself. Thus the proposals made by Dr
Salmon have been included within Nirex's future  programme of work.  As the
additional boreholes are at some considerable distance from the RCF, in areas
unlikely to be influenced by the RCF, there is no reason why this work should
not proceed in parallel with the RCF.
</P>
<P><U>Aim 2: to determine baseline environmental head and geochemical
conditions</U>
</P>
<P>8.96 This issue is dealt with in section 10 of this supplementary proof.
</P>
<P><U>Aim 3: to test further the connectivity of strata and fractures</U>
</P>
<P>8.97 Dr Salmon states that the scope for further cross-borehole tests and
pump tests is limited.  Nirex is currently analysing the results of the Borehole
RCF 3 Pump Test and considering tracer tests.  The monitoring system installed
in the deep boreholes is designed to allow sampling of groundwater for
monitoring of chemical variation and detection of tracers.  The need for further
tests will be reviewed in the light of results to date and further work will be
planned to complement testing associated with the phased RCF development.  Tests
of the connectivity of strata and fractures around the RCF and Potential
Repository Zone are best done by monitoring the disturbance due to activities
such as the controlled disturbance to the groundwater from shaft sinking.  This
will particularly measure the connectivity between the fracture networks in the
BVG and the porous strata in the cover sequence.
</P>
<P><U>Aim 4 : to refine the model in an attempt to enable it adequately to
replicate existing groundwater conditions and the effect of any field testing</U>
</P>
<P>8.98 Nirex generally agrees - this is what we are doing with our ongoing
hydrogeological characterisation and modelling and the RCF is a further
development of this process.  We are not just refining one model but are
developing and testing a range of models to develop understanding of the
hydrogeological system.  None of this activity needs to delay RCF construction
as the phased RCF activities will help to refine, develop and validate the
models and their prediction of responses to RCF development.
</P>
<P><U>Aim 5 : to model the impact of the proposed RCF construction on baseline
conditions and the PCPA</U>
</P>
<P>8.99 Nirex agrees - such modelling is part of our planned programme.  As
Salmon accepts, it is part of model development as discussed above.  This is
programmed in as part of the experimentation and modelling related to the phased
RCF development.
</P>
<P><U>Aim 6 : to assess the effectiveness of sealing techniques</U>
</P>
<P>8.100 This is part of Nirex's ongoing research.  Current laboratory results
will be further developed once the RCF is developed.
</P>
<P><U>Aim 7 : to begin to develop more appropriate modelling strategies for
determining the long-term safety case of any future repository proposals</U>
</P>
<P>8.101 The current strategy is an appropriate one for this stage of the
investigation (Nirex S/94/004 [COR/510]).  However, further developments are
planned, e.g. to take account of new data from the analysis of the Borehole RCF3
Pump Test and to investigate particular issues.  Such plans are highlighted in
Section 3 of Nirex Report S/94/004 [COR/510].
</P>
<P>8.102 Thus, all the work suggested as being necessary by Dr Salmon, and
more, is already in hand or planned by Nirex as part of an integrated programme
of site characterisation of which the RCF forms a part.  There are no reasons
for this work to delay the granting of planning permission for the RCF.

<P>9.4 Our responses to these seven concerns are enlarged upon in the remainder
of this section.
</P>
<P><B>Lack of geochemical boreholes</B>
</P>
<P>9.5 In paragraph 6.5.1 (PE/CCC/4), Professor Mather states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The lack of a programme of boreholes drilled specifically to
obtain hydrogeochemical data is one of the major deficiencies of the current
borehole programme.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.6 Nirex has drilled both deep and shallow boreholes at the Sellafield site
to gain a regional understanding of the groundwater flow and hydrochemical
patterns across the site. These boreholes have had multiple objectives, as a
number of features have been required to be explored by each borehole.  The
collection of groundwater samples from the Sellafield boreholes, in particular
in the BVG, is further complicated by the generally low groundwater flow. This
restricts the amount of water available for collection in any given period of
time. Rigorous procedures have been applied to the collection and evaluation of
groundwater samples, in order to ensure that the best feasible quality has been
achieved, and that any contamination resulting from the drilling of the borehole
or from other sample collection effects can be assessed and corrected for in
determining in-situ groundwater compositions. These issues have been previously
discussed in my Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>, Appendix 1,
<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#ParaA4.4">Sections A4.4</A> - A4.6).
</P>
<P>9.7 The subject of the reliability of the geochemical data from the deep
boreholes was a matter about which the Royal Society Study Group showed
considerable interest.  Information was presented to the Study Group by Nirex
specialists and, as a result, on page 105 of their report [COR/605] the Study
Group states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Nirex have thus demonstrated a capability to obtain high quality
hydrochemical samples from existing boreholes.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.8 This information, presented to the Royal Society Study Group, was
subsequently written up as a technical report for Nirex {Nirex Report 701} which
is referenced in Nirex Report S/95/008 [COR/525].  Professor Mather makes no
mention of having consulted this report.
</P>
<P>9.9 The second point concerning Professor Mather's comments on geochemical
boreholes is that Nirex has applied on 30 May 1995 for planning permission to
drill two boreholes (Boreholes 15 and 16).  The covering letters to Cumbria
County Council (Ref: DB/ah/PZ/PP/225 and 226) that accompanied these
applications state <I>&quot;The primary objective of these boreholes is to
extend the current understanding of the geochemical conditions as indicators of
past and present groundwater flow and mixing&quot;</I>.  Cumbria County Council
has deferred making a decision on this application.

<P><B>Geochemical information used to define groundwater regimes</B>
</P>
<P>9.10 This issue is addressed in section 8 of this supplementary proof in
<A HREF="#Para8.7">paragraphs 8.7</A> to 8.10.
</P>
<P><B>The saline transition zone and groundwater mixing in the PRZ</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.11"></A>9.11 In paragraph 6.5.5 of PE/CCC/4, Professor
Mather indicates that the saline transition zone in the PRZ is not sharp and
goes on to argue that this is
<I>&quot;clear evidence to support an upward flow from the BVG into the SSG in
the area of the PRZ&quot;</I>.  The following paragraphs 9.12 to 9.20 establish
that the saline transition zone is relatively sharp and occurs in the Brockram
and basal sandstones, which may be the result of the proximity to relatively
high permeability contrasts between the sandstones and the Brockram.
</P>
<P>9.12 In paragraph 6.5.5 (PE/CCC/4), Professor Mather questions the statement
made in my proof of evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>, <A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.67">paragraphs
6.67</A>) that the saline interface zone is relatively sharp in the PRZ.  He
states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;However, this is only because of the arbitrary definition of the
transition zone as the range over which the electrical conductivity of the
groundwater changes from less than 10 to over 17 mS cm<SUP>-1</SUP> (at 20&#176;
C) (see paragraph 3.2 of {Nirex Science Report S/95/008}).&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.13 Reference to paragraph 3.2 in Nirex Report S/95/008 [COR/525] indicates
that the statement made was:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The transition from brackish waters to saline waters is known as
the saline transition zone (STZ) and has been defined as the depth range over
which the electrical conductivity of the groundwater changes from less than 10
to over 17 mS/cm (at 20&#176; C).  The upper value is equivalent to 10 g/l of
total dissolved solids or about 6 g/l chloride.  Definitions of fresh and
increasingly saline waters are given in the glossary.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.14 The glossary in Nirex Report S/95/008 [COR/525] on page G2 states the
definitions used for fresh, brackish, and saline waters, and brines.  It is
stated that these definitions are based on the published work of Davis (1964)
and Carpenter (1978).  Thus, the definitions of salinity used by Nirex are
certainly not arbitrary and are based on standard texts.
</P>
<P>9.15 This interpretation of the salinity distribution at Sellafield is
presented in section 3 of Nirex Report S/95/008 [COR/525].  The summary, as
given in paragraph 3.10 on page 16 states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;A unified representation of the saline transition zone and other
salinity variations across the site has been achieved and is presented.  The
saline transition zone in the Potential Repository Zone is relatively sharp and
occurs in the Brockram and basal sandstones.  This is possibly the result of
proximity to the relatively high permeability contrasts between the sandstones
and Brockram in the locality.  To the south and west of the Potential Repository
Zone, the saline transition zone is more diffuse.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.16 The pattern of salinity in the upper part of the BVG is consistent with
the current understanding of the site, which suggests that, in the boreholes
drilled in the PRZ, zones of slightly higher hydraulic conductivity are
indicated  in the upper part of the BVG as compared with deeper BVG.
</P>
<P>9.17 Professor Mather uses his Figure 3 (page 32 of PE/CCC/4) and states
that this <I>&quot;proves how spectacularly wrong&quot;</I> Nirex were in
refuting his earlier suggestions of estimates of upward flow made in ERM  Report
ITA/7 [COR/608].  Professor Mather's Figure 3 is a reproduction of Figure 3.1 in
Nirex Report S/95/008 [COR/525].  Professor Mather does not point out that the
original figure was labelled as a &quot;Composite plot of Cl concentration vs.
depth for the PRZ&quot; and that it contained data from a total of nine separate
boreholes.  He also does not point out that the plots for the individual
boreholes are contained in Appendix C to the same report (S/95/008 [COR/525]).
Professor Mather is overemphasising the implications of salinity levels in
excess of 20 mg/l being observed in the base of the sandstones by not placing
these observations in context.
</P>
<P>9.18 The observations of high salinities in the lower part of the St Bees
Sandstone referred to in paragraph 6.5.6 of Professor Mather's evidence
(PE/CCC/4) are based on a limited number of samples.  The samples showing high
salinities are obtained from the North Head Member at the base of the St Bees
Sandstone.  The chloride versus depth profiles for the individual boreholes in
Appendix C of Nirex Report S/95/008 [COR/525] shows how these individual samples
relate to the interpreted position of the saline transition zone in each of
these boreholes.  Examination of the information presented by Nirex indicates
that over substantial parts of the PRZ, the saline transition zone is sharp, but
is actually located within the North Head Member of the St Bees Sandstone rather
than at the top of the BVG or within the Brockram. The interpretation of this
information presented in Nirex Report S/95/008 [COR/525] is that 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;the saline transition zone in the Potential Repository Zone is
relatively sharp and occurs in the Brockram and basal sandstones. This is
possibly the result of proximity to the relatively high permeability contrasts
between the sandstones and Brockram in the locality.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.19 As discussed previously, (<A HREF="#Para8.32">paragraphs 8.32</A>),
the inferences drawn in Nirex Report S/95/007 [COR/524] are that the North Head
Member has distinctive geological and hydrogeological properties from the
overlying St Bees Sandstone and is considered to be a possible low permeability
control on flow between the North Head Member and the overlying sandstones. The
conclusion is therefore that the North Head Member contributes to the
permeability contrast between the upper stratigraphic units of the sandstone and
the lower formations, and hence the saline transition zone in the PRZ exists in
part within the North Head Member.
</P>
<P>9.20 Detailed examination of the hydrochemical data, in conjunction with
other evidence presented by Nirex therefore indicates that it is inappropriate
for Professor Mather to conclude that the observed salinity profiles are
indicators of significant upwards flow.  At present, although the existence of a
groundwater mixing profile is evident, it is not possible to use the geochemical
data alone to speculate about the extent of this mixing.  Further data, from the
RCF Phase 1 work, are considered essential to quantify this rigorously.
</P>
<P><B>Geochemical indicators of residence times have been over-interpreted</B>
</P>
<P>9.21 In paragraph 6.5.10 on page 35 of PE/CCC/4, Professor Mather states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;It is my view that the noble gas data are over-interpreted&quot;.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.22 Professor Mather makes other comments in section 6.5 of his evidence

<BLOCKQUOTE>

are quoted as mean residence times.  A range of sample types are analysed,
including core pore fluids and fluids sampled during well testing (<A

The majority of samples analysed for groundwater residence indicators are those
taken from well testing in the boreholes. These sample the flow system around
the borehole. In the BVG, these samples are dominated by flow from the fracture
system.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;It is possible that rates of regional flows of subsurface waters
in the future could be much more rapid than any inferred today.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.28 This statement is made on the basis that Dr Haszeldine suggests in
section 10 of his evidence that data for hydrogen and oxygen isotope and noble

greater than its present value.

Nirex's interpretation of hydrogen and oxygen isotopic ratios and noble gas
recharge temperatures for Boreholes 2, 4 and 5, by equating cold climates with
glaciation.  He assumes that the observed hydrogen and oxygen isotopic ratios
and low noble gas recharge temperatures indicate that groundwater was recharged
under glacial conditions.  Nirex Report S/95/008 (paragraph 5.3, page 26,
COR/525) refers only to <I>&quot;colder climatic conditions during the

periods during the past 1.6 million years (i.e. the Pleistocene) were
interspersed with warm periods, giving the impression that warm (temperate)
climate states were common in the Pleistocene.  In fact, the dominant climate
states were colder than today's temperate climate, but only rarely glacial (see
Table on page 22 of Nirex Report S/95/003 [COR/527]).
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>9.31 In paragraph 10.2 (page 26, PE/GNP/3) Dr Haszeldine asserts that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;it is apparent that there is little evidence for water recharge
into the BVG in warm period climates, such as today&quot;.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.32 He then goes on to argue that recharge to the BVG may have been
restricted to colder (i.e. glacial) periods, and presents a cartoon in Figure
10.2 of PE/GNP/3 that suggests that this was due both to increased heads under
the ice and to opening of fractures due to ice loading.  This is how he makes
the connection between the stable isotope data and the idea that the BVG
permeability (<I>&quot;transmissivities&quot;</I>)  may have been higher during
past glaciations.
</P>
<P>9.33 His own evidence (paragraph 11.4, page 29, PE/GNP/3) emphasises his
view regarding the effect of mixing on isotopic indicators of groundwater age,
and stable isotopes are no exception.  If the Nirex view that temperate climate
conditions were the exception rather than the rule in the Pleistocene is
accepted (see paragraph 9.30 above), we would not expect to find spatially
distinct groundwater zones with stable isotopic signatures of temperate recharge
events pre-dating the last (late Devensian) glaciation, as Dr Haszeldine seems
to expect.
</P>
<P>9.34 In fact, isotopically heavy water characterises the brine in the BVG in
Borehole 3.  In Nirex Report S/95/008 (paragraph 5.8, page 28, [COR/525]), it is
said that this <I>&quot;might indicate recharge prior to the last glacial epoch&quot;</I>
i.e. before the Pleistocene, possibly associated with Tertiary tectonic events.
</P>
<P>9.35 Thus there is no evidence, only speculation by Dr Haszeldine that there
was preferential and enhanced recharge to the BVG during glacial periods.

<P>10.1 The need to establish the baseline hydrogeological conditions at the
site prior to commencement of the construction of the RCF is not in dispute. 
The point of disagreement between Nirex and the Objectors is the extent to which
this baseline has been established and, therefore, whether any further
monitoring, sampling or testing is required to establish this baseline.
</P>
<P>10.2 The matters related to baseline conditions were addressed in

</P>
<P><B>Groundwater Heads</B>
</P>
<P>10.3 The Objectors state that additional periods of time are required.  For
example Dr Salmon (paragraph 5.5, page 49, PE/FOE/5) states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;I consider that it would be a sensible precaution to define
baseline conditions as being established when relatively stable or predictable
heads and geochemistry has been observed over a period of four or five years at
all monitoring points.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>10.4 Mr Reeves (paragraph 8.5, page 42, PE/FOE/4) states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;This network should be monitored for a minimum of a further 4 or 5
calendar years to enable an equilibrium condition database to be established
over an adequate time frame.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>10.5 Similar views are stated by Drs Green and Western (PE/FOE/1, paragraph
9.7).
</P>
<P>10.6 The Nirex position, as stated in <A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#Appendix2">Appendix
2</A> of my evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>) is that baseline conditions are already
recognisable in all boreholes as shown by constant head with time or systematic
seasonal variations (<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#ParaB2.16">paragraph B.2.16</A>,
Appendix 2, <B>PE/NRX/14</B>).  It has been further pointed out that monitoring
will continue and further baseline data will become available prior to
commencement of shaft excavation (a further 2 years approximately).  A review of
baseline conditions carried out for Nirex in September 1995 by Professor Lloyd,
(Professor of Hydrogeology, University of Birmingham) has confirmed the Nirex
view that baseline has been established [NRX/14/3].

<P>10.7 In its report &quot;Review of aspects of the scientific mission and
role of the Nirex Rock Characterisation Facility at Sellafield&quot; [COR/414]

groundwater monitoring should be carried out subsequent to cessation of drilling

</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>10.11 These issues are discussed in turn below.
</P>
<P><U>Data availability</U>
</P>
<P>10.12 At paragraph 7.7 (page 31, PE/FOE/4), Mr Reeves comments on the extent
of the data available in the sandstones and drift.  He is incorrect in his
assertions concerning the limited amount of data.  There are 16 boreholes with
data from 1974 and there are at least 17 drift boreholes with more than 9 years
of data {Nirex Report 233, Table 2.11}.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para10.13"></A>10.13 In the early 1980s extensive investigations
into the water resources of west Cumbria were conducted by the North West Water
Authority, and subsequently by BNFL.  As a results of this there are 41
observation wells with more than 10 years records, and 24 observation wells with
more than 5 years records.  The results of 13 aquifer pumping tests are
available from this investigation, which included monitoring the effects of the
development on water levels in the Drift, and on flows from springs and in the
River Calder {Nirex Report 233, Table 3.2}.  It is noted that the hydrographs
presented by Mr Reeves from Cumbria (Figure 5, PE/FOE/4) display substantially
the same pattern of water levels as the hydrograph he presents for Shropshire
(Figure 1, PE/FOE/4), except the 1976 drought was less intense in coastal
Cumbria than it was in the Midlands.  This demonstrates that the Cumbria
hydrographs are comparable to the national trends in water level changes.
</P>
<P>10.14 As part of the development of nuclear facilities in the area,
investigations of the relationships between water levels in the drift and
underlying sandstone were conducted at Drigg and Sellafield.  Professor Mather
refers to the Sellafield investigations in CCC/4/3.
</P>
<P>10.15 The above data show that the investigations of groundwater conditions
in west Cumbria, although not performed specifically in connection with the
Nirex work, were of a duration and intensity that bears comparison with
investigations for groundwater schemes elsewhere in the UK and is greater than
suggested by Mr Reeves.
</P>
<P><U>Comparison with regional groundwater schemes</U>
</P>
<P>10.16 In section 5 of his evidence (PE/FOE/4), Mr Reeves draws comparisons
between the Nirex data acquisition programme, and a number of data acquisition
programmes associated with different projects.  In particular, three groundwater
schemes are cited: Thames, Shropshire and the Fylde, the latter two exploiting
the Sherwood Sandstone Group, as found at Sellafield.  All three of these
schemes are very large, designed to impact water resources on a regional or
national scale.  They involve groundwater abstractions rather larger than the
total flow of the River Calder in west Cumbria.  The likely scale of impact can
be expected to be much greater than the groundwater impact of the RCF, yet it
can be seen that the number of observation wells and the timescale of
observations are in fact similar to those for the Sellafield area, as described
above.
</P>
<P>10.17 Thus compared with other investigations of comparable scale, Nirex has
a comparable amount of data from many of its monitoring installations.  As
stated in my evidence (Appendix 2, <A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#ParaB2.16">paragraph
B.2.16</A>-17, <B>PE/NRX/14</B>) the baseline has been established and a
further two years of monitoring will be available before excavation of the RCF
South Shaft is due to commence.  As far as we are aware, there is no tradition
of requiring five years data from specially installed monitoring.
</P>
<P><U>Objectives and Duration of monitoring</U>
</P>
<P>10.18 Natural systems are seldom static, but exist in a state of
fluctuation.  The objective of monitoring over a period of time, rather than
taking just a single measurement, is to characterise this fluctuation with time.
</P>
<P>10.19 Natural changes to groundwater systems occur over a complete spectrum
of timescales.  As described in Appendix 2 of <B>PE/NRX/14</B> (<A
HREF="nrx14a1.htm#ParaB2.11">paragraph B.2.11</A> to B.2.15  on pages B.5 and
B.6), Nirex has already characterised gravitational effects (occurring on cycles
of 12 hours 25 minutes), barometric effects (24 hours to several days), seasonal
effects (1 year), synoptic effects (occurring over several years) and has
possibly identified solar effects (22 years).  In addition, there is evidence
for long-term synoptic effects (about 50 year cycles), climatic effects (100
years to 100,000 years), and tectonic effects (100,000 years plus), all of which
are applicable on a much larger scale than just west Cumbria.
</P>
<P>10.20 Given this continuous spectrum, there is no clear point at which to
stop monitoring and it is therefore necessary to form a judgement as to what is
sufficient.  Some fluctuations can be directly measured and determined on a site
specific basis, others, such as, for example, climatic effects and tectonic
effects must be established by other means and the uncertainties associated with
such estimates taken account of in the safety assessments of the site.
</P>
<P>10.21 There are two clear uses for the variability recorded in long-term
monitoring data:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">the characteristics of the variations can be interpreted in
terms of the hydrogeological properties of the site; and
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">ii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">the natural variability needs to be subtracted from
artificially induced changes, such as pump testing and the drawdown caused by
RCF shaft excavation, in order to measure correctly the size of these changes.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>10.22 In terms of hydrogeological properties it can be shown by
consideration of the diffusion equation that longer timescale fluctuations
directly increase information on hydraulic conductivity.  In progressing from
daily fluctuations to annual fluctuations there is a significant gain in
information of around 2.5 orders of magnitude, whereas further progress to
short-term synoptic fluctuations gives a further increase of only a further 0.5
orders of magnitude.  In order to characterise cyclic fluctuations, it is
necessary to observe one cycle if the period is known, rather more cycles if it
is unknown.
</P>
<P>10.23 In terms of correcting observations for natural fluctuations, if the
fluctuations have been explained in terms of hydrogeological properties, the
corrections can be made on this basis alone.  Otherwise, it will be necessary to
measure the natural fluctuations in their own right.  It is helpful if the trend
can be correlated with trends in boreholes independent of the imposed
disturbance.  For the longer term effects, which are of more than local
significance, the correlation boreholes need not be local.  The good correlation
of water levels between Cumbria and Shropshire (<A HREF="#Para10.13">paragraphs
10.13</A> above) is an example of this.
</P>
<P>10.24 Mr Reeves' assertion that at least five years' data are necessary can
be examined in the light of the above discussion.  Five years' data are clearly
more than adequate to characterise fluctuations up to the scale of annual
fluctuations.  Nearly all the likely information on hydrogeological properties
can be extracted from annual fluctuations.  Five years' data are inadequate to
characterise synoptic variations; this can be seen clearly by moving a five year
window over the hydrographs presented by Mr Reeves (Figures 1 and 5 in
PE/FOE/4).  To characterise such variations, of the order of twenty years' data
are required.  However, this yields little extra hydrogeological information,
and the trends within this can be characterised by less than five years' data. 
Correlations with other boreholes can also be used.
</P>
<P>10.25 It is also relevant to consider the use that can be made of long-term
monitoring data, for example that presented by Mr Reeves (Figures 8 and 9 in
Appendix 1 to PE/FOE/4).  Figure 9 shows a fairly consistent mean head, about
which annual fluctuations occur.  The only major excursion is in 1988.  The long
record has increased confidence that there are no long-term trends in this
dataset, but has added little information beyond that captured by the first one
or two years' data.  The hydrograph in Figure 8 (Appendix 1, PE/FOE/4) shows the
impact of shaft sinking followed by an almost straight line recovery onto which
is superimposed the annual fluctuations.  These annual fluctuations are rather
larger than in Figure 9.  The excursion in 1988 is clearly visible.  The record
prior to shaft sinking is only about 6 months in duration in Figure 8 and is too
short to establish whether the amplitude of annual fluctuations has been changed
by the shaft sinking.  However, it is not clear that the long record of data
post-sinking has added much information over that gained in the first one or two
years.
</P>
<P><U>Conclusion</U>
</P>
<P>10.26 The baseline groundwater conditions have been established at
Sellafield.  A further two years of monitoring will be available before
commencement of the RCF South Shaft excavation commences.  There is no
justification for the arbitrary assertions by Dr Salmon and Mr Reeves that a
further 4 or 5 years of monitoring is required before commencement of the RCF.

<P><B>Geochemical Conditions</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The lack of a programme of boreholes drilled specifically to

<P><I>&quot;Many aspects of the geochemistry of the site as it stands are
currently poorly understood.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>10.29 However, he does not go on to say what these are or why he believes
they are poorly understood.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para10.30"></A>10.30 These witnesses call into question whether
sufficient geochemical information has been collected prior to RCF excavation. 
In the following section I explain why baseline hydrochemical information is
only required for certain purposes, why sufficient geochemical information, of
sufficient quality, is already available for these purposes and why further
planned work to improve the baseline will be unaffected by the excavation of the
RCF.  I also explain why the RCF offers the only means to obtain baseline
hydrochemical data relevant for other purposes.
</P>
<P><U>Objective of Hydrochemical Observations</U>
</P>
<P>10.31 Hydrogeochemical baseline information is required at the current stage
of investigations principally to assist with the development of the regional
groundwater flow model. The main components of the hydrogeochemical data used to
do this have been salinity and other major chemical component data (to help
identify the processes leading to the distribution of the main bodies of water
present) and isotopic data (which give indications of origins and movement of
these waters; so-called palaeohydrogeological information).
</P>
<P>10.32 At later stages in the programme, requirements for hydrogeochemical
data will become more specific in terms of targetting hydrogeological features
or regions of interest or in terms of evaluating specific mechanisms and
pathways.
</P>
<P><U>Data used in Current Regional Model</U>
</P>
<P>10.33 The principal source of data used to draw the current hydrogeochemical
baseline has been water samples taken from cores and during hydraulic testing of
the deep boreholes. These samples were all contaminated to varying extents by
drilling fluids but it has been possible to make analytical corrections to
provide good quality data which are 'fit for purpose'. This is described in
detail in Appendix 2 (<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#B3">B.3</A>) of my Proof of Evidence
(<B>PE/NRX/14</B>) and the views of the Royal Society Study Group on data
quality were stated earlier, at

(currently, boreholes 15-18 into the sandstones), in which collection of
hydrochemical data takes precedence over other measurements, are planned to
enhance understanding in volumes of rock where the conceptual regional
hydrogeological model is sensitive. These may include the saline transition
zone, other regions of groundwater mixing and discharge zones.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para10.37"></A>10.37 Continued sampling of existing and planned
deep boreholes will provide progressively less contaminated samples for isotopic
analysis which will enable the construction of a model of regional
palaeohydrogeology. This will considerably strengthen the regional flow model.
At present, this work is in its early stages.

<P>10.38 Sampling of entirely undisturbed conditions within the PRZ will not be
possible after construction. However, this is not considered to be a significant
issue for the following reasons:

<TD WIDTH="800">A baseline of 'major variables' for the region as a whole,
including the PRZ, already exists. This is adequate for constructing the current
regional flow model (as discussed above). In this context, hydrochemical data
from the PRZ are simply one point in the much broader regional picture which can
be built even without data from the PRZ itself.

<TD WIDTH="800">Very detailed hydrochemical characterisation of undisturbed PRZ
groundwaters with a view to evaluation of their impact on the proposed
repository system is of limited relevance as the actual behaviour of the
repository near-field hydrochemistry will be dominated by the presence of the
repository excavations themselves (to which the RCF is analogous).  In
particular, the evolution of pore-waters in the cementitious engineered barriers
and the wastes and the interactions of the consequent chemical 'plume' with the
rock will need to be demonstrably understood. Monitoring of the hydrochemical
disturbance caused by the excavations,such as the RCF, is of considerably
greater significance in evaluating the future behaviour of the PRZ than is
information on its undisturbed state.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><A NAME="Para10.39"></A>10.39 In addition to these points it must be
stressed that the RCF offers the only practical means to collect other

<TD WIDTH="800">Collection and long-term monitoring of inflows to the shafts
and galleries of the RCF as drawdown proceeds using specially designed sample
installations which penetrate a few metres out from the excavation disturbed
zone will provide high-quality uncontaminated samples from zones of rock or
specific features which are intersected. Monitoring of changes in water
composition of more transmissive features/regions as the drawdown progresses
will provide valuable information on flow patterns in the PRZ region. This
latter approach has been used successfully to study the impacts of major
fractures on flow and deep hydrochemistry in the &Auml;sp&ouml; underground
research laboratory in Sweden.

neighbouring volumes of rock in the BVG via sub-horizontal boreholes drilled out
into the surrounding rock. It is expected that hydrogeochemical conditions
analogous to those existing prior to disturbance by the RCF will be encountered.
It must also be borne in mind that the response time of the hydrogeochemistry to
drawdown and excavation will vary depending on the hydraulic properties of the
rock or of the feature intersected. Low transmissivity parts of the deep BVG are
expected to remain essentially unaffected chemically and be accessible for
sampling for a considerable period.

</P>
<P><B>Extent of Nirex Investigations</B>
</P>
<P>11.6 Nirex has initiated studies to evaluate the nature of the tectonic and
seismic disturbance which could affect a repository at Sellafield in accordance
with international guidelines (<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para7.21">paragraph 7.21</A>,
page 57, <B>PE/NRX/14</B>).
</P>
<P>11.7 Nirex is adopting a balanced and scientific approach to evaluating
seismicity and any associated hazard in which the scientific evidence is
assessed and subjected to wide and critical review before incorporation into our
performance assessments of the site.  We are currently obtaining reviews of
aspects of the seismicity studies from two international experts in line with
the recommendations of the Royal Society Study Group contained on page 160 of
their report [COR/605] that the work should be exposed to the widest possible
international peer review.
</P>
<P>11.8 Nirex has recently published a four volume report on the seismological
database for Sellafield {Nirex Report SA/95/003} which is referred to in

<P>11.9 In paragraph 7.2 of his evidence (PE/GNP/3), Dr Haszeldine comments on
the map presented by Nirex as Figure 6.2 in Volume 1 of Nirex Report 524
[COR/517].  Dr Haszeldine makes the comment:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;In terms of possible uplift, the most important part of this map
is the abrupt change in the orientation of uplift contours as they cross a line
running sub-parallel to the present coastline.  The only way to resolve these
changes of contour direction, is to infer that a discontinuity has occurred
between the two sets of rocks, i.e. that a fault has been active sometime during
the last 60Ma.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>11.10 Nirex has presented evidence (Nirex Report 524, Volume 1, page 38
[COR/517]) in its published discussion of Figure 6.2 that:-

<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">

<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">The change in the orientation of the contours of uplift across
the Lake District Boundary Fault Zone in south Cumbria is largely an artefact of

<TD WIDTH="800">Faulting that has been active during the past 60 million years

uplift contours.  Expulsion of warm mineralised fluids at the basin margin is a
more likely explanation for locally enhanced values of apparent uplift - and the
process is as proposed by Dr Haszeldine and others for the origin of the
hematite ore bodies of the south Cumbria area.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>11.11 Nevertheless, Dr Haszeldine associates this apparent discontinuity
with the Lake District Boundary Fault, comments that this structure is an
extensional fault and, subsequently, (paragraphs 7.5 to 7.7, PE/GNP/3) draws an
association between extensional faulting and groundwater expulsion.
</P>
<P>11.12 The evidence for regional uplift in the Lake District is not disputed.
 Nirex has presented this information in a number of reports.  However, Dr
Haszeldine fails to make the point that uplift occurred everywhere else in
Britain.  Section 6.1.4 of Volume 1 of Nirex Report 524 [COR/517] on page 37
states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Uplift at about the Cretaceous-Tertiary is ubiquitous in Britain.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>11.13 Dr Haszeldine also fails to recognise that this latest period of
movement on the Lake District Boundary Fault, would not have been extensional,
as he implies, but compressional.  This is explained on page 38 of Volume 1 of
Nirex Report 524 [COR/517] where it is stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Further evidence of basin inversion superimposed upon a broad,
regional uplift is provided by the seismic reflection data with examples of
fault reversal and local anticlinal folding.  Compression, orientated roughly
N-, is consistent with the fact that NE-trending structures, such as the
Maryport and Lagman faults, were preferentially reversed.  This resulted in
inversion of the Solway Firth Basin and northern part of the Langman Basin which
appear to have been buttressed against the Ramsay-Whitehaven Ridge.  In the
vicinity of Sellafield, any displacements on the LDBFZ would have been markedly
transpressional.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>11.14 The 'LDBFZ' is the Lake District Boundary Fault Zone. 
'Transpressional, as stated in the Glossary of Volume 1 of Nirex Report 524
[COR/517] means <I>&quot;Action of compressive stress oblique to the trend of a
fault.  Results in oblique-reverse displacement of the fault.&quot;</I>  In
other words, it is not extensional.
</P>
<P>11.15 Thus, Dr Haszeldine is being somewhat misleading in stating that the
Lake District Boundary Fault is an extensional fault.  Whilst it formed
originally in an extensional regime, it latest movements were not extensional.
</P>
<P><B>Features within the glacial sediments</B>
</P>
<P>11.16 Nirex is investigating possible neotectonic features and attempting to
distinguish such evidence from the relatively common glacitectonic structural
features due to internal deformation of the Quaternary by the movement across it
of ice sheets.  These have produced compressional and extensional dislocations. 
The section in Volume 1 of Nirex Report 524 (page 11) [COR/517] to which Dr
Haszeldine may be referring in paragraph 7.4 (page 18, PE/GNP/3) is
comprehensive and sufficient to show that we are addressing the subject and it
is not a major omission as he claims:-
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>&quot;2.5 Neotectonics and seismic hazard</B></I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Since the preparation of Nirex Report Number 263, there have been
further investigations of seismological, geophysical, geological and remotely
sensed features, to determine whether they may indicate neotectonic activity. 
In particular, potentially faulted offsets of rockhead and Quaternary sediments
have been interpreted from onshore and offshore seismic reflection data.  No
firm field evidence of neotectonic activity has been found in the onshore
district although sites which might be the most likely to reveal such evidence
have been identified for further study.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Tectonic Regime in the UK</B>
</P>
<P>11.17 Dr Haszeldine states in paragraph 7.7 (PE/GNP/3) that Britain is in an
extensional regime.  He is incorrect in this assertion.  His mistake may have
arisen from misleading statements in the references he quotes (GNP/3/7 and
GOV/613).
</P>
<P>11.18 In the 1992 HMIP Report (page 30, section 2.7.2, British Earthquakes,
paragraph 1 [GOV/613]), Dr Muir Wood is initially definitive that Britain, in
contrast to other intraplate regions, is in an extensional regime but, on
refering to section 3, the evidence for extension is admitted to be minor with
evidence for strike-slip faulting predominant (page 63, section 3.2.5
[GOV/613]).  More specifically, for western Britain, including the Sellafield
area, it is accepted that the regime is not extensional.
</P>
<P>11.19 By the early 1990's, observations of present day stress fields by
earthquake focal mechanism studies, <I>in situ</I> stress measurements and
borehole break-out analyses had shown that the European stress state was
generally not extensional, but in a similar compressional state to other
intraplate areas.  In a summary paper on &quot;Regional Patterns of Tectonic
Stress in Europe&quot;, Muller <I>et al</I>, 1992 (Figure 3, page 11,787
[NRX/14/6]) provided maps of stress indicators.  On a generalised stress map 
they classified these as compressional or extensional.  <I>&quot;Inward
directed arrows indicate the maximum horizontal compression directions in
regions of dominantly compressive stress regimes (either thrust or strike-slip
faulting).  Outward directed arrows indicate the least horizontal stress in
regions of extension.&quot;</I>  Areas of dominant extension were only present
in Italy, Greece and Turkey.  All other areas were dominantly compressional,
with a limited number of local extensional zones as in the Rhine graben and in
uplift zones following melting of thick ice sheets. Even basins formed in an
extensional regime, such as the North Sea, were generally in a situation of
present-day compression.  All but two of the many stress indicators in Britain
were compressional.  One of these extensional indicators was in eastern England
near the Wash, the other was in the SW Scottish Highlands, in the area of
maximum ice load during the Pleistocene.
</P>
<P>11.20 In the HMIP report [GOV/613] reference is made to an article (King,
page 90) on fault plane solutions for the 1979 Carlisle earthquake.  This was
not discussed in detail but is relevant to Sellafield as the nearest earthquake
of moderate size that had been instrumentally monitored in detail and results
analysed to determine the stress pattern.  One mechanism was thrust/reverse
faulting, the other mainly strike-slip, i.e. neither were extensional.  King
favoured the reverse faulting solution but later more detailed analysis by the
BGS {SA/95/003}, including the aftershock data, preferred an oblique strike slip
mechanism.
</P>
<P>11.21 Subsequently, as part of the Nirex Seismic Hazard Assessment,
[SA/95/003], the data for the 1979 Carlisle (Longtown) earthquake were
re-analysed and confirmed the strike slip solution.  Additionally, analysis of
the 1993 Grange-over-Sands earthquake, at 3.0 M<SUB>L</SUB> the largest
earthquake recorded by the BNFL/Nirex monitoring and the closest earthquake of
moderate size to Sellafield, indicated strike-slip with a small component of
reverse movement.  Such a mechanism was found to generally apply to the great
majority of earthquake fault plane solutions in the area.  Pure reverse or
normal faulting is minor and associated with the smaller earthquakes.  It was
noted ([11] p 48 paragraph 2) that:<I> &quot;At or above this magnitude (3M<SUB>L</SUB>),
focal mechanisms elsewhere in Britain invariably appear to be strike-slip&quot;</I>.
</P>
<P>11.22 Therefore, earthquake analysis confirms that the stress regime at
seismogenic depth in the Sellafield area is not extensional but generally
strike-slip and similar to that in the majority of Britain and north-west
Europe.  Thus, Dr Haszeldine is incorrect in stating that the tectonic regime in
Britain is extensional.
</P>
<P><B>Effect of Earthquakes on Groundwater</B>
</P>
<P>11.23 Dr Haszeldine (paragraph 7.5, PE/GNP/3) states that earthquakes can
pump water to the surface as a consequence of their aftermath.  He quotes
information from GNP/3/7 in support of his statements.  He then extends his
argument to the UK quoting information from GOV/613 in his paragraph 7.7.
</P>
<P>11.24 In the 1992 DoE/HMIP Report [GOV/613], Muir Wood and Woo suggest that
normal fault earthquakes can have a major effect on groundwater whereas reverse
fault earthquakes do not produce significant effects.  Strike-slip earthquakes
were found to produce a variety of responses and this was considered to be due
to the associated component of normal or reverse faulting.
</P>
<P>11.25 The relevant extract for strike-slip earthquakes is (page 16
[GOV/613]):

<P><I>2.4.1 General remarks</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>As might be predicted from the findings concerning normal and reverse
fault earthquakes, strike-slip fault displacements are found to cause a
diversity of responses.  Many strike-slip faults are accompanied by some
component of normal or reverse displacement, and it is evident that this can be
of particular importance in dictating the resulting hydrological signatures.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>11.26 Dr Haszeldine draws an analogy in paragraphs 7.5 and 7.6 (PE/GNP/3)
between the reported effects of the 1959 Hegben Lake earthquake and the 1983
Borah Peak earthquake.  His diagrams (7.5 and 7.6) both, however, refer to the
Hegben Lake event.  He does not mention that both events were large earthquakes
on normal faults in an extensional regime and were therefore not analogues for
potential effects at Sellafield.  Section 2.2 on page 5 of  GOV/613 is headed &quot;Normal
Fault Earthquakes&quot; and contains the quote:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;In the past 35 years there have been three major onland normal
fault earthquakes in countries with a well developed programme of
hydrogeological monitoring:  the two most recent large normal fault earthquakes
in the USA (the 1959/8/17 Hebgen Lake earthquake (M7.3) in Montana, and the M<SUB>s</SUB>
7.0 1983/10/28 Borah Peak earthquake 250 km away in Idaho), and the M<SUB>s</SUB>
6.9 1980/11/23 earthquake in southern Italy.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Hydrogeological effects of UK Earthquakes</B>
</P>
<P>11.27 Reference to <A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para7.14">paragraphs 7.14</A> to 7.25
of <B>PE/NRX/14</B> indicates that the seismicity of the UK is low and that
over the last few hundred years has only been subjected to moderate or small
earthquakes (up to about magnitude 5.5).  Thus, it is scientifically
questionable to suggest that the effects of a magnitude 7.3 earthquake can be
realistically mapped onto Cumbria in the way that Dr Haszeldine has sought to do
in his Figures 7.5 and 7.6 (PE/GNP/3).
</P>
<P>11.28 Dr Muir Wood and G Woo in a 1992 report for DoE/HMIP [GOV/613] stated
in the abstract that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Britain is shown to be a slowly deforming region of active crustal
extension, in which increases in springflow and rises in the water-table have
been noted following even relatively small earthquakes of the past 150 years. 
Hence earthquake-induced changes in hydrology will need to be accounted for in
estimating the performance of proposed British radioactive waste repositories.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>11.29 They applied their analysis to the Sellafield site and concluded that
([GOV/613], page 79, section 4.5.1, paragraph 5):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Hence there are tectonic arguments for suspecting that faults of
the LDBFZ may currently be active.  The hydrological signature of the 1865
Rampside earthquake provides further corroboration that at least some faults of
this system are liable to undergo shallow normal fault displacements.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and that (page 80):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;However current evidence suggests that the fault-bounded West
Cumbrian coast may be tectonically active, and that seismic pumping of
groundwater may occur around Sellafield.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>11.30 As Britain is not in an extensional regime, the claimed mechanism for
significant hydrogeological effects predicted by Dr Muir Wood's hypothesis will
not apply.  The examples he presents, [GOV/613] Appendix B, of British
earthquakes that affected the hydrogeological regime are:

Chalk rose by up to 7.5 feet in wells to 420 feet depths over periods up to 40
days following the earthquake.  The majority of changes in water level were
rises but the level fell in one well.  The widespread nature of the changes
probably does reflect earthquake strain effects on the fissured Chalk aquifer. 
The Colchester earthquake was in SE England adjacent to the southern North Sea
basin and so there could be an extensional component to the local stress regime.
 Therefore the changes to the local water table following the Colchester
earthquake probably indicate effects that would not apply to the Sellafield
area.

<P><U>Recent Review of earthquake effects on groundwater</U>
</P>
<P>11.34 A recent study (Rojstaczer, Wolf and Michel; Nature, 373, pages
237-239, 1995) has concluded that earthquakes do not expel water from depths of
several kilometres.  Instead earthquakes can cause near-surface permeability
enhancements that produce persistent and widespread changes to the groundwater. 
These include changes to the water table and groundwater outflow to streams. 
Measurement of the groundwater chemistry after earthquakes in California showed
that near surface water was involved in changes to the stream and spring flow.
</P>
<P>11.35 Inferred changes to the permeability were about one order of
magnitude.  Measurements of the permeability of all the hydrogeological units at
Sellafield have indicated a range of values over several orders of magnitude. 
Modelling of the groundwater pathway for the post-closure performance assessment
(Nirex 95 [COR/522]) has used a range of permeability values.  A general
increase of one order of magnitude in the average near surface permeability was
not found to produce significantly different results.

<P>11.37 Dr Haszeldine, by selectively quoting information from a limited
number of sources has sought to draw conclusions about the tectonics of the
Sellafield area and concerning possible impacts of earthquakes on the
hydrogeology of the area.  In doing this he has failed to take account of the
published information and has misrepresented information, for example, by
seeking to draw a comparison between large, normal fault earthquakes in the USA
and small earthquakes in the UK in a compressional stress regime.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Comparisons"></A><B>12. COMPARISONS WITH INVESTIGATION PRACTICES
ELSEWHERE.</B></P>
<P><B>Comparisons with the Oil Industry</B>
</P>
<P>12.1 Several Objectors' proofs draw comparisons between the Nirex
investigations and the practices adopted within the oil industry.  Dr Haszeldine
(PE/GNP/3, section 6, pages 15-17) draws comparisons in terms of timescale and
approach. A similar theme relating to approach to investigations is picked up by
Professor Smythe (PE/FOE/3, paragraph 7.14).
</P>
<P>12.2 Professor Smythe and Dr Haszeldine both seek to criticise the Nirex
approach to investigations claiming that it does not follow oil company practice
which they regard as a model for Nirex to emulate (PE/FOE/3, paragraphs 7.14 and
9.6; PE/GNP/3, paragraph 6.3).
</P>
<P>12.3 The first point that must be made is that Nirex is not exploring to
identify and exploit an oil deposit.  The oil industry seeks to locate oil and
gas deposits which are confined to specific locations dependent upon very
specific combinations of geological features and processes.  Nirex, on the other
hand, is exploring a specific location to determine its suitability to host a
repository.  Fluid flow technology for the oil industry tends to be aimed at
high flow rates and high permeability rocks.  Nirex, on the other hand, is
looking primarily at low flow rates in low permeability rocks.  In these
respects, the oil industry is not a direct analogy to the work being undertaken
by Nirex.
</P>
<P>12.4 Nevertheless, the Nirex approach has drawn on a wide range of expertise
and experience from the hydrocarbons industry, notably through such contractors
as British Geological Survey, GeoScience Ltd, J. Arthur and Associates Ltd,
Schlumberger GeoQuest Ltd and others, all with direct experience of working in
the hydrocarbons industry.  Meetings have been held with both Shell and BP to
exchange technical knowledge and experience, and this information exchange
continues.
</P>
<P>12.5 At paragraph 6.7 of his evidence (Pages 16-17, PE/GNP/3), Dr Haszeldine
states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Choice of site and Planning Application for the RCF could be
considered analogous to deciding to proceed with oil field development in a
particular location.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>12.6 The only decision Nirex has made is to apply to construct an RCF.  In
terms of the exploration analogy that Dr Haszeldine persists with, this may be
seen as just another tool for obtaining data and testing predictions analogous
to the change in the hydrocarbons industry from drilling exploration wells to an
appraisal well - it is definitely not analogous to a decision to proceed with
the development of an oil field.  This would be equivalent to commencement of
construction of a repository and first oil would be equivalent to first waste
emplacement in a repository.
</P>
<P>12.7 Dr Haszeldine's presentation of the Nirex programme is wrong (his
Figure 6.7, PE/GNP/3).  He shows the boreholes starting in late 1992.  The
borehole drilling started with Borehole 1 in mid 1989.  The RCF programme
described by Dr Haszeldine is not the same as that presented as
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A> in Dr Mellor's
evidence (<B>PE/NRX/16</B>).  Dr Mellor shows the RCF programme commencing in
mid 1996, seven years after the start of drilling as compared to the 15 months
shown by Dr Haszeldine.  Dr Mellor shows the RCF science programme completed in
early 2006; Dr Haszeldine shows it to be completed by the end of 2001.  The
programme shown by Dr Haszeldine for the development of a complex or difficult
oil field concludes with first oil production some 18 years after start of work.
 The equivalent end point for the Nirex programme is first waste emplacement in
a repository.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#Para9.22">paragraph 9.22</A>, page 61) states that
this may be possible in the first half of 2011.  Mr Folger's supplementary proof
(<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12s1.htm#Para4.3">paragraph 4.3</A>, page 8, <B>PE/NRX/12/S1</B>)
presents a revised programme indicating the earliest date for first waste
emplacement as the first half of 2012.  This is 23 years after start of
drilling.  This is longer than the 18 years quoted by Dr Haszeldine for an
oilfield and substantially longer than the 9.25 years he shows in his Figure 6.7
(PE/GNP/3) for the <I>'Nirex drilling plan'</I>.
</P>
<P>12.8 Detailed examination of the Nirex investigation programme reveals close
similarities with the practice in the hydrocarbons industry.  The adoption of a
progressive, step-wise methodology from the regional reconnaissance scale
towards the District and then the Site and finally the PRZ is a clear example.
</P>
<P>12.9 The acquisition of seismic reflection data similarly followed standard
exploration procedures.  Hydrocarbon exploration normally begins with wide
ranging 2-D seismic reflection surveys and exploratory drilling, moving later,
where justified, to development drilling and, in many, but by no means all
cases, to targeted 3-D seismic surveys.
