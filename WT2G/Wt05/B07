<H3>From the Director of CSAP...</H3>
<P> The link between alcohol and other drug (AOD) abuse and child abuse is apparent.  Adults who abuse AOD are more likely than others to physically, sexually, or emotionally abuse their children.  And tragically, those abused as children are more likely to grow up and similarly abuse these substances.  Without intervention, the cycle can be unending.</P>

This resource guide provides information that will greatly assist prevention specialists, educators, and policymakers in their understanding and interactions with children and adults who are involved in a child abuse situation.  I hope the resources provided in this guide will help us put an end to the heart-rending problem of child abuse in this country.<BR>

<B>Infants of Drug Addicts:  At Risk for Child Abuse, Neglect, and Placement in Foster Care <BR>
<I>Regan, D. O.; Ehrlich, S. M.; and Finnegan, L. P. </I></B><BR>
<I>Neurotoxicology and Teratology </I>9(4):315-319, 1987
<BLOCKQUOTE>In a methadone maintenance program for pregnant, drug dependent women, an investigation was undertaken to:  (1) study the occurrence of violence experienced by the women as children and as adults; and (2) learn whether those who report past violence/abuse are more likely to neglect and/or abandon their children to the care of others.  Subjects included 178 drug-dependent women who completed a Violence Questionnaire and 70 comparable, but drug-free women.  Results revealed that a history of violence or abuse is related to drug abuse and also to the placement of one's own child(ren) in foster care.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Crack and Fatal Child Abuse <BR>
<I>Press, S. </I></B><BR>
<I>JAMA:  Journal of the American Medical Association </I>260(21):3132, 1988
<BLOCKQUOTE>The incidence of child abuse and neglect is known to be higher in families in which parents or caretakers are alcoholics or narcotic addicts. This child abuse is often fatal. Several instances of fatal child abuse as a result of parental crack use are reported. This is one small segment of the enormous, devastating impact that crack has on society.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Adult Self-Injury as a Survival Response in Victim-Survivors of Childhood Abuse <BR>
<I>Wise, M. L. </I></B><BR>
In <I>Aggression, Family Violence and Chemical Dependency,</I> R. T. Potter-Efron and P. S. Potter-Efron, Eds., pp. 185-202. Binghamton, NY:  The Haworth Press, Inc., 1990 <BR>
(Available from The Haworth Press, Inc., 10 Alice Street, Binghamton, NY 13904-1580.) 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The presence of adult self-injury is often listed as a descriptive indicator for a history of childhood sexual or physical abuse. There is a clear overlap between families in which both chemical dependency and sexual abuse occur.  A predominant dynamic for both problems is the shame-bound family system.  The author presents a therapeutic perspective of adult self-injury as a coded survival response to childhood abuse in which shame, denial, and self-injury are intricately interwoven.  Specific messages in self-injury and therapeutic responses to self-injury are discussed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Education of the Adolescent Chemical Dependence Worker in the Field of Child Abuse <BR>
<I>Schiff, M. M., and Cavaiola, A. A. </I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Adolescent Chemical Dependency </I>1(3):  3-11, 1991 
<BLOCKQUOTE>A review was conducted by the program's chief psychologist and consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist, in order to determine areas of knowledge gaps in the certified chemical dependence counselors and trainees toward abused adolescents.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Molested as Children:  A Hidden Contribution to Substance Abuse? <BR>
<I>Rohsenow, D.J.; Corbett, R.; and  Devine, D. </I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment </I>5(1):13-18, 1988
<BLOCKQUOTE>The prevalence of childhood sexual victimization among substance abusers in Maine was investigated.  A sample of inpatient substance abusers was systematically questioned about childhood sexual experiences several times during their treatment program.  The rates of childhood sexual abuse reported before and after routine questioning were compared.  The results indicate that before routine questioning, 4 percent of the men and 20 percent of the women revealed such abuse.  After routine questioning began, the rates for adult men quadrupled; up to 42 percent of teenaged boys, 71 to 90 percent of teenaged girls, and approximately 75 percent of adult women reported such abuse.  It is suggested that unresolved issues from childhood sexual abuse may influence much substance abuse and, if not treated, may be responsible, at least in part, for relapse.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Relationship Between Physical and Sexual Abuse and Tobacco, Alcohol, and Illicit Drug Use among Youths in a Juvenile Detention Center <BR>
<I>Dembo, R.; Dertke, M.; Borders, S.; Washburn, M.; and Schmeidler, J. </I></B><BR>
<I>International Journal of the Addictions </I>23(4):351-378, 1988
<BLOCKQUOTE>Relationships between child physical and sexual abuse and tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use by children were investigated.  The youths interviewed were a systematically selected cohort of detainees housed at a detention center between mid-June and the end of September 1984.  Beginning on July 2, every status offender detained (by court orders for truancy, for being a runaway, or for being ungovernable) in the detention facility for more than 96 hours was interviewed, and a same-gender juvenile delinquent (awaiting adjudication on criminal charges) case, who had entered the facility on the same day, was randomly selected to be interviewed.  The results support the proposition that child abuse is highly related to high rates of illicit drug use only.  It is noted that Blacks claim less involvement in tobacco use, alcohol use, and illicit drug use than non-Black youths and this finding appears to reflect a true difference, rather than response bias.  No significant ethnic group differences were found in physical abuse, sexual victimization, and the experience of various emotional/psychological problems. However, the dynamics of the relationship between child abuse and illicit drug use or other delinquent behavior remain to be explained.  It is suggested that causal analyses based on longitudinal data sets are needed to develop more explanatory models of various developmental outcomes for youth who were abused as children.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Survey of the Prevalence of Childhood Sexual Victimization among 18-21 Year Old College Students and Its Relationship to Alcohol Abuse and Bulimia <BR>
<I>Preuss, N.L. </I></B><BR>
<I>Dissertation Abstracts International </I>48(12):3693-B, 1988
<BLOCKQUOTE>This study assessed the prevalence of childhood sexual abuse within a cohort of 18- to 21-year-old male and female college students.  It also investigated the relationship between childhood sexual victimization and current alcohol abuse and between childhood sexual abuse and current bulimic eating behaviors.  Volunteer subjects for this project were college students enrolled in introductory social science classes at Chadron State College, Nebraska; the University of Northern Colorado; and at the University of New Mexico.  A modified version of a sexual history questionnaire developed by Finkelhor, the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test, and questions developed to assess bulimia were completed by 690 students who met the age criteria.  Males and females were compared on the categories of:  (1) prevalence of sexual abuse by relatives and nonrelatives, (2) relationship of sexual abuse to alcohol abuse, and (3) relationship of sexual abuse to bulimia.  It was found that a substantially greater number of females were sexually abused, both by relatives and nonrelatives.  Alcohol abuse was found to be related to sexual abuse for males, but not for females.  A relationship was also found between alcohol abuse and bulimic behaviors for females when less stringent criteria were used for bulimia.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Public Policy Issues Relevant to Children of Alcoholics <BR>
<I>Blume, S.B. </I></B><BR>
<I>Advances in Alcohol & Substance Abuse </I>6(4):5-15, 1987
<BLOCKQUOTE>A brief overview of public policy related to alcohol problems is presented.  Issues having special relevance to children of alcoholics are discussed including:  prevention (identification of subjects at risk, public recommendations about drinking and pregnancy, child abuse and neglect); treatment (reaching treatment professionals, parental consent, confidentiality, third-party coverage, early intervention); and research.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>The Alcoholism Treatment Client and Domestic Violence <BR>
<I>Harner, I.C. </I></B><BR>
<I>Alcohol Health & Research World </I>12(2):150-152, 160, 1988<BR>
(Available from the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information, P.O. Box 2345, Rockville, MD  20847-2345; 800-729-6686.) 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Findings on the occurrence of domestic violence among alcoholism treatment clients are discussed.  It has been said that the family is one of the most violent groups in our society and considerable evidence supports the theory that aggressive behavior increases with alcohol abuse, particularly among males.  A questionnaire, directed to therapists, alcoholic patients, and the general public, revealed differences in opinion about what constituted abuse, with 12 percent of patients believing that abuse cannot be sexual and 9 percent believing that abuse cannot be physical.  In defining physical abuse, the patient population included fewer activities than either the public or the therapists.  In fact, over 25 percent of the patients did not classify neglect as a form of child abuse; 50 percent of the men indicated they had been spanked or beaten as children.  The survey showed that 41 percent of the public, 48.7 percent of the patients, and 51.1 percent of the therapists had been abused at some time.  While 20 percent of the public indicated they were children of alcoholics, almost 50 percent of the patients and therapists indicated that at least one parent was alcoholic.  The survey also revealed that almost 40 percent of therapists believed that reported suspected abuse would have a negative effect on the patient-therapist relationship and that almost 50 percent of therapists never reported abuse of any kind.  To provide information for reporting and referral, substance abuse treatment agencies may enter into a Qualified Service Organization Agreement with child abuse protective agencies and domestic violence programs.  This legal mechanism may be the single most important factor in reaching into abuse situations in which alcohol or other drug use is involved.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Complying with Mandated Child Protective Reporting:  A Challenge for Treatment Professionals <BR>
<I>Bromley, M.A., and Riolo, J.A. </I></B><BR>
<I>Alcoholism Treatment Quarterly </I>5(3/4):83-96, 1988
<BLOCKQUOTE>Most practitioners are keenly aware of the need to protect the confidentiality of their patients.  This is of particular importance for practitioners working with alcohol and drug abuse patients due in large part to the strong Federal regulations protecting the confidentiality of alcohol and drug abuse patient records.  However, a challenge to confidentiality can result when there is an overriding need to protect the safety of others.  This is especially true when an instance of suspected child abuse or neglect arises and the patient is in treatment for an alcohol or drug abuse problem.  This article presents a model for providing optimal protection for both children and their suspected abusers.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Neglect Contributing to Tertiary Hospitalization in Childhood Asthma <BR>
<I>Boxer, G.H.; Carson, J.; and Miller, B.D. </I></B><BR>
<I>Child Abuse & Neglect </I>12:491-501, 1988
<BLOCKQUOTE>A study was conducted to substantiate the degree to which family dysfunction and neglect contribute to the necessity for hospitalization of asthmatic children at a tertiary care hospital in Denver.  Data were gathered from the multidisciplinary psychosocial team on two samples of children on the pediatric unit and an inpatient medical/psychiatric unit, during two periods. Included was information in such areas as parental alcoholism or drug use; evidence or suspicion of physical, emotional, or sexual abuse; parental neglect; &quotchaotic&quot functioning; and court intervention.  Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) scores were also obtained.  Using that measure, a psychologic morbidity was found to be associated with medical neglect.  Alcoholism or drug use was found in one or both parents of 9 of 93 patients (10 percent) of the pediatric unit, whereas it was affirmed in 46 of the 127 patients (36 percent) from the psychiatric unit. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Risk Factors for Substance Abuse in Native American Boarding Schools <BR>
<I>Matthews, R.D. </I></B><BR>
<I>Dissertation Abstracts International </I>50(3):1115-B, 1989
<BLOCKQUOTE>The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for substance abuse within a population of Native American boarding school students.  A comparative study was conducted with approximately 300 boarding school youths at a Native American boarding school, who ranged in age from 14 to 20. Subjects were divided into two groups:  Low use of alcohol and drugs, and high use of alcohol and drugs. The following items were compared between the groups:  presence of alcoholic parents or significant others; self-esteem; age of first exposure; stability of the family unit; violence in the environment or family; physical and sexual abuse or child neglect; employment status of the family; tribal affiliation and cultural tradition; and suicidal thoughts or actual suicide reported within the family or among peers.  Dysfunctional environments, including parental role models, were determining influences on the use of substances by the Native American youths surveyed.  In particular, tendency toward alcoholic consumption and drinking styles are transmitted generationally.  Those reporting usage at the earliest ages continued to broaden their experimentation and regular usage of substances until a wide variety of substances were involved.   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Prevalence of Childhood Physical Abuse in Adult Male Veteran Alcoholics <BR>
<I>Schaefer, M.R.; Sobieraj,  K.; and Hollyfield, R.L. </I></B><BR>
<I>Child Abuse and Neglect </I>12(2):141-149, 1988
<BLOCKQUOTE>This study was conducted in order to determine the prevalence of physical abuse during childhood in a sample of male alcoholics who were inpatients in a Veterans Administration hospital alcoholism treatment program and to determine whether any significant differences existed in the alcoholism and the psychological profiles of abused and nonabused alcoholics. The subjects of the study were a random sample of 100 adult male alcoholics in the treatment program who had been diagnosed on the basis of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Edition</I>(DSM-III), American Psychiatric Association, criteria. Subjects were administered a self-report questionnaire relating to childhood physical abuse in addition to the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST), the Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire (SADQ), and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R).  About one- third of the subjects reported having been physically abused during childhood. No differences were discovered between abused and nonabused alcoholics with respect to alcoholism profiles, but abused alcoholics were found to have more severe psychological symptoms and distress than those who were not abused.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Profile of Abused and Neglected American Indian Children in the Southwest <BR>
<I>Lujan, C.; DeBruyn, L.M.; May, P.A.; and Bird, M.E. </I></B><BR>
<I>Child Abuse and Neglect </I>13(4):449-461, 1989
<BLOCKQUOTE>Child abuse and neglect among Indian tribes in a southwestern State are described.  The study sample includes 53 children seen at a local Indian Health Service Hospital in the period from 1982 through 1985, whose clinic and hospital records were analyzed in addition to interviews with local community health care providers and tribal officials.  The results of the study revealed that child abuse and neglect occurred simultaneously in 65 percent of the sample, with alcohol abuse being present in 85 percent of the neglect cases and in 63 percent of the abuse cases.  It is noted that child abuse and neglect are part of the phenomenon of multiproblem families.  It is concluded that interagency cooperation is required for surveillance, treatment, and prevention of these problems.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Role of Childhood Sexual Abuse in the Development of Alcoholism in Women <BR>
<I>Miller, B.A.; Downs, W.R.; Gondoli, D.M.; and Keil, A. </I></B><BR>
<I>Violence and Victims </I>2(3):157-172, 1987
<BLOCKQUOTE>The effects of childhood sexual abuse on the development of alcoholism were analyzed.  The study group included 45 alcoholic women and a group of 40 nonalcoholic women who responded to face-to-face interviews.  Sexual abuse was defined as any unwanted sexual contact with a person at least 5 years older than the respondent or with any family relative. The study results revealed an increase in sexual abuse, in different kinds of sexual abuse, and longer duration of sexual abuse in alcoholic women.  The alcoholic women also reported an increase in parental alcohol- related problems, although the sexual abuse was rarely done by a parent. However, it is concluded that the vulnerability to sexual abuse is increased in homes where parental problem drinking exists.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Black Adolescent Alcohol Abusers:  Severity of Alcohol Use, History of Child Abuse, and Current Level of Depression <BR>
<I>London, D.P. </I></B><BR>
<I>Dissertation Abstracts International </I>50(10):3188-A, 1990
<BLOCKQUOTE>This study examined the interrelationships among alcohol use, child abuse, and depression among Black adolescent problem drinkers.  The subjects were 30 females and 30 males who were patients at an alcohol abuse outpatient clinic.  They completed protocols eliciting data on substance use, depression and violence, all of which were part of the clinical intake procedure. Statistical analyses included t-tests, Pearson product moment correlation coefficients and multiple regression. Several hypotheses were tested:  first, most adolescents would have a history of child abuse victimization; second, that the greater the severity of problem drinking, the greater the extent of child abuse; third, that sexually abused girls would have a greater degree of problem drinking than non-sexually abused girls; and fourth, that there would be a strong positive relationship between severity of alcohol abuse and incidence of family violence.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Childhood Antecedents of Antisocial Behavior:  Parental Alcoholism and Physical Abusiveness <BR>
<I>Pollock, V.E.; Briere, J.; Schneider, L.; Knop, J.; Mednick, S.A.; and Goodwin, D.W. </I></B><BR>
<I>American Journal of Psychiatry </I>147(10):1290-1293, 1990
<BLOCKQUOTE>Hierarchical logistic regression was used to assess the independent and interactive effects of paternal alcoholism and physical child abuse on antisocial behavior in young adult men. Men with alcoholic fathers (N=131) did not exhibit more antisocial behavior than comparison subjects (N=70).  Men with physical abuse histories, however, reported more aggressive and antisocial behavior during a clinical interview and were rated by a clinical interviewer as more likely to act out aggression. Arrest records did not distinguish the groups.  There was no evidence that paternal alcoholism and childhood victimization interacted to increase the risk of antisocial behavior.</BLOCKQUOTE>

In <I>Handbook of Family Violence,</I> V.B. VanHasselt, R.L. Morrison, A.S. Bellack, and M. Hersen, Eds., pp. 383-406. New York:  Plenum Press, 1990
<BLOCKQUOTE>Survey research concerning child abuse and marital violence is reviewed along with analog studies of alcohol and aggression that are related to family violence. Headings within this review of the literature include:  (1) child abuse; (2) wife abuse; (3) alcohol and laboratory aggression; and (4) alcohol, alcoholism, and family interactions.  It is suggested that alcohol abuse is only weakly involved with child abuse and is limited to a certain subgroup of abusers or types of abuse.  On the other hand, men who abuse their wives appear to be men who are frequently drunk, with violence and intoxication occurring simultaneously.  Analog studies suggest that alcohol consumption can lead to increases in aggressive behaviors that appear to be related to violence.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Alcohol and Family Violence:  Then and Now. Who Owns the Problem <BR>
<I>Flanzer, J.P. </I></B><BR>
In <I>Aggression, Family Violence and Chemical Dependency, </I>R.T. Potter-Efron and P.S. Potter-Efron, Eds., pp. 61-79. Washington, DC:  Catholic University, 1989
<BLOCKQUOTE>The author explores why family violence has emerged as a social problem and scrutinizes the association of child/ spouse abuse and alcoholism based on a literature review.  Three areas of change and development have heightened and highlighted interest in alcohol and family violence among both professionals and public:  (1) public policy; (2) prevalence of alcohol misuse and (3) portrait and/or behavioral styles of the joint appearance of family violence and alcoholism.  A historical involvement of the medical, legal and mental health fields with this topic are examined.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Adult Survivors of Childhood Sexual Abuse and Other Consequences <BR>
<I>Russell, S.A., and Wilsnack, S. </I></B><BR>
In <I>Alcohol and Drugs are Women's Issues:  Volume One. A Review of Issues, </I>P. Roth, Ed., pp. 61-70. Metuchen, NJ:  Scarecrow Press, 1991 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The authors explore the role of childhood sexual abuse in the development of substance abuse.  Topics covered include the prevalence of sexual abuse; definition of sexual abuse; who the abused are according to gender, race, social class and ethnicity; consequences of sexual abuse in childhood for adult women; effects on future substance abuse; and how women's centers can help adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse.  Three suggestions are made in this context:  (1) staff members of women's centers should not feel that they must diagnose and treat the effects of childhood sexual abuse themselves since it requires professional training, (2) women should be educated regarding sexual abuse, and (3) services should be offered that are specific to adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse out of the women's center itself, if possible.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Linkages:  Battering, Sexual Assault, Incest, Child Sexual Abuse, Teen Pregnancy, Dropping Out of School and the Drug and Alcohol Connection <BR>
<I>Reed, B.G. </I></B><BR>
In <I>Alcohol and Drugs are Women's Issues:  Volume One. A Review of Issues, </I>P. Roth, Ed., pp. 130-149. Metuchen, NJ:  Scarecrow Press, 1991 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Linkages are explored between battering, sexual assault, incest, child sexual abuse, teen pregnancy, dropping out of school and alcohol and other drug abuse.  A case study of a battered woman is presented who has drug and alcohol problems and has experienced battery, sexual assault, incest, child sexual abuse, pregnancy in teens, dropping out of school and currently living in a shelter home.  Using this case study, the concepts of gender roles and stereotypes, and gender-related societal status are explained.  The author also discusses research data, methodology, linkages and interrelationships in each of these problem areas.  Three general types of theories and data which stress the role of alcohol and other drug related problems in the development of other physical and behavioral problems are described.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Undetected Abuse Among Intensive Case Management Clients <BR>
<I>Rose, S.M.; Peabody, C.G; and Stratigeas, B. </I></B><BR>
<I>Hospital and Community Psychiatry </I>42(5):499-502, 1991 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The prevalence of physical and sexual abuse was determined in a series of 89 consecutive male and female adults referred to an intensive case management program.  Clients were interviewed using structured questions about parental alcoholism, sexual or physical abuse during childhood and adulthood, history of self- mutilation and substance abuse, and the attention given to these factors by previous mental health care providers.  Fifty percent of the subjects were children of alcoholics and 34 percent were childhood sexual abuse victims.  The incidence of every type of abuse (incest, sexual, physical abuse in childhood or adulthood) was significantly higher among clients with alcoholic parents than those without alcoholic parents. Substance abuse was reported by 50 percent of all subjects and by 75 percent of children of alcoholics.  Parental alcoholism was also correlated with self-mutilation and heavy use of mental health services.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Substance Abuse and Serious Child Mistreatment:  Prevalence, Risk, and Outcome in a Court Sample <BR>
<I>Murphy, J.M.; Jellinek, M.; Quinn, D.; Smith, G.; Poitrast, F.G.; and Goshko, M. </I></B><BR>
<I>Child Abuse and Neglect </I>15(3):197-211, 1991
<BLOCKQUOTE>The relationship between substance abuse and serious child mistreatment was studied, with a focus on prevalence, risk and outcome.  The research sample included cases drawn from consecutive referrals to the Boston Juvenile Court from 1985-1986.  The study results revealed that in 43 percent of the cases, at least one parent misused either drugs or alcohol, with alcohol, cocaine, and heroin mentioned most frequently.  Those parents who abused alcohol or other drugs were most likely to have multiple referrals to child protective agencies, to present a high risk to their children; to reject court-ordered services, and ultimately to have their children removed permanently.  It is concluded that increased screening, evaluation, and treatment of parental substance abuse is of vital importance to abused children.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Effect of Response to Father-Daughter Incest on Psychological Well-Being among Alcoholic and Non-Alcoholic Women</B><BR>
<I>Dissertation Abstracts International </I>51(12):6114-B, 1991. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>A total of 122 adult female survivors of father (or father- figure)-daughter incest who responded to a set of questionnaires constituted the sample.  Although differences in response patterns did not exist between alcoholic and non-alcoholic survivors, the findings strongly suggest that survivors often use alcohol and other drugs as an attempt to cope with feelings and memories of incest.  Parental substance abuse was found to be quite high in families where incest takes place. Certain response patterns to the incest were found to be related to psychological well-being.  The ability to have resolved one's feelings about the incest was significantly related to experiencing lower levels of psychological distress. Current attribution of self- blame, current disconfirmation/ transformation of the incest, the ability to have made sense of the incest, were not significantly related to psychological distress.  The use of repression as a psychological defense against the incest was quite common among the survivors.  The findings strongly suggest that when repression begins to break down, survivors often experience  high levels of psychological distress.  The findings suggest that the healing process from incest may be a long and complex one.   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Child Maltreatment and Alcohol Abuse:  Comparisons and Perspectives for Treatment<BR>
<I>Bavolek, S. J., and Henderson, H. L.</I></B><BR>
In <I>Aggression, Family Violence and Chemical Dependency, </I>R.T. Potter-Effron, and P.S. Potter-Effron, Eds., pp. 165-184. Binghamton, NY:  Haworth Press, Inc.
<BLOCKQUOTE>This chapter identifies indicators of child abuse and neglect, discusses similarities between child abusers and alcohol abusers, and considers treatment approaches. Parents who abuse their children display inappropriate expectations of their children; are unable to be empathetically aware of their children's needs; and have a strong belief in punishment. Child abusers and alcohol abusers are similar:  the need to control and blame others; confusion about their roles and the roles of their family members; poor perception of their actions; violent family backgrounds; and poor impulse control. Professionals who treat alcohol abusers should be aware that child abuse may also occur in the family. Treatment must address both child abuse and alcohol abuse and involve the entire family to eliminate family dysfunction and teach new behaviors and roles.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Chemical Dependency in Women:  A Description of Its Effects and Outcome on Adequate Parenting<BR>
<I>Davis, S. K.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment </I>7(4):225-232, 1990
<BLOCKQUOTE>This article defines chemical dependency in women as a maladaptive response to inadequate upbringing. The situational and psychological variables that characterize chemically dependent women are described, focusing on childhood traumas and socioeconomic and pregnancy issues. The attributes that these women lack that are necessary for effective parenting are discussed, including positive self-concepts, high levels of frustration tolerance, and adaptive attitudes. In addition, the dysfunctional child rearing patterns and the consequential outcome for children are examined, and suggestions for clinical intervention are offered.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Health Risk Behaviors and Attempted Suicide in Adolescents Who Report Prior Maltreatment<BR>
<I>Riggs, S.; Alario, A. J.; and  McHorney, C.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Pediatrics </I>116(5):815-821, 1990
<BLOCKQUOTE>This article presents a study that tested the hypothesis that high school students who experienced prior maltreatment would be more likely than their peers to report health risk behaviors and suicide attempts. Before the establishment of a high-school-based clinic, an anonymous needs assessment survey was completed by 600 adolescents in grades 9 to 12. Sociodemographic information was obtained and questions were asked about physical and sexual abuse, health- related behaviors and habits, and suicide attempts. Results indicate that 13 percent of the adolescents had been maltreated; 5.2 percent reported prior physical abuse; 5.4 percent sexual abuse; and 2.7 percent both physical and sexual abuse. Multivariate statistical techniques were used to clarify how previous abuse was related to adolescent risk-taking behaviors and suicide. Students with a history of physical abuse were 3 times more likely than nonabused peers to drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes, almost twice as likely to use illicit drugs, 6 times more likely to self-induce vomiting, and 5 times more likely to attempt suicide. These data on a nonclinical, nondeviant population of adolescents indicate that physical or sexual abuse in childhood may have a significant impact on adolescent health risk behaviors and suicide attempts.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>The Relationship Between Sexual Abuse and Substance Abuse among Psychiatrically Hospitalized Adolescents<BR>
<I>Singer, M. I.; Petchers, M. K.; and Hussey, D.</I></B><BR>
<I>Child Abuse and Neglect </I>13(3):319-325, 1989
<BLOCKQUOTE>A comparative study using matched samples was conducted to investigate the relationship between sexual abuse and substance abuse. The sample included 48 adolescent psychiatric inpatients who had been sexually abused and 48 psychiatric inpatients without a known history of such abuse matched by age, race, sex, and primary psychiatric diagnosis. Statistically significant differences emerged between the groups in several areas. Abuse group subjects indicated more regular use of cocaine and stimulants, greater frequencies of alcohol and drug use, and more reported drunkenness and times high on drugs than their control group counterparts. Explanations of the association between substance abuse and sexual victimization are explored. Discussion suggests the possibility of earlier coping strategies being related to later chemical use patterns. Implications for services delivery are offered. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Self-Esteem in Abused Chemically Dependent Adolescents<BR>
<I>Cavaiola, A. A., and Schiff, M.</I></B><BR>
<I>Child Abuse and Neglect </I>13(3):327-334, 1989
<BLOCKQUOTE>In a random sample of 500 admissions to a residential treatment center for chemically dependent adolescents, 150 cases of physical and sexual abuse had been identified. These adolescents were matched for age, race, and socioeconomic status, with two comparison groups:  a group of nonabused, chemically dependent adolescents and a group of nonabused, nonchemically dependent adolescents. Self-esteem was measured, utilizing the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale (TSCS), which was administered to all subjects. Abused, chemically dependent adolescents demonstrated significantly lower self-esteem on all subscales when analyzed against these two comparison groups. There were negligible differences within the abused group when the TSCS scores were analyzed according to type of abuse. Aggressive, physically abused adolescents scored higher on the physical self subscale and the incest group scored significantly lower on the identity subscales. These results suggest that abuse is equally devastating, regardless of the type of abuse, and has a long- lasting impact on self-esteem.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Triple Jeopardy. Child Abuse, Drug Abuse, and the Minority Client<BR>
<I>Thomas, J. N.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Interpersonal Violence </I>4(3):351-355, 1989
<BLOCKQUOTE>This commentary examines the problems of drug abuse and child abuse. Data are limited on the relationship between child abuse and drug abuse. Despite the lack of hard data on incidence and interrelationship, it can be assumed that the two problems are strongly correlated and that they both may be caused by poverty, a problem that affects minorities disproportionately. As a result of poverty, drug abuse and trafficking, and rejection of parental responsibilities become acceptable behavior. No single or simple solution exists, but social service professionals can educate themselves about the extent of the drug abuse-child abuse problem, educate themselves about the history of minority groups, meet in think-tank forums to identify and devise effective strategies for child protective service agencies, and be careful to avoid stigmatizing minority clients further by sharing in their hopelessness.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Physical Abuse, Sexual Victimization, and Illicit Drug Use:  Replication of a Structural Analysis Among a New Sample of High-Risk Youths<BR>
<I>Dembo, R.; Williams, L.; La Voie, L.; and Berry, E.; et al.</I></B><BR>
<I>Violence and Victims </I>4(2):121-138 1989
<BLOCKQUOTE>This study, based on a sample of 399 high-risk youths, replicates a structural model that specified the influence of child physical and sexual abuse on self-derogation and drug use. Results suggest that, for male and female youths, physical abuse and sexual victimization had a direct effect on self-derogation and illicit drug use, and an indirect effect on drug use that was mediated by self-derogation. Moreover, structural coefficients for the model were found to be identical across gender. Subsequent analyses demonstrated the equivalence of the structural model of child physical and sexual abuse on drug use across this cohort and an earlier cohort of high-risk youth. Implications for the identification and treatment of youths in high-risk groups are discussed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Effects of the Current Drug Epidemic on Children:  A Critical Need for National Data<BR>
<I>Tatara, T.</I></B><BR>
<I>Protecting Children </I>6(4)15-19, 23 1989-1990
<BLOCKQUOTE>This article identifies four key data items that can be routinely used by State child welfare agencies to collect statistics for infants and children affected by parental and caretaker substance abuse. The four data items are:  counts of drug-exposed infants referred to the child protective services (CPS) system; counts of drug-exposed infants placed in substitute care; counts of children in families of substance-abusing parents or caretakers referred to the CPS system; and counts of children placed in substitute care due to parental or caretaker substance abuse, regardless of whether the parent or caretaker substance abuse was given as the primary reason for substitute care placement. Ways in which these data items can be incorporated into the public child welfare information systems are discussed. The paper also examines the magnitude of the current drug crisis, with a particular focus on its effects on children. Guidelines for dealing with these technical issues are presented.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Drug Abuse and Child Maltreatment:  A Clear and Present Danger<BR>
<I>Thomas, J. N.</I></B><BR>
<I>Protecting Children </I>6(4)4-8, 11, Winter 1989-1990<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This article examines the scope of the problem of alcohol and other drug abuse and child abuse, identifies critical public policy issues that address the drug problem, and presents intervention and prevention strategies. It is argued that, because the relationship between alcohol and other drug abuse and child abuse is complex and there is no single approach to eradicate the problem, it is critical for key professionals to formulate public policies that will enhance programs for children of chemically dependent parents. Public policies are proposed in the areas of prevention, education, treatment, and research. Prevention strategies are advocated that address systematic changes in institutions such as schools, churches, governmental agencies, and businesses to provide support for children and families who are most at risk.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Substance Abuse and Child Abuse. NCPCA Fact Sheet No. 14</B><BR>
Fact sheet. National Committee for Prevention of Child Abuse, Chicago, IL, February 1989.
<BLOCKQUOTE>This fact sheet examines the relationship between substance abuse and child maltreatment. Research in this area is reviewed:  there is little concrete evidence to suggest that one behavior is the primary cause of the other, but it is apparent that alcohol can act as a psychological disinhibitor, making it easier for child abuse to occur; drug or alcohol dependency frequently coexists in families involved in child abuse; and histories of alcoholic and abusive parents indicate that both lacked parental nurturing and appropriate modeling and often were reared in disruptive homes. The impact of drug or alcohol use by pregnant women on infants is also discussed. Studies demonstrating that children of alcoholics are at high risk for a multitude of social and behavioral problems and are themselves at risk for substance abuse are mentioned with some facts on the generational cycle of chemical abuse and child abuse. Suggestions are offered on prevention efforts involving education, direct services to children and parents, and education of professionals about the links between substance abuse and child abuse.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This chapter on maltreating parents who are substance abusers clarifies the terms used in discussing individuals who abuse drugs or alcohol, explains the impact of various substances on the individual, and describes the characteristics of drug and alcohol abusers. The relationship between parental drug and alcohol abuse and child maltreatment is examined, and findings associated with maternal abuse of drugs and alcohol are outlined. Guidelines for intervention with and assessment of substance- abusing parents are offered. Treatment approaches available to substance abusers are discussed, including detoxification treatment, inpatient rehabilitation treatment, methadone maintenance programs, outpatient individual treatment, group counseling and activities, family therapy, and social support programs. In addition, intervention with maltreated children and collaboration between substance abuse and child abuse agencies are considered. </BLOCKQUOTE>

In <I>Annual Progress in Child Psychiatry and Child Development 1987,</I> S. Chess, A. Thomas, and M. Hertzig, Eds., pp. 555-584.  New York:  Brunner/Mazel, 1988
<BLOCKQUOTE>This article reviews studies that have tried to confirm empirically the effects of child sexual abuse cited in the clinical literature. In regard to initial effects, empirical studies have indicated reactions, in at least some portion of the victim population, of fear, anxiety, depression, anger and hostility, aggression, sexually inappropriate behavior, feelings of isolation and stigma, poor self-esteem, difficulty in trusting others, a tendency toward revictimization, substance abuse, and sexual maladjustment. Kinds of abuse that appear to be most damaging, according to the empirical studies, are experiences involving father figures, genital contact, and force. The controversy over the impact of child sexual abuse is discussed, and recommendations for future research efforts are suggested.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Complexities of Alcoholic and Abusive Families<BR>
<I>Ackerman, R.J.</I></B><BR>
<I>Focus on Chemically Dependent Families </I>11(3):15, June-July 1988
<BLOCKQUOTE>This short article examines the issues of alcoholic families, arguing that any alcoholic family is abusive because alcoholism is an abuse in itself. Correlations between alcohol abuse and family abuse are discussed. Seven general problems found in most abusive families are outlined:  parent's unfulfilled needs; isolation; lack of support systems; marital problems; stress; minimal understanding of human development; and lack of nurturing family practices. It is argued that both alcohol abuse and family violence are intergenerational problems; despite the similarities between the two abuses, different intervention strategies may be needed to treat each problem.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Common Bonds of Family Tragedy. Alcoholism and Child Sexual Abuse<BR>
<I>Brown, J. R.</I></B><BR>
<I>Focus on Chemically Dependent Families </I>11(1):18-19, 41-42, 46, 1988
<BLOCKQUOTE>The relationship between alcohol abuse and sexual abuse is examined. The literature indicates that alcohol abuse and child sexual abuse occur simultaneously with a high level of significance; half of those who commit sexual abuse also abuse alcohol. In as many as 80 percent of first episodes of father-daughter incest, the adult has been drinking. Characteristic similarities between the sexual abuser and the alcohol abuser are:  sexual dysfunction, family-of-origin deficits, lowered coping skills, and lowered self-esteem. It is argued that both sexually abusive and alcoholic families may develop dysfunctional alliances and a conspiracy of silence. In both types of abuse, goals include establishing responsibility for the behavior and its consequences:  establishing appropriate family roles and boundaries; offense-specific treatment; and dispositional-specific treatment to prevent further abuse. Implications for future research are discussed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>The Long-Term Clinical Correlates of Childhood Sexual Victimization<BR>
<I>Briere, J.</I></B><BR>
In <I>Human Sexual Aggression:  Current Perspectives. </I>Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 528:327-334, 1988 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Long-term effects of sexual abuse in childhood were studied in 195 female clients of an outpatient crisis intervention service. There was a preponderance of former sexual abuse victims, at 133 to 61 nonvictims. Discriminant function analysis compared the abused and nonabused on several variables. Canonical correlation analysis examined the relationship between characteristics of abuse and clinical variables; simple correlations were calculated for abuse and effects found meaningful to allow evaluation of the canonical correlation results. Results offered support for the notion that sexual abuse in childhood produces long-term psychological problems. Former sexual abuse victims scored higher on four scales of the Crisis Symptom Checklist, reported greater substance abuse and self-destructiveness, and were more likely to be sexually revictimized as adults. Data suggested that there may be a general traumagenic process in sexual abuse and that sexual intercourse during abuse is specifically associated with later dissociation and suicidality.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Project Safe. Final Evaluation Report<BR>
<I>Godley, M. D.; White, W. L.; and Lemke, E. A.</I></B><BR>
Report, Lighthouse Training Institute, Bloomington, IL.  September 30, 1988
<BLOCKQUOTE>This report evaluates Project Safe, a project that began in 1985. Project Safe was designed to formalize referral procedures so that women with severe substance abuse and indicated child neglect problems would routinely be referred from the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) to substance abuse treatment centers funded by the Illinois Department of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse. The demonstration project included systematic screening for substance abusing clients and a unique service modality known as intensive outpatient services of 16 to 20 hours of substance abuse treatment per week. Participants also completed a parent training course developed by the DCFS. Women with addiction recovery experience served as outreach workers to provide frequent assistance to the clients in their homes or other places in their environments. A fourth component was special groups focusing on women's issues, as well as Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous. The evaluation revealed that the intervention group improved in measures of attitude and substance use and experienced greatly reduced abuse and neglect complaints. An appendix contains forms used in the evaluation.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Project Safe. Program Handbook<BR>
<I>White, W. L., and Godley, M. D.</I></B><BR>
Lighthouse Training Institute, Bloomington, IL. September 30, 1988
<BLOCKQUOTE>This manual provides guidance and direction for others to replicate Project Safe. The purpose of Project Safe was to develop, demonstrate, evaluate, and disseminate an innovative model of providing services to neglectful mothers who abuse, or are addicted to, alcohol. The model provided diagnosis, intervention, and treatment of the alcoholic parents, as well as concurrent interventions to improve functioning as parents. Project components included:  identification of neglectful mothers at high risk of alcoholism; assessment and recruitment of these women into an outpatient counseling program; completion of a formal course to improve parenting skills; provisions of outreach worker services in the home; ongoing participation in self-help groups and aftercare counseling; and case conferences and service coordination meetings between representatives of the Department of Children and Family Services and staff of the alcoholism counseling program. Between August 1, 1986, and June 30, 1988, 105 women were involved in Project Safe. The evaluation report is published separately from this manual. Individual chapters provide technical guidance for those who may be involved in replication of the project in specialized roles. There are detailed descriptions of both the structural and process components of the project. An appendix includes some of the instruments used in the project.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Variables Associated with Disrupted Placement in a Select Sample of Abused and Neglected Children<BR>
<I>Cooper, C. S.; Meier, J. H.; and  Peterson, N. L.</I></B><BR>
<I>Child Abuse and Neglect </I>11(1):75-86, 1987
<BLOCKQUOTE>The purpose of this study was to examine the placement history of 172 abused and/or neglected children who had been placed in a residential home for maltreated children. Data were collected on the child's placement history (i.e., number of placements, time in transition, and placement rate) and also on child and family characteristics. Pearson correlation coefficients were run between child and family variables and each of the three placement history variables. In addition, t-tests were also used as a method of analysis. Results indicated that children with the following characteristics or life circumstances experienced the more disruptive experience while in foster care:  (1) children having severe behavior problems; (2) children who were very young when first removed from their natural home; and (3) children having drug-addicted and/or alcoholic parents. Implications of these findings indicate social workers and judges need to be alert to the potential for system abuse of children in foster placement, responsible long-term planning for any child in foster care is critical, and those involved in therapeutic treatment for abused/neglected children should be attentive to the child's placement history.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Children in Alcoholic Families. Risks of Abuse and Unwise Parenting<BR>
<I>DiLorenzo, P.</I></B><BR>
Livengrin Foundation, Bensalem, PA. September-October 1987
<BLOCKQUOTE>This article discusses risks of abuse and unwise parenting in alcoholic families. Assessing whether it is safe for the child to remain in the home is an ongoing process. Thirteen questions a counselor or therapist might ask themselves when making such a determination are provided. Removal of a child from the home should be a last alternative, since such an action can be a double punishment for a victimized child.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Sexual Addiction and Covert Incest. Connecting the Family Roots of Alcoholism, Neglect, and Abuse<BR>
<I>Adams, K. M.</I></B><BR>
<I>Focus </I>10(3)10-11, 46, 1987
<BLOCKQUOTE>This article discusses the connection between sexual addiction, covert incest, and alcoholism. Research has indicated that alcoholism, abuse, and incest are common characteristics of recovering sex addicts. Covert incest, where no sexual contact occurs but the emotional dynamics are present, is also common in alcoholic families. Adult children of alcoholics, who appear responsible and successful, often suffer from shame, abandonment, and alienation. They may resort to sexual compulsiveness. Therapy for the adult sex addict is suggested.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Alcohol and Adolescent Abuse:  The ALCAN Family Services Treatment Model. Research Based Evaluation Series<BR>
<I>Flanzer, J. P., and Sturkie, K.</I></B><BR>
Holmes Beach, FL:  Learning Publications Inc., 1987
<BLOCKQUOTE>Findings of a nationally funded project, the Arkansas Alcohol/Child Abuse Demonstration Project (ALCAN), to help families who abuse and neglect adolescents, coupled with misuse of alcohol by the parents, are presented. The identified clinical sample, 200 families in need, was compared to a nonabusing sample. Services were offered and their effectiveness in stopping abusive behavior and improving family functioning were evaluated. The treatment model was based on the Bowen theory, a family systems theory, and was influenced by strategic and structural therapy and the family management approach. Training increased the effectiveness of child protective services. The program was effective for those engaged in it. Family systems therapy stopped abusive behavior and decreased drinking.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Deadly Deals:  Child Abuse in Chemically Dependent Families<BR>
<I>Focus on Chemically Dependent Families </I></B>10(6):16-17, 34-35, 1987
<BLOCKQUOTE>The relationship of abusive families and families experiencing chemical abuse, as well as historical attitudes toward child abuse, are examined. The family dynamics that perpetuate abuse also sustain chemical dependency, such as poor self-images of family members, problems with emotional stability, and difficulty in intrafamily relationships. Although some programs have had success in dealing with the dilemmas of prevention and treatment faced by abusive families, to deal effectively with abusive and addicted families, society needs:  (1) special education on abusive families as part of training for professionals; (2) integration of curricula on child abuse and chemical dependency into medical schools; (3) increased awareness of child abuse as a family illness; (4) training for teachers; (5) more chapters of Parents United; (6) support groups for abused children and family members; (7) community parenting classes; (8) crisis centers; (9) parent assistance lines for telephone aid; (10) lobbying efforts for better programs; and (11) teams of trained professionals. Increased awareness through education and community programs is essential. </BLOCKQUOTE>

In <I>The Battered Child. Fourth Edition,</I> R. E. Helfer, and R. S. Kempe, pp. 3-22. Chicago:  University of Chicago Press, 1987

<B>Children of Substance Abusers:  A Review of the Literature<BR>
<I>Deren, S.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment </I>3(2):77-94, 1986
<BLOCKQUOTE>This paper presents a literature review summarizing the research on children of substance abusers (COSAs) available through 1985. The proportion of women in substance abuse treatment programs or in need of substance abuse treatment has been increasing. Concern with female substance abusers has led to increased attention on identifying the problems and needs of children of substance abusers, particularly on neonates. Areas requiring further research and methodological problems in the research are identified. The literature has been organized into several areas:  estimates of the numbers of COSAs, and research on pregnant addicts, neonates, infants, older children, and parenting issues.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Alcoholism and Severe Child Maltreatment<BR>
<I>Famularo, R.; Stone, K.; Barnum, R.; and Wharton, R.</I></B><BR>
<I>American Journal of Orthopsychiatry </I>56(3):481-485, 1986
<BLOCKQUOTE>This controlled study focuses on alcoholism among families whose children have been removed by the court because of alleged maltreatment involving significant physical abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect. The study sample consisted of 50 parents referred from a juvenile court to a court psychiatric clinic and a control group of 38 parents. The study revealed a significant over-representation of alcoholism in the study parent population.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Child Sexual Abuse in the Alcoholic Family<BR>
<I>Lynch, B.</I></B><BR>
<I>Focus on Family </I>9(6):26-27, 30, 1986
<BLOCKQUOTE>The topic of child sexual abuse in the alcoholic family is examined. Contrary to popular belief, most child sexual abuse takes place in the home rather than outside of the home. The alcoholic uses alcohol as a justification for any type of behavior. Being drunk can be a rationalization for carrying out sexual behavior with a child. The emotional and psychological effects that alcoholism creates within a family is outlined, followed by the specific interrelationships of child sexual abuse and family alcoholism. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This technical report reviews literature on alcohol and drug use among Hispanic youth. It addresses factors that complicate assessing the problem, such as a lack of a clear definition of Hispanic shortcomings related to research methodology and limitations related to the use of drug statistics. This is followed by a description and summary of emerging issues based on the CSAP grant application and site visits and general programmatic recommendations in prevention, intervention, and treatment. Such recommendations include the need for longitudinal studies to understand changes in patterns of alcohol and other drug use, additional research on the use of specific substances by specific Hispanic subgroups, obtaining specific information on environmental factors, the need for innovative outreach models, and the need for publications and media that reflect the Hispanic culture. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Journal of Primary Prevention</I> 11(2):119-141, 1990<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The systematic development of a preventive intervention for elementary school-age children of alcoholics (COAs) is described. First, the risk status of children of untreated alcoholics is established. Second, risk and protective factors that appear to be mediators of mental health status or COAs are identified. Third, a preventive intervention is designed to teach coping skills and enhance self-esteem. Fourth, the intervention is pilot- tested to assess its feasibility and potential. Finally, plans for a large-scale, experimental field trial of the revised curriculum are outlined. The advantages of following a systematic intervention development plan are demonstrated. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Young Children of Alcoholics: Little People with Big Needs<BR>
<I>O'Rourke, K.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Alcohol and Drug Education</I> 37(2):43-51, 1992<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Parental drinking provides a central focus for the lives of young children of alcoholics (YCOA). Until recently, this group was thought to be the least affected by parental alcoholism because of their immaturity; however, research now indicates that the opposite is more likely to be true. Little is done conventionally in an alcoholic household. When entire families organize around the behavior of an alcoholic, individuals are continually kept off balance anticipating drinking behaviors that are entirely unpredictable. Children worry when they are away from home about the safety of the drinker and frequently blame themselves for parental drinking. Small children raised in alcoholic homes have little sense of power over their own lives. As if childhood trauma is not enough, children of alcoholics are at high risk for future problems, as well. School systems are definite resources for supplying assistance since all children attend school or come to the attention of school authorities. Children in the classroom are observable for long periods of time at various activities, and the public school system is generally connected to a much wider network of community agencies, so many services can be mobilized to effect specific or serious YCOA issues. Young children of alcoholics are in need of assistance in understanding and coping with familial alcoholism before they can effectively use the skills and knowledge that are the main tasks of education professionals. The greatest stumbling block to serving children from alcoholic homes is the problem of identifying them, but when an elementary school works hard to reach its YCOA population and intervenes, the entire school system is likely to reap future benefits. The child-centered approach to family alcoholism in the schools begins with the assumption that children can be helped to understand their feelings and change their behavior whether or not parents are involved in treatment. 31 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Elementary School-Based Alcohol Misuse Prevention Program: Follow-Up Evaluation<BR>
<I>Shope, J.T.; Dielman, T.E.; Butchart, A.T.; Campanelli, P.C.; and Kloska, D.D.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Studies on Alcohol</I> 53(2):106-121, 1992<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>An alcohol misuse prevention study (AMPS) curriculum for fifth- and sixth-grade students was developed, implemented, and evaluated with over 5,000 students. The AMPS program emphasized social pressures resistance training, focusing on the immediate effects of alcohol, risks of alcohol misuse, and social pressures to misuse alcohol. Schools were randomly assigned to curriculum, curriculum plus booster, or control groups with half of each group pretested and all posttested. Measures focused on susceptibility to peer pressure, internal health locus of control, understanding of the curriculum material, alcohol use, and alcohol misuse. After 26 months, there was a significant treatment by occasion interaction on internal health locus of control (sixth grade). A significant treatment by occasion interaction effect was also found with respect to curriculum measures in both grades. There were no significant treatment by occasion interactions with respect to alcohol use or misuse when the groups as a whole were considered. When subgroup analyses based on type of prior drinking experience were conducted, however, significant program effects on alcohol misuse were found among sixth-grade students who had experienced unsupervised, as well as supervised drinking prior to the prevention program. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Program Integrity as a Moderator of Prevention Program Effectiveness: Results for Fifth Grade Students in the Adolescent Alcohol Prevention Trial<BR>
<I>Hansen, W.B.; Graham, J.W.; Wolkenstein, B.H.; and Rohrbach, L.A.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Studies on Alcohol</I> 52(6):568-579, 1991<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This study reports the results of a test of the quality of program delivery (program integrity) as a variable that may moderate the effectiveness of alcohol prevention programs. Two theory-based programs, Resistance Training and Normative Education, were delivered to fifth-grade students who were then tested on program relevant mediating variables. Resistant Training was found to improve students' knowledge of peer pressure resistance strategies, their performance on a behavioral assessment of peer pressure resistance skills, and the manifestation of their future intentions to drink alcohol. Normative Education was found to improve students' perceptions of a conservative norm, regarding alcohol use, facilitated their belief that refusing unwanted offers to drink alcohol could be easily accomplished, and reduced their perceptions of the prevalence of alcohol use. Program integrity was measured by program specialists who taught the programs to students and by trained observers. Ratings of program integrity were found to significantly moderate outcomes for three of seven mediating variables. Affected were knowledge of peer pressure resistance strategies, behavioral pressure resistance skills, and perceived self-efficacy. These results suggest that the quality of program delivery and reception may play an important moderating function on prevention program effectiveness. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Early intervention is examined through new approaches to school- based prevention. Entry into school marks a major transition in the developmental path toward adulthood and autonomous functioning. Schooling itself has a pervasive influence on emotional and social development, as well as cognitive development. The school is, in essence, a major socialization influence. Research findings from four school-based, early intervention programs show that models based on a holistic developmental approach and focused on promoting positive social development, rather than simply preventing problems, can lead to healthy development for some adolescents. Based on these programs and other child development research, a tentative model of socialization and social development is proposed. This model rests, in part, on the establishment of a positive, affective bond between the individual child and important socializing agents and institutions. The role of these agents is to promote interpersonal relatedness, competence, and autonomy. The proposed model implies that schools should be concerned with the whole child. The model presented can serve as an initial framework for guiding demonstration research projects in school-based prevention. 112 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This article is concerned with the familial and socioeconomic factors that contribute to the high prevalence rates of drug use in African American children. In addition to detailing the impact of drug use in African American children and their families, the authors consider how this critical health problem can be prevented using existing knowledge and strategies known to mental health professionals. A model program entitled Project for a Substance Abuse-Free Environment (SAFE) is outlined. Its objectives are to implement: (1) a broad-spectrum family intervention to empower disadvantaged and families in high-risk communities; (2) a competency-based skills intervention to increase resilience and decrease drug use and other maladaptive behaviors in at-risk children; (3) alternative activities that will promote self-efficacy, achievement, and self-esteem; (4) a culturally-relevant evaluation plan that includes both formative (process) and summative (outcome) evaluation; (5) a comprehensive approach for assessing project impact; and (6) systematic procedures for enhancing the maintenance and generalization of gains in participating children and families.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>While few programs for the prevention of drug use among children have been systematically examined, those that do exist focus on junior high and high school children. This study investigated the effectiveness of a program with elementary school fourth graders. A total of 100 children was assigned to an experimental group or a no-treatment control group and was assessed at pretreatment, post-treatment, and a 2-month follow-up. Subjects in both groups were seen for three 1-hour sessions in groups of approximately 20 children. The children receiving the drug use prevention program were taught information about drugs and drug use, the difference between good and bad drugs, information about addiction and being &quot;conned&quot; into drug use, and safety rules for preventing drug use. Children in the control group were seen for an equal amount of time by an experimenter but were taught their regular class lessons. Relative to the control group, children in the experimental group acquired more information at the post assessment. While the differences between the two groups in this area diminished somewhat at follow-up, differences between the two groups' application of skills emerged at follow-up. The results indicate that children in elementary school can be taught basic information concerning drug use prevention. </BLOCKQUOTE>

It targets elementary school children at high risk using a family-based approach. FAST is structured to address four factors that have been correlated with adolescent substance use: parental substance abuse; low self-esteem; inability to discuss feelings; and lack of routines, rituals, structure, and communication. The children served by FAST are not yet involved in substance use but are referred through their teachers who find them at risk for school failure, juvenile delinquency, and alcohol and other drug use. FAST recognizes the school as a hub in families' lives and therefore creates a community within a community by bringing families in the same geographical school district together to participate in the program. The program consists of multiple family meetings in two phases: eight weekly meetings followed by monthly meetings for graduate families that continue for at least 2 years. Exposing families to information and resources in these meetings is seen as an important part of empowerment. FAST has been successful in increasing children's attention spans and self-esteem and decreasing behavior problems, strengthening parent-child relationships, enhancing overall family functioning, encouraging family networking, and helping families feel more comfortable in their dealings with schools and other community resources. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Conducting Support Groups for Elementary Children K-6: A Guide for Educators and Other Professionals<BR>

Minneapolis, MN: Johnson Institute, 1991<BR>
(Available from the Johnson Institute, 7151 Metro Boulevard, Suite 250, Minneapolis, MN 55439-2122.)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A comprehensive guide for establishing a support group program in a school setting is presented for educators in a step-by-step format. Examples and ready-to-use ideas are included, and an irrefutable case is made for the importance and impact such programs have. It is contended that offering K-6 children a support group program like the one outlined in the guide gives them the opportunity to acquire the skills and motivation they will need to preserve and increase their health and ways of healthful living throughout their lives. 29 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Elementary Prevention: Supporting At-Risk Students<BR>

<I>Student Assistance Journal</I> May/June 1992, pp. 21-23, 26-28<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A student support program has been implemented in 21 elementary schools in York and Adams counties in Pennsylvania. The model has been replicated in both urban and rural areas, in schools with small and large populations, and in all socioeconomic groups. Every effort is made to work within each school's philosophy and perceived student needs to collaborate with existing pupil personnel services. The referral process has been integrated into pre-existing referral teams, such as elementary student support teams, instructional support teams, and child study teams. This model interfaces smoothly with the Pennsylvania State model of instructional support teams that are being phased into every elementary school throughout the State by the 1994-1995 school year. The support groups are a viable onsite intervention strategy for children identified by the instructional support team as needing life skills remediation. The comprehensive program focuses on school, parent, and community resources in a supportive network surrounding the child's needs. Referrals may be made to additional services outside of the school environment for the child and/or family who are severely traumatized. 4 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Bonding Is the Key<BR>
<I>Lerner, R.</I></B><BR>
<I>Adolescent Counselor</I> July 1992, pp. 13, 17<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Underlying many of society's problems is a core issue: many children who turn to drug use, sexual acting out, suicide, and crime are non-attached children who never bonded adequately to a parent or caregiver. It is suggested that educators can learn to spot the early patterns of these children at high-risk to prevent devastating consequences in the teenage years. Secure bonding has implications far beyond emotional well-being. Healthy attachment helps children think logically, attain full intellectual potential, become self-reliant, cope with stress and frustration, reduce jealousy, and develop healthy relationships. Non-attached children who have reached school age often exhibit impulsive, uncontrolled behavior, easily provoked frustration, and apathy. Securely attached children have predictable relationships with their caregivers. Anxious attachments produce kids who are easily agitated, controlling, and difficult to console. Avoidantly attached kids give the impression of independence, acting cool, distant, and not inclined to seek help. The latter two types may be clingy, angry, or aggressive; these strategies adopted by the children to help them get along in the world help to alienate other people, reinforcing their belief that they will never be loved. Suggestions are provided for elementary teachers working with non-attached children who are still capable of forming alliances. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Groups Do It Better: Boost Esteem and School Morale with Student Support Groups<BR>
<I>Plaford, G. R.</I></B><BR>
<I>Adolescent Counselor: Education About Addictions</I> May 1992, pp. 32-35, 60<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Over the past several years, student assistance programs (SAPs) have become increasingly common in public education. While today's youth are faced with more and tougher decisions, they also find themselves with increasingly less control and support from home. In addition to support and guidance, SAP student support groups provide other benefits. After participating in support groups, students often express a more positive attitude toward teachers, and teachers gain a greater understanding and compassion toward students. Another benefit of SAPs is that of student self-esteem. The basic elements necessary for self-esteem are outlined and include a sense of belonging, a sense of uniqueness, a sense of power, and a model for personal standards. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The most effective programs to prevent alcohol use among African American adolescents have adapted a culture-specific, alcohol-specific educational model that focuses on the individual and his or her environment. An alcohol education program for African American youth must provide opportunities for these youngsters to discard negativism. Many of these youngsters have been hardened by the reality of their lifestyles, but it is possible to help them beyond the present and set positive goals for the future. Because African American youth often are confined to their communities, they may lack knowledge or exposure to the majority community. This can make any contact frustrating, intimidating, or frightening. Because drinking is part of American society and African American culture as well, youth alcohol use prevention efforts should focus on teaching responsible decision making about alcohol use. It is contended that an understanding of the reasons that youth drink, the influence of role models and value systems, and the significance of African American culture are important considerations when designing behavioral change programs. 11 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Health Education Research</I> 7(3):403-430, 1992<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Substance use prevention studies published between 1980 and 1990 are reviewed for content, methodology, and behavioral outcomes. Studies were classified based on the inclusion of 12 content areas: Information, Decision Making, Pledges, Values Clarification, Goal Setting, Stress Management, Self-Esteem, Resistance Skills Training, Life Skills Training, Norm Setting, Assistance, and Alternatives. Six groups of programs (Information/Values Clarification; Affective Education; Social Influence; and Comprehensive, Alternative, and Incomplete Programs) are identified. Reports are analyzed for two major threats to validity, selection bias and statistical power. Program groups generally have similar selection biases but have important differences in statistical power. Comprehensive and Social Influence Programs are found to be most successful in preventing the onset of substance use. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Programs for Change: A Realistic Look at the Nation's Potential for Preventing Substance Involvement Among High-Risk Youth<BR>
<I>Lorian, R.P., and Ross, J.G.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Community Psychology</I> 1992, pp. 3-9<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Eight model demonstration programs funded by the Office for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) are described. These models demonstrate that: (1) preventive interventions appear to maximize their potential for lowering rates of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use when targeted toward youth burdened by combinations of risk factors; (2) the development and implementation of a community-based preventive intervention is a complicated undertaking; and (3) the evaluation of community-based preventive interventions concerns far more than determining the proportion of program participants using AOD relative to their non-recipient counterparts. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Culturally Relevant Smoking Prevention for Minority Youth<BR>
<I>Cella, D.F.; Tulsky, D.S.; Sarafian, B.; Thomas, C.R., Sr.; and Thomas, C.R., Jr.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of School Health</I> 62(8):377-380, 1992<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A rap contest methodology for smoking prevention was tested with sixth and seventh grade students in a predominantly minority public school district. Contests were held after initial assemblies in which students heard anti-smoking rap messages from same-age and older peers on audio and video tape. Pretesting and posttesting (N = 268) indicated high preference ratings for most aspects of the intervention. Analyses of variance revealed no differences across races on any of the dependent measures. However, smaller assemblies were more effective than larger ones in enhancing attitudes against smoking and obtaining more positive contest evaluations and predictions about smoking behavior. A rap contest method therefore may be effective against the initiation of smoking by disadvantaged children in sixth and seventh grades because it is highly acceptable and preceived as culturally relevant. This effectiveness may be better demonstrated in a single classroom environment rather than larger assemblies.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Boys & Girls Clubs in Public Housing Developments: Prevention Services for Youth At Risk<BR>
<I>Schinke, S.P.; Orlandi, M.A.; and Cole, K.C.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Community Psychology</I> CSAP Special Issue:118-128, 1992<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This article describes and evaluates the impact of Boys & Girls Clubs recently installed in residential public housing developments. Because most prevention interventions to date have been school-based, this study marks a development in prevention interventions for problem behavior among youth at high-risk. The evaluation compares sites without Boys & Girls Clubs to sites with both previously and recently installed Boys & Girls Clubs. The results show that public housing developments with Boys & Girl Clubs have less drug-related activity, measurably fewer damaged and unoccupied units, and increased parental involvement in youth activities.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Catalyst for Action: A National Survey to Mobilize Leadership and Resources for the Prevention of Alcohol and Other Drug Problems Among American Youth</B><BR>
Report, Louis Harris and Associates, Inc., New York, April 1988, 116 pp.<BR>
(Available from Boys Clubs of America, 771 First Avenue, New York, NY 10017.) <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Boys Clubs of America commissioned a survey to measure the amount of untapped volunteer leadership and private-sector financial support for community-based prevention efforts. Interviews of 2,100 community leaders, 1,000 grant makers, and 100 national prevention experts were conducted between April 15 and May 12, 1987. The key findings follow: (1) alcohol and other drug abuse is viewed as a compelling problem; (2) many of those polled already know a great deal about substance abuse and youth; (3) there is considerable awareness of the causal connection between substance abuse and auto crashes, death, and youth crime; (4) alcohol is seen as the principal substance abused by youth; (5) peer pressure and parental example are viewed as the biggest factors affecting youthful behavior; (6) marijuana is considered a gateway drug; and (7) most believe the family to be responsible in dealing with substance abuse and believe the family has for the most part failed in its role. However, there is a general optimism about prevention and a willingness to contribute talent, time, and money to a quality campaign. The group unanimously supported early school-based programs, parental involvement, and severe punishment of drug dealers as absolutely essential to an effective program. The implications of these findings are discussed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Private Sector: Taking a Role in the Prevention of Drug and Alcohol Abuse for Young People<BR>
<I>Adams, T., and West, B.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Drug Education </I>18(3):185-199, 1988<BR>
(Available from Barbara West, Ph.D., Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, 1777 North California Boulevard, Suite 200, Walnut Creek, CA 94596.)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For many years the main support for drug abuse prevention programs from the private sector came through financial resources from agencies of community assistance, such as the United Way. In the 1970s, the approach began to change and diversify as the negative social impact of drugs became more visible and far-reaching. Throughout all strata of society and within the workplace itself, more lives than ever before were affected by the abuse of drugs. A national problem was identified, highlighted by deaths of celebrities, respected community members, and/or their children due to drug overdosing. The abuse of dangerous drugs, no longer confined to the Nation's slums and minority communities, proliferated with the more tolerant social attitudes of the 1960s and 1970s. It soon became evident that not to take a stand would only make the problem worse, and that prevention would be far less costly in both human suffering and financial costs than treating problems after the fact. On a different front, studies of manpower productivity revealed that the abuse of chemicals by employees was costly, and not to acknowledge and do something about it even costlier. In response, some companies designed and implemented employee assistance programs, while others insisted on broader insurance coverage to support the inpatient and outpatient treatment of chemically dependent employees and their families. Still others looked for ways they could become involved in preventing the problem in the first place. Employee health or fitness centers were one result of this growing interest. Active support of projects designed to prevent drug use among young people was another.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Prevention Gains New Support from Foundations</B><BR>
<I>Prevention File </I>Spring 1990, pp. 13-14<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This newsletter article focuses on the topic of private foundation grants that would fund the development and implementation of substance abuse prevention programs. Many foundations not previously concerned with alcohol and drug abuse programs are concluding that their funds should be devoted to trying to prevent those problems. Still, alcohol and drug problems remain low on the scale of priorities for many philanthropies. A survey of foundation support of alcohol and drug programs between 1983 and 1987 showed that the number of foundations making grants in these areas rose from one out of four in 1980 to two out of five in 1987. Total funding and share of funding also continues to rise for this field. The grants of some large philanthropic organizations are reviewed. </BLOCKQUOTE>

Rainbow Research, Inc., Minneapolis, 1991<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Lilly Endowment began its &quot;Religious Institutions as Partners in Community Based Development&quot; program in 1989. The program aims to: (1) stimulate greater involvement of religious institutions in community revitalization; (2) create new religious-community partnerships; (3) strengthen community ministries; and (4) attract new sources of funding for such initiatives. Twenty-eight religious institutions or partnerships involving religious institutions and community-based organizations are receiving grants and technical assistance through the program. This report presents evaluation findings from the first year of funded activity for grant recipients. Chapters include: <I>Results of the Planning Phase, Contextual Factors Affecting Funded Projects, Varieties of Partnerships, Characteristics Contributing to Effective Partnerships, Lessons for Building Partnerships, Focus for Future Inquiry, and Funded Group Descriptions</I>.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>The Importance of Philanthropy and Voluntary Initiative: A Message to Candidates for National Office, the Administration and Congress</B><BR>
Report, Independent Sector, April 1992<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>America's independent sector is comprised of millions of formal and informal voluntary and philanthropic organizations such as schools; hospitals; social service organizations; advocacy groups; civic, social, and fraternal organizations; arts and culture organizations; foundations; and religious institutions. Government actions have a profound effect on the ability of voluntary organizations to carry out their mission. This booklet urges national leaders to adopt policies that support and strengthen nonprofit endeavors by adopting 13 actions, expanded upon in this paper, that are needed to achieve this end. Policies address such issues as tax incentives and deductions, free speech rights, liability insurance, and government involvement.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Alcohol and Drug Abuse Funding: An Analysis of Foundation Grants<BR>
<I>Renz, L.</I></B><BR>
Report, The Foundation Center, April 1989<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Grants were analyzed over a 5-year period to determine changes in patterns of giving in the area of alcohol and other drug (AOD) abuse. The study examined 1,800 grants by program focus, type of support, geographic distribution, population group served, and recipient type. Additional analysis of funders was made to determine giving patterns by type and size of foundation. The study included profiles of the largest funders and of those grantmakers who have recently announced AOD programs. Finally, a survey of grantmakers and practitioners was conducted to determine current attitudes and priorities. Fifty-four influential or consistent grantmakers and 18 AOD abuse professionals participated in the program. 1 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>The History of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Funding: Trends in the 1980s<BR>
<I>Renz, L.</I></B><BR>
Report, The Foundation Center, June 1991<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The author explores the trends of foundation and government funding in the alcohol and drug abuse field through the 1980s. The increase in substance abuse funding during these years signaled a heightened concern and national focus on the interrelated problems of at-risk youth. Between 1983 and 1987 nearly half of the $87 million spent by foundations to combat substance abuse went for treatment compared with about 36 percent for prevention. By 1987, however, due to a few very large grants, prevention dollars exceeded treatment dollars. There was still strong support for treatment, but the growth area was undoubtedly prevention. Whether in prevention or in treatment, foundations were seeking out community-based strategies especially those that involved parent participation. The author predicts future trends for substance abuse funding.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Grant Proposal Development<BR>
<I>Newman, R.</I></B><BR>
Report, Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress, Congressional Reference Division, August 1990<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Congressional offices are frequently asked for guidance by constituents planning projects of benefit to their community. With Federal funding cutbacks and competition for grants becoming more intense, proposals need to be carefully thought through to increase the likelihood of receiving funding. Sufficient time should be allowed for all stages of proposal development. This report offers suggestions for finding appropriate sources of Federal and private project funding. It describes major components of the written grant proposal and gives basic guidelines for developing, organizing, and writing the proposal.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Foundation Response: Opportunities and Strategies for Grantmakers in the War on Drugs<BR>
<I>Dolan, J. S., and Olander, C. K.</I></B><BR>
<I>Health Affairs </I>9(2):202-208, 1990<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The authors contend that foundations, corporations, and individuals have both the mandate and the potential to substantially reduce the national dependence on drugs. The challenge facing grantmakers is how to integrate alcohol and other (AOD) drug issues into current program areas. Grantmakers can become important in bridging issues, coalescing community resources, and empowering grass-roots leadership. The following areas are listed as deficits in the AOD field: (1) forging systemic policy; (2) building consensus on attitudes; (3) identifying what works best for whom and under what conditions; (4) moving from a curative mode to one of prevention, education, and early intervention; (5) anticipating and intercepting new drug cycles; and (6) creating multidisciplinary, independent think tanks to address AOD problems. Grantmakers can play a major role in demanding credible data from providers and fostering new cost-effective treatment models. 8 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Building a Successful Fundraising Program<BR>
<I>Kintigh, C.</I></B><BR>
Report, Campus Activities Programming, November 1986<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With a little foresight, planning, and hard work, outside sponsorship of campus lecture programming is entirely possible. And much needed dollars aren't the only benefit of a successful fundraising drive: the campaign can also polish an organization's image and provide a number of sophisticated opportunities for student development. This article highlights techniques that have been developed over the 36 years that the Memorial Student Center at Texas A&M University has been raising funds. Setting goals, budgeting and organization, identifying contributors, and the actual fundraising are major topics addressed by the author. 6 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Fighting Drug Abuse at the Local Level<BR>
<I>Jellinek, P.S. and Hearn, R.P.</I></B><BR>
Report, Issues in Science and Technology, Summer 1991<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This article argues that community partnerships are the most effective way of fighting the drug problem in this country. The authors state that neither an increase in law enforcement nor the legalization of illicit drugs is the answer, but rather demand reduction, handled by federally-assisted collaboration within individual communities, is the best way of preventing and treating drug-infested neighborhoods. Examples of successful unified community initiatives are described, including Fighting Back, a group funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Private Foundation Support for Alcohol and Substance Abuse Prevention<BR>
<I>Keenan, T.</I></B><BR>
Report, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation<BR>
Reprinted by permission of the author, Summer 1990<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Private foundation support for alcohol and substance abuse is a relatively recent phenomenon in the annals of institutional philanthropy. It was not until the early 1980s, when public schools and other institutions began to be adversely affected by the growing prevalence of the use and abuse of narcotic substances, that interest in substance abuse funding began to grow. This article describes specific foundation-supported projects, including the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, the Lilly Endowment, and the Conrad Hilton Foundation, and details the future outlook for foundation grantmaking.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Healthy Youth 2000:  National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives for Adolescents</B><BR>
In <I>Healthy People 2000:  National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives</I>, U.S. Public Health Service, December 1990<BR>
(Available from Betsy J. Davis, American Medical Association, Department of Adolescent Health, 515 North State Street, Chicago, IL 60610.) 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Healthy People 2000 is a blueprint that sets broad health goals for the American people.  The three principal goals for the 1990s are to:  (1) increase the span of healthy life of Americans; (2) reduce health disparities among Americans; and (3) provide access to preventive services for all Americans.  To promote the achievement of the objectives, the American Medical Association (AMA) has received funding to focus on the adolescent population through its Healthier Youth by the Year 2000 project.  This project includes the publication of a multi-disciplinary, modular newsletter, Target 2000.  To simplify the task of identifying and working specifically with the adolescent health objectives, the AMA has assembled this volume.  Adolescents are defined as 10-24 year olds, and the objectives were selected from Healthy People 2000 about that age group.  The information is divided into two sections.  This first section lists objectives pertaining only to adolescents or addressing issues central to adolescent health, such as physical activity and fitness, nutrition, tobacco, and alcohol and other drugs.  The second section includes additional objectives organized according to roles for professionals in health care, education, community, and government contexts.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Smokeless Tobacco Use Among Native American School Children<BR>
<I>Bruerd, B.</I></B><BR>
<I>Public Health Reports </I>105(2):196-201, 1990<BR>
(Available from Ms. Bonnie Bruerd, 1095 Kathy Way South, Salem, OR 97306.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>Seven published and two unpublished surveys of Native American school children's use of smokeless tobacco (ST) are reviewed.  The surveys represent school children in South Dakota, Montana, Nebraska, Washington, Arizona, New Mexico, and Alaska.  This review describes and discusses the survey methods, prevalence, duration, and intensity of ST use, and ST health effects documented in these studies.  Prevalence of regular ST use ranges from 18 percent in kindergartners through 6th graders to 55.9 percent among 9th and 10th graders.  In two studies that surveyed kindergartners, regular use was reported at 13 percent in one study and 21 percent in the other.  Comparisons to use by non-Native Americans, as reported in surveys, demonstrate the severity of the problem in Native American communities.  There appear to be three significant findings related to Native American ST use:  (1) young age of onset of ST use, (2) similar prevalence of use among adolescent boys and girls, and (3) higher overall prevalence of ST use when compared to non- Native American populations.  Acceptance of the habit, peer pressure, and addiction seem to be contributing to the high ST use in Native American communities.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>AIDS Education and Prevention </I>2(4):305-312, 1990<BR>
(Available from Steven P. Schinke, Columbia University, School of Social Work, 622 West 113th Street, New York, NY 10025.) 
<BLOCKQUOTE>This paper considers strategies for preventing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among African-American and Hispanic-American adolescents.  The authors describe culturally sensitive interventions based on social learning theory.  The interventions combine elements of cognitive-behavioral skills for problem solving, coping, and interpersonal communication with elements of ethnic pride and HIV facts.  The paper discusses the strengths and limitations of skills intervention for AIDS prevention and concludes with directions for research.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>AMA Profiles of Adolescent Health:  America's Adolescents:  How Healthy Are They?<BR>
<I>Gans, J.E.; Blyth, D.A.; and Gaveras, L.L.</I></B><BR>
Report, American Medical Association, 1990<BR>
(Available from the Department of Adolescent Health Profiles NL012690, American Medical Association, 535 North Dearborn Street, Chicago, IL 60610.) 
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is the first volume in a new series that focuses on major issues in adolescent health.  The purpose of the AMA Profiles of Adolescent Health is to provide a useful set of references for planning, advocacy, teaching, and community education.  The series is intended for people who work with or on behalf of adolescents and who want to know more about the state of their health.  Although it provides important information on various topics in adolescent health, the series is not a guide to working with individual adolescents.  Each volume in the series is arranged in a question and answer format and the following questions are answered in this publication:  How severe and widespread are adolescent health problems? What are adolescents doing and experiencing that threatens their health? Are adolescents more at risk today than in the past? Which adolescents are more at risk for particular health problems? What can be done to improve the health of America's adolescents? Topics discussed include:  violence, alcohol, tobacco, drugs, suicide, sexual activity, injuries, pregnancy, and recommendations for improvement in services for adolescents.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>NIDA Prevention Effort Links Teenage AIDS, Drug Use, and Sexual Behavior</B><BR>
<I>Public Health Reports</I> January/February 1991
<BLOCKQUOTE>As part of a broad drug education and drug use prevention effort directed toward the Nation's teenagers, the National Institute on Drug Abuse recently released a statistical overview that relates drug use, risky behavior, and AIDS in this age group.  About half of all American high school seniors have used illegal drugs.  About 1 in 6 was currently using marijuana and more than 90 percent of these students had tried alcohol, some using it in substantial amounts.  As a group, American teenagers are sexually active.  Evidence indicates that sex and drug use are linked among teenagers.  Teenagers as a group are of special concern because they are a growing proportion of HIV-infected persons.  Further statistics from this NIDA study, and their implications, are discussed in this brief article.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Peer Group Influence as a Factor in Smoking Behavior of Adolescents<BR>
<I>van Roosmalen, E.H.</I></B><BR>
<I> Journal of the American Medical Association </I>264(12):1591, 1990<BR>
(Available from Susan A. McDaniel, Department of Sociology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta T6G 2H4, Canada.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>Adolescents, as the fastest growing group of smokers, have been a focus and concern of health educators and researchers.  Adolescent smoking is of particular interest because initiation and early habits are known to have important implications for lifetime smoking or cessation.  Despite the well-known centrality of the peer group in adolescent behavior, smoking cessation programs have been largely directed toward individuals rather than groups, with emphasis on encouraging the individual to say &quot no.&quot  In this article, smoking behavior and peer group patterns among a sample of 1,689 eighth-grade students from southern Ontario were analyzed to ascertain possible differences.  It was found that peer groups are crucially important in the initiation of smoking among young adolescents, particularly girls.  The patterns of indirect peer influence on girls is such that girls are less likely to stop smoking once they have begun than are boys.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Adolescent Steroid Use</B><BR>
Report, Office of the Inspector General, February 1991<BR>
(Available from the Office of the Inspector General, 330 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, DC 20201.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>This report describes the non-medical use of steroids by adolescents, suggests appropriate education and intervention strategies, and recommends areas for research.  The study employed by NIDA included professional literature, 30 experts, and 72 current or former steroids users.  Findings showed that over one quarter million adolescents have used steroids; adolescent steroid use starts early and often follows a prolonged intense pattern; adolescents' steroid use is motivated by socially acceptable values and life-stage concerns with appearance and peer approval; adolescents are at special risk for adverse results of steroid use; experts link steroid use to serious psychological and physical health risks; experts recommend education of adolescents and adults as the best solution to the steroid use problem; and testing and controlled substance status can be potential deterrents to steroid use.  Recommendations were that a national steroid education strategy be developed and that further medical and scientific research be conducted.  37 Ref.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Preventing Adolescent Drug Use:  From Theory to Practice<BR>
<I>Goplerud, E.N.</I></B><BR>
Rockville, MD:  Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, 1991<BR>
(Available from the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information, P.O. Box 2345, Rockville, MD 20847-2345.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>This book is testimony to the growing body of knowledge that has resulted from the combined efforts of clinicians and researchers.  The authors describe the complex world of adolescents, their families, the transitions that influence their development and behavior, and the factors that place them at risk for alcohol and other drug use and for progression to addictive use.  The book also contains practical information about methods of identifying, reaching, retaining, and serving adolescents and their families.  A major theme throughout the book is the need to reach and intervene early with youth before the onset of adolescence.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Effect of Drug and Alcohol Education on Attitudes of High School Students<BR>
<I>Lignell, C., and Davidhizar, R.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Alcohol and Drug Education </I>37(1):  31-37, 1991
<BLOCKQUOTE>The effects of a 3-week alcohol and drug education course on a group of ninth graders' attitudes and opinions about alcohol and drugs are examined. The course included lectures and group discussions.  Films were presented on drunk driving and fetal alcohol syndrome.  Guest lecturers included a social worker, a nurse, and a substance abuse prevention specialist from the health department.  The first portion of the Fishbein/Ajzen Model, which measures the strength of beliefs and opinions about an object, was used to measure the students' beliefs and opinions about alcohol use.  This instrument was used both prior to and after completion of the course.  It was found that the total attitude score for all the students changed in the desired direction, indicating stronger attitudes against using and abusing drugs and alcohol, polydrug use, dependency, social pressure, and media influence and in favor of legal restrictions and education.  18 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>School Crime:  National Crime Victimization Survey Report<BR>
<I>Bastian, L.D., and Taylor, D.M.</I></B><BR>
Report, September 1991<BR>
(Available from the Justice Statistics Clearinghouse/NCJRS, U.S. Department of Justice, Box 6000, Rockville, MD 20850.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>The National Crime Victimization Survey was administered during the first half of 1989.  The data collected represent an estimated 21.6 million students, ages 12 to 19 years.  This analysis accounts for crime experienced by different groups:  males and females; blacks and whites; Hispanics and non-Hispanics; and central city, suburban, and rural residents.  It also accounts for selected characteristics of schools and students:  public and private, grade levels, and security measures.  This study asked students for their perceptions of crime issues such as &quot How difficult were drugs or alcohol to obtain at school? How prevalent were street gangs in school? How fearful were students of being attacked at school?&quot  Information also was gathered on the school environment, victimization, and the efforts to avoid becoming a victim.  The questionnaire used for the survey is presented.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Johnston, L.D.; O'Mally, P.M.; and Bachman, J.G.</I></B><BR>
Report, 1991<BR>
(Available from the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information, P.O. Box 2345, Rockville, MD 20847.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>This comprehensive report published by NIDA presents the results of the 16th national survey of the drug use and related attitudes of American high school seniors, college students, and young adults.  Two of the report's major topics include the current prevalence of drug use among seniors and trends in drug use by seniors since the study began in 1975.  Content areas covered in this report include:  trends in drinking alcohol, illicit drug use, and cigarette smoking according to age, college/non-college, and gender; study design and procedures; prevalence of drug use among seniors; trends in drug use among seniors; use at earlier age levels; degree and duration of drug highs; attitudes and beliefs about drugs among seniors, particularly about harm, marijuana, approval and legality; the social milieu for seniors, particularly attitudes of parents and friends; exposure and availability of drugs; use of non-prescription stimulants; daily use of marijuana; racial and ethnic differences; recent declines in cocaine and marijuana use; changes in use during pregnancy; and information about dropouts.  Drugs discussed include:  marijuana, cocaine, stimulants, hallucinogens, LSD, PCP, inhalants, nitrites, barbiturates, methadone, tranquilizers, heroin, opiates, cigarettes, and alcohol.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>AIDS Risk Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behavioral Intentions among Multi-Ethnic Adolescents<BR>
<I>Dusenbury, L.; Botvin, G.L.; Baker, E.; and Laurence, J.</I></B><BR>
<I>AIDS Education and Prevention </I>3(4):367-375, 1991
<BLOCKQUOTE>The purpose of this study was to determine how much young adolescents know about AIDS and AIDS risk and to identify areas of confusion that might serve as important targets of educational intervention.  A multiethnic (43 percent white, 33 percent black, 18 percent Latino) sample of 303 seventh-grade students (48 percent male) in 3 schools in the greater New York area completed questionnaires assessing knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intentions concerning AIDS and AIDS risk.  Consistent with previous studies with older adolescents, the major finding in this study was that young adolescents had a high degree of knowledge concerning AIDS and AIDS risk.  There were two areas of confusion concerning AIDS risk.  Specifically, 31 percent of adolescents did not correctly identify &quot not having sex&quot  as the most effective way of preventing AIDS, and 33 percent believed that AIDS could be spread through casual contact.  Findings are discussed in terms of their implications for prevention.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Alcohol Consumption and Sexual Risk-Taking in Adolescents<BR>
<I>Leigh, B.C., and Morrison, D.M.</I></B><BR>
<I>Alcohol Health and Research World </I>15(1):59-63, 1991
<BLOCKQUOTE>Considerable research has shown that the use of alcohol is correlated with early sexual activity, and a smaller body of work has suggested that the use of alcohol may be related to nonuse of contraception in adolescents.  Most of this existing research comes from small, nonrepresentative samples, specific contraceptive methods often are not distinguished, and cultural and ethnic differences have not been explored fully.  It is contended that as yet no definitive casual relationship is established between alcohol use and unprotected intercourse.  Identifying whether the cause of alcohol-related sexual risk-taking lies with the individual, the alcohol, or the environment in which both exists is an important step in identifying appropriate strategies for intervention.  48 Ref.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>The Effects of Alcohol Abuse on the Health of Adolescents<BR>
<I>Arria, A.M.; Tarter, R.E.; and Van Thiel, D.H.</I></B><BR>
<I>Alcohol Health and Research World </I>15(1):52-57, 1991
<BLOCKQUOTE>A person's physical and mental state changes rapidly and profoundly during the developmental period of adolescence.  There is a deficient amount of research into the possibly deleterious effects of alcohol abuse on development and general health in adolescents.  A summary is provided of the prevalence of adolescent alcohol use and abuse.  The reasons for the lack of attention  directed at adolescent health issues are examined.  The current status of knowledge about the biomedical consequences of adolescent alcohol use is  reviewed.  Research strategies are suggested that might lead to clarification of the influence of adolescent alcohol use on health.  47 Ref.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Adolescent Alcohol Decisions<BR>
<I>Fischhoff, B., and Quadrel, M.J.</I></B><BR>
Alcohol Health and Research World 15(1):43-51, 1991
<BLOCKQUOTE>Making decisions related to alcohol consumption requires both specific knowledge and general cognitive skills.  Decision theorists have studied knowledge and skills in a variety of settings.  A review of these results suggests some explanations for adolescents' alcohol- related decisions.  If teens are drinking in a way that is ill-advised, it may be because they are not considering options that would make it more attractive not to drink.  Life-skills training programs attempt to create such options by teaching refusal skills, socially adroit ways to avoid taking risks.  Teens' drinking decisions also might be traced to their beliefs about the consequences of the options that they consider or to the tradeoffs that they are willing to make.  Finally, adolescents may have difficulty making sense of complex decisions and keeping track of all the relevant considerations and so may resort to quick solutions reflecting only some of their personal beliefs and values.  57 Ref.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Alcohol Use and Abuse:  Some Findings from the National Adolescent Student Health Survey<BR>
<I>Windle, M.</I></B><BR>
<I>Alcohol Health and Research World </I>15(1):5-10, 1991
<BLOCKQUOTE>Most people are aware that adolescents drink alcohol, but the patterns of alcohol use among adolescents are not well known.  Three topics related to adolescent drinking are described.  The first is the prevalence of alcohol consumption and heavy drinking in nationally representative samples of 8th graders and 10th graders.  The second topic is the prevalence of combined alcohol and drug use in a single setting.  The final topic discussed is the relationship between the age of first alcohol use and the development of heavy drinking and the combined use of alcohol and other drugs.  Patterns of adolescent drinking are identified for more effective prevention and treatment of alcohol-related problems.  8 Ref.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Patterns of Alcohol Consumption Among Suburban Adolescent Black High School Students<BR>
<I>Beck, K.H., and Zannis, M.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Alcohol and Drug Education </I>37(2):1-13, 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>A survey was given to 392 black and 1,173 white students in a middle class, suburban high school by the means of an anonymous questionnaire designed to uncover the social context of youth drinking. Results showed that black adolescents drink smaller quantities less frequently than whites, are more likely to be non-drinkers, are less likely than whites to drive while intoxicated, are twice as likely as whites to report never having been drunk, and are less likely to use alcohol for relief of physical pain, stress, or sleeplessness.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Drug Use Among Black, White, Hispanic, Native American, and Asian American High School Seniors (1976-1989):  Prevalence, Trends, and Correlates<BR>
<I>Bachman, J.G.; Wallace, J.M.; Kurth, C.L.; Johnston, L.D.; and O'Malley, P.O.</I></B><BR>
Report, Institute for Social Research, 1990. 63 p.<BR>
(Available from Monitoring the Future, Institute for Social Research, The University of Michigan, P.O. Box 1248, Ann Arbor, MI 48106.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>This paper reports racial/ethnic differences in the use of licit and illicit drugs, using data from 14 nationally representative surveys of high school seniors from 1976 through 1989.  Throughout the period, Native Americans had the highest prevalence rates for use of illicit drugs except cocaine, for frequent use of alcohol, and for use of cigarettes.  White students had the next highest prevalence rates for most drugs.  Asian Americans had the lowest prevalence rates, and black students had prevalence levels nearly as low, except for marijuana.  Prevalence rates for the Hispanic groups were mostly in the intermediate ranges, except for a relatively high prevalence of cocaine use among the males.  Trend patterns for most forms of drug use have been similar across subgroups, with two notable exceptions:  (1) cocaine use increased somewhat more than average among Hispanic seniors and less than average among black seniors, (2) the proportions of those smoking cigarettes have declined more sharply among black than among white seniors, resulting in greater black-white differences in recent years.  Multivariate analyses indicate that subgroup differences in drug use cannot be attributed to background factors such as family composition, parents' education, region, or rural-urban distinctions.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Training Teachers to Integrate Prevention Concepts into the Primary Curriculum<BR>
<I>Koenig, L.</I></B><BR>
In <I>Working With Youth in High-Risk Environments:  Experiences in Prevention, CSAP Prevention Monograph 12,</I> C.E. Marcus, J.D. Swisher, Eds., pp. 140-150. Rockville, MD:  Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, 1992<BR>
(Available from the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information, P.O. Box 2345, Rockville, MD 20847-2345.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>Sixty primary grade teachers of a New York City public school district were trained in alcohol and other drug use prevention as one component of a Center for Substance Abuse Prevention grant project.  The goal of the training was to have the teachers understand the nature of addiction, to be able to recognize elements in the existing curriculum that have implications for prevention, and to develop the capacity to bring life skills training into the curriculum as a prevention strategy.  Resistance to training was encountered even when teachers were offered the highest rate of compensation for their participation in this school prevention program.  It is recognized that teachers today are faced with myriad expanding professional roles as well as normal family responsibilities.  Consequently, the teachers were reluctant to become involved with anything that required additional time commitments.  When the project staff presented their program to the teachers through another agency, however, interest was generated in participation in the more extensive training.  7 Ref.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

In <I>Preventing Adolescent Drug Use:  From Theory to Practice, OSAP Prevention Monograph 8,</I> pp. 127-181. Rockville, MD:  Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, 1991<BR>
(Available from the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information, P.O. Box 2345, Rockville, MD 20847-2345.) 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Early intervention is examined through new approaches to school-based prevention.  Entry into school marks a major transition in the developmental path toward adulthood and autonomous functioning.  And schooling itself has a pervasive influence on emotional and social development, as well as cognitive development.  The school is, in essence, a major socialization influence.  Research findings from four school-based early intervention programs show that models based on a holistic developmental approach and focused on promoting positive social development, rather than simply preventing problems, can lead to healthy development for some adolescents.  Based on these programs and other child development research, a tentative model of socialization and social development is proposed.  This model rests, in part, on the establishment of a positive affective bond between the individual child and important socializing agents and institutions.  The role of these agents is to promote interpersonal relatedness, competence, and autonomy.  The proposed model implies that schools should be concerned with the whole child.  The model presented can serve as an initial framework for guiding demonstration research projects in school-based prevention.  112 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from Paul M. Kingery, Ph.D., M.P.H., Health Promotion Program, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843-1255.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>The relationships between violence, drug use, and victimization were examined in a representative sample of American adolescents. The commonly used illegal drugs (marijuana, amyl/butyl nitrites, psychedelics, amphetamines, and cocaine) and alcohol were considered. Drug users, compared to nonusers, fought more, took more risks that predisposed them to assault, and were assaulted more both at school and outside school supervision. Adolescents who were victims at school were also more likely to be victimized outside of school supervision. This study clearly demonstrates that the aggressor may also be the victim, and that illegal drug/alcohol use is related to victimization. 43 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from the CDC National AIDS Clearinghouse, P.O. Box 6003, Rockville, MD 20849-6003.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is suggested that efforts to prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the United States must be targeted toward persons of all age groups at risk, including adolescents. Three national school-based surveys among high school students addressed HIV-risk behavior and school-based instruction. Each survey included similar questions about HIV instruction, discussion of AIDS or HIV-infection topics with parents, and HIV-related risk behaviors. The percentage of students who received HIV instruction in school increased significantly during 1989-1991, as did the percentage of students who discussed AIDS or HIV infection with parents or other adults in their families.  From 1989 to 1991, significant declines occurred in the percentages of students who reported ever having had sexual intercourse, having two or more sex partners during their lifetime, and having four or more sex partners during their lifetime.  While the overall percentage of sexually active students who reported using condoms did not change significantly from 1990 to 1991, when analyzed by age group, a significant increase was reported by those under the age of 15 years.  8 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information, P.O. Box 2345, Rockville, MD 20847-2345; 800-729-6686.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Drug-Free School Recognition Program was formed in 1987 to seek out and honor schools that have developed exemplary programs to combat student drug use.  There is a common core of experience and approach upon which each school draws; this core forms the basis of the Drug-Free School Recognition Program's indicators of success and includes:  (1) recognition and assessment of drug problems, (2) setting and enforcing policies, (3) teaching drug prevention, (4) staff development, (5) student involvement, (6) parent involvement, and (7) community involvement.  Entries are provided for each of the 47 winning schools from the 1988-1989 Drug-Free School Recognition Program.  The summaries of each program highlight the techniques, strategies, and activities used by the winning schools and focus on the individual methods employed to combat student drug use.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Youth & Alcohol:  Selected Reports to the Surgeon General</B><BR>
Report, U.S. Department of Education, Washington, DC, 1993<BR>
(Available from Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Mail Stop:  SSOP, Washington, DC 20402-9328.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>Underage drinking presents a serious health threat to the Nation's education goal that by the year 2000, all schools will be safe, disciplined, and drug free.  This monograph contains a collection of reports presented to the Surgeon General of the United States by the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services.  These reports contain information that will be useful to educators and administrators who develop or implement school-based alcohol and other drug prevention programs.  The reports outline the magnitude of the problem, discuss laws governing alcohol use by students, and provide insight into youth's attitudes about alcohol.  Divided into four chapters and an appendix, the contents include a report on the dangerous and deadly consequences of alcohol; drinking habits, access, attitudes, and knowledge from a national survey; drinking and crime; laws and enforcement; and a compendium of State laws.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Meta-Analysis of Adolescent Smoking Prevention Programs<BR>
<I>Bruvold, W.H.</I></B><BR>
<I>American Journal of Public Health </I>83(6):872-880, 1993<BR>
(Available from the Behavioral Sciences Program, School of Public Health, University of California - Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>A large number of studies evaluating adolescent smoking prevention programs has been published.  Systematic quantitative reviews of this literature are needed to learn what does and does not work.  The present meta-analysis focuses on the efficacy of school-based programs.  Evaluations of 94 separate interventions were included in the meta-analysis.  Studies were screened for methodological rigor and those with weaker methodology were segregated from those with more defensible methodology; major analyses focused on the latter.  Behavioral effect sizes were found to be largest for interventions with a social reinforcement orientation, moderate for interventions with either a developmental or a social norms orientation, and small for interventions with the traditional rational orientation.  Attitude effect sizes followed the same pattern, but knowledge effect sizes were similar across all four orientation categories.  Because behavioral effect represents the fundamental objective of programs for prevention of adolescent tobacco use, the present results indicate that school-based programs should consider adopting interventions with a social reinforcement, social norms, or developmental orientation.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Investigators Demonstrate Link Between Drug Use and Dropping Out of School</B><BR>
<I>Chemical People Newsletter</I>, January/February 1990<BR>
(Available from The National Media Outreach Center, 4802 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213.) 
<BLOCKQUOTE>This article is about the link between drug use and dropping out of school.  When a young person uses drugs, the odds the adolescent will not finish school increase significantly, according to data from a national survey conducted by two researchers in New York City.  If adolescents can be kept from or at least delayed from using drugs, the chances of them completing high school are much greater.  The earlier the drug involvement starts, the greater the risk of dropping out.  Other key factors in predicting dropping out of school include having a broken home at age 14, low self-esteem, and participation in delinquent activities.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Ebeling, J.H.</I></B><BR>
<I>Student Assistance Journal</I>, March/April 1991
<BLOCKQUOTE>A school-community partnership was developed in the town of Nanuet, New York, to bring schools, parents, and businesses together to address growing concern about the use of alcohol and other drugs by minors.  Nanuet SAFEHOMES mission is to empower parents to shape their children's values, attitudes, and behaviors concerning alcohol and other drug use.  A handbook was developed to serve as a resource guide for parents.  It contains information about local teenage drug trends and tells how to identify a suspected alcohol or other drug problem and where to go for help.  It also contains a pledge, which over 200 parents signed and returned, affirming that alcohol or other drug use by minors would not be tolerated.  A directory of these names was published, with addresses and telephone numbers of participating families.  The SAFEHOMES board is composed of school personnel, parents, and other community members who share responsibility for coordinating and implementing programs and activities.  The parents involved are establishing prevention programs in their own homes, setting up rules regarding parties and alcohol or other drug use.  Recently Nanuet SAFEHOMES began working with local police departments and area businesses to make these groups more responsive to parents' concerns regarding teenage drinking and drug use.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Peer Helping Programs<BR>
<I>Greis, L.C.</I></B><BR>
<I>Student Assistance Journal </I>3(2):22-25, 51, 1990
<BLOCKQUOTE>Peer helping is coming of age; new applications of the concept are being used every day.  The approach is the logical extension of two recent trends in human services delivery:  the use of paraprofessionals and the development of self-help groups.  Peer helping programs are not only cost effective, they also are potentially perpetual in operation because the students themselves are always changing.  When operating efficiently, peer helping functions like a quality group circle in which students manage student concerns and difficulties in an organized and structured fashion.  In the process, peer helpers gain invaluable knowledge, skills, and experience that they carry with them to adulthood.  When a school administration begins using peer helping techniques to service students' academic and social needs, existing gaps between needs and services begin to close and strides are made toward improving the total school environment.  12 Ref.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Working Together Model:  SAP as a Whole-School Effort<BR>
<I>Zimman, R.N. </I></B><BR>
<I>Student Assistance Journal</I>, May/June 1991<BR>
(Available from John Hipple, Appleton Area School District, Appleton, WI.) 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Many student assistance programs (SAPs) have a core team organizational structure in which a handful of staff members are given responsibility for planning SAP activities, screening referred students, and placing students in support groups.  Core teams limit ownership of the SAP to a narrow group, and the dependence of the SAP on a small group of people renders it vulnerable to failure, sabotage, and burnout.  The working together model for SAPs is based on the principle that the SAP should include as much of the school community as possible, rather than distancing itself through an exclusive structure.  By increasing the number of staff who are involved in the SAP, the working together model reduces the risk of program failure due to departure of a staff member, sabotage from staff who feel excluded, and burnout from trying to accomplish too much with too few people.  While only a few SAP team members will be group facilitators, others are needed to identify and refer students, make classroom presentations to students, make educational presentations to parents, make awareness presentations to organizations, maintain SAP records, design and conduct evaluations, and coordinate SAP activities.  SAP team members may be encouraged to volunteer 1 hour per week for SAP tasks.  Basic SAP training in the form of a 4- or 5-day experiential workshop is a prerequisite for placement on the SAP team roster.  An example is provided of a SAP based on the working together model.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Prevention of Alcoholism in Black Youth<BR>

(Available from Aspen Publishers, Inc., 200 Orchard Ridge Drive, Suite 200, Gaithersburg, MD 20878.) 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The most effective programs to prevent alcohol abuse among African American adolescents have adapted a culture-specific, alcohol-specific educational model that focuses on the individual and his or her environment.  An alcohol education program for black youth must provide opportunities for these youngsters to discard negativism.  Many of these youngsters have been hardened by the reality of their life styles, but it is possible to help them beyond the present and set positive goals for the future.  Because black youth often are confined to their communities, they may lack knowledge or exposure to the majority community; this can make any contact frustrating, intimidating, or frightening.  Because drinking is part of American society and African American culture as well, youth alcohol abuse prevention efforts should focus on teaching responsible decision making about alcohol use.  It is contended that an understanding of the reasons why youth drink, the influence of role models and value systems, and the significance of African American culture are important considerations when designing behavioral change programs.  11 Ref.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Study of Anabolic Steroid Use at the Secondary School Level:  Recommendations for Prevention<BR>

(Available from Human Kinetics Publishers, Inc., Box 5076, Champaign, IL 61825-5076.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>Anecdotal accounts from high school athletes, coaches, and athletic administrators suggest widespread anabolic steroids use, which prompted a groundbreaking 1988 survey.  The methods and results of this first nationwide survey of anabolic steroid use among the general adolescent male population are presented.  Based on these findings, 6.6 percent of 12th grade male students use or have used these drugs; this suggests that between 250,000 and 500,000 adolescents in the country have used or are using steroids currently.  Possible methods of preventing adolescent steroid use are discussed.  23 Ref.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Teens Helping Teens<BR>
<I>Yates, B.</I></B><BR>
<I>Adolescence Magazine </I>5(3):39-41, September 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>This article discusses and encourages the use of teens as peer counselors and peer teachers.  With sufficient training, mature teens are more effective than adults in encouraging honest dialogue or &quot selling&quot  an idea to their peers.  Students participate more enthusiastically and are more likely to internalize whatever suggestions come forth.  The positive effect of peer-helping upon peer-teachers, peer-helpers, and peer-tutors appears to be similar, regardless of background.  Self-esteem is noticeably improved for high-risk as well as honor-roll students.  The change is most apparent in teens who believe they have failed to accomplish anything meaningful in their lives.  Participation in these programs can fill the void that is created when teens feel they have no purpose or value at home, at school, or in their community.  The article mentions several programs that can be conducted by teens rather than adults.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Your Student Athletes Can Help Prevent AOD Use<BR>
<I>Milburn, S.B., and Smith, S.R.</I></B><BR>
<I>Student Assistance Journal </I>5(3):25-27, 37, 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>Student athletes perform in a &quot fish bowl&quot  in many communities.  Their feats and defeats are chronicled by local media.  Student athletes tend to be subjected to special public figure pressures.  Although student athletes are at special risk for AOD use, they are also in an excellent position to be positive role models for other youth, especially budding athletes.  This article suggests methods for models for athletes in prevention of AOD.  They include using the athlete as a peer helper in the classroom setting, establishing peer counseling problems with student athletes talking to young peers about AOD use, refusal skills, self-esteem, and other social competencies, and using student athletes as guest readers and discussion leaders.  As it recognizes these athletes as leaders in the awareness and prevention of AOD use, the community can reinforce the athletes' message with community pride and commitment to the same ideals.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Families and Schools Together (FAST):  Prevention Program That Works<BR>
<I>McDonald, L.</I></B><BR>
<I>Family Resource Coalition Report </I>10(3):10, 1991<BR>
(Available from Lynn McDonald, Ph.D., Family Service, Inc., 128 East Olin Avenue, Suite 100, Madison, WI 53713.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>Families and Schools Together (FAST) is a unique alcohol and drug prevention program, a collaboration between elementary schools, a mental health agency, an alcohol and other drug prevention agency, and families, that targets high risk elementary school children using a family-based approach.  FAST addresses four factors that have been correlated with adolescent substance abuse:  parent substance abuse; low self-esteem; inability to discuss feelings; and lack of routines, rituals, structure, and communication.  The children served by FAST are not yet involved with drugs, but are referred through their teachers who find them at risk for school failure, juvenile delinquency, and substance use.  The program focuses on strengthening families and building family participation in a community network.  Families eat together, engage in family strengthening activities, and learn communication skills.  Parents spend time with their at-risk child, which helps build self-esteem for both participants.  Families meet weekly in this way and also spend time at these meetings with representatives from the schools, the prevention agency, and the mental health agency.  Exposing families to information and resources in these meetings is seen as an important part of empowerment.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>You Can Make a Difference:  Characteristics and Skills of the Effective Prevention Teacher:  A Guide for Educators and Other Professionals<BR>
<I>Christensen, L.</I></B><BR>
Report, Johnson Institute, Minneapolis, MN, 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>Increasing national attention on chemical use and abuse by the young people in this country has led educators into the role of prevention specialists.  Teachers who begin to assume this role wonder what characteristics, skills, expertise, and approaches are needed to become effective prevention teachers.  To uncover the characteristics and skills that make a good prevention teacher, it is important to examine what researchers have defined as the three most important areas of competency for teaching prevention:  (1) teacher-student relationships; (2) teacher role modeling; and (3) clear information.  The teacher as source of support and referral, as a strong role model, and as a purveyor of reliable, timely, and age-appropriate information about chemical use, abuse, and consequences also are key competencies.  Teachers who have cultivated student relationships are the first to sense changes in student behavior, identify potential problems, and make suggestions for seeking help.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Fostering Resiliency in Kids:  Protective Factors in the Family, School, and Community<BR>
<I>Benard, B.</I></B><BR>
Report, August 1991, 27 p.<BR>
(Available from the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory, 101 Southwest Main Street, Suite 500, Portland, OR 97204.) 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The major protective factors that research has identified as contributing to the development of resiliency in youth are discussed.  The commonly identified attributes of resilient children usually includes the qualities of responsiveness, flexibility, empathy and caring, communication skills, a sense of humor, and any other prosocial behavior.  Resilient children are considerably more responsive, more active, and more flexible and adaptable.  The attributes of social competence, problem-solving skills, autonomy, and sense of purpose appear to be the common threads running through the personalities of resilient children.  What clearly emerges as a powerful predictor of the outcome for children and youth is the quality of the immediate caregiving environment.  Families that establish high expectations for their children's behavior from an early age play a role in developing resiliency in their children.  When children are given responsibilities, the message is communicated that they are worthy and capable of being contributing members of the family.  For families to create an environment characterized by the qualities of caring, high expectations, and opportunities for participation, they, in turn, must exist in communities that provide support and opportunities.  Caring peers and friends in the school and community environments help create resilient youngsters.  Schools that establish high expectations for all kids, and give them the support necessary to achieve them, have high rates of academic success.  138 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><P>Parents and guardians have a tremendous influence on the attitudes and behavior of their children.  As substance abuse touches the lives of millions of children and families, parents must take the opportunity to help their children learn a wide variety of skills that will help them keep away from alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs.  Violence, AIDS, and teenage pregnancy are just a few of the risks associated with alcohol and other drug use.  It is our job to keep our children safe and healthy. </P>

This resource guide provides information and referrals to assist parents and guardians, as well as information and resources for prevention specialists and community leaders.  We at CSAP look forward to working side by side with you toward a brighter future for all of our nuclear and extended families. <BR>

<B>Families, Adolescents, and Drugs:  Review and Interpretation of the Research Literature<BR>
<I>Carlson, A.C.</I></B><BR>
In:  R. Pedone and M. K. Gwaltney, Eds., <I>Perspectives on Preventing Student Drug Abuse</I><BR>
Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Education, 1989. 270 p. (pp. 45-65)
<BLOCKQUOTE>This review examines research literature on families, adolescents, and drugs.  It was not until the 1950s that illegal drug use among children and youth became a source of considerable worry.  Studies began to document a changing addict population.  Experts also began to detect a rising sense of rebellion among the urban young that threatened to extend beyond the slums.  The 1960s became a decade almost defined by the explosive increase in drug use among teenagers and young adults.  The change in American life, reflected in the drug arrest statistics, also could be witnessed in trends in family life.  Statistical evidence pointed to an unprecedented collapse of normative social arrangements.  The divorce rate rose 140 percent.  During the 1950-69 period, researchers in sociology and psychology, who looked at the family-drug equation, moved toward a common conclusion: family life, properly structured, could and did insulate children from drug experimentation and use, and the more traditional the family, the greater the degree of protection.  The implications of this paper, according to the author, show that the incidence of future drug use will be significantly related to the proportion of traditional families within the population.  The sum of the research data is unambiguous: children are insulated from the use of illicit drugs within intact families, where religion is an active and vital force, with many siblings and meaningful linkages to other relatives.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Parental Monitoring and Peer Influences on Adolescent Substance Use<BR>
<I>Steinberg, L.; Fletcher, A.; Darling, N.</I></B><BR>
<I>Pediatrics </I>93(6):1060-1064, 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>This study examined the joint influences of parental monitoring and peer influence on adolescent substance use over time.  Six thousand five hundred adolescents attending six high schools in Wisconsin and northern California were used in a longitudinal study.  Parental monitoring was negatively associated with substance use, whereas the more involved an adolescent's peers were in substance use, the more likely he or she also was to use drugs and alcohol.  Effects of monitoring and peer coercion were strongest for boys and girls at the transition into substance use, rather than at the transition from experimentation to regular use.  The effect of parental monitoring on changes in adolescent substance use is mediated not so much by the nature of the adolescent's peer associates, but by its direct effect on the adolescent.  Specifically, poorly monitored adolescents are more likely to use drugs, and drug-using adolescents seek out like-minded friends.  Once an adolescent associates with drug-using peers, his or her own substance use approaches their level.  Intervention efforts should include both parents and community-level efforts.  Parental monitoring is an effective tool both in the prevention of drug use and in the amelioration of drug use.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Differential Influence of Parental Smoking and Friends' Smoking on Adolescent Initiation and Escalation of Smoking<BR>
<I>Flay, B.R.; Hu, F.B.; Siddiqui, O.; Day, L.E.;  Hedeker, D.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Health and Social Behavior </I>35(3):248-265, 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>Smoking-related behaviors and attitudes of significant others (especially friends and parents) are among the most consistent predictors of adolescent smoking.  However, theorists remain divided on whether the behaviors of significant others influence adolescent smoking directly or indirectly, and the relative influence of parental and peer smoking on adolescents' own smoking is still a matter of debate.  In addition, little research has examined the role of significant others' behavior on different stages of smoking onset.  In particular, not much information is available regarding gender and ethnic differences in social influences on smoking behavior.  The authors use structural equation modeling to address these issues.  Various theoretical perspectives from cognitive-affective and social learning theories have been integrated into a structural model of smoking influence.  The results show that friends' smoking affects adolescent initiation into smoking both directly and indirectly, whereas parental smoking influences smoking initiation only indirectly.  The data also show that friends' and parents' smoking affect smoking escalation only indirectly.  In general, friends' smoking has a stronger effect on adolescents' smoking behavior, particularly on initiation.  Multiple group comparisons of the structural models predicting smoking initiation among males and females reveal that parental approval of smoking plays a significant mediating role for females, but not for males.  Comparisons of Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, and other ethnic groups reveal some significant differences in the pathways of friends' influences among the four groups.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Parenting Behaviors and the Onset of Smoking and Alcohol Use:  A Longitudinal Study<BR>
<I>Cohen, D.A.; Richardson, J.; LaBree, L. </I></B><BR>
<I>Pediatrics </I>94(3):368-375, 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>This study identified specific parenting behaviors associated with the onset of alcohol and tobacco use and how they are associated.  A prospective cohort study of two groups of preadolescents surveyed annually was conducted, the first group for 4 years, the second for 3 years.  In two public school districts in Southern California, 1034 fifth graders and 1266 seventh graders began the study after obtaining parental consent to complete surveys in a classroom setting.  By the last measurement, attrition was 37 and 38 percent for the two cohorts, respectively.  Researchers measured the onset of tobacco or alcohol use in the last month.  Children who reported that parents spent more time with them and communicated with them more frequently had lower onset rates of using alcohol and tobacco in the last month.  These parental interactions lead to more positive relationships with their children.  Parental monitoring and positive relations were protective factors for disruptive behavior and the selection of substance-using friends.  Disruptive behavior increased the odds of adolescents drinking in the last month approximately twofold and of smoking in the last month two to fourfold.  This study provides further evidence that parenting behaviors are significant precursors to adolescent disruptive behavior, vulnerability to peer pressure, and subsequent substance use.  Future substance use prevention programs should target parents before their children reach adolescence.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Knowledge and Attitudes of Parents Who Smoke About the Smoking Behavior of Their Children<BR>
<I>Stacy, R.D. and McIlvain, H.E.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Alcohol and Drug Education </I>40(1):103-114, 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>The purpose of this exploratory study was to determine the knowledge about smoking issues, attitudes about smoking by their children, and beliefs about their ability to prevent their children from smoking among parents who smoke and have children in the sixth grade.  Sixty parents who smoke and have children in the sixth grade were selected at random from elementary schools in the Omaha, NE, public schools.  Results indicate that although there are areas where these parents seem to have an adequate level of knowledge about smoking, there are other crucial areas about which their knowledge is incomplete or lacking.  Their attitudes about their children and smoking are generally positive.  They generally do not believe that they will be effective in preventing their children from smoking.  Limitations and recommendations are presented.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Peer and Parental Influences on Adolescents' Substance Use:  A Path Analysis<BR>
<I>Webster, R.A.; Hunter, M.; Keats, J.A. </I></B><BR>
<I>The International Journal of the Addictions</I> 29(5), 647-657, 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>Five hundred and seven 14- to 16-year-old students gave self-report responses to a substance use questionnaire.  The questionnaire assessed adolescents' use, preferences, and norms and also their perceptions of their parents' and peers' use and norms in relation to alcohol, tobacco, and tea/coffee.  Path analysis revealed that adolescents' internalization of parental and peer pressures is a stronger predictor of substance use than are direct effects.  Internalized effects occur by means of preferences rather than norms, and peer pressure is predominantly through modeling behavior, whereas parental influence is through perceived normative standards.  Peers' influence is stronger in relation to tobacco use, parental influence is stronger in relation to tea/coffee use, and both are equally important in relation to alcohol use.  These findings are discussed in relation to preventive strategies.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Parental Dissatisfaction with Sons in Substance Abusing Families:  Relationship to Child and Parent Dysfunction<BR>
<I>Ammerman, R.T.; Loeber, R.; Kolko, D.J.; Blackson, T.C.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Child and Adolescent Substance Abuse </I>3(4):23-36, 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>Considerable attention has focused on the role of family dysfunction in the development of adolescent substance use, particularly in families where a parent has a history of alcohol and drug abuse.  This study examined parental reports of dissatisfaction with 41 boys (ages 10-12) of fathers with a history of substance abuse (SA+) and 68 boys of fathers without such a history (SA-).  Higher dissatisfaction ratings by both mothers and fathers were found in the SA+ group in contrast to the SA- group.  Both child externalizing behavior problems and parental personality characteristics were correlated with dissatisfaction.  Stepwise regression analysis revealed that fathers' negative affectivity, followed by externalizing symptoms in the boys, were most predictive of dissatisfaction in both mothers and fathers.  The implications of these results for an understanding of the adverse family context of substance abuse are discussed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Parental Divorce and the Change in Drinking Behavior From High School to College<BR>
<I>Billingham, R.E.; Post, J.; Gross, W.C. </I></B>
<I>Psychological Reports </I></B>72(3):1275-1281, 1993
<BLOCKQUOTE>A survey of 192 male and 289 female college students provided information about their drinking behavior both currently and in their senior year in high school.  These data were analyzed by students' sex and family structure.  Men drank significantly more than women.  No differences for family structure were noted.  Students from divorced families drank less, while students from intact families drank more than they did as seniors in high school.  This was true for more men than women.  Results support the position that current drinking behavior may be associated with a decrease in parental or adult supervision, which is experienced earlier for those whose parents have divorced and later (upon entering college) for those students whose parents have not divorced.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Urine Drug Screening of Adolescents on Request of Parents<BR>
<I>Tennant, F.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Child & Adolescent Substance Abuse </I>3(3):75-81, 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>The availability of urine screening has resulted in parents seeking this procedure when they suspect their adolescent uses drugs.  To systematically evaluate this practice, 100 consecutive adolescents were screened by use of a sensitive quantitative method that can detect low levels of drug use.  A total of 43 percent of the adolescents tested positive for one or more drugs, and 25 percent entered treatment.  Eight (8 percent) proved dependent upon drugs to the point of requiring medical detoxification or inpatient treatment.  In this study, urine screening, which was done for clinical rather than punitive purposes, appeared to facilitate entry into treatment.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This study compared the frequency of substance use disorders and symptoms between adults reporting child physical abuse or neglect and individually matched control subjects in a community sample.  In a nested case-control study, 169 adults reporting physical abuse of a child and 209 adults reporting neglect of a child, from 11,622 individuals were successfully interviewed in a probabilistic survey in four communities.  Subjects were individually matched with control subjects drawn from the participants.  Case subjects were compared with control subjects on the number of alcohol- or drug-related symptoms and disorder diagnoses as determined by symptoms from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule.  Respondents reporting either physical abuse or neglect of children were much more likely than their matched control subjects to report substance abuse or dependence.  These differences persisted after potential confounding variables were controlled.  Parental substance abuse and dependence, independent of confounding factors, are highly associated with child maltreatment.  Inconsistent results in previous studies may have arisen from reliance on referred samples and unstandardized assessment methods.  Agencies involved in the care of abused or neglected children and their families should consider incorporating routine substance abuse evaluations with treatment, or referral for treatment, where indicated.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Parent-Child Closeness Affects the Similarity of Drinking Levels Between Parents and Their College-Age Children<BR>
<I>Jung, J.</I></B><BR>
<I>Addictive Behaviors </I>20(1):61-67, 1995
<BLOCKQUOTE>College males reported drinking more frequently and in higher amounts than females.  Correlations between quantity-frequency (QF) indices of drinking by parents and by their college-age children showed the greatest similarity between fathers and sons.  Log linear analyses compared each parent's drinking level against each of three other factors that might affect the QF levels of college-age children: the relationship between parent and child, the effect of the parent's drinking on the parent, and how the parent's drinking affected his or her treatment of the child.  The results supported models in which the relationship of each parent's drinking to the QF levels of both sons and daughters was affected by the closeness of the parent-child relationship.  However, there was no support for models involving how each parent's drinking affected that parent or how each parent's drinking affected treatment of the child.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Cultural forces affect family interaction when adolescents are acculturated and their parents are underacculturated.  These changes often underlie behavioral problems and drug abuse in immigrant adolescents.  The process of multiculturation occurs in stages:  The first stage occurs when new immigrants move to communities that are totally Hispanic/ Latino, comprised of families from every Latin American nation.  The second stage occurs when these new immigrants are exposed to a fuller community made up of non-Hispanic/Latino cultures, particularly African Americans.  The challenge for these new Hispanic/Latino immigrants is to overcome nationalistic and racial differences and learn to live among and get along with other Hispanic/Latino and non-Hispanic/Latino cultures.  In Miami, Multicultural Effectiveness Training (MET) consists of four 2-hour sessions on cultural diversity, adaptation, managing problem behavior, and conflict resolution.  The lessons give Hispanic immigrant and refugee families the skills to thrive in a multicultural society.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Attitudes of Central American Parents Toward Alcohol Use by Their Children<BR>
<I>Tyler, F.B.; Tyler, S.L.; Kaljee, L.M.; Hopps, H.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Alcohol and Drug Education </I>39(2):25-36, 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>As part of a peer counseling program, 71 parents in a predominantly Central American neighborhood in Washington, DC, were interviewed to determine their attitudes toward the use of alcohol by their sons and daughters.  Parents overwhelmingly considered their own drinking behavior to influence their children's drinking behavior, but generally would not permit their children to drink.  However, they said they would do little if they discovered that their children were drinking without their permission.  Recommendations are made for including attention to these parental inconsistencies in Latino youth oriented alcohol prevention or intervention programs.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Family System Characteristics and Parental Behaviors as Predictors of Adolescent Substance Use<BR>
<I>Anderson, A.R. and Henry, C.S.</I></B><BR>
<I>Adolescence </I>29(114):405-420, 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>The purpose of this study was to examine adolescent perceptions of family system characteristics and parental behaviors as predictors of adolescent substance use.  Self-report questionnaire data were collected from a sample of 489 high school students.  Bivariate correlations and multiple regression analysis were used to examine the research hypotheses.  Results indicated that the frequency of parental substance use was positively related to adolescent substance use, while family bonding and parental support were negatively related.  The results provide support for considering both family system characteristics and parenting behaviors in relation to adolescent substance use.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Influence of Family Disharmony and Parental Alcohol Use on Adolescent Social Skills, Self-Efficacy, and Alcohol Use<BR>
<I>Webb, J.A. and Baer, P.E.</I></B><BR>
<I>Addictive Behaviors </I>20(1):127-135, 1995
<BLOCKQUOTE>Defects in social skills have been found to be related to adolescent substance use.  Little effort has been devoted to understanding how family factors influence the acquisition of these skills.  This study examined the manner in which family disharmony and parental alcohol use affect adolescent alcohol use through their influence on the acquisition of social skills and self-efficacy regarding one's ability to utilize these skills.  It was hypothesized that family disharmony and parental alcohol use directly influenced usage and affected usage indirectly through their influence on acquisition of social skills.  Social skills were also hypothesized to affect usage directly and to affect usage indirectly by influencing beliefs regarding one's ability to implement these skills.  Results indicated that family disharmony was directly related to adolescent alcohol use and social skills.  Parental alcohol use was related only to adolescent usage, not to social skills.  Social skills were related to self-efficacy, which was related to alcohol use but was not directly related to usage.  Results are discussed in terms of the importance of family influences on adolescent alcohol use, the importance of including families in prevention efforts, and the importance of the acquisition of self-efficacy relative to social skills.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>National Survey Results on Drug Use from the Monitoring the Future Study, 1975-1993:  Volume 1, Secondary School Students<BR>

(Available from NCADI, P.O. Box 2345, Rockville, MD 20847-2345; 800-729-6686.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>The results of the 19th national survey of drug use and related attitudes among American high school seniors, and the third such survey of 8th and 10th grade students are presented.  Most notably, this year's results indicate a sharp rise in marijuana use in all three grade levels.  In addition, use of other illicit drugs in the past year rose among seniors, but remains substantially below the peak rate in 1981.  Prescription-controlled stimulants showed evidence of a turnaround in 1993, with prevalence rates increasing among all three populations.  Inhalants constitute another class of abusable substance where a troublesome increase was seen in 1993.  However, cocaine and crack cocaine use have continued to decline and PCP use has remained low.  Seniors' use of tranquilizers has also continued to decline.  The annual prevalence of heroin use has been steady since 1979 among high school seniors, and the use of opiates other than heroin has been fairly level over most of the life of the study.  Trends in cigarette smoking and other substance use also are examined.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Specialized Treatment Can Help Pregnant and Parenting Teenagers Who Abuse Drugs<BR>

(Available from NCADI, P.O. Box 2345, Rockville, MD 20847-2345; 800-729-6686.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>Early results of two research projects indicate that specialized training added to comprehensive rehabilitation programs can help pregnant and parenting teenagers who have used drugs or who are at risk of using drugs to improve the quality of their lives and function better in society.  Girls who receive vocational training along with a comprehensive rehabilitation package use drugs less often, have fewer new pregnancies, and are more successful in securing jobs after completing the program than girls who get the rehabilitation package without the job training.  Data also indicate that mothers who get job training suffer less depression and have better peer relations than mothers who do not receive training.  Intensive skills training improves the quality of the teenagers' social networks and upgrades their social skills as well.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Parenting and Early Development Among Children of Drug-Abusing Women:  Effects of Home Intervention<BR>
<I>Black, M.M.; Nair, P.; Kight, C.; Wachtel, R.; Roby, P.; Schuler, M.</I></B><BR>
<I>Pediatrics </I>94(4):440-448, 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of home intervention on parenting behavior and attitudes of drug-abusing women and on development of their children.  A randomized, clinical trial of 60 drug-abusing women were recruited prenatally and randomized into an intervention (n=31) or comparison (n=29) group.  Most mothers were single, African-American, multiparous, and non-high school graduates from low-income families.  Approximately 40 percent of the women were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive, all admitted to either cocaine and/or heroin use, and 62  percent had a history of incarceration.  Intervention and comparison group women did not differ on any background variables.  All children received primary care in a multidisciplinary clinic.  Biweekly home visits were provided by a nurse beginning before delivery and extending through 18 months of life.  The intervention was designed to provide maternal support and to promote parenting, child development, the utilization of informal and formal resources, and advocacy.  Behavioral measures included self-reported ongoing drug abuse, compliance with primary care appointments, and an observation of the child-centered quality of the home (HOME Scale).  Parenting attitudes were measured by the Child Abuse Potential Inventory (CAPI) and the Parenting Stress Index.  The CAPI was administered before initiating the intervention and the Parenting Stress Index was administered when the children were 18 months of age.  Developmental status was measured with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development administered at 6, 12, and 18 months.  Repeated measures multivariate analyses of variance were used to examine changes in parenting attitudes and children's development.  Analyses of covariance were used to examine compliance with primary care appointments and the quality of the home.  Logistic regression was used to examine ongoing drug abuse.  Birth weight and maternal education were used as covariates in all analyses.  To control for social desirability, the faking-good index of the CAPI was included as a covariate in analyses involving self-report measures.  Women in the intervention group were marginally more likely to report being drug-free (P - .059) and were compliant with primary care appointments for their children (P = .033) and provided marginally more opportunities for stimulation (P = .065).  At 18 months parents reported more normative attitudes regarding parenting and more child-related stress than they had initially, but the differences were not related to intervention status.  At 6 months infants in the intervention group obtained marginally higher cognitive scores (P = .099); at 12 and 18 months there were no differences.  The findings suggest a cautious optimism regarding the efficacy of early home intervention among drug-abusing women in promoting positive behaviors.  Subsequent investigations of home intervention should include larger sample sizes and more intensive options.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3> From the Acting Director of CSAP...</H3>
<B><P>The number of children using inhalants has nearly doubled in the last 10 years.  Youth are using regular household, office, and classroom products to get high, and many are suffering the damaging effects to the heart, kidney, liver, and brain.  Some are even dying from this dangerously popular craze. </P>
<BR>
We at CSAP want to change this and prevent even one more child from misusing these products.  This resource guide is one step in our prevention venture and we want you -- teachers, parents, community leaders -- to join us in this undertaking.  Together we can stamp out inhalant and other drug problems and together we can prove again that Prevention <I>Works!</I>

<BLOCKQUOTE>In the fall of 1989, the University of Texas, Health Sciences Center, and the Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse convened a meeting to review the state of knowledge on inhalant use and stimulate inquiry into aspects of this complex problem.  During this meeting it became obvious that, unlike other areas of drug abuse research, no cohesive group of investigators has directly addressed research or treatment of inhalant use.  The lack of cohesion of inquiry into solvent use may result, in part, from both the unusual patterns shown by the abusers and the nature of the substances themselves.  Many dimensions that differentiate inhalant users from other drug abusers are described in this volume.  Not only does this group use an enormous array of substances, the individuals themselves are a complex cross-section of many sociocultural and psychological dimensions.  Many exhibit particularly dysfunctional behavior patterns, making them especially resistant to treatment.  While volatile solvent users share many characteristics with other drug users, enough differences exist to make many researchers and treatment personnel reluctant to become involved with these populations and their behavior.  The format of the conference focused on broad fields of endeavor.  Each section was introduced by a review of the state of knowledge in a particular area followed by discussions and relevant short papers.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Nitrite Inhalants:  Patterns of Abuse in Baltimore and Washington, DC<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Nitrite inhalants, as drugs of abuse, have received a new prominence in the literature since their use has been associated with Kaposi's Sarcoma and possibly other manifestations of AIDS.  Changes in patterns and prevalence of use have not been investigated since the onset of the AIDS epidemic.  Researchers have examined the use patterns of nitrite inhalants (poppers) in several different groups.  The use of poppers among drug abusers in the Baltimore-Washington, DC, metropolitan area has remained constant over the past 5 years, with the prevalence of use being approximately 11 percent for occasional drug users and 22 percent for heavy users.  Self-reported use by a homosexual group had decreased over the same period.  Sixty-nine percent of the homosexual sample had experience with nitrites, but only 21 percent had used them in the 6 months before being surveyed.  The mean interval since last use was 25 months, and since peak use, 4.1 years.  Among substance abusers, nitrites appear to be a drug whose use starts late, with the mean age of first use being 25.6 years compared to 14.6 years for glue, 17.6 years for marijuana, and 18.5 years for heroin.  Researchers found both heterosexual and homosexual groups use nitrites primarily to &quotget high,&quot but homosexuals more often use them during overt sexual activity.  Experience with amyl nitrite was much more prevalent than with the butyl derivative in both populations.  It is concluded that the prevalence of nitrite abuse among drug users has not changed because of the AIDS epidemic, but such use appears to have decreased within the homosexual community.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The problem of inhalant use is highlighted.  The populations at risk are identified.  Various approaches for control, prevention, and intervention of inhalant use are discussed.  Inhalant abuse is increasing both in the United States and in neighboring countries.  Prevalence appears to differ greatly by subgroups.  Inhalant abusers can be grouped into three categories:  (1) inhalant-dependent adults; (2) polydrug users; and (3) young inhalant users.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This case report examines a patient who acutely used excessive amounts of N2O and presented with symptoms of a severe mood disorder without any of the usually reported symptoms.  A computer search of the literature  revealed no reports in which an acute N2O user presented with a severe mood disorder as the sole symptom complex.  This case report is intended to introduce clinicians working in the field of substance abuse to this newly described disorder.  The patient's diagnosis, Nitrous Oxide Mood Disorder, conforms to DSM-III-R (American Psychiatric Association 1987) nomenclature for the diagnostic category &quotOther Psychoactive Substance-Induced Mood Disorder.&quot</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>A growing body of evidence suggests that nitrites may play an important role in the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.  The inhalation of volatile nitrite vapors produces diffuse relaxation of smooth muscle, thereby causing an intense vasodilation with flushing, a fall in blood pressure, and a reflex tachycardia.  Two distinct, high-risk groups were surveyed about their use of nitrites.  Homosexual men reported an appreciable decline in nitrite inhalant use, while substance abusers (predominantly a heterosexual group) showed not much change in nitrite inhalant use for the years studied (1981-1986).  One other study found that nitrite inhalation induces change in the immune system by initially suppressing immune function and later following with a period of non-specific stimulation.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Inhalant-Related Medical Emergencies Highest in Southwest</B><BR>

(Available from CSAP's National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information, P.O. Box 2345, Rockville, MD  20847-2345)
<BLOCKQUOTE>Three of the four metropolitan areas with the highest number of inhalant-related emergency room episodes have been in the Southwestern United States, according to NIDA's Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN).  Hispanics  accounted for 22 percent of the emergency room episodes in which inhalants were reported, a significant overrepresentation of that ethnic group compared with their numbers in the total population.  The DAWN data may not reflect the full magnitude of medical problems related to inhalant use, and inhalants may contribute to more deaths than are reported in the medical examiner data.  Most inhalants cannot be detected through metabolites in tissue or blood and are never identified in autopsies or toxicological examinations.  Long-term effects of inhalants can be insidious and often do not precipitate a medical emergency or death.  For this reason, chronic abusers may experience health problems related to inhalant use but never enter the emergency room or end up on the medical examiner's autopsy table.  Data for these cases, therefore, would not show up in DAWN.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>American Indian children under age 10 are sniffing paint, gasoline, aerosol sprays, and model glue at an alarming rate.  Sometimes, entire families spanning three generations are buying and sniffing paint by the case.  Inhalant users are invariably ostracized by the community.  Inhaling solvents has serious physical and psychological repercussions.  Inhalant use may result in thought dysfunction, irreversible brain damage, and coma.  Other serious effects include leukemia, liver damage, hearing loss, kidney dysfunction, and permanent paralysis.  Recovery from the physical effects of inhalant use can take from 6 to 12 months.  Most treatment programs are not equipped to deal with such a long withdrawal and recovery period.  Adolescents generally use inhalants within the context of their peer groups.  Therefore, it is necessary to treat the entire peer cluster, not just the individual.  Detoxification centers have become concerned about the increase in the number of inhalant users being readmitted for continued inhalant use.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Inhaling a variety of substances for recreational purposes is a health problem of worldwide proportions.  The inhalation of non-narcotic agents, such as volatile inhalants (e.g., solvents and glues), anesthetics and nitrites, adds significantly to the growing number of substance abusers.  This is of particular concern because it affects the younger members of the population, and the substances abused are, for the most part,  legally obtainable.  The toxicity of these inhaled substances is reviewed and compared, as is their potential for addiction and dependence.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>According to the U.S. Indian Health Service, substance abuse is the most urgent health problem facing American Indians.  Inhalants are among the first drugs used by Indian youth, with first use occurring at approximately the same time as the onset for cigarette smoking.  Although prevalence rates vary among Indian subpopulations,  Indian youth generally have much higher rates of inhalant use than non- Indian youth.  Furthermore, while other drugs are showing a downward trend among Indian youth, inhalant use is increasing slightly.  This paper examines this phenomena by reviewing related epidemiological, social, and clinical issues.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Barrio Inhalant Abuse Model:  Clinical Typologies and Program Strategies<BR>
<I>Jasso, R.</I></B><BR>
Conference Paper, November 7, 1989<BR>
(Available from Ricardo Jasso, Southwest Associates, 1306 West Commerce, San Antonio, TX 78207.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Barrio Inhalant Model acknowledges that Chicano adolescent inhalant users are bicultural and assumes that language and culture play a significant role in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of inhalant use.  The author contends that Chicanos do not participate and fully benefit in Anglo-oriented substance abuse programs.  Besides, traditional prevention and treatment approaches are ineffective and do not deter barrio children and adolescents from using and abusing inhalants.  The Barrio Inhalant Abuse Model presents a more precise typology of inhalant use:  experimental, recreational, habitual, chronic, and dependent.  The social characteristics of each typology are outlined.  This model uses several intervention and treatment strategies, each conducted in a community-based setting.  These program strategies are described, specific to the typology of inhalant use.  It is suggested that this model could be modified for use in the Native American community, which also has a high degree of inhalant use.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The use of toxicant inhalants among school-age youth is recognized as a growing and serious problem in the United States.  Prevalence estimates of inhalant use show wide geographic differences in both the size and growth of the problem.  The common perception is that inhalant use is an especially serious problem among Mexican American youth living in barrios and Native American youth living on reservations.  Although inhalant use is considered a problem among poor Mexican American and Native American youth living in areas of the southwest, national and State surveys generally have not shown it to be a greater problem among these minority groups.  The exact relationships between ethnic background, socioeconomic class, and toxicant inhalant use are not clear at present, but many other factors associated with its use have been noted.  More males than females engage in inhalant use, school surveys have shown that inhalant use was associated with poor academic performance and social adjustment in school.  Several studies have shown that inhalant use is correlated with negative and inconsistent family interactions, deviant peers, low self-esteem, and poor psychological adjustment.  Several etiological, epidemiological, and developmental issues associated with toxicant inhalant use among Mexican American youth were studied, including reasons that youth believe cause toxicant inhalant use, parental behaviors and influences, the influences of cultural background and acculturation, physical symptoms and psychological distress, and prospective efforts to predict drug use and criminality outcome.  Results are pending.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Inhalant use is the intentional deep breathing of gases from a substance for the effect of obtaining a high.  Inhalant use can cause various allergic reactions.  Other immediate effects include loss of feeling in limbs, blurred eyesight, asphyxiation, irregular heartbeat, nausea, amnesia, and brain, lung, nerve, liver, kidney, and bone damage.  As the sniffing persists, the body's tolerance weakens and the effects become permanent.  Sniffing is hard to control because the substances are sold for legitimate purposes.  The Aerosol Education Bureau (AEB) distributes information to youth concerning the dangers of inhalant use, and they are spreading the word to friends.  But the problem still  exists, across all boundaries, including age.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Inhalants:  A Review of Current Literature and Research</B><BR>
Report, November 1991<BR>
(Available from DIN Publications, P.O. Box 27568, Tempe, AZ 85285.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>Inhalants include a variety of household and industrial chemicals that are sometimes sniffed for their psychoactive effects.  Typically, they fall into three categories:  (1) solvents; (2) aerosols; and (3) nitrites.  Most inhalants are powerful central nervous system depressants, with effects ranging from dizziness and numbness to nausea and blackout.  Nitrous oxide is an anesthetic gas and mild pain reliever, while the nitrites are fast-acting heart stimulants.  Concern over products containing butyl nitrite, and research linking it with an AIDS-related cancer, led to a Federal ban on the chemical in 1989.  Sniffing remains a persistent element in the American drug abuse picture and is a major problem among Native Americans.  According to senior survey data, 18.5 percent of the class of 1990 have used inhalants, compared with 18.2 percent of the class of 1979.

<B>Fatal Attraction:  &quotHow Huffing Kills&quot</B><BR>
<I>Redbook, </I>March 1993, pp. 78, 118, 120
<BLOCKQUOTE>This article looks at the increasingly popular youth activity known as huffing -- getting high by inhaling the organic solvents used to make aerosol sprays and petroleum products.  In just 10 years the number of youth who have used an inhalant has nearly doubled, and more than twice as many high school youth will huff as will use cocaine or LSD.  Inhalants are more poisonous to the body than all other drugs combined, and because inhalants are extremely accessible, inexpensive, concealable, and easy to use, more youth are picking up this potentially fatal habit.  Case studies are presented, and a listing of &quotdrugs&quot you may not recognize and warning signs you may miss are included.  The International Institute for Inhalant Abuse is listed as a contact for more information.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Drug use by Native American youth ages 12 to 17 is discussed.  Headings within this chapter include:  (1) a brief history of epidemiological drug studies, (2) drugs and Native American youth, (3) inhalant use by Indian youth, (4) cultural identification and drug use of Indian youth, (5) emotional distress and drug use of Indian youth, and (6) peer clusters and drug use of Indian youth.  It is found that Indian adolescents who live on reservations have high rates of use of marijuana, inhalants, and stimulants.  These rates are higher than those found in other American youth although Indian culture does not encourage drug usage.  However, it is stressed that susceptibility of Indian youth differs from other adolescents only because of poverty, prejudice, and lack of educational, economic, and social opportunity.  133 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>From the Acting Director of CSAP...</H3>
<P><B>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, roughly 419,000 people die in the United States from tobacco use every year.  Teenagers make up the largest percentage of new cigarette smokers and studies show that tobacco is one of the most common &quotgateway drugs&quot there is.  Obviously, the problem of tobacco use among our country's youth must be addressed.</P>
<P>CSAP recognizes the seriousness of tobacco problems and is working diligently to bring hope for a healthier tomorrow.  Designed to aid prevention specialists, educators, parents, and others, this resource guide includes a listing of exciting and colorful prevention materials, useful research abstracts, and relevant resources for your use and attention.  Prevention works.  We can save lives.</P>

<B>Preventing Tobacco Use Among Young People: A Report of the Surgeon General</B><BR>
Report, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (in press), 1994<BR>
(Available from CDC: 800-CDC-1311)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One out of three adolescents in the United States is using tobacco by age 18, adolescent users become adult users, and few people begin using tobacco after age 18.  Preventing young people from starting to use tobacco is the key to reducing the death and disease caused by tobacco use.  This report documents that intervention programs targeting the broad social environment of adolescents are both effective and warranted.  The report examines the health effects of early tobacco use, the reasons why young people begin using tobacco, the extent to which they use it, and efforts to prevent tobacco use by this population.  Six major conclusions are highlighted: 1) Nearly all first tobacco use occurs before high school graduation; 2) Most adolescent smokers are addicted to nicotine and report that they want to quit; 3) Tobacco is often the first drug used by those young people who use alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs; 4) Adolescents with lower levels of school achievement, with fewer skills to resist pervasive influences, with friends who use tobacco, and with poorer self-images are more likely than their peers to use tobacco; 5) Cigarette advertising appears to increase young people's risk of smoking; and 6) Community-wide efforts, which include tobacco tax increases, enforcement of minors' access laws, youth-<BR>oriented mass media campaigns, and school-based programs, are successful in reducing adolescent use of tobacco.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Tobacco May Provide Gateway to Drug, Alcohol Abuse <BR>
<I>Keegen, A.</I></B><BR>
<I>NIDA Notes </I>Summer/Fall 1991<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Scientists are accumulating evidence that tobacco and its key ingredient, nicotine, may provide a gateway to illicit drug use and alcohol abuse.  While the use of tobacco products is not a specific cause of drug and alcohol abuse, it clearly is one of the most powerful, preventable risk factors preceding drug and alcohol abuse.  Three characteristics of tobacco that may be involved in the subsequent abuse of drugs or alcohol are outlined.  First, nicotine is a potent, addicting drug.  Second, cigarette smoking is a complex learned behavior.  Third, nicotine is used to regulate mood and behavior; it provides relief from stress and boredom.  Tobacco then becomes a stepping stone to other drug use.  Other factors making a person vulnerable to drug use include stress, socioeconomic status, exposure frequency, and possibly even genetic predisposition; however, tobacco use is the most preventable risk factor to such behavior.  3 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from Linda Dusenbury, Department of Public Health, Cornell University Medical College, 411 East 69th Street, New York, NY  10021.)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The authors examined prevalence rates and risk factors for smoking among Latino adolescents, using a multiethnic sample of sixth- and seventh-grade students (n = 3,129) in 47 New York City public and parochial schools.  The students completed questionnaires; self-reported smoking data were collected by means of the &quotbogus pipeline&quot technique.  The largest group of Latino students (43 percent) was Puerto Rican; 20 percent were of Dominican background, 7 percent were Colombian, and 7 percent were Ecuadorian.  &quotCurrent smoking&quot was defined as smoking at least once per month. A series of logistic regression analyses indicated that peer influence was the strongest predictor of smoking. Family influence was important as well.  The results are discussed in terms of their implications for prevention. 13 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>More American women are taking up smoking than men and fewer are quitting; if current trends continue, rates for women will surpass those for men by the mid-1990s.  But ironically, much of what is known about the biobehavioral aspects of smoking is based on research using male subjects.  The present paper reviews evidence suggesting that:  (1) women may differ from men with regard to nicotine intake and/or effects; (2) nicotine intake and effects may be influenced by menstrual cycle phase; (3) oral contraceptive use and estrogen replacement therapy may affect intake and effects of nicotine; (4) the effects of chronic nicotine use on female reproductive endocrinology may have implications for the reinforcement of smoking; and (5) pharmacological agents used to treat smoking may have different effects in women than in men. Guidelines and suggestions are presented by future biobehavioral research in women, including standardization of assessment procedures, attention to the use of appropriate controls, and use of pharmacological probes. 40 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Journal of Drug Education </I>20(1):15-29, 1990<BR>
(Available from Lawrence R. Krupka, Michigan State University, Department of Natural Sciences, East Lansing, MI  48824.)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The number and content of tobacco advertisements were examined in 74 gender-oriented popular magazines published during the summer of 1988.  More ads were present in women's than men's magazines, and the messages contained in these ads were differentially stressed as a function of the magazine's primary readership. The type of Surgeon General's warning appearing in an ad often was not directed toward the typical concerns of the readership of the magazine in which the ad appeared.  This survey, and a follow-up 3 months later, indicated that the Surgeon General's report on nicotine addiction, published in the Spring of 1988, had no apparent effect on the number of ads placed.  Advertising revenues received by publishers from conglomerates that control the manufacture of foods as well as tobacco products may be partially responsible for this finding.  It was concluded that effective drug education programs should encourage skepticism when tobacco advertisements are examined.  28 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Adolescents, as the fastest growing group of smokers, have been a focus and concern of health educators and researchers.  Adolescent smoking is of particular interest because initiation and early habits are known to have important implications for lifetime smoking or cessation. Despite the well-known centrality of the peer group in adolescent behavior, smoking cessation programs have been largely directed toward individuals rather than groups, with emphasis on encouraging the individual to say &quotno.&quot In this article, smoking behavior and peer group patterns among a sample of 1,689 eighth-grade students from southern Ontario were assessed.  It was found that peer groups are crucially important in the initiation of smoking among young adolescents, particularly girls.  The patterns of indirect peer influence on girls is such that girls are less likely to stop smoking once they have begun than are boys.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Tobacco Foes Attack Ads That Target Women, Minorities, Teens, and the Poor</B> <BR>
<I>JAMA: Journal of the American Medical Association </I>264(12):1505, 1990<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Advocates for women, minorities, youth, and economically disadvantaged people are among the anti-smoking activists adopting what they see as the tobacco industry's own tactics:  moving away from wide-angle warnings about the long-term health hazards and focusing instead on different brands, the smoker's self-image, and the short-term social consequences, in messages tailored to these specific groups.  Four hundred thousand of the 2.5 million smokers the tobacco industry loses every year are lost because of tobacco-related deaths.  The new smokers that act as replacements for these are children, with an average starting use age of 12.5 years.  A variety of activities that organizations are pursuing to end the tobacco advertisements targeted to high-risk groups are outlined.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The extent to which cigarette advertising contributes to increases in smoking has been debated by public health professionals and the tobacco industry. One aspect of this debate has been the degree to which advertising influences smoking among adolescents. Previous research suggests that there are significant relationships between measures of advertising and smoking. However, potential simultaneous relationships between these measures have not been addressed. Observed correlations may arise from the effects of advertising on smoking or from smokers' selective exposure to advertisements. This study examined relationships between cigarette advertising and smoking experimentation. Using environmental and psychological measures of advertising exposure, it was demonstrated that adolescents who experimented with cigarettes were better able to recognize advertised products than those who had not, a selective exposure effect. Conversely, subjects who were better at recognizing advertised brands were more likely to have experimented with cigarettes, an effect due to their exposure to cigarette advertising.  34 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Tobacco Use by American Indian Youth<BR>
<I>Moncher, M. S.; Schinke, S. P.; Holden, G. W.; and Aragon, S.</I></B><BR>
<I>JAMA:  Journal of the American Medical Association </I>262(11):1469, 1989<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A study of 1,150 female and male American Indian youth revealed high rates of tobacco use. Responding to 126 items on a confidential questionnaire, children reported their lifetime prevalence of smoked and smokeless tobacco and their use during the prior 7 days and 24 hours. Analysis of self-reported tobacco use focused on rates of lifetime prevalence, recent incidence, and peer use. The present findings, together with other data, suggest the need for more research on the development of culturally sensitive assessment and prevention interventions targeting tobacco use among American Indian youths.  4 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Aspects of attention behavior in 4 to 7 year olds, as assessed by auditory and visual vigilance tasks, were related to prenatal exposure to cigarettes. Data on 76 to 79 children born to healthy, White, predominantly middle-class women were analyzed using multiple regression techniques controlling for potentially confounding variables including postnatal second hand smoke exposure. Cigarette smoking during pregnancy was related to an increased activity level of the children during the tasks and increased errors of commission in the auditory task and, to a lesser degree, in the visual task. After controlling for confounding factors, the relationship between prenatal smoking and errors of omission did not retain significance. The combination of results suggest that the deficits in attention may reflect impulsive responding and increased overall activity.  25 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from Prevention File, Program on Alcohol Issues, UCSD Extension, X-001, La Jolla, CA  92093.)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A coalition of 22 health and community groups is asking the Federal government to limit the alcohol content of malt liquor -- a high-proof beer -- and restrain the advertising of the product aimed at Blacks and Hispanics. The life expectancy of Black Americans has declined as a result of deaths from types of cancer linked to drinking and smoking, as well as AIDS and homicide. The death rate for liver cirrhosis, linked with heavy drinking, is nearly twice as high for Blacks as for the rest of the population. Blacks also suffer disproportionately from cancer of the esophagus, also linked to drinking and smoking. Alcoholism rates are also higher among Blacks. The high incidence among Blacks of disease and illness associated with alcohol is paralleled by high rates of disease linked to the use of tobacco, including cancer, heart disease, and stroke.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Two studies were conducted to investigate unrealistic optimism among adolescent cigarette smokers. In the first study, 54 smokers and 304 nonsmokers agreed that there was a strong relationship between smoking and lung cancer. Nonsmokers accurately predicted their chances of contracting lung cancer as below average. However, smokers perceived themselves as having only an average chance of contracting lung cancer. The second study replicated the first in both procedure and results regarding lung cancer, but also added perceptions of the relationship between smoking and two other smoking-related health problems, emphysema and heart attacks. The results were similar: 33 smokers rated their chances of developing emphysema and having heart attacks as higher than 299 nonsmokers, but still viewed their chances as only about average. Finally, perceptions of stress were examined. Smokers perceived themselves to be under more stress than nonsmokers. It was concluded that self-deception as indicated by unrealistic optimism regarding the chances of getting smoking-related diseases characterized adolescent smokers.  7 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Teenage girls comprise the largest percentage of new cigarette smokers in the United States today.  Factors contributing to smoking initiation include peer pressure, family and social influences, cigarette availability, and cigarette advertising.  Because three-quarters of smokers become dependent on cigarettes by age 20, smoking prevention programs aimed at the adolescent population have great potential.  The proposed program outlined is directed at girls 12 to 18 years of age in New York City.  Among the objectives are increasing students' knowledge of the short- and long-term health effects of smoking and awareness of the social factors that lead to smoking. Participants would be taught social skills and behaviors that could help them to resist initiating smoking, by such activities as assertiveness training through role playing.  Endurance sports activities would be emphasized while learning of the effects of smoking on physical conditioning.  The costs of such a program are estimated, and classroom activities are outlined.  25 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Oral snuff and chewing tobacco, commonly referred to as smokeless spitting tobacco, are being used by many adolescent and young adult males, and no indication exists that use by this group is declining. Users are at risk for oral cancer, noncancerous oral pathology such as leukoplakias, and addiction. Information about patterns of smokeless tobacco use and motivations of users may help planners develop and implement interventions. Variables include the importance of peer and family influences, social image, knowledge of harmful effects, regional differences, use of other substances, and addiction. Due to the addictive nature of smokeless tobacco, older youth may need cessation programs. Health educators are encouraged to include smokeless tobacco in their tobacco use prevention programs and to develop and implement comprehensive tobacco interventions appropriate for their youth population.  43 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This report discusses the health consequences of smokeless tobacco use. It constitutes a comprehensive review by an advisory committee to the U.S. Surgeon General of the available scientific literature to determine the health consequences of using smokeless tobacco. After a careful examination of the relevant epidemiologic, experimental, and clinical data, the committee concludes that the oral use of smokeless tobacco represents a significant health risk. It is not a safe substitute for smoking cigarettes. It can cause cancer and a number of noncancerous oral conditions and can lead to nicotine addiction and dependence. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This report examines the scientific evidence that cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are addicting. Despite the significant health risks of tobacco use, many smokers have great difficulty in quitting.  Nicotine is the drug in tobacco that causes addiction.  The pharmacologies and behavioral processes that determine tobacco addiction are similar to those that determine addiction to drugs such as cocaine and heroin.  Tobacco use is a disorder that can be remedied through medical attention.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>For older smokers, as for smokers of any age, smoking is a modifiable behavior with serious health consequences. Unfortunately, the body of knowledge aimed at helping older smokers quit is limited because older smokers have been a lower priority for research than younger populations. This state of affairs must change. Although the prevalence of smoking is somewhat lower in the older population than in young groups, older adults are at least equally interested in personal health promotion; the consequences of continued smoking are especially serious for them; and the benefits of their quitting are substantial. For example, smoking cessation can improve vital capacity and reduce disability and can reduce costs to third-party reimbursers of health care costs, including the Federal government. Clearly, older Americans who smoke should be encouraged to quit smoking.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>More than 38 million Americans have quit smoking, and almost half of all living adults in the United States who ever smoked have quit. Nevertheless, more than 50 million Americans continue to smoke. This report reviews in detail the health consequences of smoking cessation for those who have quit and for those who will quit in the future. The following conclusions summarize the health consequences of smoking cessation for those who quit smoking in comparison with those who continue to smoke: (1) Smoking cessation has major and immediate health benefits for men and women of all ages. (2) Former smokers live longer than continuing smokers. (3) Smoking cessation decreases the risk of lung cancer, other cancers, heart attack, stroke, and chronic lung disease. (4) Women who stop smoking before pregnancy or during the first 3 to 4 months of pregnancy reduce their risk of having a low birthweight baby to that of women who never smoked. (5) The health benefits of smoking cessation far exceed any risks from the average 5-pound (2.3-kilogram) weight gain or any adverse psychological effects that may follow quitting.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from Cancer Information Service, 800-4-CANCER.)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A summary is provided of what has been learned over the past 40 years of the public health effort against tobacco smoking -- from the early trial-and-error health information campaigns of the 1960s to the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) science-based ASSIST project (the American Stop Smoking Intervention Study for Cancer Prevention), which began in the fall of 1991. An historical accounting of these efforts is presented, as well as the reasons why comprehensive smoking control strategies are now needed to address the smoker's total environment and reduce smoking prevalence significantly over the next decade.  While the data clearly show that only White male smokers reacted to the first wave of public information in the 1950s, the counteradvertising campaigns of the late 1960s produced a greater level of smoking cessation across all major demographic groups. The current state of the art in combatting tobacco use combines multiple environmental changes with multiple programs directed to individuals in different stages of the smoking initiation and cessation process.  This strategy recognizes that no single approach is best for all individuals, that no one intervention channel is capable of effectively reaching all smokers, and that no single time is best for individual smokers to make an attempt to quit.  The ASSIST framework incorporates a three-axis model, consisting of target populations, intervention channels, and interventions.  More than 90 million Americans will be directly affected by ASSIST over the life of the project. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Youth Access to Tobacco</B><BR>
Office of the Inspector General/DHHS, December, 1992<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In July 1992, the President signed the ADAMHA Reorganization Act, which requires States to ban the sale and distribution of tobacco products to anyone under the age of 18 by October 1, 1994.  This report examines the current accessibility of tobacco to minors, and discusses State and Federal options to reduce the accessibility problem.  Although most States prohibit the sale of tobacco to minors, their failure to enforce their laws would place them out of compliance with the new Federal law.  The survey reports the following findings: (1) All but three States ban the sale of tobacco to minors under the age of 18;  (2) Only two States are enforcing laws restricting the sale of minors statewide;  (3) A few States are funding local initiatives to reduce youth access; (4) Low priority by police and lack of a designated enforcer are seen as obstacles to enforcement; (5) Despite lack of State efforts, some localities are demonstrating enforcement is possible; and (6) Vending machine restrictions are the most common initiative.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Model Sale of Tobacco Products to Minors Control Act</B><BR>
Department of Health and Human Services, May 24, 1990<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Access of minors to tobacco is a major problem in every State of the Nation.  This document contains a model law recommended for adoption by States or localities to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors.  The law would do the following: (1) Create a licensing system, similar to that used to control the sale of alcoholic beverages, under which a store may sell tobacco to adults only if it avoids making sales to minors.  Signs stating that sales to minors are illegal would be required; (2) Set forth a graduated schedule of penalties--monetary fines and license suspensions--for illegal sales so that owners and employees face punishment proportionate to their violation of the law; (3) Provide separate penalties for failure to post a sign, and higher penalties for sales without a license; (4) Place primary, but not exclusive, responsibility for investigation and enforcement in a designated State agency; (5) Rely primarily on State-administered civil penalties to avoid the time delays and costs of the court system, but allow use of local courts to assess fines, similar to traffic enforcement; (6) Set the age of legal purchase at 19; (7) Ban the use of vending machines; and (8) Contain a number of features to minimize burdens on retail outlets. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Reducing the Health Consequences of Smoking: 25 Years of Progress.  A Report of the Surgeon General</B><BR>
Atlanta, Georgia: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1989<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This report examines the fundamental developments over the past quarter century in smoking prevalence and in mortality caused by smoking.  It highlights important gains in preventing smoking and smoking-related disease, reviews changes in programs and policies designed to reduce smoking, and emphasizes sources of continuing concern and remaining challenges. Five major conclusions are drawn from this report.  They are: (1) The prevalence of smoking among adults decreased from 40 percent in 1965 to 29 percent in 1987; (2) Between 1964 and 1985, approximately 750,000 smoking-related deaths were avoided or postponed as a result of decisions to quit smoking or not to start; (3) The prevalence of smoking remains higher among Blacks, blue-collar workers, and less educated persons than among the overall population.  The decline in smoking has been substantially slower among women than among men; (4) Smoking begins primarily during childhood and adolescence; and (5) Smoking is responsible for more than one of every six deaths in the United States.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Cigarette smoking is the chief preventable cause of death in our society.  This report presents health and cost consequences of tobacco use to Congress and the American people, broken down by each of the 50 States.  The report shows that smoking is a particularly important problem for young Americans -- nearly all smokers now start smoking regularly in their teenage years.  In addition, data show that cigarette smoking is becoming increasingly concentrated among Americans with lower incomes and less education.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Clinical Interventions to Prevent Tobacco Use by Children and Adolescents <BR>
<I>Epps, R.P., and Manley, M.W.</I></B><BR>
National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute/American Academy of Pediatrics, [1991]<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Each day more than 3,000 children in the United States begin to use tobacco.  Physicians who treat children have the opportunity to play a major role in fostering the prevention and cessation of smoking.  This guide provides physicians with general recommendations on how to help prevent, delay, or minimize the use of tobacco among children and adolescents.  Physicians are asked to: (1) Anticipate the risk for tobacco use at each developmental stage; (2) Ask about exposure to tobacco smoke and tobacco use at each visit; (3) Advise all smoking parents to stop and all children not to use tobacco products; (4) Assist children in resisting tobacco use, and assist tobacco users in quitting; and (5) Arrange followup visits as required.  Specific suggestions are broken down according to three developmental ages. 17 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Smokeless Tobacco or Health: An International Perspective</B><BR>
National Cancer Institute, Smoking and Tobacco Control, Monograph 2, 1992<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Smokeless tobacco use is increasing throughout the United States, especially among children.  With more than 30,000 new cases of oral cancer reported in 1991 for the United States alone, it is time that use of smokeless tobacco take its rightful place next to cigarette smoking, in national and world consciousness, as a serious health risk that must be stopped.  This monograph, which includes a keynote address from HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, M.D., and a forward from U.S. Surgeon General Antonia Novello, M.D., discusses the issues and implications surrounding smoking tobacco use, and offers recommendations on prevention, cessation, and policy.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Gateway Theory Revisited:  Alcohol, Cigarette, and Marijuana Use Patterns of Young Adults
<I>Yu, J., and Williford, W. R.</I></B><BR>
Report, New York State Division of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse, Albany, NY, 1990<BR>
(Available from Jiang Yu, Ph.D., New York State Division of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse, 194 Washington Avenue, Albany, NY 12210.) <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Using the data from the New York State Youth Alcohol Survey (1986), the authors re-examined the gateway theory. Logit analysis is employed to estimate the causal effect of using one type of drug on the subsequent use of other drugs. Comparisons are made between male and female alcohol and other drug use patterns. The data suggest that alcohol use tends to increase the chance of using cigarettes, and the chance of marijuana use is increased by the use of alcohol and cigarettes. The onset age of alcohol use is found to influence the current pattern of alcohol and other drug use; most young adult current alcohol and other drug users started drinking in the critical onset age period between 13 and 16.  21 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The purpose of this study was to compare longitudinal smoking prevention program effects estimated on a population-based cohort sample of sixth-grade students (average n per year = 4,664) using different schools as units of analysis (middle/junior high school as the school of origin or high school of intervention). Fifty schools in 15 school districts were demographically matched and assigned to either a school and community-based program for prevention of cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use, or a health education as usual control group. Smoking was measured by questionnaires administered to the students. An expired air (CO) measure of smoking was also administered to increase accuracy of self-reports. Program effects were estimated with regression analyses, controlling for school-level socioeconomic status, racial/ethnic make-up, urbanicity, and grade. Using school of origin as the unit of analysis, program effects showed 1-year net reductions of -8, -6, and -5 percent in prevalence rates of smoking in the last month, last week, and last 24 hours; 2-year program effects showed similar net reductions of -6, -5, and -3 percent (P's-0.001). Analyses with endpoint school as the unit showed slightly weaker effects at the 2-year follow-up, the year during which 64 percent of students had moved to a junior high or high school. The findings are discussed in terms of the potential contamination of experimental groups in longitudinal studies from school consolidations, family mobility, and feeder patterns to high schools, and the different smoking environments represented by middle, junior high, and high schools.  35 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Alcohol and tobacco consumption have been identified as leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Despite this fact, these drugs are sold legally and advertising is generally permitted. A variety of restrictions have, nonetheless, been imposed on both the sales and the advertising of these products and still others have been proposed, though this has become a highly controversial issue and the source of considerable debate. The aspect of this debate, which centers on children and adolescents, is the topic of this article.  Public health advocates claim that recent alarming trends in the prevalence of alcohol and tobacco use among minors are due, at least in part, to the extensive advertising campaigns in which these industries engage. Industry representatives retort that, since no scientific research study has proven that their ads cause consumption among this age group, these claims are unfounded. The purpose of this article is to analyze what have, to date, been sources of considerable confusion in this area and to suggest an alternative framework for future discussions. 69 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Brown University Digest of Addiction Theory and Application </I>8(7):7-8, 1989<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This study measured the effect of ambient tobacco smoke on nonsmokers flying on typical commercial flights. Nine nonsmoking subjects (four flight attendants and five passengers) participated on each of four flights. The attendants were rotated between smoking and nonsmoking sections while the passengers were seated in or near smoking sections. All the subjects on all flights were exposed to measurable levels of smoke. In addition, many perceived a smoky environment and experienced eye and nose irritation. Cotinine (a nicotine metabolite) levels in urine returned to preflight levels 72 hours postflight. The authors concluded that even with the segregation of smoking and nonsmoking sections, passive tobacco smoking in closed environments posed a health risk.  5 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Smoking and tobacco-chewing habits of sixth and seventh graders were investigated. Four hundred thirty-three White, Black, Mexican-American, and Oriental students in San Diego public schools self-reported their tobacco use as well as perceptions of use among their peers and friends, parental socioeconomic status, and other variables. One-third of the respondents had used some form of tobacco at least once, with cigarette smoking more common than chewing. Norm perceptions and best friend's habits predicted both smoking and chewing experimentation and prevalence. White males were more frequent &quotchewers,&quot while Blacks and Mexican-Americans were more frequent smokers. Significant associations between the two types of tobacco use were also found.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The evidence that environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) increases risk of death from heart disease is similar to that available when the Surgeon General concluded that ETS caused lung cancer in healthy nonsmokers.  ETS increases risk of death from heart disease by 30 percent among nonsmokers living with smokers.  ETS adversely affects platelet function and damages arterial endothelium.  ETS significantly reduces exercise capability of healthy people and those with heart disease, as well as mitochondrial respiration.  The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in ETS accelerate the development of atherosclerotic plaque.  ETS causes heart disease and is the third leading preventable cause of death, after active smoking and alcohol.  71 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Smokeless Tobacco Addictive, and a Gateway Drug<BR>
<I>Henningfield, J.</I></B><BR>
<I>Tobacco and Youth Report </I>Autumn 1990<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The danger of smokeless tobacco, as a gateway to using illicit drugs and as a relatively difficult drug to quit using, is described in this article. Marketing strategies that appeal to youth are described, including starter products that taste like candy and are often given as samples. The article cites research that indicates that use of smokeless tobacco escalates at a rate four times that of cigarettes. The marketing and the addiction rate is implicated in a six-fold increase in the number of males age 17 to 19 who regularly use smokeless tobacco. Research is reported to support the contention that smokeless tobacco is a gateway drug.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Gender Differences in Psychosocial Determinants of Adolescent Smoking<BR>

(Available from Serena Clayton, University of California - Los Angeles, Division of Behavioral Sciences and Health Education, Los Angeles, CA  90024.)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Because of the social meaning smoking has acquired and because of different trends in male and female initiation rates, it is reasonable to suspect that different psychosocial factors predict smoking in teenage boys and girls. A literature review revealed external pressures such as peer and parental smoking are important for both boys and girls though their influence may be moderated differentially by age and type of smoking assessed. Some data support the hypothesis that female smoking is associated with self-confidence, social experience, and rebellion, whereas male smoking is associated with social insecurity. Overall, group differences such as gender and socioeconomic status are well-documented in terms of smoking prevalence but underexplored in the area of psychosocial predictors. In this review, gender differences have been documented with sufficient frequency to warrant further attention to develop gender specific components of smoking prevention programs.  28 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Despite significant change in smoking patterns among women during the 1980s, the toll in tobacco-related morbidity and mortality remains high and will continue to rise for some diseases (e.g., lung cancer).  Women with lower educational attainment are at particularly high risk for smoking initiation and continuation.  Advances in gender-specific knowledge regarding the processes on initiation, cessation, and relapse provide more specific opportunities for targeted intervention.  Strategies for change involve media, clinical approaches, and public health efforts.  Emphasis needs to be placed on tailoring the message and on using innovative channels through which women can be effectively reached.  Advocacy groups are targeting public policies affecting women.  Ongoing gender-specific research is needed in the next decade. 136 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Teen Smoking Boosts Risk for Later Pot Use</B><BR>
<I>The Bottom Line </I>1991<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>According to a recent analysis of Federal surveys, adolescent cigarette smokers are 100 times more likely to smoke pot than are teenage non-smokers.  Many believe that tobacco addiction serves as a major gateway to other forms of drug addiction.  Not only does smoking tobacco predict later use of marijuana, but increasing levels of tobacco use also are associated with future episodes with other illicit drugs such as cocaine and heroin.  Tobacco is one of the most important preventable risk factors for the development of other drug addictions.  Other survey results conclude that tobacco appears to be more addictive than alcohol or other drugs, 40 percent of those teenagers who smoke daily had been drunk in the last 30 days, users of smokeless tobacco were more likely to use cigarettes, marijuana, or alcohol than non-users, and use of other drugs such as heroin, cocaine, amphetamines, and sedatives is associated with increased levels of nicotine dependence.  It is believed that studying tobacco use can serve as a model to investigate the biological mechanisms of those other drug dependencies, and that more effective efforts to prevent smoking might help curtail the spread of illicit drug use.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Previous research suggests that maternal smoking during pregnancy remains prevalent, particularly among adolescents.  However, little is known about the factors related to smoking during adolescent pregnancy.  The goal of the present study is to identify intrapersonal, familial, and peer factors that are related to smoking during adolescent pregnancy, and to determine the relative degree to which they affect this behavior.  Interviews were conducted with 241 unmarried pregnant adolescents who planned to carry their pregnancies to term.  Consistent with previous studies, 27 percent of the respondents reported daily smoking during pregnancy, and Whites reported higher rates of use than members of other racial groups.  Smoking during adolescent pregnancy was related to intrapersonal, familial, and peer factors.  The results of a regression analysis suggest that perceived parental disapproval of smoking during pregnancy, friends' cigarette use, and race play a particularly important role in this behavior.  The implications of these findings for preventive programs are discussed.  36 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Child Development </I>61(2):557-565, 1990<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The relationship between ethnicity and psychosocial factors and alcohol and/or tobacco use during adolescence was evaluated.  The study sample included 2,125 seventh grade students in 47 public and parochial schools in New York City that contained at least 25 percent Hispanic students.  The study evaluated the differences between Black, Anglo, Puerto Rican, and Dominican adolescents in cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and psychosocial functioning.  The study results revealed the following: (1) Public school students reported less use of alcohol but similar use of tobacco when compared to parochial school students; (2) Dominican students reported more use of alcohol than Black and Puerto Ricans, while Puerto Ricans reported more use than Blacks; and (3) There was no significant difference in tobacco use between the three ethnic groups.  In addition, the data indicate that psychosocial functioning affects substance use differently in the groups and that the use of alcohol may be more compatible with Dominican culture than the others. However, it is not clear whether these constructs will predict increased drug use by adolescents or not.  33 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Health Psychology </I>63 p.[1985]<BR>
(Available from Brian R. Flay, Health Behavior Research Institute, 1985 Zonal Avenue, Los Angeles, CA  90033.)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Twenty-six school-based studies of psychosocial approaches to smoking prevention are reviewed. Two major approaches are represented: the &quotsocial influences&quot approach, and the broader &quotlife/social skills&quot approaches. The research studies are considered in four &quotgenerations&quot: (1) The seminal work by Richard Evans and colleagues at the University of Houston; (2) Seven &quotpilot&quot studies of improved programs at Stanford, Minnesota, New York and Washington, with one school or classroom per experimental condition; (3) Eleven improved &quotprototype&quot studies by these four groups and others, with two or three units randomly assigned to conditions; and (4) Six studies where maximizing internal validity was of prime concern. None of the pilot or prototype studies considered alone provided interpretable results; however, reported results were fairly consistent, with each tested program seeming to reduce smoking onset by about 50 percent. The major contribution of the pilot and prototype studies was improved programs and methods. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Every Cloud Has a Silver Lining, Even with Airline Smoking Ban</B><BR>
<I>Bottom Line </I>9(4):48-50, 1990<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Now that the airlines have banned in-flight smoking, some smokers have found that chewing gum, taking deep breaths, and eating tend to calm the urge to light up. Coffee and alcohol offer no relief at all in easing the pain from nicotine withdrawal. The biggest help for cigarette-addicted flyers is CigArrest Gum, advertised as &quotThe Traveler's Smoking Alternative.&quot It became air travelers' only alternative to lighting up, and includes a stop-smoking kit, tablets, and the new gum. More competition is on the way, principally from makers of nicotine patches that slowly release nicotine into the wearer's skin to ease withdrawal symptoms. Leading marketers say the airline smoking ban may encourage other manufacturers to end CigArrest's dominance in the growing market for &quotsmoking cessation&quot products. The CigArrest products are an important option for people who won't spend $500 to $1000 to go to a smoking cessation clinic or who don't have the time. More important, they are affordable, readily accessible and available when motivation is high.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from Thomas J. Glynn, National Cancer Institute, Smoking, Tobacco, and Cancer Program, Executive Plaza North, #320, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD  20892.)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This essay suggests approaches to two issues of importance to the future of tobacco use control research. First, there is need to identify those areas of tobacco use prevention and cessation research that have evolved to the point where additional investigation would only bring incremental gains. The reduction potential of this research should then be consolidated by applying existing, effective interventions widely and systematically. Conversely, there is need to identify those areas in which additional research is necessary. Second, the most logical way to reach agreement on those areas which are ready to move from research to application-of-research is, with the cooperation and advice of the research community, through the large funding organizations which have supported this research over the past two decades. It is these organizations which, once the most effective interventions are identified, are capable of supporting the centrally planned, consensus-driven, comprehensive approaches to tobacco use control which will be necessary to continued success in reducing tobacco-related mortality in the industrialized world and to begin addressing the growing problems of tobacco use in the developing world. </BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from the American Public Health Association, 1015 15th Street, NW, Washington, DC  20005.)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This monograph reviews and synthesizes evaluations of 56 mass media programs and campaigns designed to reduce cigarette smoking. Programs are divided into three groups according to format and objectives: (1) Programs and campaigns designed to inform smokers about the consequences of smoking and to motivate smokers to want to quit; (2) Programs and campaigns designed to promote some specific action preparatory to smoking cessation; and (3) Televised self-help cessation clinics.  The programs and campaigns providing information and/or motivation generally produced significant changes in awareness, knowledge, and attitudes; however, only extensive national campaigns also produced meaningful behavior change.  Programs and campaigns promoting specific actions produced mixed results, depending in large part on the type of promotion involved.  Televised self-help clinics were generally effective.  Viewing alone was as effective as using an effective self-help manual, while requesting a manual to accompany a self-help clinic almost doubled the effectiveness of television alone.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Public Citizen's Health Research Group, Advocacy Institute, August 1992<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Between the 1988 Presidential election and August 1992, roughly $3.11 million in tobacco soft money was given to Republicans and Democrats.  This report analyzes the role this tobacco money plays in enacting White House policies, and asserts that many anti-tobacco efforts have been squelched due to the tobacco industry's strong influence on the executive branch.  The report is divided into four parts:  Part one, entitled, <I>The Money</I>, charts the extent which tobacco donations are made to political figures, citing that through June 30, 1992, the tobacco industry gave over $2 million for the 1992 election;  <I>The People</I>, part two, lists and describes 45 people in the Bush, Clinton, Reagan, and previous administrations or campaigns with strong ties to or presence in the tobacco industry;  Part three, <I>The Policies</I>, explains that recent presidential policies have been to oppose legislation to place more controls over tobacco use and to simultaneously force American tobacco into foreign markets via the U.S. Trade Representative; and Part four, <I>Recommendations</I>, offers three suggestions:  (1) Presidential candidates should refuse to accept any contribution from the tobacco industry; (2) No tobacco industry officials should be in key administration or campaign posts; and (3) The new president should push for legislation to ban all tobacco advertising and to substantially increase Federal excise tax cigarettes as Canada has done. 122 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>The Congressional Addiction to Tobacco: How the Tobacco Lobby Suffocates Federal Health Policy<BR>
<I>Wolfe, S.; Douglas, C.; Wilbur, P.; Kirshenbaum, M.; McCarthy, P.; Bame, A.; and McKnew, D.</I></B><BR>
Public Citizen's Health Research Group Advocacy Institute, October 1992<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Despite the fact that tobacco is the leading preventable cause of death and disease in the United States and around the world, Congress has done very little to combat the tobacco epidemic.  This is the most comprehensive report to date regarding the tobacco industry's successful attempt to buy Congress and the deadly pro-tobacco legislative gridlock that continues to afflict our Federal legislators.  There are four sections of this report.  In the first section, <I>The Death Money</I>, the authors focus on the money the industry has contributed to congressional campaigns, and also examine the additional personal contributions made by tobacco industry executives and lobbyists, and those individuals who support the tobacco political action committees (PACs).  The second section of the report, <I>The Policies</I>, looks at the impact of the tobacco industry money and influence on the business of Congress, that is the making of public policy.  Section three, <I>Public Opinion</I>, examines the desires of the majority of the American people, and determines that congressional inaction is not what the majority favors.  In section four, <I>Recommendations</I>, the authors suggest that candidates for Congress not accept any contributions from tobacco companies or their representatives, and that members of Congress start to represent the wishes of their real constituents, as opposed to those of the tobacco lobby, by enacting strong public health policies to combat the devastating health and economic problems wrought by tobacco. 93 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>
<P>CSAP recognizes that youth in low-income environments face tremendous pressures every day.  Economic, social, environmental, and familial complications put these youngsters at high risk for developing alcohol and other drug (AOD) problems.  We at CSAP have heard the requests for more prevention information specifically designed for those working with young people in rural and urban settings.  </P>
This Resource Guide provides research, information, and referrals to assist youth and family members, as well as the community leaders and prevention specialists who work with them.  We are now delighted to share it with you. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Traffic accidents are the leading cause of death for teenagers, taking 4,000 lives annually.  Young males from blue-collar backgrounds are particularly likely to die in alcohol-related crashes.  They tend to drink beer and drink to the point of intoxication more often than peers in other demographic groups.  This report finds that beer manufacturers are spending up to $50 million per year on motor sports sponsorships.  The report documents how American beer companies link beer and fast cars in a carefully crafted effort to promote beer, especially among working class youth and young adults who are part of the &quotcar culture.&quot  The report advocates an eventual ban on sponsorship of motor sports by alcohol companies.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>The Role of Social Factors and Individual Characteristics in Promoting Alcohol Use Among Inner-City Minority Youths<BR>
<I>Epstein, J.A.; Botvin, G.J.; Diaz, T.; Schinke, S.P.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Studies on Alcohol </I>56(1):39-46, 1995
<BLOCKQUOTE>During seventh grade, many adolescents initiate alcohol use yet school drop-out rates are still low.  Therefore, this is an ideal period of adolescence to examine predictors of alcohol use.  The purpose of this study was to elucidate the etiology of alcohol use among an understudied population: disadvantaged inner-city minority youths.  The authors attempted to develop as complete a model of predictors of alcohol use as possible from three domains: background characteristics, social influences to drink and individual characteristics. To explore alcohol use of youths who are living in poverty and are members of minority groups, New York City public schools from districts known to have predominantly minority student bodies with low socio-economics status (SES) were identified. Self-reports of alcohol use and data concerning background, social, environmental, and individual characteristics hypothesized to promote drinking alcohol were collected from Black and Hispanic seventh graders (N=757). Logistic regression analyses indicated that social influences from friends, peers, and parents predicted alcohol use.  Most interestingly, the drinking status of the person the respondent most admired was related to drunkenness and future alcohol use.  Individual characteristics, such as health-related knowledge concerning alcohol use and antidrinking attitudes, lowered the odds of drinking. These findings imply that effective prevention programs targeting inner-city minority youths should provide students with awareness of the social influences to drink, provide them with positive role models, and correct misperceptions about the prevalence of drinking among friends and peers.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Life Choices of African-American Youth Living in Public Housing:  Perspectives on Drug Trafficking<BR>
<I>Ricardo, I.B.</I></B><BR>
<I>Pediatrics </I>93(6):1055-1059, 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>Our understanding of youth involvement with drug trafficking is derived mainly from survey data. Personal narratives present the life choices that low-income, urban African-American youth perceive and the decisions that they make.  Narratives provide insight into the complexities inherent in those choices. Twenty youth were interviewed through semiclinical, open-ended interviews.  Youths were asked to describe their perceptions of how people their age make choices about becoming involved or refraining from involvement in drug trafficking.  Data were analyzed within the context of psychological factors that  influence child development, including attributions of personal meaning and identify formation. Youth narratives reflect an awareness of the contradictory messages present within their environments. Youths articulate the importance of family and peer influences on their decisions to encourage in or refrain from the drug trafficking. Their perceptions of themselves as belonging to a racial minority group also influence their views regarding the viable alternatives available to them for achieving success.  Youth who are able to identify alternative activities from which they can derive positive experiences are less likely to become involved in drug trafficking.  Recommendations for intervention at the familial, community, and institutional levels are discussed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Drug Use, Drug Trafficking, and Weapon Carrying Among Low-Income, African-American, Early Adolescent Boys<BR>
<I>Black, M.M.; Ricardo, I.B.</I></B><BR>
<I>Pediatrics </I>93(6):1065-1072, 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>The authors examined relationships involving three extremely high-risk behaviors (drug use, drug trafficking, and weapon carrying) among low-income, urban, African-American early adolescent boys using both quantitative and qualitative methods.  The quantitative phase included 192 African-American boys from 9 through 15 years of age recruited from reaction centers located in low-income communities. Youth completed a survey addressing personal risk practices; intentions to engage in risk practices; risk taking among family, friends and community; and values toward risk practices.  They also completed standardized assessments of sensation seeking, perceived peer pressure, and parent-child communication. All questionnaires were self-administered through MacIntosh computers programmed to present questions orally and visually.  The qualitative phase included 12 African-American youth from low-income, urban families. The youth participated in 60- to 90-minute interviews regarding drug activities and violence.  Most boys (73 percent) were not involved in either drug activities or weapon carrying.  Boys who were involved in drug activities or weapon carrying were often involved in other high-risk activities (cigarette and alcohol use, school failure and expulsion) and had low rates of adaptive communication with their parents.  The boys reported high rates of drug involvement by their family, friends, and community.  However, psychological and interpersonal factors were better predictors of individual risk activities than community or family variables.  Personal values regarding economics predicted drug trafficking.  More than 56 percent of the boys who reported past involvement in drug activities did not anticipate future involvement.  Multilevel strategies are necessary to prevent involvement in drug activities and weapon carrying. Intervention programs should begin early and should promote communication between parents and children, adaptive behavior in school, and avoidance of cigarette and alcohol use. Community-level interventions are needed to alter the myth that drug involvement and weapon carrying are normative and to promote images that are less materialistic and more supportive of education and future-oriented activities.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>The &quotHustle&quot:  Socioeconomic Deprivation, Urban Drug Trafficking, and Low-Income, African-American Male Gender Identity<BR>
Whitehead, T.L.; Peterson, J.; Kaljee, L.</I></B><BR>
<I>Pediatrics </I>93(6):1050-1054, 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>Drug trafficking seems to be both prevalent and associated with considerable morbidity and mortality among inner-city African-American males.  Survey data has indicated the possible importance of economic need in the rapid emergence of drug trafficking in this population.  In the present study, an historical-cultural approach is used to examine this economic relationship further and to explore the role that drug trafficking plays in a society that has permitted its successful and rapid growth.  Data were obtained from interviews of approximately 600 African-Americans residing in inner-city neighborhoods in Washington, DC, and Baltimore during nine drug- and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related studies conducted over 4 years.  From the perspective of the study participants, the need to provide economic support for one's family as well as to achieve some sense of status, respect, and reputation among one's peers are two core constructs of masculine identity in the United States.  The historical and worsening inequities in access to economic resources and power by African-American males are viewed as significantly reducing the opportunity for economic success through more social or legal enterprises. Pursuit of nonmainstream activities (such as drug trafficking) is perceived as offering an opportunity for economic advancement and for establishing a power base for individuals who have been denied access to mainstream opportunities.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Boys & Girls Clubs in Public Housing Developments:  Prevention Services for Youth at Risk<BR>
<I>Shinke, S.P.; Orlandi, M.A.; Cole, K.C.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Community Psychology </I>OSAP Special Issue: 118-128, 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>This article describes and evaluates the impact of Boys & Girls Clubs recently installed in residential public housing developments.  Because most prevention interventions to date have been school-based, this study marks a development in prevention interventions for problem behavior among high-risk youth.  The evaluation compares sites without Boys & Girls Clubs to sites with both previously and recently installed Boys & Girls Clubs.  The results show that public housing developments with Boys & Girls Clubs have less drug-related activity, measurably fewer damaged and unoccupied units, and increased parental involvement in youth activities.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Homeless, Runaway, and Street Youth</H3>
<B>A Substance Use Profile of Delinquent and Homeless Youths<BR>
<I>Forst, M.L.; Crim, D.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Drug Education </I>24(3):219-231, 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>The overall health status of delinquent and homeless youths is of increasing concern.  These high-risk youth populations have a variety of health problems, including relatively high levels of substance abuse.  This study provides empirical data on the substance use behaviors of a sample of delinquent and homeless youth in San Francisco, CA. The data, secured within the context of medical examinations, indicate that both samples use tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs at higher rates than the general adolescent population. The study concludes that drug education and prevention programs must be tailored to fit the needs and lifestyles of these two populations, and that the programs should be provided within the broader context of adolescent health care.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Street Youth and AIDS<BR>
<I>Bond, L. S.; Mazin, R.; Jiminez, M. V.</I></B><BR>
<I>AIDS Education and Prevention </I>4(3):14-23, 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>An attempt is made to characterize the population of homeless street youth who are living marginally and to describe aspects of this population's dynamics, motivations, values, and aspirations.  Street youth, ranging in age from birth to 21, are on the street for one reason or another  because of dire poverty in the home, which necessitates their working on the street to supplement the family income; because of rejection by parents or guardians; because of violence in the home or drug or alcohol use by family members; or because of lack of a place where they feel they can be &quotthemselves.&quot  These conditions make street youths particularly vulnerable to HIV infection, not to mention malnutrition, stress, and drug use.  Their violently accelerated emotional maturation, ignorance, alcohol- and drug-induced confusion, together with the exploitation and sexual abuse of which they are often victims, are additional factors that contribute to sexual practices that may lead to HIV infection.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>High-Risk Behaviors Among Male Street Youth in Hollywood, California<BR>
<I>Pennbridge, J. N.; Freese, T. E.; Mackenzie, R. G.</I></B><BR>
<I>AIDS Education and Prevention </I>4(30):24-33, 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>High-risk sex and drug use behaviors are examined among 446 male street youth 14 to 23 years old in Hollywood, CA (the area in Los Angeles County with the highest number of AIDS cases).  Comparisons are made based on whether the sex behaviors occurred in situations of &quotsurvival sex&quot (&quotsex you gotta do&quot) and &quotrecreational sex&quot (&quotsex you wanna do&quot). Ninety-seven percent of the males were sexually active with 27.1 percent involved in prostitution in the last 3 months. Involvement in prostitution is most common among older, gay identified males.  The most prevalent risk factors seen among this group include inconsistent condom use (which also varies by social situation), high-risk sexual behaviors during both survival and recreational sex, large numbers of sexual partners, intravenous drug use, and the use of drugs and alcohol during all sex.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Teen Peer Outreach-Street Work Project: HIV Prevention Education for Runaway and Homeless Youth<BR>
<I>Podschun, G. D.</I></B><BR>
<I>Public Health Reports</I> 108(2):150-155, 1993
<BLOCKQUOTE>Each year, there are approximately 2 million homeless and runaway youths in the United States.  On any given night, there are 1,000 homeless youngsters living on the streets of San Diego, CA.  Homeless young people are commonly involved in one or more of the following activities that place them at risk for HIV infection  unprotected sexual intercourse, needle-sharing in the use of injectable drugs, sex with someone who injects drugs.  The Teen Peer Outreach-Street Work Project trains teen peer educators to work in three existing San Diego youth service programs with street outreach staff members to provide HIV prevention education and referral services to San Diego's homeless youth.  Selected teens from the target population also participate in street-based case management that provides skill development to bring about behavioral and attitudinal changes.  An HIV outreach program cannot stand alone and is most successful if it is integrated with services that meet the basic needs of its clients.  In the three participating youth service programs of the Teen Peer Outreach-Street Work Project, food, clothes, and shelter information are provided. There are shelters in two of the three programs that become places where HIV educational messages, delivered on the street, can be reinforced. Immediate and concrete assistance can be offered to homeless youth.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Similarities in Drug Use and Depression Among Runaway Students and Street Youth<BR>
<I>Smart, R.G.; Adlaf, E.M.; Walsh, G.W.; Zdanowicz, Y.</I></B><BR>
<I>Canadian Journal of Public Health </I>85(1):17-18, 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>The problem of adolescents who run away from home has recently come to national prominence in the United States and Canada.  Runaways are at a high risk for becoming street youth.  This paper compares student runaways, non-runaways, and street youth on alcohol and other drug use, problems, and psychological depression.  Most runaways do not become street youth but leave home for brief periods, often going to neighbors, friends, or relatives' homes because of some temporary crisis. Studies of street youth show that those groups contain youth who have run away from home repeatedly. These youth have high rates of drug use. Few studies have been made of runaways in general samples of youth.  No study has shown how similar runaways still in school compare to street youth.  The authors expected that runaways in their study would be much higher than non-runaways and close to street youth with regard to drug use and depression.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>One-hundred fifty clients of a shelter for homeless youths in New York City were interviewed to obtain information about their backgrounds and the incidence of behavioral and emotional disorder. Most of the respondents came from backgrounds characterized by severe emotional deprivation and physical or sexual abuse.  Of the 140 who completed the full interview, 90 percent fulfilled DSM-III-R criteria for an emotional or behavioral disorder.  Fifty-nine percent had conduct disorder, three-quarters were depressed, 41 percent had considered suicide, and more than one-quarter had attempted suicide.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The extent of depression and other psychiatric problems among adolescent &quotstreet&quot and homeless populations is largely undocumented. Using a sample of 145 adolescent street youth interviewed in Toronto, Canada, this study attempted to extend the knowledge of street youth by examining the association of depression with alcohol and other drug use and related problems, social supports, self-esteem, family background, and alcohol and other drug use among family members.  The results indicated that the best predictors of depression among street youth were self-esteem and length of time spent in a hostel.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>More women and children are homeless today than ever before.  In the 1980s, growing numbers of women and children transformed the homeless population.  Many women were alone on the streets, but others had pre-school age children in tow.  The following topics are addressed:  (1) housing, poverty, and homelessness; (2) homelessness and prevention research; (3) the impact of homelessness on children; (4) mother and child interactions in high-risk families; (5) family violence and homelessness; (6) impact of substance abuse on homeless families; and (7) public policies, program responses, and evaluation strategies for homeless families.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Risk Factors for Drug Use in Rural Adolescents<BR>
<I>Farrell, A. D.; Anchors, D. M.; Danish, S. J.; Howard, C. W.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Drug Education </I>22(4):313-328, 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>This study tested the relevance of a risk factor model for predicting drug use among rural adolescents.  A questionnaire battery assessing drug use and the presence/absence of 20 risk factors derived from a previous study of urban adolescents was administered to a sample of seventh graders (N = 235) in the public school system of a rural community.  All but one of these risk factors were found to be significantly related to at least one category of drug use.  In addition, a risk factor index based on a subset of 10 risk factors was significantly associated with the prevalence and frequency of use for cigarettes, beer and wine, hard liquor, marijuana, and other drugs.  These findings support the generalizability of a risk factor approach to predicting drug use, and underscore the need for increased prevention and research efforts directed at rural adolescents.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>International Journal of the Addictions </I>28(3):249-255, 1993
<BLOCKQUOTE>Based on developmental theory, this article tests the relationships between first and current use of alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs among a sample of 197 rural and small-town youth.  Findings indicate that age of first use of alcohol predicts current use of alcohol. The same pattern occurs for marijuana and other drugs. Age of first use of alcohol is also related to first use of marijuana, which in turn is related to first use of other drugs.  The order is reversed for current use. Current use of other drugs predicts current use of marijuana, which in turn predicts current use of alcohol.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Gender Differences in Rural Adolescent Drinking Patterns<BR>
<I>Pope, S.K.; Smith, P.D.; Wayne, J.B.; Kelleher, K.J.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Adolescent Health </I>15(5):359-365, 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>This study examined differences in rural adolescent male and female drinking patterns, problem drinking behavior, and the factors associated with problem drinking behavior. An anonymous written survey was administered to 2,297 adolescents, ages 12 to 18 years, in a rural Mississippi River Delta county. Potential risk factors for problem drinking behavior examined included demographic, behavioral, peer, and parental characteristics. Drinking patterns were examined separately for male and female adolescent drinkers.  Individual factors associated with problem drinking behavior for these rural adolescents were consistent with previous research. However, these factors were gender specific in prevalence.  Males were more likely than females to report all of the behavioral and peer risk factors associated with problem drinking, except depressive symptoms, which were more frequently reported by females than males.  The interactions of gender with race and gender with peer approval of drinking were significantly associated with problem drinking.  The ratio of male to female problem drinkers among African-American adolescents was twice as high as the ratio among Caucasian adolescents.  Females were much more strongly influenced by peer disapproval of drinking than were males.  Prevention and intervention programs may be more effective for rural females if they target depression and focus on support systems, whereas intensive programs for adolescents with multiple high risk behaviors may be more effective for rural males.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Journal of Drug Education </I>39(1):19-33, 1993
<BLOCKQUOTE>The purposes of this study were (1) to assess the usage of substances by 2,125 youth (grades 4-12) in rural Indiana and (2) to explore the differences between students' reported use of substances and parents' perceptions of students' use.  While all parents believed that some students were using substances (i.e., cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana), they underestimated the percentage of students in their child's grade who reported the use of a variety of substances, especially alcohol.  If parents are to be allies in the fight against drugs, it is imperative they be aware of the dimensions of the problem.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Data assessing the extent of drug and alcohol use among 4-H members were collected in the fall of 1990 from 255 youth in a three-county area of rural northeastern Nevada.  The results were compared to a similar survey conducted in local schools by the Nevada State Department of Education.  No statistically significant differences were found between the 4-H members' drug and alcohol use and students in the school survey.  Seventy percent of the 4-H members indicated that 4-H had made a difference in their attitudes about drug and alcohol use.  Yet, school was the most reported source of their current information about drugs and alcohol. Recommendations for 4-H programs wanting to implement contemporary programs are included.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Trends in Indian Adolescent Drug and Alcohol Use<BR>
<I>Beauvais, F.</I></B><BR>
<I> American Indian and Alaska Native Mental Health Research </I>5(1):1-12, 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>Trends in overall drug use among Indian and non-Indian youth have followed similar patterns, increasing from 1975 to the early 1980s and, for the most-used drugs, declining since then.  At every point in time more reservation Indian youth are involved with drugs than are non-Indian youth.  Rates for cocaine and hallucinogen use by Indian youth increased until 1990. The decline in overall drug use has occurred because a considerable number of moderate users have shifted to non-use.  There has been no decrease in the proportion of high-risk users; since 1980, it has stayed between 17 percent and 20 percent.  Societal changes and prevention programs are reaching casual drug users but not those susceptible to heavy drug involvement.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Beauvais, F.</I></B><BR>
<I>American Indian and Alaska Native Mental Health Research </I>5(1):13-31, 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>Rates of drug use and involvement were compared for three groups:  Indian youth living on reservations, Indian youth living off reservations, and Anglo youth. A consistent pattern emerged, showing the lowest rates of use among Anglo youth, higher rates among non-reservation Indian youth, and the highest rates among Indian youth on reservations.  Rates of tobacco use, both smoked and smokeless, and marijuana use are especially high for Indian youth.  Indian youth also show a pattern of earlier initiation to drug use. Gender differences reveal slightly higher rates of use for males, although the differences are not great enough to suggest that prevention efforts for males should have a higher priority.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Drug Use Patterns Among American Indian and Alaska Native Youth:  Special Rural Populations<BR>
<I>Beauvais, F.; Segal, B.</I></B><BR>
<I>Drugs and Society </I>7(1/2):77-94, 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>American Indian and Alaska Native communities illustrate the great diversity found among the rural populations of the United States. These communities are marked by cultural, socioeconomic, and historical patterns that differ from other rural groups, causing a distinctive set of social problems. American Indian and Alaska Native youth show exceptionally high levels of drug use compared to the national average for youth. Because Native groups share a number of similar cultural characteristics, it could be hypothesized that the rates of drug use among them are related to cultural traits. However, non-Native Alaskan youth also have high rates of drug use, indicating factors in the social environment other than culture that account for drug use.  Possible explanatory factors include uncertain economic conditions, family instability, and lack of access to cultural values. Although rural living in itself is not necessarily a contributing factor to drug use, it does place some constraints on intervention efforts.  Geographic isolation and lack of adequate health and social service resources make it difficult to develop adequate prevention and treatment services.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Public Health Reports </I>108(5):643-645, 1993
<BLOCKQUOTE>Questionnaires on smokeless tobacco use were completed by 781 sixth grade students in 15 schools at six locations in the United States.  The students were both American Indian-Alaskan Native and non-American Indian-Alaskan Native.  The Indian and Alaskan Native school children were experimenting with and regularly using smokeless tobacco at higher rates than non-Indian school children.  At Indian Health Service sites, 28.1 percent of the children reported current use of smokeless tobacco, compared with 3.3 percent of the children elsewhere.  For girls reporting smokeless tobacco experimentation, the comparison was 68.9 percent at Indian Health Service sites and 8.7 percent at non-Indian sites; for boys, it was 79.1 percent from the Indian sites and 35.4 percent from the non-Indian sites. For those students who had tried smokeless tobacco, more than half also reported having tried cigarettes. The majority of all sixth grade students surveyed were aware of the health risks of smokeless tobacco use in that it is an increased risk for cancer.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Two promising theoretical models for predicting substance abuse were examined.  The life stress and social support theory identified life stress as a significant influence on levels of family support and drug use but for unknown reasons it did not predict levels of alcohol use.  Family support moderates rates of alcohol use and is itself also influenced by life stress factors.  Overall, life stress appears to be a major influence on factors related to substance use. The peer cluster theory also identified factors significant to substance use.  Family strength or parental expectations were found to influence levels of friend support, family support, and school adjustment. Adolescents who received greater friend support and had better school adjustment chose same-age peers to drink with.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The study assessed the impact of an intensive retreat for American-Indian youth in high-risk environments.  It found that the experience greatly reduced excessive drinking among the targeted adolescents.  The evaluation design was unique in assessing attitudes that were and were not expected to change.  Those variables not expected to change because they were to related to the goals of the retreat served as a control for the attitudes that were expected to change.  The results were consistent with these expectations and the model for evaluation was appropriate for demonstration programs. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This report is part of a current awareness service.  It summarizes recent research on adolescent drug use and its prevention.  Each issue abstracts and reviews the prevention implications of new research dealing with a major topic of concern in the field; in this case the problem of substance abuse among Native American youth. The report includes the nature and extent of the problem, use correlates and risk factors, prevention strategies, and a conclusion of the research.  AOD use and abuse in the Native American population have long been at a crisis level.  Since the 1986 Indian Health Service launching of an intensive, community-based prevention initiative there has been a rapid increase in research.  The body of research has increased so markedly that this update report became warranted.  In this overview, the findings of studies in regard to the nature and extent of AOD use is reviewed on a drug-by-drug basis. This is followed by a summary of the research on use correlates, especially the risk factors that account for the high levels of use among this population, as well as the protective factors that promote resiliency.  The final section discusses the prevention implications of these findings and reviews published program evaluations.  Taken as a whole, the evidence indicates that Native American youth generally still exhibit greater use of psychoactive substances than youth in any other U.S. ethnic group.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The problems associated with adolescent pregnancy are well documented and continue to challenge health care providers, community workers, social service personnel, educators, policy makers, and especially the young men and women and their families whose lives are so intimately affected.  Problems such as poor educational achievement, poverty, family instability, homelessness, lack of prenatal care, low birthweight infants, and compromised child development persist for adolescent parents and their children.  A resource guide provides information concerning adolescent pregnancy, prevention, and care.  A substantial number of resources deal with the prevention of adolescent pregnancy because interventions that address the underlying issues and lower the incidence of pregnancy, especially among younger adolescents, are critical to improving the overall health of adolescents.  Resources also are included dealing with pregnancy care and parenting education to help assure optimal outcomes for both the adolescent and his or her child.  The resource listing is divided into three sections: (1) publications and resource materials; (2) organizations; and (3) commercial educational resources.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Rural youth have unique disadvantages as a result of their isolation and attendant transportation barriers. A program was funded to provide outreach to pregnant teenagers, only half of whom were in school.  AOD use was found to be extensive among the girls, particularly in the last 3 months of pregnancy.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Prenatal Alcohol Education for Low-Income Women with Interactive Multimedia<BR>
<I>Kinzie, M.B.; Schorling, J.B.; Siegel, M.</I></B><BR>
<I>Patient Education and Counseling </I>21(1/2):51-60, 1993
<BLOCKQUOTE>Prenatal alcohol education for low-income expectant mothers is discussed, with a focus on an interactive multimedia program called &quotThe Healthy Touch.&quot The program was created using Hypercard (TM) software for the Macintosh SE computer with a touch-sensitive screen. The program is designed for women of low literacy levels and uses simple terms and provides narration throughout. The welfare of the women's babies is the focal point for changing behaviors. The program went through two cycles of field-testing and revision to determine the appropriateness of the content and the acceptability of the computer format, and to evaluate the interactive functions of the program. The program provides health education via photographic, graphic, spoken narrative, and musical modes, with limited on-screen text. It is concluded that the program offers valuable information in a desirable format. The article includes a brief review of the literature addressing the effects of alcohol consumption during pregnancy, intervention strategies, and interactive multimedia as an educational tool.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This chapter describes the Diagnostic and Rehabilitation Center's (DRC) approach to closing the gap in services for women and their children in Philadelphia, PA. The approach included the provision of a safe, supportive, and drug-free residential facility for mothers and their young children and pregnant women.  In combination with this residence, it provided outpatient substance abuse treatment, not in the residential facility, but at DRC's main treatment facility.  The women in this project are young, minority, urban mothers who are actively struggling with intergenerational cycles of substance abuse, child abuse, disorganized families, and few environmental resources. They are homeless, polydrug-addicted mothers in treatment for alcohol and other drug problems.  The service intervention of this project is described, as is the program concept, policy, staffing, criteria for admission, intake information, protocol for clients, initial plan, progress notes, client tracks, resident plan, and aftercare plan.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The Aftercare project, which is in the beginning stages, focuses on 200 formerly homeless recovering women with children.  The target population will be randomized into two groups.  One group will receive peer support and case management and the other will receive case management alone.  Subjects will be followed for 18 months.  The case load will consist of one case manager to 15 families.  The case management model incorporates a philosophy of empowerment.  Several barriers in working with the target population are identified, including the need for life and parenting skills, manipulative coping behaviors, transportation, and the potential for relapse.  Roles also are identified for the case manager, including advocate, treatment coordinator, educator, and therapist.  Major gaps in services, such as the lack of affordable housing, affordable child care, and material goods, will require advocacy by the case manager.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Brown, D.L. ; Hirschl, T.A.</I></B><BR>
<I>Rural Sociology </I>60(1):44-66, 1995
<BLOCKQUOTE>Urban poverty and rural development literatures are used to identify the determinants of poverty, resulting in the hypothesis that controlling for household and contextual-level variables would reduce metropolitan (metro) core versus rural differences in the likelihood of poverty.  Modeling data from the 1985 wave of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, rural households have the highest probability of poverty followed by the metro core.  Both household and contextual factors were important determinants of the chances of household poverty.  However, controlling for these determinants failed to eliminate the greater likelihood of rural versus metro-core poverty.  Findings indicate the need for new directions in future poverty research and a reconsideration of the importance of space in sociological theory.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Involving the family in assessing and making decisions about the care and treatment of the troubled adolescent is essential to diminish the estrangement and incursions on sense of competence and confidence that inevitably accompany problems with alcohol and other drug abuse and emotional disturbance.  Highly involved and competent families that have the resources to devote to the care of their youngsters may be able to be the major context of treatment, providing supervision for the suicidal, attention to the withdrawn, and limits for the antisocial.  On the other hand, families that are seriously impaired by other stresses, such as poverty, mental illness, relocations, job loss, or abuse of alcohol and other drugs, may not be able to care for their youngsters; however, they can be involved in thoughtful decisions about how the youth should be cared for and can maintain meaningful connections with their children throughout treatment.  This can be done, however, only if the family is the center of the assessment and treatment plan.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Concerns about family economic insecurity dominated much of the Nation's public discourse during the past year.  Stubbornly high levels of joblessness and widespread layoffs have kept millions of parents anxious about their own ability to support their children. Fears of possible job loss have been powerful themes in the push for national health reform and the recent debate on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).  At the same time, the announcement in 1993 of yet another increase in child poverty during the previous year reaffirmed suspicions that the current economic recovery is not reaching many of America's most vulnerable families.  As reports of child abuse and neglect continued to climb, Congress passed significant child protection and family support reforms in the form of a new Family Preservation and Support Services Program and increased funding for preventive community-based mental health services for children.  Child care has become a basic necessity for millions of American families.  In 1993, 54 percent of mothers with children younger than three years of age, and 64 percent of those with children ages three to five, were in the civilian labor force.  And many parents, regardless of whether they require child care because of employment, now want their children to have some kind of preschool experience to help them prepare them for school.  Rising teen birth rates, steadily increasing youth violence, and persistent employment and education problems for teens and young adults provided powerful warnings in 1993 that American society cannot afford to allow so many children to drift into unproductive or destructive dead-end paths during their adolescence.  The degree to which anxiety about violence permeates children's lives was documented powerfully during the year by several nationwide polls, including one released by the Children's Defense Fund (CDF) and Newsweek magazine in which nearly three-quarters of the surveyed parents and more than half of the children said their top worry is that a loved one would become a victim of a violent crime.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Medicine Seeks to Prevent More 'Lost Generations' of Low-Income Children with Avoidable Problems<BR>
<I>Zylke, J. W.</I></B><BR>
<I>JAMA:  Journal of the American Medical Association </I>267(21):2856, 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>This article focuses on facing the problems confronting children living in the inner cities today.  The viewpoints of several speakers at an American Academy of Pediatrics meeting are cited.  Creativity, cooperation, and long-term vision will be key in solving the problems, especially those that are preventable or treatable such as low birth weight, injuries, measles, and tuberculosis.  One physician argues that in addition to health care financing reform, proven public health measures must be made available and more focused treatment and prevention programs targeted to children and families are needed.  Key to such public health measures will be convenient access to medical care.  For children and adolescents, the school is a logical location.  The primary source of health care for many poor children is the emergency department.  Barbara Barlow, MD, chief of pediatric surgery, Harlem Hospital, reported that 1 in 100 children in her community were being admitted with major injuries.  With the help of the community, the Harlem Hospital Injury Prevention Program was created.  Education about safety was a critical component of the program as were various programs aimed at getting children off of the streets. According to George Foltin, director of the Bellevue Hospital Pediatric Emergency Department, the continued escalation in violence, substance abuse, and poverty cannot be remedied by individual programs or short-term solutions.  The only real solutions will be long-term; he called for the implementation of the recommendation of the National Commission on Children.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) are jointly sponsoring a program to develop and demonstrate effective models for integrating alcohol and other drug abuse teaching into the medical and nurse education curricula. The model curricula are based upon discipline-specific knowledge and skill objectives and address undergraduate, graduate, residency, and faculty training needs. Within medicine, curriculum models are being developed for the following specialties: general internal medicine, family medicine, psychiatry, pediatrics, and OB/GYN. Within nursing, curriculum models are being developed for undergraduate core courses and for graduate nursing specialties. Each project includes the following components: 1) use of a faculty working committee to assess alcohol and other drug abuse instructional needs and develop curriculum objectives; 2) development of curriculum materials and pilot testing of a selected segment of the curriculum; and 3) a 14-month implementation and evaluation phase. Descriptions of the 12 model curriculum projects are presented in this publication.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>During the past decade, many medical and nursing educators and specialty organizations have developed curriculum materials on alcohol and other drug abuse for use in undergraduate, graduate, and continuing education programs. This resource directory is designed to assist health professions faculty to integrate substance abuse teaching into their ongoing instructional activities. The curricula listed in this directory include a broad spectrum of instructional materials that can be used in primary care and specialty teaching settings. These materialsinclude instructional units that can be offered as a single teaching session or combined to form a comprehensive substance abuse curriculum.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Rockville, MD: Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, October 1993<BR>
(Available from Judith A. Alamprese, COSMOS Corporation, 1735 Eye Street, NW, Suite 613, Washington, DC 20006.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Health Professions Clinical Training Program in Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse, referred to as the Faculty Development Program (FDP), was established in 1989 by the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP), the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). The FDP, as part of CSAP's Training System, seeks to improve clinical teaching about alcohol, tobacco, and other drug abuse by offering training to academically based clinical faculty in primary healthcare and mental health. The FDP funds grants in 35 institutions, including 16 schools of medicine, 11 schools of nursing, 7 schools of social work, and 1 graduate psychology department. The purpose of this program is to develop a cadre of academically based health professions faculty who will provide leadership, within their clinical specialties and departments, in alcohol, tobacco, and other drug abuse training. This directory contains summaries of the 35 projects in the FDP and a listing of all participants in these projects. The summaries and participant list are organized within four professional fields included in the FDP: medicine, nursing, social work, and psychology. It is intended that the directory serve as a resource for FDP participants and for others who work with or are interested in the program.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Targets for Change in Alcohol and Drug Education for Nursing Roles<BR>
<I>Naegle, M. A.</I></B><BR>
<I>Alcohol Health and Research World </I>13(1):52-55, 1989<BR>
(Available from the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information, P.O. Box 2345, Rockville, MD 20847.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>Nursing roles must adapt to changes in health needs and treatment trends to provide responses to society's healthcare needs. Nurses, as the largest group of healthcare providers, have the greatest contact with clients and patients in the widest variety of settings. Changes have been slow in the three active components of alcohol and other drug abuse education considered essential to advancing professionalism in nursing: (1) changes in attitude; (2) acquisition of information; and (3) development of skills. These areas are addressed. </BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information, P.O. Box 2345, Rockville, MD 20847.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>In 1983, a national survey was designed and implemented to determine the extent to which nursing schools were meeting the needs of the nursing profession for information on alcohol and other drug abuse. One of the unexpected results of this nursing education survey was the discovery of an apparent discrepancy between: (1) total number of reported hours of instruction on alcohol and other drugs, and (2) the quantity of information and clinical skills identified as being included in this component of the curriculum. The highest percentage of schools used psychiatric and mental health nursing as the place in the curriculum for alcoholism and other drug abuse, reflecting the historic role of specialty wards for alcohol patients in State mental hospitals. Problems with this arrangement are discussed briefly. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Training Practicing Physicians: Recognition and Early Treatment of Alcohol and Other Drug Problems<BR>
<I>Fishbein, H. A.; Berlin, N. J.; and Seitz, S.L.</I></B><BR>
<I>Addiction and Recovery, </I>November 1990
<BLOCKQUOTE>The National Training System (NTS), which is part of the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP), is responsible for increasing recognition, prevention, and intervention for alcohol and other drug-related problems in the United States.  They do this by developing and pilot testing curricula and other materials for professionals and community groups who have access to populations at risk. This article focuses on the NTS physician training initiative that reflects the assumption that attention to existing or potential AOD problems is an essential ingredient of good primary medical care. The NTS and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) developed and tested a pediatrician training program. This article provides details of the program including the scope of the problem, the role of the pediatrician, interviewing guidelines, management operations, and resources for treatment, referral, and followup. Nine physician organizations that observed the training agreed that physician awareness of AOD issues in the patient population was minimal and that motivating physicians to increase their involvement in this area was critical. </BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from Patrick A. Miederhoff, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, VA 23928.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>A study was conducted to determine the effect of drug abuse education courses offered by schools and colleges of pharmacy on the attitudes and behavior of participants. A total of eight instructors in colleges of pharmacy that sponsor drug abuse education programs in seven geographic regions of the United States participated in data collection. The basic design consisted of pre- and post-test measures with treatment and social control groups. Subjects included 506 students enrolled in drug abuse education courses and 295 students who were not receiving any type of drug abuse education experience. Attitudes toward drug abuse, the dependent variable, were operationalized with the Measurement of Attitudes Toward Drugs (MAD). Other variables in the study were operationalized with a self-report confidential questionnaire. In addition to demographic variables, the subjects were asked to report their level of use of prescription, non-prescription, and recreational drugs compared to others their age. The instructors of the courses were asked to provide information about class size, textbook used, and their academic backgrounds. The data suggest that individuals who choose to take undergraduate pharmacology courses tended to have greater empathy for people suffering from substance abuse problems and believed that rehabilitative approaches for dealing with these problems were preferable to more punitive approaches. The educational experience tended to enhance these attitudes. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Alcoholism Training for Social Workers<BR> 
<I>King, G., and Lorenson, J.</I></B><BR>
<I>Social Casework </I>70(6):375-382, 1989
<BLOCKQUOTE>The authors discuss the credentialing program for alcoholism counselors in New York State, as well as effective treatment applications. Social workers are in an ideal position to identify, refer, and treat alcoholic patients; however, they need special training and specific work experience. In New York State, alcoholism counselor applicants are required to have at least 450 clock hours of relevant instruction, of which 150 hours must be specific to alcoholism counseling. In addition, they must document at least one full-time, employed year of providing alcoholism services in which counseling is practiced. Studies show that social workers as a group have been deficient in making early diagnoses and intervening with alcoholic clients. Social workers should acquire specific skills including assessment and diagnosis, limit setting and leverage, client contracting to change drinking behavior, education on alcoholism, group treatment, family involvement in treatment, and self-help groups. It is noted that schools of social work increasingly recognize the importance of these skills and provide courses to prepare their graduates to work with individuals with alcohol and other drug problems. 21 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Educational Factors in Substance Abuse for Physicians<BR>
<I>Johnson, N. P.; Lindsay, A. B.; and Tumblin, M.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of the South Carolina Medical Association </I>86(1):64-65, 1989<BR>
(Available from N. Peter Johnson, University of South Carolina, School of Medicine, Department of Neuropsychiatry and Behavior Science, Office of Alcohol and Drug Studies, Columbia, SC 29208.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>The authors discuss current techniques used to upgrade physicians' skills on substance abuse with minimum investments of time and money. The basic premises are: (1) concern of the administrator engenders positive attitudes in students even in face of adversity; (2) students should have regular exposure to recovering individuals and ill patients; (3) alcoholism and drug addictions are treatable; (4) education reduces the severity of problems; (5) overprescription of medicine is a behavior that can be overcome in new generations of physicians; (6) early diagnosis makes treatment outcome easier; and (7) lectures are least likely modes of change, but the time constraints make them necessary. The authors also emphasize research because learning is increased when students are involved in research. Administrative benefits include employment and resource persons. Student activities contribute to involvement after graduation. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Current Status of Psychiatric Education in Alcoholism and Drug Abuse<BR> 
<I>Galanter, M.; Kaufman, E.; Taintor, Z.; Robinowitz, C. B.; Meyer, R. E.; and Halikas, J. </I></B><BR>
<I>American Journal of Psychiatry </I>146(1):35-39, 1989<BR>
(Available from Dr. Marc Galanter, Division of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse, Department of Psychiatry, New York University School of Medicine, 550 First Avenue, New York, NY 10016.) 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The authors conducted a survey of psychiatric education in alcoholism and drug abuse in the United States. Ninety-seven percent of 106 undergraduate training programs and 91 percent of 169 residency programs offered curriculum units in this field. Most of these programs also provided supervised clinical care. Areas of reported faculty dissatisfaction included problems with attitude and interest of psychiatric faculty and with the amount of curriculum time allotted. The authors conclude that although the amount of curriculum time devoted to training in alcoholism and drug abuse is growing, further investment in developing faculty and fellowships is warranted to increase the quality of teaching commitment.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Specialty Specific Model: To Develop, Implement and Evaluate a Model Program and Curriculum in Alcohol and Drug Abuse in Family Medicine. Final Report</B><BR>
Report, Society of Teachers of Family Medicine, Kansas City, Missouri, April 1, 1989<BR>
(Available from Society of Teachers of Family Medicine, 8880 Ward Parkway, Box 8729, Kansas City, MO 64114.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>Successful faculty development strategies in family medicine incorporate elements ensuring sustained vitality and interest beyond the program. In accordance with these principles, 10 family physician faculty members from around the country were selected to undergo a 1-year faculty development fellowship program in substance abuse. Sponsored by the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine (STFM), the goal of the program was not only to develop the faculty members, but also to have impact on both the fellows' institutions and on the specialty of family practice. The program incorporated a combination of off-site group instruction and home-site individual curriculum projects. Additional essential features of the program were socialization activities aimed at the development of formal and informal links within family practice and with other medical specialties and exchange of resources and materials among participants. Program evaluation findings indicate that this program was very effective in fostering networking among fellows, maintaining their enthusiasm, and promoting their academic commitment to substance abuse. The resulting formation of an active, viable STFM Substance Abuse Working Group attests to the strength of both the networking and the commitment among fellows that were fostered by the program. The fundamental features of this program may be applicable to smaller, more localized groups such as faculty within institutions or within regionally based groups or committees. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Workshop Approach To Provide Substance Abuse Education to Pharmacy Students<BR>

(Available from AMERSA, Brown University, Center for Alcohol and Addictions Studies, Box G, Providence, RI 02912.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>Data on the incidence of alcohol and other drug use among students and of serious consequences, including academic and professional impairment, indicates that pharmacy students have good reason to be concerned about their own vulnerability. A recent survey of pharmacy faculty revealed that two-thirds of the respondents believed current curricular content about alcohol and other drug abuse was not adequate. An ongoing program of education and awareness concerning substance abuse was developed.  A 3-hour workshop was proposed to increase students' understanding of alcoholism/addiction, to enable them to recognize behaviors in individuals at risk for chemical dependency, to help them recognize enabling behaviors, to develop alternatives to enabling behaviors, and to increase students' awareness of resources that help students and pharmacists. An evaluation of the program found that the students found all components of the workshop to be helpful.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Doctors Lack Adequate Training in Substance Abuse</B><BR>
<I>Drug Abuse Update </I>Summer, 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>A new study shows that medical schools are failing to teach doctors how to treat substance abuse. Doctors have been shown to be biased against drug abusers and think of them as difficult patients. Doctors are not totally comfortable with the fact that addiction is a chronic disease, a disease with signs and symptoms and set causes. It is recommended that medical schools provide formal training in substance abuse for every medical student. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Guidelines for Facilities Treating Chemically Dependent Patients at Risk for AIDS or Infected by HIV</B><BR>
Report, American Society of Addiction Medicine, April 1991<BR>
(Available from ASAM, 5225 Wisconsin Avenue, NW, Suite 409, Washington, DC 20015.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) presents guidelines to help staff members working in chemical-dependency treatment programs to respond effectively, safely, and humanely to the needs of patients with HIV/AIDS or who are at high risk for HIV infection. Topics discussed include principles for treatment and housing, the spectrum of services needed, precautions that should be taken by caregivers, special considerations for programs with child care services, HIV-antibody testing, pre-test counseling, post-test counseling, symptoms of HIV infection, other infections among intravenous drug abusers, rationale for addictions treatment, residential treatment philosophy, significant other, and legal concerns. ASAM believes it is important for members of the chemical dependency treatment community to respond in the manner outlined because: (1) it is medically imperative for people at risk for or already diagnosed with AIDS to stop using chemicals that can affect the immune system and impair judgment, (2) there is great potential for limiting the occurrence of opportunistic infections and the progression of HIV disease if early medical intervention is instituted, (3) it is important to limit the spread of HIV infection by helping patients reduce high-risk behavior, and (4) there is a need to improve the biopsychosocial quality of life of people with HIV/AIDS.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Seminars Not Enough:  Addiction Training for Psychologists<BR>
<I>Kent, D., and Baker, L.</I></B><BR>
<I>Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Weekly, </I>July 15, 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>The authors contend that psychologists need a multidimensional perspective on addictions treatment. Psychologists have been on the fringes of the addiction treatment field, lacking the proper training and effective education in this area. It is suggested that psychologists need to recognize the biochemical basis of addiction and still be willing to treat addicted persons using a mainstream approach. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Getting Doctors To Diagnose Substance Abuse Problems</B><BR>
<I>Strategies </I>1(2):10, 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>One problem with getting a person with a substance abuse problem into early treatment is that physicians often do not diagnose the problem. Physicians need better training to screen patients for substance abuse problems, especially early on so that appropriate interventions can be made. Physicians active in coalitions can play an important role by working to train other doctors as well as medical students to be aware of alcohol and drug abuse problems in clinical practice. The Association for Medical Education and Research in Substance Abuse (AMERSA), an organization made up of physicians, nurses, and social workers who teach in medical schools around the country, encourages a multidisciplinary approach to the recognition, diagnosis, intervention, treatment, and prevention of substance abuse. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Substance Abuse Teaching in a Community Psychiatry Setting: An Integrated Chemical Dependency Curriculum for Psychiatry Residency Training<BR>
<I>Ronis, R. J.</I></B><BR>
<I>Substance Abuse </I>13(3):112-116, 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>The author's experience in the initial year of a newly developed community psychiatry program, the Public Academic Liaison program at University Hospitals in Cleveland, confirms a high comorbidity of chronic mental illness and chemical dependency. Advanced psychiatry residents without focused training in screening and identification of substance abuse noted substance abuse problems in almost 50 percent of their inner city community mental health center patients. Unfortunately, identification seldom led to direct treatment recommendations or referrals consistent with the diagnosis. This article outlines a multiphase training program for psychiatry residents. The author hopes that the integrated curriculum will lead to greater identification, more appropriate treatment and referral, and improve expectation for treatment outcome of the mentally ill substance abuser. </BLOCKQUOTE>

Bethesda, MD: Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, 1990<BR>
(Available from the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information, P.O. Box 2345, Rockville, MD 20847.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>An overview of program evaluation is presented as it applies to the evaluation of faculty development and clinical training programs in substance abuse for health and mental health professional schools. Conceptual issues in program evaluation are discussed, including the uses of evaluation, the major options, and the benefits and risks of conducting evaluation studies. An introduction is provided to research methods, including discussions of sampling, statistical power, the validity of evaluations and potential sources of bias, comparison and control groups, and measurement of outcomes. The information presented is to enable program developers and other faculty to work as partners with evaluators in the development of evaluation designs that meet the specialized needs of faculty development and clinical training programs.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Challenges to Health Professional Education in Substance Abuse in the 1990s<BR>
<I>Chappel, J. N.</I></B><BR>
<I>AMERSA Substance Abuse </I>13(4):219-225, 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>The author discusses his views of the treatment of alcohol and drug dependence and how these views have changed since he first entered the field of addiction medicine almost 30 years ago. Despite the many advances in the field of addiction psychiatry, stigma, prejudice, and resistance still pose a challenge to healthcare professionals. In meeting the challenges of resistance and recovery, healthcare professionals have a long road ahead of them, according to the author. He suggests speeding up the process by defining and teaching recovery supportive skills, which include early identification and diagnosis, combined with motivation for the addicted person to enter treatment; detoxification that educates and motivates the patient to begin working on recovery; prescribing to prevent iatrogenic addiction, relapse, and to enhance recovery; psychotherapy to intervene on and motivate patients to enter and work on recovery; and teaching the knowledge and skills necessary for healthcare professionals to work effectively with 12-step programs.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><P>Teenagers and young adults often experiment with tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana, the so-called &quotgateway drugs.&quot  For a variety of reasons, people may try these drugs, with no intention of any further use.</P><BR>
Unfortunately, despite their best intentions, sometimes their drug experimentation continues and worsens.  We at CSAP recognize the importance of intervening in these critical, early stages of drug use, and have compiled this resource guide as a means to help prevent the further spread of drug abuse among our early users.<BR>

<B>Families of Adolescent Drug Abusers: Systemic Interventions to Attain Drug-Free Behavior<BR>
<I>Quinn, W. H.; Kuehl, B. P.; Thomas, F. N.; and Joanning, H.</I></B><BR>
<I>American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse </I>14(1):65-87, 1988
<BLOCKQUOTE>Adolescent drug use in the community is a widespread social problem. The abuse of alcohol and/or other illegal drugs ranges from random experimentation to a complex pattern of regular use of a combination of drugs. This paper addresses systemic therapeutic interventions that have been constructed to achieve drug-free behavior. The family is considered the unit of treatment. Contextual goals (necessary to attain a therapeutic climate) and family goals are delineated. These include unity and action within a parental coalition, therapeutic utilization of urinalyses, the bogeyman cometh, probation, home detoxification, and countering adolescent sabotage. Family structural and interfactional features outside the explicit arena of drug-taking, such as marital conflict or adolescent autonomy/ dependence issues, are not addressed but are discussed elsewhere. Clinical illustrations to document interventions discussed are provided.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Alcohol Dependency Prevention and Early Intervention<BR>
<I>Nathan, P. E.</I></B><BR>
<I>Public Health Reports </I>103(6):683-689, 1988
<BLOCKQUOTE>Current data on efforts to prevent alcoholism indicate that we are better able to prevent some of the consequences of alcohol misuse, such as alcohol-related car crashes and fetal alcohol syndrome, than chronic alcohol dependence itself. A review of data on outcomes of treatment for long-term alcohol dependence indicates that 9 of 10 alcohol dependent persons receive no treatment for the disorder in any given year. When treatment is provided for long-term alcohol dependent persons, it has only slightly positive results. As a result, many clinicians and researchers have concluded that rather than exclusive preoccupation with long-term alcoholics, early intervention with persons who are just beginning to abuse alcohol may be a more effective use of resources.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Current Status of Drug Intervention & Prevention in College Athletic Programs <BR>
<I>Tricker, R., and Cook, D. L.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Alcohol and Drug Education </I>34(2):38-45, 1989
<BLOCKQUOTE>This study surveyed National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I universities to collect information related to the existence, nature, and effect of drug testing and drug education programs upon college athletes. Seventy-one questionnaires were sent to the head athletic trainers to ascertain their perceptions of the drug testing program used in conjunction with their athletic program. The findings indicate that trainers believe that drug testing helps to reduce the incidence of drug abuse in college sports programs. However, they report that most programs do not emphasize drug education.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Empirical Guidelines for a Family Intervention for Adolescent Drug Use<BR>
<I>Dishion, T.J.; Reid, J B.; and Patterson, G.R.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Chemical Dependency Treatment:  Clinical Topics for the Practitioner</I> 1(2):189-225, 1988
<BLOCKQUOTE>This article summarizes research that shows that initial substance use by adolescents is influenced by their family, and continued use is influenced by their peers. Statistics and charts are provided showing the results of research done on the effect of family management on antisocial and delinquent behavior in adolescents. The effects of family management on preadolescent drug sampling and adolescent drug use are also shown. The use of multiple gating (weeding out children who aren't at risk using three different assessment instruments) to identify high risk families is explained. The empirical guidelines that are developed for prevention target the parent's ability to monitor the child, the parent's use of drugs, and the adolescent's peers and social skills. Examples of parent training and peer training (training the adolescent to relate well to peers) are given. Suggestions are made for future research.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Treating the High Risk Adolescent:  A Survey of Effective Programs and Interventions<BR>
<I>O'Connell, D.F.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Chemical Dependency Treatment </I>2(1):49-69, 1989
<BLOCKQUOTE>Adolescents at risk for chemical abuse and chemical dependency constitute a highly diversified group in terms of age, background, level of psychopathology, life adjustment, and coping skills. Mental health specialists, school counselors, addiction clinicians, and other professionals need to be aware of the special needs of these adolescents when implementing education, prevention, or treatment programs. Strong efforts at early identification of vulnerable adolescents and the design of appropriate prevention and intervention programs need to be made. Further research should focus on the effectiveness of existing programs and the development of more comprehensive programs for high risk youth.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Tobacco Use by American Indian and Alaska Native People: Risks, Psychosocial Factors, and Preventive Intervention<BR>
<I>Schinke, S. P.; Orlandi, M. A.; Schilling, R. F.; Botvin, G. J.; Gilchrist, L. D.; and Landers, C.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Alcohol and Drug Education </I>35(2):1-12, 1990
<BLOCKQUOTE>Smoked and smokeless tobacco use pose cancer and other health and behavioral risks for American Indian and Alaska Native people. This paper reviews these risks with particular attention to psychosocial aspects of tobacco use, including the influences of cultural, social, and gender-specific factors. After highlighting the advantages of interventions to prevent smoked and smokeless use, the paper suggests a prevention model based on bi-cultural competence theory and on cognitive and behavioral principles of social learning. The authors discuss implications and suggest research directions for tobacco use prevention efforts with American Indian and Alaska Native populations.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Drug Exposed Children Aged 2 to 5: Identifying Their Needs and Planning for Early Intervention</B><BR>
Report, Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, 1991
<BLOCKQUOTE>The first CSAP Issue Forum in 1990 addressed the needs and early intervention plans for drug-exposed children ages 2 to 5.

<B>Applying Relapse Prevention Strategies to Secondary Prevention <BR>
<I>Dimeff, L. A.; Baer, J. S.; and Marlatt, G. A.</I></B><BR>
<I>The Counselor </I>September/October 1991, pp. 22-25
<BLOCKQUOTE>Alcohol-related crashes are the leading cause of death among young adults ages 16 to 24 years in the United States. Because of the prevalence of alcohol problems within this age group, there is a need to broaden the treatment base for alcohol problems by moving beyond treatment of alcoholism to prevention of alcohol abuse by using a range of prevention and treatment options, including moderate drinking programs and abstinence-based programs. When relapse prevention principles are applied to secondary prevention, these programs are referred to as Alcohol Skills Training (AST). The primary aim of the Alcohol Skills Training Program is to reduce alcohol consumption and related risks in young adults who are at high risk for alcohol problems, and preliminary research has established its efficacy. It is contended that additional research is needed to test the efficacy of the program throughout the developmental phase of risk, and to test AST on other populations identified as high risk for alcohol-related problems.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This guide helps parents find out if their children are at high risk for alcohol or other drug use. The authors describe the families most at risk to have a child with AOD problems, and provide parents with intervention techniques designed to prevent a child from becoming involved with drugs or to stop use if it has already begun. The topics discussed include: personality factors of children who will have a tendency toward drug use; physical symptoms of substance use; immediate steps to take if you suspect a drug problem; the connection between teen suicide and drugs; and effective treatment programs -- how to find and evaluate them.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Intervention in the SAP Setting<BR>
<I>Watkins, G. F.</I></B><BR>
<I>Student Assistance Journal </I>2(3):46, November/December 1989
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the student assistance program (SAP) setting, an intervention is an attempt to intercept and change an established pattern of unacceptable behavior. Intervention takes place at school and may require the support of a teacher, parent, or significant other, in addition to the SAP counselor, to induce the student to accept help and enter treatment. In a SAP setting, an intervention may entail creating a crisis as an impetus to motivate the student to seek help. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Alcohol Problems Prevention/Intervention Programs<BR>
<I>Harding, F. M., and Connor, L. S.</I></B><BR>
Report. Bureau of Community Education and Intervention, April 1989 (Available from Bureau of Community Education and Intervention, Division of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse, 194 Washington Avenue, Albany, NY  12210.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>The college environment provides an ideal setting for dealing with problem drinking. This environment is such that problematic behavior can be identified, confronted, and changed at an early stage. Effective education and intervention efforts can be developed. An overview is provided of the dimensions of alcohol-related problems and the causes and prevention of alcohol problems are examined. The public health model approach to dealing with alcohol problems is outlined and the importance of effective primary prevention strategies to reach not only persons suffering from alcoholism but also those not currently dependent on alcohol is stressed. Research with important implications for college alcohol programming is highlighted. A practical step-by-step procedure for organizing an effective alcohol program for the college population is presented, including both prevention and intervention components.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>What's Really Wrong with the Patient? Hospitals Can Help Heavy Drinkers </B><BR>
<I>Prevention File </I>Fall 1990, pp. 7-9
<BLOCKQUOTE>Early intervention to identify and treat alcohol problems leads to savings in health care costs. An estimated 25 percent of all hospitalized patients have a significant alcohol problem regardless of the diagnosis for which they were admitted for treatment. Several programs have been developed around the country to uncover the hidden role of alcohol in hospital cases. One specific program includes medical screenings and tests and interviews used to identify patients with alcohol-related problems.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Intervention Strategies for the Prevention of Adolescent Substance Abuse<BR>
<I>Silverman, W. H.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Adolescent Chemical Dependency </I>1(2):25-34, 1990
<BLOCKQUOTE>Although substance use among adolescents is a complex problem, intervention models have been designed that address the extent and depth of the problem. Because most adolescents experiment with drugs, such intervention must be broad-based and multi-level and involve the teen, peers, parents, and the school. Efforts should be focused on the widely used drugs. The two most successful intervention strategies have been the &quotproblem-solving&quot and the &quotsocial competency building&quot approaches. Several model programs are reviewed. Community-wide prevention programs are proposed as an emphasis for future efforts, particularly those that make use of the media.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Theory and Methods for Secondary Prevention of Alcohol Problems:  A Cognitively Based Approach<BR>
<I>Sanchez-Craig, M.; Wilkinson, D.A.; and Walker, K.</I></B><BR>
In <I>Treatment and Prevention of Alcohol Problems:  A Resource Manual, </I>Cox, W.M., Ed., pp. 287-331. Orlando, Florida: Academic Press, 1987<BR>
(Available from NCADI, P.O. Box 2345, Rockville, MD  20847; 800-729-6686.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>A recent topic of interest has been the identification of early-stage problem drinkers for the purpose of preventing progression of their problem into full-scale alcohol dependence. Topics are discussed under these headings: Rationale for secondary prevention, including impediments to secondary prevention, empirical and conceptual influences on secondary prevention, and desirable features of secondary-prevention programs; Conceptual basis and program development, including cognitive model of human emotions and action, development of a cognitive-behavioral treatment program, and cognitively oriented model of alcohol abuse; Treatment program for early-stage problem drinkers, including procedures for recruiting and screening suitable clients, introductory procedures to enhance compliance, guidelines for setting drinking goals, aids for goal achievement, and development of adaptive coping in high-risk situations; and Future considerations, including abbreviation of the treatment program, generalization of our program to other client populations, cognition and conditioning, and relapse. It is recommended that secondary prevention programs be publicized within the community and be associated with general treatment centers in order to avoid stigmatization of participants. It is also concluded that cognitive-behavioral combination programs are probably the most appropriate approach to this type of prevention.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><P>Alcohol and other drugs (AOD) are associated with up to 50 percent of spousal abuse cases, 68 percent of manslaughter charges, and 52 percent of rapes.  Those using AOD are more likely than others to be involved as both assailants and victims in criminal acts.  Obviously, AOD use and violence are related problems in today's society.</P>

<B>The Dimensions of an Epidemic of Violence</B><BR>
<I>Mason, J.O.</I></B><BR>
<I>Public Health Reports </I>Jan /Feb 1993.  pp. 1-3
<BLOCKQUOTE>This editorial is an adaptation of a keynote address made by the author and various government officials at a conference on violence.  It focuses on the spectrum of violent behavior and crime in the United States, including murder, robbery, gang-related crime, and domestic violence.  Twenty-five to 50 percent of homeless families are headed by women who left home to escape domestic violence.  Half of the women murdered in the U.S. are killed by current or former partners. Women also are violent in the home, but do not do as much damage as men.  In one recent study, nearly 1 million children a year experienced demonstrable harm as a result of abuse or neglect. Theories on violence include a personality disorder that is innate in certain individuals. Others see a trigger between domestic violence and alcohol and other drug abuse.  Prevention and intervention programs focusing on strengthening individuals, homes, and families are discussed.  The need to bring conflict resolution curricula into the schools also is addressed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Substance Abuse, Aggression, and Violence:  What are the Connections?<BR>
<I>Moss, H. B.; Tarter, R. E.</I></B><BR>
<I>American Journal on Addictions </I>2(2):149-160, 1993
<BLOCKQUOTE>The authors review the scientific literature linking the use of specific psychoactive substances with aggressive and violent behavior. In general, the effects of alcohol and other drugs on aggression and violence are influenced through the complex interaction of (1) the particular pharmacological effects and dose of the specific drug; (2) the psychological and biological characteristics of substance-using individuals; and (3) the situational context in which the drug use occurs.  Furthermore, a model is advanced that delineates the relationship between individual dispositional factors promoting aggression and the resultant occurrence of violent behavior.  The authors conclude that the multifactorial nature of this problem emphasizes the need for multimodal strategies of intervention and prevention to reduce the societal impact of violence involving alcohol and other drugs.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Violence and substance use in rural America are explored, including the relationship between the two, the factors contributing to these problems, and the most effective approaches to prevention and intervention.  Overcoming misconceptions about rural areas is necessarily the first step toward developing effective approaches to prevention and intervention for rural communities.  Youth gangs have begun to appear in many rural schools and communities.  The diversity of rural communities requires a community development approach to prevention and intervention rather than an individual or psychological approach.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Cross-Cultural Counseling with the Chemically Dependent:  Preparing for Service Delivery within a Culture of Violence<BR>
<I>Wallace, B.C.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Psychoactive Drugs </I>25(1):9-20, 1993
<BLOCKQUOTE>This article prepares the clinician delivering chemical dependency treatment for more effective work in therapeutic dyads where there are racial, ethnic, or other differences between client and therapist.  The objective is to prepare clinicians for service delivery within the present culture of violence and for the receipt of additional training in cross-cultural counseling and trauma-resolution psychotherapy.  Social learning and unconscious processes are reviewed to explain how this culture of violence operates and impacts treatment.  The way in which chemically dependent clients of colorespecially African Americans, Native Americans, and Latinoshave been impacted by both personal and cultural trauma is illustrated by a case example.  The resolution of clients' personal trauma by properly trained clinicians is presented as relapse prevention and the clients' best defense against becoming a victim of violence and racism.  The article ends with a brief description of the recommended clinical technique for this kind of work, and a statement of needed research.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Alcohol is present in a significant proportion of aggressive and violent events.  Criminological research and public health perspectives are brought together to elucidate the problem of alcohol-related violence.  There is a focus on cognitive processes as the link among pharmacological, personality, and cultural factors affecting post-drinking behavior.  Communication among intoxicated individuals, potential targets of aggression, and bystanders or witnesses are discussed.  The effect of alcohol on information processing is explored, particularly during the initial phases of social interactions, when they may stimulate or defuse potential violence. Conceptual and methodological issues across the disciplinary domains and types of violence are addressed.  The perspectives, methodologies, and findings of four academic disciplinesbiology, psychology, sociology, and economicsare reviewed.  Specific types of alcohol-related violence are examined, namely spouse abuse, child abuse, and violence perpetrated by persons with co-occurring drug and mental disorders.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Violent Crime:  The Role of Alcohol and New Approaches to the Prevention of Injury<BR>
<I>Shepherd, J.</I></B><BR>
<I>Alcohol and Alcoholism </I>29(1):5-10, 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>Almost all evidence of a link between alcohol consumption and violence is available only in the form of aggregate data.  This is unsatisfactory and case-control investigations and studies that relate injury severity to blood alcohol levels are needed.  In the few closely controlled studies that have been performed, increased risk of injury in assault has been linked with binge consumption of more than about 8 units, and above average weekly consumption only in those over 25 years.  Raising the minimum purchasing age for alcohol to 21 years, learning to drink responsibly with parents, especially fathers, and the adoption of tempered glassware are all achievable objectives that would reduce alcohol-related injury.  The use of sobriety-checkpoints (breath testing though not by the police) and other situational prevention programs need to be evaluated in relation to reducing injury sustained in violent crime.  Proactive, community policing has been shown to reduce levels of alcohol-related crime, in contrast to more reactive, defensive, and confrontational policing.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Substance Abuse and Gang Violence<BR>
<I>Cervantes, R.C., ed.</I></B><BR>
Newbury Park, CA: SAGE Publications, 1992. 178 p.
<BLOCKQUOTE>Gangs, violence, drug and alcohol abuse -- these subjects have become increasingly prominent in the eyes of the public.  Some of the important issues revolving around gangs and substance abuse, particularly in the relationships they have with gang violence, are addressed.  Research, policy, and legal issues, prevention strategies, and victims of violence are discussed.  Prevention strategies now are recognized widely as a required complement to police efforts to address substance abuse and gang violence.  As with many other public health problems, this one originates and grows in conditions of urban poverty, neighborhood decay, stressed families, and, in short, the myriad characteristics found in the city's ethnic minority underclass population.  As with other public health problems, also, drug-related gang activities eventually will spread beyond the boundaries of those communities to infect the public at large.  This fact necessitates levels of preventive strategies designed to address the various facets of the problem.  This book is an anthology of selected papers presented at the National Conference on Substance Abuse and Gang Violence, sponsored by the Federal Office for Substance Abuse Prevention in 1990.  The conference was structured around the premise that a multidisciplinary approach is necessary to address the complex social and economic issues of drugs and gang violence.  The contributing authors bring a diversity of experience and expertise to their discussion of topics, which include research on substance abuse and criminal activity by multiethnic gangs; legal and policy issues regarding public health, substance abuse, and gang violence; prevention and intervention strategies to curtail gang violence; and the impact of gang violence on survivors.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Violence and Illegal Drug Use among Adolescents:  Evidence From the U.S. National Adolescent Student Health Survey<BR>
<I>Kingery, P. M.; Pruitt, B. E.; Hurley, R. S.</I></B><BR>
<I>The International Journal of the Addictions </I>27(12):1445-1464, 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>The relationships between violence, drug use, and victimization were examined in a representative sample of American adolescents.  The commonly used illegal drugs (marijuana, amyl/ butyl nitrites, psychedelics, amphetamines, and cocaine) and alcohol were considered. Drug users, compared to nonusers, fought more, took more risks that predisposed them to assault, and were assaulted more both at school and outside school supervision.  Adolescents who were victims at school were also more likely to be victimized outside of school supervision.  This study clearly demonstrates that the aggressor may also be the victim, and that illegal drug/alcohol use is related to victimization.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Risks Among Inner-City Young Teens:  Prevalence of Sexual Activity, Violence, Drugs, and Smoking<BR>
<I>Vanderschmidt, H.F.; Lang, J.M.; Knight-Williams, V.; Vanderschmidt, G.F.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Adolescent Health </I>14(4):282-288, 1993
<BLOCKQUOTE>Boston University's Youth at Risk (URISK) program is working to reduce five high-risk behaviors:  violence, sexual activity, drinking, illicit drug use, and smoking among inner-city public middle-school students, grades 6-8.  To set program priorities and for subsequent program evaluation, students in four schools completed a self-report questionnaire.  Violence (physical fighting or carrying a knife or a gun) and sexual activity were the most commonly reported risks, 54 percent and 38 percent, respectively, for such activity within the past year.  Four-fifths of the students reported risk in at least one of the five risk categories at some time; two-thirds reported current risk in at least one category.  Among those reporting two or more current risks, over 90 percent included violence, and over 80 percent included sexual activity.  Except for smoking, risk rates were lower in females than in males.  Risk rates for violence and drug use were similar among Blacks and Whites, while sexual activity was more common and drinking and smoking less common among Blacks compared with Whites.  Rates for all high-risk behaviors were consistently lower for Hispanics than non-Hispanic Whites.  Risk rates for violence were similar for grades 6-8.  Sexual activity increased mainly from the 7th to the 8th grade.  Drinking increased both from the 6th to the 7th grade and again from the 7th to the 8th grade. Drug use and smoking increased only from the 6th to the 7th grade.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Clinical Issues in the Treatment of Chicano Male Gang Youth<BR>
<I>Belitz, J.; Valdez, D.</I></B><BR>
<I>Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences </I>16(1):57-75, 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>The problem of gang violence poses a significant threat to the mental health of Chicano children.  Although there has been considerable media attention given to the increase in gang violence, the mental health literature is sparse with clinical information on the assessment and treatment of Chicano gang-involved youth.  The sparsity of information has been related to public apathy toward these youth and negative and stereotypic views of these youth as antisocial. This article examines family systems dynamics and adolescent developmental variables that contribute to gang participation.  Specific treatment modalities are discussed and the importance of a multimodal approach is emphasized.  Two cases are presented:  one that addresses family systems and cultural identity factors of gang participation; the other case highlights the importance of a multimodal treatment approach as well as extended family involvement in treatment.  Finally, recommendations are made for mental health professionals to advocate the needs of Chicano gang-involved youth in both mental health and correctional settings.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>The Gang Intervention Handbook<BR>
<I>Goldstein, A.P., and Huff, C.R., eds.</I></B><BR>
Champaign, IL:  Research Press, 1993
<BLOCKQUOTE>This handbook is actually the first edited anthology to bring together a host of relevant disciplinary perspectives and intervention techniques for structuring a comprehensive gang intervention strategy.  The volume begins with a concise review of the current gang situation in America and past intervention efforts.  Part<I>focuses on the psychological dimension of gang membership and behavior, while Part</I>concerns contextual dimensions -- family, school, employment, recreational, and community change.  Part IV provides the criminal justice perspective, with an overview of the National Youth Gang Survey conducted by Irving Spergel and David Curry, and discussion of the implications of gangs for law enforcement, prosecution, and corrections.  Part V highlights the need for cultural sensitivity in the design and delivery of gang interventions.  The authors caution their readers not to seek a single intervention approach for sustained, positive impact on all gang youth.  Instead, they recommend a range of interventions to meet the diverse needs of individual gang members.  The authors propose an innovative national public strategy that would address the underlying socioeconomic conditions that spawn gangs.  They conclude by emphasizing the need for promising programs to be implemented and evaluated to advance the efficacy of gang interventions.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Conventional and Delinquent Activities:  Implications for the Prevention of Violent Victimization Among Adolescents.<BR>
<I>Lauritsen, J.L.; Laub, J.H.; Sampson, R.J.</I></B><BR>
<I>Violence and Victims </I>7:91, 1991
<BLOCKQUOTE>This study examined the relationship between conventional and delinquent activities and violent victimization of adolescents, in the hope of providing an empirical base for victimization prevention strategies.  Data were evaluated from two national sources, the National Youth Survey (NYS) and the Monitoring the Future Study:  A Continuing Study of the Lifestyles and Values of Youth (MTF).  From their findings, the authors conclude that involvement in delinquent activities increases the risk of victimization and violence, that conventional lifestyles are negatively related to the risk of assault and robbery, and that conventional activities are related to victimization only in that they reduce the likelihood of individuals engaging in delinquent activities.  In order to reduce the risk of involvement in violence, delinquency must be targeted as a prime consideration in victimization prevention programs.  Since delinquency prevention is seen as the key to victimization prevention, delinquency and victimization programs should be combined with nonviolent conflict resolution training programs.  These findings have good generalizability and are validated by the longitudinal nature of the two databases employed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>The Prosocial Gang:  Implementing Aggression Replacement Training<BR>
<I>Goldstein, A.P., Glick, B.</I></B><BR>
Thousand Oaks, CA:  Sage Publications, Inc., 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>This book describes an innovative and effective gang intervention program, Aggression Replacement Training (ART).  This program has been selected for the National Model Program Award by the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.  A reduction in arrest rates, as well as other evaluation findings, support the success of a multi-year project using the ART intervention approach with a series of very aggressive juvenile gangs in New York City.  Working with gangs as a unit, the ART project not only taught gang members anger control and other skills but also attempted, as much as possible, to turn their real-world reference group (the gang) into a prosocial rather than an antisocial group.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Domestic and Family Violence</H3>
<B>Substance Abuse as a Precipitant of Wife Abuse Victimizations<BR>
<I>Kantor, G. K.; Straus, M. A.</I></B><BR>
<I>American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse </I>15(2):173-189, 1989
<BLOCKQUOTE>This study examines the question of whether drug and alcohol use by victims constitutes a risk factor increasing the chances of their being assaulted by their partners.  Data from a subsample of the 1985 National Family Violence Survey consisting of the 2033 female respondents who were currently married or living in a male-female couple relationship were used as the basis of the analysis.  The logistic analysis revealed that, of the variables in the model, the most important for distinguishing abused from nonabused women are husband's drug use, a history of paternal violence in women's family of origin, husband's drunkenness, low income, and wife's drunkenness.  Women who abuse alcohol are more likely to be victims of minor marital violence, but female substance abuse of any type is not a significant factor in severe violence.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Alcohol and Drug Use Among Abused Women Who Kill, Abused Women Who Don't, and Their Abusers<BR>

<I>Journal of Drug Issues </I>24(2):165-177, 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>Interviews were conducted with 42 women with extensive abuse histories who had killed their intimates and 59 women with similar abuse histories who were in shelters for battered women. Controlling for demographic and other differences, analyses indicated that alcohol and other drug use ably distinguished between the two groups of women (correctly classifying 89 percent of the cases), and that alcohol use was more salient than other drug use.  The partner's alcohol use and the respondent's alcohol use were significantly associated between intimate homicide and alcohol use. Alcohol counseling should, therefore, be a significant part of programs for both battered women and for men who batter.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Childhood Victimization and Risk for Alcohol and Drug Arrests<BR>
<I>Ireland, T.; Spatz Widom, C.</I></B><BR>
<I>The International Journal of the Addictions </I>29(2):235-274, 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>Using data from a prospective cohort design study, this paper examines the relationship between early childhood victimization and subsequent arrest for alcohol and other drug related offenses.  Complete official criminal histories are compared for cases of childhood physical and sexual abuse and neglect (n = 908) and a control sample (n = 667).  After controlling for relevant demographic characteristics, logistic regression analyses indicate that childhood maltreatment is a significant predictor of adult, but not juvenile, arrests for alcohol or other drug related offenses. Differential responses to maltreatment by race and gender are discussed as well as limitations of the findings and future directions for research.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Many pregnant women suffer physical abuse from their husbands or partners.  A study based on surveys completed in 1990-91 by new mothers living in Alaska, Maine, Oklahoma, and West Virginia found that approximately 3.4 percent of women in these areas are physically abused by their partners in the 12 months preceding childbirth.  The figures vary from 3.8 percent in Maine to 6.9 percent in Oklahoma.  Women with fewer than 12 years of education, nonwhites, unmarried women, and those whose pregnancies were unplanned were the most likely to experience abuse.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from the National Clearinghouse on Child Abuse and Neglect Information, P.O. Box 1182, Washington, DC  20013-1182; 800-FYI-3366 or 703-385-7565.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>Sources of Federal funding and addition sources of information are presented.  The first component provides information on Federal agencies involved in child abuse and neglect and family violence activities.  Each agency is briefly described to provide the reader with an overview of relevant agency activities and interest, including examples of discretionary grants and contracts funded by the agency in the past.  Since Federal agency funding priorities are subject to change on a yearly basis, the reader is shown how to contact the agency directly.  Many agencies maintain mailing lists to alert interested organizations and individuals about current funding opportunities.  The guide's second component provides information on a variety of resources for finding funds, including publications, information clearinghouses, resource centers, national organizations, computerized data bases, Federal regional offices, and State agencies.  A brief description of each resource is provided to assist the reader in making appropriate selections.  The major sources of funding within the Federal government for activities that address child abuse and neglect, domestic violence, elder abuse and neglect, and other forms of family violence are described.  Activities include research, data collection, demonstration projects, technical assistance and training, direct services, conferences, publications, program planning, promotion of cultural responsiveness in service delivery, and support of resource/research centers, and information clearinghouses.  Activities are typically funded through the award of discretionary grants and contracts to State and local agencies, public and private organizations, and universities and colleges.  In addition to discretionary grants and contracts, many Federal agencies fund programs through formula grants and basic grants to States and U.S. Territories.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Health and Justice Professionals Set Goals to Lessen Domestic Violence<BR>
<I>Marwick, C.  </I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of the American Medical Association </I>271: 1147-1149, 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>Health, law, and social service professionals met at the National Conference on Family Violence (Health and Justice) in March 1994 to discuss ways to reduce domestic violence in America.  Speakers called for physicians to move beyond simply reporting cases of child and spousal abuse to becoming more involved in actively preventing it.  Specific methods of involvement, including helping patients obtain treatment for alcohol and drug addiction and making more home visits, were suggested.  Conferees argued that physicians need to learn to view violence as a disease in order to diagnose its causes and develop remedies more effectively.  The conference concluded with the recommendation that communities across the country develop family violence coordination councils to address the issue at a local level.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Developing Community Systems for the Primary Prevention of Family Violence<BR>
<I>Andrews, A.  </I></B><BR>
<I>Family & Community Health </I>16(4): 1-9, 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>The author presents a plan for community-level interventions to prevent family violence.  The various manifestations of domestic violence occur with alarming frequency, affecting family members of all ages.  Preventing these violent incidents requires a fundamental restructuring of society to strengthen the caregiving capacity of individuals, families, and communities.  The article discusses the goals and principles of community prevention programs and offers a brief overview of specific methods of preventive intervention, including education in social skills and the use of legal sanctions, tangible family resources, social support networks, and positive social and physical environments.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Rape and Date Rape</H3>
<B>Dating Violence among High School Students<BR>
<I>Bergman, L.</I></B><BR>
<I>Social Work </I>37(1): 21-27, 1992<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Questionnaire data from 631 students attending suburban, rural, and inner-city high schools in the midwestern U.S. are drawn on to investigate their experience with sexual, physical, and verbal dating violence, exploring the characteristics and correlates of such violence.  The proportion of females who report sexual violence is 15.5 percent, the same percent for physical violence; however it rose to 24.6 percent reporting sexual or physical violence or both.  For male respondents, 4.4% reported sexual violence, 7.8 percent physical violence, and 9.9 percent both.  Significant correlates of violence included dating patterns, grade point averages, and the communities in which the students lived.  Respondents said violence tended to recur but they did not disclose this to parents or officials.  Implications with regard to the causes, treatment, and prevention of dating violence are discussed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Explaining Rape Victim Blame:  A Test of Attribution Theory<BR>
<I>Gray, N.B., Palileo, G.J., Johnson, G.D.</I></B><BR>
<I>Sociological Spectrum </I>13(4): 377-392, 1993
<BLOCKQUOTE>Questionnaire data are used to examine rape victim-blaming attitudes among a probability sample of students at a southern university (511 males and 666 females).  Hypotheses derived from two competing versions of attribution theory, &quotdefensive attribution&quot and &quotneed for control,&quot are tested to examine the effects of gender, past female sexual victimization, past male sexual aggression, nonsexual crime victimization, and risk-taking on rape myth acceptance.  The results show that: (1) females are substantially less likely to blame rape victims; (2) among females, risk taking and rape victim blame are negatively associated; (3) among males, past sexual aggression and risk taking are positively related to victim blaming; and (4) male experience with nonsexual victimization is negatively related to victim blaming.  Each version of attribution theory is partially confirmed by the findings.  Nationality, race/ethnicity, class standing, and rape prevention knowledge also influence victim-blaming attitudes.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Victims of Violence</H3>
<B>Homicide:  Drinking by the Victim<BR>
<I>Welte, J. W.; Abel, E. L.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Studies on Alcohol </I>50(3):197-201, 1989
<BLOCKQUOTE>A comparison was made between homicides in which the victim had either been drinking or had not been drinking.  Medical examiner records for 792 homicides in Erie County, NY, from 1972 through 1984 were used. A logistic regression found that in a significantly higher proportion of certain types of homicides there was alcohol in the victim's blood:  male victims; victims aged 30-49; homicides that occur in the warmer months and in the evening or at night; homicides not related to another crime; stabbings; and homicides that take place in bars and restaurants.  Some circumstances associated with a very high likelihood of alcohol in the victim's blood were:  men killed at night; men killed by women; Black male victims; and all killings on Saturday or Sunday nights.  These results suggest that a high likelihood of alcohol in victims is associated with circumstances that make drinking more likely (e.g., male victims, homicide at night), but also alcohol is more likely present in homicides that arise spontaneously from personal disputes. It was also found that there is a higher likelihood of alcohol in the victim for homicides that occur during time periods when there are more homicides.  It is suggested that in some cases the alcohol may be a causal factor in the homicide. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Hispanic Victims<BR>
<I>Bastian, L. S.</I></B><BR>
<I>Bureau of Justice Statistics:  Special Report </I> January 1990
<BLOCKQUOTE>This report provides detailed information on how crime affects Hispanics residing in the United States. Data are based on the National Crime Surveythe Nation's second largest ongoing household survey, sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statistics.  One of the major findings in this analysis is that compared to other groups, Hispanics are victimized mostly by robbery. Findings on this and other crimes suffered by Hispanics are presented in this report, which includes trends in crime rates, demographic characteristics of the surveyed Hispanic population, location of violent crimes and who committed them, and crime outcomes.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Substance Use, Risky Behaviors, and Victimization Among a U.S. National Adolescent Sample<BR>
<I>Windle, M.</I></B><BR>
<I>Addiction </I>89(2):175-182, 1994<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Data from the National Adolescent Student Health Survey were used to study the interrelations among substance use, risky (dangerous) behaviors, and victimization among 8th and 10th graders.  Pearson correlations indicated significant associations between substance use and both higher-levels of risky behaviors (e.g., hitchhiking, going on a blind date) and victimization among adolescents.  Regression analyses indicated the potency of risky behaviors as a predictor of victimization for male adolescents, and a significant risky behavior by illicit drug use interaction for female adolescents.  Results are discussed with regard to potential short- and long-term health consequences of risky behaviors and violent victimization for psychological developments in adolescence and adulthood.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Gun Violence</H3>
<B>Drugs and Guns Among Inner-City High School Students<BR>
<I>Sheley, J.F.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Drug Education </I>24(4):303-321, 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>Despite public and governmental concern about the issue, little has occurred in the way of a systematic assessment of the gun-possession profiles of young persons involved in the use and distribution of drugs. This article reports the results of an analysis of survey data collected from male, inner-city high school students. The data pertain to firearms possession and carrying, use of heroin, cocaine, and crack, the sale of drugs, and commission of crimes with weapons.  The findings offer no evidence of a progressive, linear relationship between level of drug use and gun possession (including number of guns owned and the routine carrying of guns). However, disregarding level of drug use, when non-users were compared with users, and &quotheavy&quot users were compared with those who did not use drugs &quotheavily,&quot significant differences in involvement in gun possession did appear. When the authors separated students who did not sell drugs from those who did, the latter generally exhibited higher involvement in gun possession.  Finally, drug sellers who also committed crimes with weapons exceeded drug sellers who did not in involvement in some but not all, types of gun possession.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Drug Activity and Firearms Possession and Use by Juveniles<BR>
<I>Sheley, J.F.</I></B><BR>
<I>The Journal of Drug Issues </I>24(3):363-382, 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>Despite considerable public attention to the issue, little has occurred in the way of a systematic assessment of the gun-possession and gun-use profiles of young persons involved in the use and distribution of drugs.  This article reports the results of an analysis of survey data collected from juveniles incarcerated in maximum security reformatories.  The data pertain to firearms possession, carrying and use, use of heroin, cocaine, and crack, the sale of drugs, and involvement in armed robbery.  The findings offer no evidence of a progressive, linear relationship between level of drug use and gun possession (including number of guns owned and the routine carrying of guns) and use.  However, disregarding level of drug use, when nonusers were compared with users who did not sell drugs, significant differences in involvement in gun possession and use did appear.  Also, when the authors separated users who did not sell drugs from users who did, the latter generally displayed higher involvement in gun possession and use.  Drug selling clearly increased gun-related behavior. Finally, drug users who also committed robberies exceeded drug users who did not in involvement in gun possession and use.  Drug sellers who robbed similarly were higher in the same activities than sellers who did not.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Gun Ownership as a Risk Factor for Homicide in the Home<BR>
<I>Kellerman, A. L.; Rivara, F. P.; Rushforth, N. B.; Banton, J. G.; Reay, D. T.; Francisco, J. T.; Locci, A. B.; Prodzinski, J.; Hackman, B. B.; Somes, G.</I></B><BR>
<I>New England Journal of Medicine </I>329(15):1084-1091, 1993
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is unknown whether keeping a firearm in the home confers protection against crime or, instead, increases the risk of violent crime in the home.  To study risk factors for homicide in the home, the authors identified homicides occurring in the homes of victims in three metropolitan counties.  After each homicide, they obtained data from the police or medical examiner and interviewed a proxy for the victim.  The proxies' answers were compared with those of control subjects who were matched to the victims according to neighborhood, sex, race, and age range.  Crude and adjusted odds ratios were calculated with matched-pairs methods. During the study period, 1,860 homicides occurred in the three counties, 444 of them (23.9 percent) in the home of the victim. After excluding 24 cases for various reasons, the authors interviewed proxy respondents for 93 percent of the victims.  Controls were identified for 99 percent of these, yielding 388 matched pairs.  As compared with the controls, the victims more often lived alone or rented their residence.  Also, case households more commonly contained an illicit-drug user, a person with prior arrests, or someone who had been hit or hurt in a fight in the home.  After controlling for these characteristics, the authors found that keeping a gun in the home was strongly and independently associated with an increased risk of homicide (adjusted odds ratio, 2.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 4.4).  Virtually all of this risk involved homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance.  The use of illicit drugs and a history of physical fights in the home are important risk factors for homicide in the home.  Rather than confer protection, guns kept in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member of intimate acquaintance.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Journal of the American Medical Association </I>273(22): 1749-1754, June 14, 1995
<BLOCKQUOTE>This paper describes the magnitude and characteristics of nonfatal firearm-related injuries treated in hospital emergency departments in the United States and compares nonfatal injury rates with firearm-related fatality rates.  Nonfatal firearm-related injuries contributed substantially to the overall public health burden of firearm-related injuries in the US. A national surveillance system is needed to provide uniform data on firearm-related injury morbidity and mortality for use in research and prevention efforts.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Hospitalization Charges, Costs, and Income for Firearm-Related Injuries at a University Trauma Center<BR>
<I>Kizer, K.W., Vassar, M.J., Harry, R.L., Layton, K.D.  </I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of the American Medical Association </I>273(22): 1768-1773, 1995
<BLOCKQUOTE>This study quantifies the actual cost of inpatient medical care for firearm-related injuries at a university trauma center.  Treatment of firearm-related injuries produces net income for this university trauma center by virtue of the cost shifting built into its pricing structure.  If data from this institution are extrapolated to the Nation, then the actual cost of providing medical care for firearm-related injuries in the United States in 1995 is projected to be $4 billion.  The majority of this cost will be paid indirectly by private health insurance.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from National Criminal Justice Reference Service, P.O. Box 6000, Rockville, MD 20850; 800-638-8736; NCJ#154303.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>To guide U.S. Attorneys in their violence prevention efforts and to assist States and jurisdictions in responding to this epidemic, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice, has developed this document.  It provides a synthesis of the most current available programs that seek to reduce youth gun violence.  The programs represent an array of strategies from school-based prevention programs to gun market interception.  To ground these programs and provide a context for their successful implementation, relevant research, evaluation, and legislation are also provided.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Suicide</H3>
<B>Blood Alcohol Levels in Suicide Cases<BR>
<I>Hayward, L.; Zubrick, S.R.; Silburn, S.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health </I>46(3):256-260, 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>This study investigated the relationship between alcohol consumption prior to suicide and the act of suicide.  This was a retrospective total ascertainment survey of a 3-year cohort of suicides in Western Australia.  Data were extracted from coroner's records of suicide in Western Australia between 1986 and 1988 inclusive.  The study involved 515 consecutive suicides: 414 males and 101 females.  Information on blood alcohol levels at time of death, drug and alcohol abuse history, psychiatric history, life events prior to death, and method of suicide were collected.  It was found that 35.8 percent of cases had a positive blood alcohol reading.  Those who had been drinking alcohol prior to suicide were younger, more likely to be male, more likely to have chosen carbon monoxide as the method of suicide, more likely to have experienced a break up of a relationship, and less likely to have sought professional help than those who had not been drinking.  Data from the present study do not provide evidence for a causal relationship between alcohol consumption and suicide.  Differences between those who had consumed alcohol and those who had not are suggestive of a contributory role of alcohol to a decision to commit suicide in a subset of suicide cases.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Suicidal Behavior and History of Substance Abuse<BR>
<I>Adams, D. M.; Overholser, J. C.</I></B><BR>
<I>American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse </I>18(3):343-354, 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>Substance abuse is frequently associated with suicidal behavior.  However, it is unclear to what degree substance abuse in a family member is related to suicide.  In the present study, personal and family histories of substance abuse were examined in 716 psychiatric emergency room patients.  Suicide attempters, suicide ideators, and nonsuicidal controls were compared across demographic, clinical, and substance abuse variables.  Results showed that suicidal patients differed from nonsuicidal controls on many of the dependent variables.  Suicidal patients were more likely to be depressed and report a history of previous suicidal tendencies.  Also, alcohol and drug abuse occurred more frequently in suicidal than nonsuicidal patients.  These patterns of substance abuse in suicidal patients were especially prominent among older subjects. Results are discussed in terms of the implications for identifying psychiatric emergency room patients at risk for suicide.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Journal of Alcohol and Drug Education </I>39(2):101-111, 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>In a partial replication of the Harlow, Newcomb, & Bentler (1986) study, the relationships between depression, meaninglessness, suicide ideation, and substance abuse are examined in two samples of adolescents (48 high school students and 113 patients in two psychiatric hospitals).  Correlational analyses indicated that the high school students who viewed themselves negatively, were depressed, or who had found little meaning in their lives were more likely to consider suicide and to abuse drugs.  Regression and structural modeling analyses uncovered a strong mediational relationship between purpose in life with the precursor of depression and the consequent of substance abuse.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>American Journal of Public Health </I>83(2):179-184, 1993
<BLOCKQUOTE>This study analyzed the frequency and correlates of suicidal behaviors in a community sample of adolescents.  Information concerning suicidal thoughts and acts, aggressive behaviors, substance use, and physical recklessness were collected with the 70-item, self-report Youth Risk Behavior Survey from a statewide sample of 3,764 South Carolina public high school students.  Seventy-five percent of students reported serious suicidal thoughts, 6.4 percent reported specific suicidal plans, 5.9 percent reported attempts not requiring medical care, and 1.6 percent reported attempts requiring medical care.  All types of suicidal behaviors occurred more frequently in females than males. Odds ratios for aggressive behaviors and cigarette use were elevated across all categories of suicide behaviors, increasing in magnitude with severity of reported suicidal behavior.  Substance use was associated with some but not all categories of suicidal behaviors.  The relationships were most pronounced with the use of potentially more dangerous drugs. The results suggest that suicidal behaviors are not infrequent occurrences among adolescents and that they often coexist with other high-risk behaviors. Interventions designed to reduce suicidal behaviors should simultaneously address coexisting high-risk behaviors.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Emergency Department in Surveillance of Attempted Suicide:  Findings and Methodologic Considerations<BR>
<I>Birkhead, G. S.; Galvin, V. G.; Meehan, P. J.; O'Carroll, P. W.; Mercy, J. A.</I></B><BR>
<I>Public Health Reports </I>108(3):323-331, 1993
<BLOCKQUOTE>The authors conducted one of the first active, population-based public health surveillance systems for detecting suicide attempts in the United States. Surveillance was conducted in all four hospital emergency departments serving a county suburban to Atlanta, GA, with a population of 426,000. Emergency department staff gathered information from all patients who presented with an intentionally self-inflicted injury (suicide attempt) or with thoughts about self-injury (suicidal ideation).  During an 18-month period in 1988 and 1989, 798 suicide attempt-related patients were reported, for a rate of 124.7 per 100,000 county residents per year.  Females had a higher attempted suicide rate than males, but males had a higher completed suicide rate.  Ingestion of drugs or poison was the most common method of attempted suicide (71.1 percent), and use of firearms was the most common method of completed suicide (69.8 percent).  In comparing reported cases with those found by reviewing emergency department log books, the authors found that the case reports were 58 percent complete and that surveillance reporting was highly representative of all cases requiring emergency transport. The authors conclude that emergency department-based surveillance for attempted suicide is feasible.  It can provide representative data that may be used to monitor trends in attempted suicide and to define high-risk groups. Such surveillance may also allow timely detection of suicide attempt clusters, facilitating prompt intervention.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>The Impact of Hate Violence on Victims:  Emotional and Behavioral Responses to Attacks<BR>
<I>Barnes, A., Ephross, P.H.  </I></B><BR>
<I>Social Work </I>39(3): 247-251, 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>This study examined the nature of hate violence and its impact on 59 victims (ages 16-67 years) who experienced hate crimes.  Data were obtained through focus group meetings, individual interviews, and questionnaires.  More than half of the subjects reported experiencing a series of attacks rather than a single attack.  Anger, fear, and sadness were the emotional responses they most frequently reported.  About one-third of the subjects reported behavioral responses such as moving from the neighborhood or purchasing a gun.  The emotional and behavioral responses of victims of hate violence were similar to those of victims of other types of personal crime.  Practitioners and group work services can help victims to manage the stress of hate violence.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Motivated by Hatred or Prejudice:  The Making of Police Hate Crime Data <BR>
<I>Boyd, E. A., Hamner, K., Berk, R. </I></B><BR>
Conference Paper -- Society for the Study of Social Problems, 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>Though hate crimes--motivated by the racial, ethnic, religious, or sexual identity of the victim--have increasingly become the focus of public and media concern, there remains little agreement over what actually constitutes a hate crime.  Examined here are the conceptualizations, official procedures, and interpretive practices in one police department charged with collecting official hate crime data, based on 7 months of observation and interviews in 8 of 18 divisions in a large metropolitan police department.  It is suggested that police hate crime data must be understood as the result of a complex interaction of departmental structures, individual expectations, and concerns among officers to meet the demands of functioning within the police bureaucracy and the greater context of the city.  The conceptualization of hate crimes as a practical and social problem is described, and the specific interpretations and decisions made by detectives assigned the job of categorizing crimes as hate-motivated are analyzed.  Implications of these practices for the understanding of official hate crime data and the nature of hate crimes as a social problem are discussed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Carter, J.H.  </I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of the National Medical Association </I>86(7): 543-547, July 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>This study presents an historical perspective on racism and its impact on the mental health of African Americans.  Recently uncovered issues of racism that negatively affect the mental health of minorities are the escalation of hate crimes, housing discrimination, and school resegregation.  Epidemiological studies of mental illness identify racism as a major contributor to psychopathology.  Mental health professionals have an ethical responsibility to identify and strengthen minority community support systems and help initiate strategies to empower minorities to demand equitable health care.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Documenting Prejudice Against Lesbians and Gay Men on Campus:  The Yale Sexual Orientation Survey<BR>
<I>Herek, G.M.  </I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Homosexuality </I>25(4): 15-30, 1993
<BLOCKQUOTE>This study reports the methodology and results of a survey conducted at Yale University in 1986 documenting the frequency and forms of harassment, discrimination, and violence against gay and bisexual people on campus.  Results from 215 completed surveys revealed that many lesbians, gay men and bisexual people on campus lived in a world of secretiveness and fear.  Although experiences of physical assault on campus were relatively infrequent, many respondents reported other forms of discrimination and harassment.  A majority reported that they feared anti-gay violence, had harassment on campus, and that such fears affected their behavior.  Replications on other campuses have yielded similar results.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Social Movement Growth, Domain Expansion, and Framing Processes:  The Gay/Lesbian Movement and Violence Against Gays and Lesbians as a Social Problem<BR>
<I>Jenness, V.  </I></B><BR>
<I>Social Problems </I>42(1): 145-179, 1995
<BLOCKQUOTE>This work offers an empirical analysis of 32 gay/lesbian sponsored anti-violence projects in the U.S.  The analytic focus is on how gay and lesbian communities have brought attention to the scope and consequences of anti-gay and lesbian violence in the United States, which &quothas taken its place among such societal concerns as violence against women, children and ethnic and racial groups.&quot  In large part, this is because within lesbian and gay communities across the U.S. there has been an &quotunprecedented level of organizing against violence.&quot  This activism continues to include documenting the incidence and prevalence of anti-gay and lesbian violence, establishing crisis intervention and victim assistance programs, sponsoring public education campaigns, and undertaking surveillance efforts in the form of street patrols.  Analysis of these activities brings together elements of the social problems and the social movements literature; it demonstrates that domain expansion accompanies social movement growth and provides a necessary resource for framing select social conditions as a social problem.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Violence in the Media</H3>
<B>Community Violence, Children's Development, and Mass Media:  In Pursuit of New Insights, New Goals, and New Strategies<BR>
<I>Friedlander, B.Z.</I></B><BR>
<I>Psychiatry </I>56(1):66-81, Feb 1993
<BLOCKQUOTE>Community violence that victimizes children is an unmitigated evil exacerbated by vast economic and social forces.  It leaves people in central cities and the rural countryside adrift on seas of rolelessness, hopelessness, group disintegration, and alienation.  The contemporary drug scene and the easy availability of guns greatly intensifies violence on a local scale, while crimes of violence, especially with guns, appear to be level or declining in the Nation as a whole.  Claims that the persistently high levels of violence in mass media, mostly television, are largely responsible for violence in society represent narrow views of very large issues.  These narrow views overlook essential elements of both phenomenaviolence and media.  Direct models of interpersonal violence in families and in the community probably give rise to more violent behavior than indirect models in media.  Disinhibitory and provocative aspects of media probably do as much or more to trigger violent behavior than violent narratives and violent actions.  Comprehensive meta-analysis indicates that prosocial messages on television can have greater effects on behavior than antisocial messages.  These data support the contention that mass media can play a strong and positive role in alleviating some of the distress of victims of community violence, and in redirecting the behavior of some of its perpetrators so as to protect the children.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>The Video Violence Debate<BR>
<I>Lande, R.G.</I></B><BR>
</I>Hospital and Community Psychiatry  iii 44(4):347-51, April 1993
<BLOCKQUOTE>Some researchers and theorists are convinced that graphic scenes of violence on television and in movies are inextricably linked to human aggression.  Others insist that a link has not been conclusively established.  This paper summarizes scientific studies that have information on these two perspectives.  Although many instances of children and adults imitating video violence have been documented, no court has imposed liability for harm allegedly resulting from a video program.  This indicates that considerable doubt still exists about the role of video violence in stimulating human aggression.  The author suggests that a small group of vulnerable viewers are probably more impressionable and therefore more likely to suffer deleterious effects from violent programming.  The author proposes that research on video violence be narrowed to identifying and describing the vulnerable viewer.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This review article describes the effects of television within the framework of normal child development, and natural exposure to television as a cause of aggression and violence.  The author makes recommendations for lessening the negative impact of television violence.  Pediatricians can help by advising parents to limit their children's television viewing and to model appropriate behavior by removing televisions from their waiting rooms.  Parents should monitor and restrict their children's exposure to violent programming, either in person or through the use of specially designed television sets.  Finally, a violence rating system for all programming should be initiated to help parents decide which shows are appropriate for their children to watch. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>From the Director of CSAP...</H3>
<B><P>Roughly 27 percent of the U.S. population lives in rural regions of the country.  These citizens face challenges that city-dwellers and suburbanites do not.  Geographic isolation, lack of available resources and activities, and a relative absence of anonymity lead many rural residents to turn to alcohol and others drugs.</P>
This guide includes a host of resources that we believe will help prevention specialists, teachers, health care providers, and others like you in our mutual quest for drug-free neighborhoods.  This guide offers hope for our rural communities, and we at CSAP look forward to working side by side with you as we pursue this exciting goal.<BR><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Indian teenagers in the United States have poorer health than the general population and the greatest frequency of alcohol-related problems of any ethnic group.  Common barriers to their use of health care services are compounded by isolation, distance, and absence of suitable services in rural areas.  A demonstration project established in rural New Mexico to overcome these barriers (1) set up one location where teenagers can obtain free, integrated, multiple health care services; (2) formed links with other agencies; and (3) incorporated community action toward change.  Alcohol abuse evaluation, education, and counseling are among the project model's components, as is sponsorship of such activities as Students Against Driving Drunk (SADD).  Adolescents participating directly in program planning have presented workshops at other schools on such topics as alcohol and drug abuse.  The Teen Advisory Group presented a skit on drinking and driving.  Preliminary findings indicate that most of the target population is using the services, with the proportions of girls and boys about equal, and the project is being replicated.  26 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<B>Antecedents of Rural Adolescent Alcohol Use:  Risk Factor Approach<BR>

<I>Journal of Drug Education </I>21(4):  361-376, 1991<BR>
(Available from Linda P. Bloch, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>The present study examines the association between risk factors and alcohol use for a sample of young adolescents in a rural eastern community.  Family relations, family structure, marks in school, participation in academic activities, frequency of church attendance, and deviant behavior were found to be significantly associated with alcohol use 2 years later.  No gender or age differences were found in these predictors of alcohol use.  These six risk variables were combined to form a risk index.  A 3 x 2 x 2 (User group by Gender and Grade) ANOVA was used to examine the association between the risk index score at Year 1 and level of alcohol use at Year 3.  Only the main effect for User group was significant.  Thus, the number of risk factors at Year 1 was predictive of alcohol use at Year 3.  The risk index also predicted frequency of alcohol use in a replication sample.  Implications for the risk factor approach, prevention, and intervention are discussed.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>A sample of 1,004 8th and 10th grade students in 23 small central/east Texas communities was assessed to determine (1) their perception of the number of their friends who use drugs, (2) the amount of information they received about drugs from their friends, and (3) the connection between those perceptions and drug use.  A multiple regression model that included grade, gender, the degree to which friends are perceived to use drugs, and the amount of information about drugs received from friends explained 39 percent of the variance in the degree to which rural adolescents were involved in drug use.  An item-specific analysis of the subcomponents of these composite variables explained 44 percent of the variance in the degree to which rural adolescents were involved in drug use.  This same four-factor model accurately classified over 81 percent of non-drug users and 67 percent of users using discriminant analysis.  Students who perceived a higher degree of drug use among their friends and who received more information about drugs from their friends used drugs more frequently.  Lower marijuana use in these rural areas as compared to the Nation, both as a peer perception and as a fact, may protect these students to a degree from broader patterns of drug use.  The findings of this study support the theory that peer pressure is related to drug abuse, even in rural areas.  19 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

(Available from the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information, P.O. Box 2345, Rockville, MD 20847.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>Although the majority of research studies concerning alcohol and other drug (AOD) problems among youth are based in urban populations, AOD use is not a problem confined to the cities.  Many studies have found that AOD use has reached an alarming rate in rural regions.  This document describes a study of AOD use and related behavioral problems of participants enrolled in the Adolescent Substance Prevention Education Network (ASPEN), a program sponsored by the Shawnee/Adolescent Health Center (SAHC) and designed to reduce AOD problems among pregnant teens in rural southern Illinois.  The ASPEN curriculum includes eight modules that address the following topics:  general alcohol and other drug information; fetal development; decision making and self-esteem; alcohol, health, and nutrition; prescription and nonprescription drugs; smoking; marijuana; and stress.  Pilot study findings showed a high rate of cigarette and caffeine use among ASPEN program participants.  Many of the participants' friends were involved with AOD use, indicating a need to add a refusal skills/peer pressure component to the ASPEN curriculum package.  Participants said they had heard about the problems related to AOD use and pregnancy through SAHC, suggesting strong support for the implementation of similar programs in other adolescent health clinic settings.  12 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

(Available from Albert D. Farrell, Department of Psychology, Box No. 2018, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23284-2018.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>This study tested the relevance of a risk factor model for predicting drug use among rural adolescents.  A questionnaire assessing drug use and the presence/absence of 20 risk factors derived from a previous study of urban adolescents was administered to a sample of seventh graders in the public school system of a rural community.  All but one of these risk factors were found to be significantly associated with the prevalence and frequency of use for cigarettes, beer and wine, hard liquor, marijuana, and other drugs.  These findings support the generalizability of a risk factor approach to predicting drug use and underscore the need for increased prevention and research efforts directed at rural adolescents.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

Employee Assistance Quarterly 7(1/2):117-139, 1992<BR>
(Available from <I>Drugs and Society</I>, The Haworth Press, 10 Alice Street, Binghamton, NY 13904.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>This article is the result of a literature review and assessment of rural drug abuse research and drug research policy formation by U.S. Government agencies.  It also presents results of a participant observation study of one of the major research institutes, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and its linkages with groups influential to its research policies.  NIDA also had linkages that influence its other activities, such as service and drug testing oversight functions; however, these activities were not studied.  This review reveals a decade of relative inattention to the job of obtaining a national assessment of the rural drug situation, especially with regard to prevalence and impact of drugs in the adult population, efficacy of prevention efforts by rural institutions and workplaces, effectiveness of treatment programs, and drugs and crime.  There have also been relatively few individual subnational or regional research efforts or even rural-urban case study comparisons aimed at these research topics.  A variety of influences on drug research policy were discovered.  Rural drug research advocates need to be knowledgeable about these influences in order to use them to stimulate support for rural drug research.  The main influences were found to be in certain committees and offices in the legislative and executive branches of the Federal Government.  Cases were also identified, however, in which non-governmental organizations were found to be influential and, in certain cases, even individuals were found to have some impact on research policy.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

(Available from Rutgers University, Box 969, Piscataway, NJ 08855.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>Data from a 1983-88 retrospective panel study of 797 rural (non-Metropolitan Statistical Area) U.S. hospitals revealed that less than one in five (18.7 percent) had any alcohol and chemical abuse (ACA) service.  About one-third of both inpatient and outpatient services had been established during the study period, but few hospitals not offering these services planned to offer them in the immediate future.  These findings support other studies showing that the availability of such services may not meet population need or demand, although analysis showed that hospitals in more densely populated counties with higher per capita income and more physicians per 1,000 population were positively associated with ACA services.  Hospitals that were in the New England, Mid-Atlantic, East North Central census divisions and were large according to number of beds, presence of psychiatric services, availability of psychiatrists and other non-physician personnel, certain organizational arrangements, and strategic management activities were positively associated with ACA services.  Multivariable logistic regression suggested the presence of psychiatric service as a key correlate of ACA services, and the scarcity of psychiatric personnel in rural areas appears to have been a major reason for the infrequence of rural hospital-sponsored ACA services.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

(Available from the U.S. General Accounting Office, P.O. Box 6015, Gaithersburg, MD 20877.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>This report, written at the request of five U.S. senators, examines the extent and the effects of the drug crisis in rural areas of the United States.  The researchers defined substance abuse as involvement with illegal drugs, illegal use of drugs, or drug use linked to other criminal activity or needing treatment.  The research data show that total substance abuse rates in rural States are about as high as in nonrural States; of all substances, alcohol is by far the most widely abused; and the difference between rural and nonrural areas is that prevalence rates for some drugs (such as cocaine) appear to be lower in rural areas, while prevalence rates for other drugs (such as inhalants) may be higher.  Other findings:  rural area arrest rates for substance abuse violations are as high as those in nonrural areas; most prison inmates in rural States have abused alcohol, other drugs, or both; and the prevalence of substance abuse among inmates completely overwhelms available treatment services.  For purposes of this study, a rural State is defined as having a population density of 50 persons or fewer per square mile.  These are:  Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming.  48 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>After presenting a review of the literature on alcohol use and abuse among American Indians from the early 1950s until the present, this paper describes research on alcoholic beverage consumption among urban and rural American Indians and its relationship to selected demographic, psychological, and personal history variables.  A total of 323 Indians of both sexes, representing four tribal affiliations (Navaho, Sioux, Eastern Oklahoma Indians, and California Indians) and residing in the Los Angeles area or in their respective rural or reservation homelands, were included in this study.  The participants ranged from abstainers to very heavy drinkers.  Current and former drinking frequency and quantity measures from partially overlapping samples (with lifetime abstainers included with current drinkers, on the one hand, and with now-abstaining former drinkers on the other) were subjected to multivariate analyses of variance and covariance.  The effects on drinking of urban versus rural residence, tribal affiliation, and sex, as well as interrelationships with participants' age, proportion of Indian ancestry, psychosomatic stress (as measured by the Cornell Medical Index CMI), and drinking in the household of origin are assessed.  The findings are discussed in relation to ethnographic observations and recent historical developments, as well as theoretical and policy implications.  118 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Alcohol use by 1,190 fourth, fifth, and sixth grade students was assessed in a survey of four rural New Hampshire school districts.  Half of the students surveyed (596) drank, but not regularly; 5 percent (59) were regular drinkers, and an additional 2 percent (19) were regular drinkers and had been drunk at least once.  Reported alcohol use increased with both grade and age, and males drank more than females.  The child's attitude toward drinking, perceived family attitudes towards drinking, the number of drinking friends, and self- perception were four factors strongly related to alcohol use.  Increased alcohol use was also associated with experimental and current use of cigarettes, marijuana, and smokeless tobacco.  45 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<B>Health Care in Rural America:  Summary </B><BR>
Report, Office of Technology Assessment, Congress of the United States, September 1990<BR>
(Available from the Office of Technology Assessment, Washington, DC 20510-8025.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>This report discusses the access of people in rural America to basic health care services.  The 1980s witnessed rural economic decline and instability, major changes in Federal health programs, and increasing concern about the long-term viability of the rural health care system.  This concern prompted the Senate Rural Health Caucus and the Ranking Minority Member of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources to request that OTA assess the availability of health services in rural communities, the problems rural providers face, and the remedial strategies that might be influenced by Federal policy.  This report focuses on trends in the availability of primary and acute health care in rural areas and factors affecting those trends.  For example, rural residents are characterized by relatively low mortality but relatively high rates of chronic disease; persons living in low-density &quotfrontier&quot counties--counties of six or fewer persons per square mile--can have geographic access problems of immense proportions; and rural residents are much more likely than urban residents to have no health insurance coverage.  Rural health service issues and options are discussed as are issues surrounding personnel shortages and concerns.  Two specific services are described:  issues and options in maternal and infant care and issues and options in mental health care.  Fetal, infant, and maternal mortality are all disproportionately high in rural areas.  Two potential contributors to the relatively poorer health of rural mothers and infants are the limited availability of obstetric providers and access to specialized care for women with difficult pregnancies and deliveries.  The prevalence of mental disorders in rural Americans is similar to that of their urban counterparts.  The severe shortage of psychiatrists and doctoral-level psychologists in rural areas, the proportion of mental health care provided by nonpsychiatric physicians, and the types of services likely to be most acceptable to rural residents all suggest that integrating mental health and other health care is especially important in rural areas.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Data concerning self-reported driving after drinking or using other drugs were collected from 3,382 junior and senior high school students in rural central and southern Illinois.  Drinking, drug use, and driving increased steadily with age, with 42 percent of the 12th grade class indicating they had driven a car at least one time in the past 6 months after drinking or using other drugs.  Riding with a driver who had been drinking also increased with age:  20 percent of the seventh-grade sample had ridden in a car with a drinking driver, while 58 percent of the 12th grade sample reported having done so.  Slightly more females had ridden in a car with a driver who had been drinking than males, while males reported higher rates of driving after drinking or using other drugs than females.  Correlation analyses indicated 22 variables related significantly to drinking, drug use, and driving.  Forward stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that 11 variables related significantly to riding as a passenger with a drinking driver.  Thirteen variables were related significantly to driving after drinking or using other drugs.  Frequency of alcohol use variables were the most powerful indicators of self-reported driving after drinking or using other drugs in this sample.  </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<B>Prevalence of Substance Use in a Rural Teenage Population

<BLOCKQUOTE>A survey was administered to all students enrolled in a rural county school system, grades 7-12 (N = 1,175) to assess prevalence rates of substance use for teens and their parents and lifestyle variables that relate to substance use.  The variables of age, sex, and race were all related to both frequency and type of substance abuse.  Lifestyle variables, such as music preference, sexual activity, and choice of friends, also related to substance use.  Recommendations for planning primary prevention programs based upon findings were discussed.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<B>Rural Black Adolescents:  Psychosocial Development in a Changing Environment<BR>
<I>Lee, C.C.</I></B><BR>
In: <I> Black Adolescents</I>, R.L. Jones, Ed., pp. 79-96. Berkeley, CA:  Cobb & Henry, Publishers, 1989 
<BLOCKQUOTE>This chapter focuses on the psychosocial development of Black adolescents residing in rural areas of the Nation.  Despite the fact that approximately one-fourth of the Black population of the United States lives in rural regions, most analysis and research has focused exclusively on the social and economic considerations of urban Black youth.  While rural youth face many of the same challenges that confront urban adolescents, the nature of the rural Black environment serves to alter the impact of these stresses for rural youth.  Identity development among rural Black adolescents appears to be influenced by several major areas:  home and family life, school experiences, social relationships, activities, aspirations, attitudes and values, and self-concept.  Close, supportive family systems and well-developed community networks that include the church and the school seem to play the most significant roles in psychosocial development.  Socialization within these networks produces important personality characteristics that provide the basis for adolescent identity formation.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<B>Substance Abuse Among Youth (Grades 4-12) in Rural Indiana:  Parents' vs. Children's Perceptions<BR>

Conference Paper, Madison Consolidated Schools, February 7-8, 1991<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The purposes of this study were to assess the use of substances by 2,125 youth (grades 4-12) in rural Indiana and to explore the differences in perceptions between these students and their parents regarding the students' use of substances.  While all parents believed that some students were using cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana, they seriously underestimated the percentage of students in their child's grade who reported the use of a variety of substances (especially alcohol) by themselves and their peers.  If parents are to be allies in the fight against drugs, it is imperative that they be aware of the severity of the problem.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

Conference Paper, Los Angeles, CA, April 28, 1990<BR>
(Available from Daniel M. Mayton, II, Lewis-Clark State College, Lewiston, ID 83501.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>Values are a central concept in understanding and predicting human behavior.  Given the increase of tobacco use among adolescents, understanding the personality variables and characteristics associated with tobacco use is critical.  The purpose of this study was to identify differences and similarities among the value hierarchies of adolescents who have never tried tobacco, adolescent tobacco experimenters, and adolescents who use tobacco daily.  A large written questionnaire was administered to a sample of 5,128 adolescents from grades 7 through 12 in the rural inland northwest.  The questionnaire assessed reported tobacco use, selected demographic information, and terminal values with the Rokeach Value Survey.  The priority placed on the terminal values of health, family security, a comfortable life, a world at peace, a sense of accomplishment, an exciting life, mature love, pleasure, social recognition, national security, and salvation were statistically significant in differentiating the three groups of adolescents.  24 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<B>Drug and Alcohol Use Prevention:  Utility and Effectiveness with Rural Fifth-Grade Students<BR>
<I>Blau, G.M.</I></B><BR>
Dissertation Abstracts International 50(8):2426-A, 1990<BR>
(Available from UMI, 300 North Zeeb Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48106.  Refer to number DA 8918773.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>The purpose of this investigation was to determine the short- and long-term effectiveness of drug and alcohol use prevention programs with rural fifth-grade students.  Five classrooms (approximately 115 children) from Pike County, Alabama, were randomly assigned to one of five treatment conditions.  These conditions were a no-treatment group, a placebo discussion group, a drug and alcohol education group, an assertiveness training group, and an interpersonal problem-solving group.  The eight sessions for these programs (with the exception of the non-treatment group) were held once a week for 1 hour.  Pretest scores were obtained 1 week prior to the start of the first session, post-test scores were obtained 3 weeks after the completion of the final session, and follow-up scores were obtained 1 year after the completion of the final session.  The short- and long-term effectiveness of these interventions were compared by using hierarchical regression analyses and analyses of variance.  The results for the short-term evaluation indicated that all programs reduced children's likelihood to use drugs compared to the control procedures.  </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<B>Sources of Drug and Alcohol Information Among Rural Youth<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The purpose of this study was to identify rural youth sources of alcohol and other drug information in order to establish baseline information for the design and development of effective rural drug and alcohol abuse prevention programs.  Data were collected from 622 junior and senior high school students in rural northwest Ohio in May 1985.  The county from which this sample was drawn is a geographically large, predominantly rural county characterized by small communities and family farms.  The media (18.8 percent) (TV, radio, newspapers, and magazines) and teachers at school (18.8 percent) were identified most frequently by the study sample as the source from which they learned the most about alcohol and other drugs.  This was followed by close friends (11.2 percent), personal experiences with drugs and alcohol (7 percent), and parents (6.9 percent).  Only 2.9 percent of the students cited brothers or sisters or people from alcohol and drug agencies as primary sources of drug and alcohol information.  &quotOther&quot was cited by 23.2 percent of the sample, while 17.8 percent said they didn't know very much about alcohol and other drugs.  24 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<I>Canadian Journal of Community Mental Health </I>8(1):5-14, 1989<BR>
(Available from Wayne R. Mitic, Ed.D., Associate Professor, Health Education Division, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, NS B3H 3J5, Canada.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>The nature and extent of alcohol-related problems experienced by adolescents were evaluated in 1,132 male and female Canadian subjects living in an urban setting and in 987 male and female Canadian subjects living in a rural setting.  The subjects were 13- to 19-year-old students in grades 9 through 12.  Information on three types of alcohol-related problems, including social consequences, early dependency symptoms, and vandalism or violence, was obtained by questionnaire.  More rural than urban junior high school students reported problems with school, police, and money, but more urban senior high school students reported pre-party drinking activity.  The overall results suggest that the small-town environment of a rural area does not provide insulation against the risks and problems of teenage alcoholism.  Implications for developing prevention and intervention programs for both rural and urban adolescents are discussed.  19 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<B>Drug Use Patterns Among American Indian and Alaska Native Youth:  Special Rural Populations<BR>
<I>Beauvais, F., and Segal, B.</I></B><BR>
<I>Drugs & Society </I>7(1/2):77-94, 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>American Indian and Alaska Native communities illustrate the great diversity found among the rural populations of the United States.  These communities are marked by cultural, socioeconomic, and historical patterns that differ from other rural groups and that lead to a distinctive set of social problems.  When compared to a national sample of youth, American Indian and Alaska Native youth show exceptionally high levels of drug use.  Because they share a number of similar cultural characteristics, it could be hypothesized that the rates of drug use among these Native groups are related to cultural traits.  However, non-Native Alaskan youth also have high rates of drug use, indicating that factors in the social environment other than culture account for this behavior.  Possible explanatory factors include uncertain economic conditions, family instability, and lack of access to cultural values.  Although rural living in itself is not necessarily a contributing factor to drug use, it does place some constraints on intervention efforts.  Geographic isolation and lack of adequate health and social service resources make it difficult to develop adequate prevention and treatment services.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<B>Trends and Issues Surrounding Rural Adolescent Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse<BR>
<I>Madlem, M.S.</I></B><BR>
<I>Prevention Forum </I>1992, (Vol. 12, No. 2), pp. 1-9
<BLOCKQUOTE>With prevalence rates declining for overall drug use, the rural areas appear to be matching, or even surpassing, urban areas.  The trends and issues surrounding rural adolescent alcohol and other drug use are examined.  The inherent population density problem faced in rural areas has contributed to the underfunding of programs targeted at the prevention and treatment of alcohol and other drug problems for rural youth.  This underfunding has led to a lack of trained and experienced staff and a lack of rural-specific programs and models from which the rural professional can draw.  19 Ref.  </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<B>Alcohol and Other Drug Service Needs in Rural Communities<BR>
<I>Long, J.E.</I></B><BR>
<I>Prevention Forum </I>Winter/Spring, 1992. p.  9
<BLOCKQUOTE>Rural families have the same concerns that urban families do about whether their children grow up drug-free.  The incidence of alcoholism and substance abuse in rural communities is no less than among urban populations.  Residents of rural communities face real barriers to treatment for substance abuse, including isolation, transportation difficulties, economic conditions, and health care shortages.  Prevention is vitally important in rural areas, but geographic distances create barriers to the delivery of effective prevention services.  The Illinois Department of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse (DASA) has worked to ensure that every community has access to an array of services from detoxification to residential rehabilitation to outpatient services and has made prevention service grants that recognize how much travel is necessary to serve rural areas.  </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<B>Physical, Subjective, and Social Availability:  Their Relationship to Alcohol Consumption in Rural and Urban Areas<BR>
<I>Abbey, A.; Scott, R.O.; and Smith, M.J.</I></B><BR>
<I>Addiction </I>88(4):489-499, 1993<BR>
(Available from Antonia Abbey, Department of Community Medicine, Wayne State University, 4201 St. Antoine, Detroit, MI 48201.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>The alcohol availability literature indicates that under some conditions, physical availability is positively associated with per capita alcohol consumption.  For example, Smart suggested that at the individual level, subjective and social aspects of availability may mediate and outweigh the influence of physical availability.  The study described here examined the simultaneous effects of physical, subjective, and social availability on alcohol consumption.  Standardized telephone interviews were conducted with 781 adult drinkers.  As hypothesized, physical availability was not a significant multivariate predictor of alcohol consumption for residents of high, medium, and low alcohol outlet density counties in Michigan.  Subjective and social availability indicators were significant predictors of alcohol consumption.  Similar patterns of results were found in multiple regression analyses for Blacks and Whites and women and men, although Blacks and women consumed less alcohol than did Whites and men.  The theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<B>Substance Abuse in Rural Communities</B><BR>
<I>Substance Abuse in Schools </I>December 1989, pp. 2-3<BR>
(Available from Substance Abuse in Schools, National Professional Resources, Inc., P.O. Box 1479, Port Chester, NY 10573.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>Alcohol remains the primary drug of abuse in rural areas, although use of crack and cocaine is increasing and tobacco smoking and chewing are also large problems.  In a small town where residents are well known to each other, it is more stigmatizing to seek help from outside professionals.  Small towns have big drug problems, but they tend to have limited resources to fight those problems.  Because of resistance from school boards, administrators, and teachers, it is difficult to establish prevention programs in schools, although that is the best chance for success.  Rural youths have a greater difficulty with the transition to high school, a key time for alcohol and drug prevention.  1 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

Report, National Rural and Small Schools Consortium, Bellingham, Washington, 1989 <BR>
(Available from the National Rural and Small Schools Consortium, Western Washington University, Miller Hall 359, Bellingham, WA 98225.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>A comprehensive literature review revealed that rural schools, although they tend to resist sex education, are experiencing growing numbers of intravenous drug users, pregnant teenagers, and sexually transmitted diseases.  Through sexual activity and intravenous drug use, rural teenagers are placing themselves at risk for becoming infected with HIV and contracting AIDS.  The relationship between teen sexual behavior and the level of self-esteem has been well established, as have problems with traditional approaches to sex education.  This article outlines factors in effective sex education programs and explains that sex education, in isolation, is not a deterrent.  Problems specific to rural areas are emphasized in the article, as are the necessity of rural-oriented approaches.  Examples of viable methods of integrating HIV education into rural schools and community life are provided.  20 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The Partners in Prevention (PIP) Project was designed as both a community and school-based substance abuse prevention and in-service training demonstration model for use in several rural Oklahoma communities.  It is believed that this project can be replicated in other rural communities in Oklahoma as well as throughout the Nation.  A step-by-step outline is provided of the PIP Project for its replication or adaptation throughout rural America.  Project activities include the collection of statistical data, training in team building, action planning, problem solving, intervention resource identification, substance abuse prevention identification and awareness, and technical assistance in creating local sanctions and guidelines.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<B>Relation of Rural Alcoholism to Farm Economy<BR>

<I>Community Mental Health Journal </I>25(4):341-347, 1989<BR>
(Available from Hudson H. Hsieh, M.D., Creighton Psychiatric Associates, 2205 South 10th Street, Omaha, NE 68108.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>The relationship of rural alcoholism to the state of the farm economy is discussed.  Data reported to the Nebraska Department of Public Institutions, Division on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse, for the 8-year period starting in 1978 were analyzed.  During this very difficult period for the farm economy, 126,350 new cases were reported, of which 5,268 or 4.2 percent were farmers.  The number of persons seeking treatment grew steadily; however, the total number of farmers seeking treatment peaked in 1982 and then began a steady decline.  It is suggested that the farmers may have looked to sources other than mental health facilities for help or that they adapted to the new demands, thereby reducing their need to use alcohol consumption as a coping mechanism.  10 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<B>State Initiatives to Improve Rural Health Care</B><BR>
Report, National Governors' Association, Washington, DC, 1990<BR>
(Available from the National Governors' Association, 444 North Capitol Street, Washington, DC 20001.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>Rural health issues have attracted significant interest during the past several years.  Governors have become acutely aware of failing rural hospitals and the shortage of health personnel in rural communities.  At the Federal level, a broad range of legislative and program initiatives have been implemented, including the creation of a Federal Office of Rural Health Policy.  Many States also have moved forward with their own programs, including the establishment of offices to serve as the focal point for rural health.  This publication describes a broad range of ongoing State programs and policies designed to improve access to health care in rural communities.  It presents the results of a State survey and includes profiles of State rural health task forces and commissions, State offices of rural health, and State rural health programs.  By identifying approaches States have used to address the common problems in rural health care delivery, this document provides an information base to guide future rural health initiatives.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<H3>From the Acting Director of CSAP...</H3>
<P><B>Roughly 18,000 people were killed in alcohol-related traffic crashes in 1992--nearly 50 lives lost every single day!  Many of these casualties are new drivers--youth between 16 and 20 years of age--for whom purchase and possession of alcohol is illegal in all 50 states.  We at CSAP understand the enormity of the impaired driving problem and have compiled this resource guide for use in homes, schools, and communities across the country.</P>
<P>By working together we can stop these senseless deaths.  We must implement prevention programs.  We must continue strict law enforcement.  We must strive to save lives, and by doing so prove once again how Prevention Works!</P>

<B>Model of Parental Involvement in Adolescent Drinking and Driving<BR>
<I>Beck, K.H. and Lockhart, S.J.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Youth and Adolescence</I>, 21(1):35-51, 1992<BR>
(Available from the University of Maryland, Safety Education Center, College Park, MD)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A model of parental prevention involvement in drinking and driving by adolescents is described. Headings within this review of the literature include: (1) adolescent drinking patterns, (2) parents as possible influence channels, (3) parent perceptions, (4) theoretical models, and (5) a model of parental involvement. Parental and adolescent perceptions of adolescent drinking inside and outside the home are presented in tabular form. Different stages of parental involvement are defined as awareness, acceptance, action, and consequences. It is suggested that although parents tend to be unaware of the true extent of their teens' drinking behavior, their effectiveness at preventing alcohol use and drinking and driving depends on their stage of involvement.  59 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Effectiveness of Legal Sanctions in Dealing with Drinking Drivers<BR>
<I>Nichols, J.L. and Ross, H.L.</I></B><BR>
<I>Alcohol, Drugs and Driving </I>6(2):33-60, 1990<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Recent research on the use of legal sanctions for drunk driving is reviewed with reference to their effectiveness as deterrence and reform methods.  The objectives of legal sanctions; types of sanctions (fines, license suspension and revocation, jail sentences, community service); the advantages and disadvantages of criminal versus administrative sanctions; and the value of general versus individual sanctions are considered.  Several U.S. and international studies on the effectiveness of jail sentences for first offenders and repeat offenders, on the efficacy of license actions in reducing recidivism, on the use of alcoholism treatment as an alternative to license actions, on the relative effectiveness of mandatory versus discretionary actions, and on the effectiveness of fines are discussed in detail.  Studies evaluating the question of whether license actions reduce drunk driving and alcohol-related crashes among drivers who are not punished are also examined.  A model sanctioning system, which suggests differing types and levels of sanctions for first and repeat offenders, is proposed. The advantages of the model sanction system are also discussed.  84 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information, P.O. Box 2345, Rockville, MD 20852)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Several approaches for reducing adolescent drinking and driving are reviewed including provisional licensing, restriction of driving hours (curfew laws), revocation of driving privileges because of alcohol use, restricting access to alcohol, and controlling the use of false identification.  The benefits and effectiveness of parent-supervised driving practice, license testing and driver improvement actions, night driving curfews, and the use of more stringent license sanctions for young drinking drivers than for adults are discussed.  Problems associated with enforcement of measures targeting youth drivers are also considered.  22 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information, P.O. Box 2345, Rockville, MD 20852)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The effectiveness of impersonal preventive measures in reducing the risk of fatal vehicle crashes is discussed. These measures, which include raising the legal drinking age, increasing alcohol beverage excise taxes, and making use of availability controls, work either by reducing the availability of alcohol or by heightening public perception of risks associated with drinking and driving. The relationship between enforcement practices, standards for driving while intoxicated, and the use of breath analysis to reduction of fatalities from alcohol-involved crashes is also considered.  The effectiveness of education campaigns and warning labels on containers of alcoholic beverages is examined.  28 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information, P.O. Box 2345, Rockville, MD 20852)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Recent research on the impact of specific deterrence measures--directed at drivers who have been convicted of drinking and driving violations--and of general deterrence measures--directed at all persons whether or not they drink and drive--are discussed.  Several studies on the effects of jail sentences, license suspension and revocation, preliminary breath analysis, and administrative or criminal per se laws on recidivism rates for drinking and driving are reviewed.  The effects of local enforcement campaigns, public perception of enforcement, and social pressure on recidivism rates are also examined.

<B>Bad Drivers:  Identification of a Target Group for Alcohol- Related Prevention and Early Intervention<BR>
<I>Donovan, D.M.; Umlauf, R.L.; and Salzberg, P.M.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Studies on Alcohol</I>, 51(2):136-141, 1990<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Individuals arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI) have been targeted for preventive intervention of alcohol-related problems. However, high rates of diagnosed alcoholism among DWI arrestees suggest a need to identify individuals at risk earlier in the developmental process.  The present study investigates one such group, namely male &quotbad drivers&quot with a history of multiple nonalcohol-related driving convictions.  Over 11 percent of a sample of 254 men identified as bad drivers during an index year received an initial DWI arrest over a subsequent 3-year follow-up period.  This was over five times greater than the rate of initial DWI arrest among a representative sample of men from the general driving population over the same time period.  The same high rate of subsequent DWI arrests among drivers having four or more driving offenses within the index year was replicated in a 1 percent probability sample of over 39,000 drivers from the general driving population.  Those individuals from the original group of 254 bad drivers who received an initial DWI had significantly higher levels of drinking at the time of their original identification as bad drivers than did those who did not receive a DWI.  The results were discussed in terms of early identification and preventive interventions within the population of bad drivers.  28 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Recent research on the differences between three subcategories of drinking drivers is reviewed.  These subcategories include the &quotQuick,&quot who are drinking drivers who have never been arrested for alcohol-involved problems; the &quotCaught,&quot who are motorists who are apprehended and convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI); and the &quotDead,&quot who are fatally injured drivers who have positive blood alcohol concentrations. Data sources for these studies include official public records, including the Fatal Accident Reporting System, roadside research surveys, personal interviews, and specific surveys of convicted DUI offenders.  The overall results indicate that most first offenders are problem-drinkers who had not been previously caught nor had yet been caught for a second DUI offense.  Several types of first and multiple DUI offenders were determined:  negligent operator, pre-DUI alcoholic, DUI alcoholic, life crisis problem drinker, deceptive problem drinker, white-collar controlled problem drinker, blue-collar controlled problem drinker, problem drinker, and social-normative problem drinker.  Studies on the characteristics of DUI offenders and recidivist DUI offenders and on risk factors associated with DUI are also summarized.  30 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This article describes the development and uses of the Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS), initiated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 1975. To date, FARS contains information on over 600,000 motor vehicle crashes resulting in fatalities.  The methodology used in collecting and interpretating the data, especially that used to estimate the blood alcohol content (BAC) of drivers who were not tested or whose BAC is unknown, is discussed.  An analysis of data in FARS has indicated that alcohol involvement in fatal crashes has declined steadily over the past 7 years, that the proportion of drivers with very high BACs (0.20 g/dL or higher) has decreased, but that the average BAC of fatally injured drinking drivers has remained relatively constant since 1980. Reasons for the decrease in alcohol involvement in fatal crashes are listed, including heightened public awareness of the dangers of drinking and driving, efforts by many States to implement stricter enforcement procedures to deter drinking and driving, raising the legal drinking age to 21 years, prevention and intervention concepts and programs that emphasize alternatives to legal deterrents, a declining population of young drivers, and a decrease in per capita alcohol consumption in the United States. Facts about alcohol-impaired driving are also listed. Suggestions for further reducing the magnitude of the drinking and driving problem are provided.  31 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>A random telephone survey was conducted in a suburban community in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area to assess the perceptions of parents about teenage drinking and driving.  A total of 807 interviews were conducted.  The results indicated that while most parents viewed teen drinking (69 percent) and drinking and driving (65 percent) to be prevalent, relatively few seem to be engaging in behaviors likely to influence these activities. Thirty-two percent said they never discuss drinking and driving with their children, and over 65 percent said they never talk to other parents about how to talk to their children about drinking and driving, nor have any interest in doing so. Although slightly more than half said they had family policies concerning drinking, less than 20 percent said there were penalties for violating these policies.  Over 70 percent expressed their willingness to watch a special show on TV about how parents can talk to their children about alcohol.  Parents of teenagers appear to be far more likely to think that their teen's friends drink and drive (36 percent) than they are to think that their teen drinks and drive (10 percent). The results of this survey indicate a significant lack of parental awareness of teen drinking and a denial of their own teen's possible involvement in this behavior. 25 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from Dr. H. Laurence Ross, Department of Sociology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM  87131)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The question of whether DWI sanctions work is addressed in terms of four functions of criminal punishment: retribution, reform, incapacitation, and general deterrence.  A review of the relevant literature leads to the conclusion that the question cannot be answered for retribution because of the peculiar and debatable status of the crime.  For reform, the answer is generally no; for incapacitation, yes, especially when the sanctions take the form of administrative license revocation; and for general deterrence, yes, especially to the degree that the sanctions are perceived as likely to be swift and certain.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>By assessing and treating alcohol abuse and alcoholism in their patients, physicians can play an important role in preventing some traffic deaths and injuries.  Almost half of all traffic crashes involve alcohol and in 1990 alcohol-related crashes left 1.9 million people injured.  The most recent statistics on impaired driving, as in previous years, reveal a public health burden of tremendous magnitude.  Yet they also indicate a gradual, but real improvement, particularly in the teen and young adult age group.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration attributes this decline to several factors: 1) the increase in the minimum drinking age to 21; 2) educational efforts and programs aimed at reducing drinking and driving among young people; 3) formation of student groups, such as Students Against Driving Drunk; and 4) changes in State laws penalizing drivers younger than 21 years of age for driving with low blood alcohol levels.   To continue with this decline, the National Transportation Safety Board urges States to pass legislation allowing police officers to confiscate the driver's license -- on the spot -- from anyone who fails or refuses to take a sobriety test.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Growing attention is being given to the issue of appropriate limits for the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) in drivers of motor vehicles.  How the limits are implemented will influence future driver behavior and hence determine the actual impact of a lower BAC limit for the general driving public.  To collect additional information, four regional workshops were conducted involving the various institutions that deal with drinking and driving.  The objective was to learn how these different groups currently respond to the statutory BAC limit and how they believe they would respond to a new limit.  Institutions could adopt a BAC limit of 0.08 percent with a minimum of problems.  Institutions would have great difficulty in effectively implementing a BAC limit of 0.04 percent or 0.00 percent for the general driving public without additional changes.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>License Deprivation As A Drunk-Driver Sanction<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Reformation of the offender, or &quotprevention of recidivism&quot as in the title of this conference, is one of the most important goals of the criminal justice system.  However, there is little empirical evidence that most commonly used sanctions for the drunk-driving offender have contributed to attaining this goal.  Only one sanction, license deprivation, is strongly supported in the research literature as effective in reforming the drunk driver. Although this accomplishment appears to be far from perfect, it is real and important, whereas this claim cannot be made for such sanctions as fines, jail, or community service. Moreover, license deprivation has another meaningful promise for criminal-justice system goals:  that of general deterrence.  In contrast to reformation, which applies to future behavior of the punished offender, general deterrence applies to the future behavior of onlookers.  These people may not have committed or been detected in an infraction, but they are expected to be influenced by the fate of those who have been so identified and punished.  Again in this regard, most traditional sanctions for drunk driving have not been found to be effective, but license sanctions appear in some degree to have their intended consequences.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The decision to intervene to prevent an inebriated peer from driving drunk is examined in a survey administered to one lower division and two upper division university classes. Of the 303 students who had been in a situation in which someone was too drunk to drive, 65 percent reported having intervened.  Differences in the likelihood of intervention are examined through a loglinear analysis of the age, race, and sex of the respondent and the potential drunk driver. The decision to intervene is seen as a naturally occurring form of helping behavior.  Two hypotheses derived from the literature on helping behavior are examined:  (1) persons are more likely to intervene with persons of perceived lower status in terms of age, race, and sex than persons of higher status and (2) persons are more likely to intervene with those who are similar to themselves in terms of age, race and sex than those who are different.  Analysis reveals that persons are much more likely to experience drunk-driving situations in which the potential driver is similar to them in terms of these social characteristics than situations in which the driver is different.  However, neither status differences nor similarity affects the likelihood of intervention. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Studies of motor vehicle fatality data have indicated that alcohol involvement in fatal crashes has declined substantially in the United States since 1980.  To determine the actual incidence of alcohol-impaired drivers on U.S. roads, a national roadside survey using portable breath-testing devices was carried out in 32 localities in the spring of 1986.  The same sampling design and survey procedures used in a 1973 national roadside survey were followed as closely as possible.  The 1986 survey found 3.1 percent of the late-night weekend drivers to have a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.10 percent or more, compared to 4.9 percent of drivers in 1973.  Similarly, 8.3 percent of the 1986 drivers were at or above 0.05 percent BAC, compared to 13.5 percent in 1973.  The data indicate that the incidence of alcohol-impaired driving on weekend nights has fallen by one-third or more in the United States since 1973 and that the decline affected most population subgroups.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Effect of License Suspension upon DWI Recidivism<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Driver's license suspension is designed to reduce recidivism among those convicted of driving while intoxicated (DWI) for two reasons:  1) incapacitation prevents individuals from driving while on suspension and 2) deterrence prevents future instances of drinking and driving.  When compared with lesser restrictions, or no restriction, driver's license suspension has a greater incapacitation effect but no greater deterrent effect.  When driver's license suspension is compared with remediation (education, counseling, treatment), suspension has the greater incapacitation effect, but remediation has the greater deterrent effect.  This paper concludes that the effect of driver's license suspension upon drinking and driving is primarily to limit driving, and hence, the possibility of convictions and accidents of all kinds.  Remedial programs, coupled with some driving instruction, however, appear to be more effective in deterring the drinking-driving behavior itself.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>During his term as the 13th Surgeon General of the United States, Dr. C. Everett Koop emphasized the urgency of the problem of drunk and drugged driving in this country. To address this problem, he called together 120 professionals and asked them to use their experience and knowledge to guide the country toward strategies for resolving the problem.  On May 31, 1989, Dr. Koop held his final press conference as Surgeon General, at which he released the results of his workshop on drunk driving.  He presented the following ten key summary recommendations at this press conference: (1) reduce the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) from its present level of 0.10 percent to 0.04 percent by the year 2000, and establish a level of 0.00 percent for drivers under the age of 21 years; (2) increase excise taxes on alcoholic beverages and tax beer, wine, and distilled spirits equally based on alcohol content; (3) have each State provide a system to fund comprehensive alcohol-impaired driving programs; (4) reduce the availability of alcoholic beverages; (5) pass legislation in each State to confiscate drivers' licenses on the spot for those above the legal BAC; (6) match the level of alcoholic advertising with pro-health and pro-safety messages; (7) restrict certain kinds of advertising and marketing practices, especially those that reach underage youth; (8) conduct public information efforts that are based on social marketing and communication strategies and on sound learning principles; (9) conduct drinking and driving education within worksites, communities, health care agencies, and, schools; and (10) increase the enforcement of drinking and driving laws and expand the use of sobriety checkpoints.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS) gathers data on the most severe traffic crashes that occur each year--those that result in the loss of human life.  The system was conceived, designed, and developed by the National Center for Statistics and Analysis of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). It was established in order to provide an overall measure of highway safety, to help identify traffic safety problems, to suggest solutions, and to help provide an objective basis on which to evaluate the effectiveness of motor vehicle safety standards and highway safety problems.  The FARS file contains descriptions, in a standard format, of each fatal crash reported.  Each crash has more than 90 different coded data elements that characterize the crash, the vehicles, and the people involved.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Recent research indicates that women are drinking and driving more often and that the proportion of female drivers involved in fatal crashes is increasing.  U.S. Fatal Accident Reporting System data (Fall 1987) suggest that although overall alcohol involvement rates in fatal crashes have been declining for the past 4 years, the rates for females aged 21 to 24 have not, and their alcohol involvement rate in late-night single vehicle (SV) crashes, a surrogate measure of alcohol-related (A/R) crashes, is almost as high as that of male drivers.  This paper examines the involvement of North Carolina female drivers who are less than 35 years old for the period of 1976 through 1985 and reports on trends in driver licensing, arrests for drinking and driving, SV nighttime and A/R crashes, and measured blood alcohol levels in fatalities.  It identifies an emerging driving-while-impaired problem for younger women, particularly those 21 to 24 years old.  Significant trends pertaining to the involvement of women will have implications for the design and implementation of education, deterrence, enforcement, and rehabilitation programs.  18 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Since 1983, nine States have passed laws that lower the legal BAC level for adolescent drivers.  This paper examines fatal crash data in the four States that passed laws before 1989 and have accrued sufficient data for evaluation.  Adolescent and adult night fatal crash trends were compared in these States and four nearby States with similar drinking age laws, but which did not lower BAC levels for teen drivers.  Equal numbers of pre- and post-law years were examined in each of the four pairs of States.  In the four States that lowered their BAC levels for teens there was a 34 percent post-law decline in night fatal crashes among adolescents targeted by lower BAC levels.  Among adults there was a 7-percent decline in night fatal crashes.  In comparison States there was a 26-percent decline in adolescent night fatal crashes and a 9-percent decline in adult night fatal crashes.  As a group, States that lowered their BAC levels for adolescents had significantly greater post-law reductions in night fatal crashes among adolescents relative to adults than was observed in comparison States. This early evidence from the first four States to lower adolescent legal limits suggests this law may help to reduce adolescent involvement in alcohol-related fatal crashes.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>In the early 1980s the percentage of fatally injured drivers with high blood alcohol concentrations decreased; this rate stabilized in the latter 1980s.  The primary reasons for this decline appear to be reduced alcohol consumption in general, the emergence of citizen activist groups, and the proliferation of effective laws (e.g., administrative license suspension and 21-year-old minimum alcohol purchase age laws).  In the latter part of the 1980s public attention to the problem waned.  Further progress in combating the problem of alcohol-impaired driving and crashes may be obtainable through wider implementation of effective laws, additional strategies not based on deterrence, and a resurgence in public focus on the problem.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Administrative license revocation (ALR) refers to either the revocation or suspension of a driver's license before conviction for an alcohol-impaired offense.  Studies show that license suspension deters drivers from repeated crashes and violations.  Although many suspended drivers continue to drive, they drive less often and more carefully. While specific deterrence is important, the well-publicized, certain loss of license is the heart of ALR.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Although in most States the legal blood concentration (BAC) limit is .10, increasing evidence shows that impairment occurs at much lower levels.  Alcohol education must incorporate these findings into public and school health programs to raise awareness of low level BAC impairment.  The purpose of this study was to measure variability in behavior impairment at specific levels of the rising and falling BAC curve.  Behavior impairment was measured for anticipation and reaction time in addition to a variety of visual skills.  Also of interest was the variability in impairment involved at specific BAC levels under single dose and double dose conditions.  The experimental design was a variation on a 2X2 factorial with repeated measures on the dose of alcohol.  All subjects took part in two experimental sessions, i.e., single dose and double dose.  Sixteen (eight males and eight females) paid subjects ages 21-40 participated in the study.  Testing procedures included repeated measures on reaction time, anticipation time, perceptual vision acuity, and depth perception.  Breath-alcohol measures were sampled continuously at 5-minute intervals to obtain BACs.  A two-way (gender x dosage) analysis of variance (ANOVA) of peak BAC showed no significant interactions.  The average peak BAC for the double dose was significantly higher than that of the single dose condition.  Noteworthy was that the same individuals exhibited different levels of impairment at a given BAC level, depending on whether the session was single or double dose, suggesting that one's current BAC level is less a measure of impairment than is the total quantity of alcohol consumed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This article is a discussion on certain personality factors associated with teen drunk drivers.  Evidence suggests that adolescents at risk for drunken driving have certain personality traits, including anger/hostility, feelings of powerlessness and low self-restraint.  It has already been confirmed that these traits are common in adult drunken drivers.  The usefulness of these predictors is important in designing primary and secondary prevention programs for young drivers.  Programs should be designed to deal with new ways of coping with anger and hostility, self-esteem, personal responsibility, street management and the effects of alcohol.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This paper reports the results of a literature search to determine the extent and nature of minority group involvement in drunk driving. Most of the research supports the view that American Blacks and Hispanics are disproportionately more likely to be drunk drivers. However, the evidence is not fully consistent. The general relationship seems to be reduced or even reversed for minority youth. Furthermore, studies based on self-reported behavior contradict those based on official statistics such as alcohol-related deaths, traffic arrests and accidents. Self-reports generally show less drunk driving among the minority groups. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<IMG SRC="curicuml.gif"><BR><A NAME="Sec2"> <H2>ATOD Resource Guide:  Curriculum<BR> Section 2 -- Curriculum Resource List </H2></A>
<BR>

This resource list was compiled by the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention to assist teachers, youth leaders, and others who work with youth in grades K-12 in their review and selection of alcohol and other drug curricula.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
Curricula listed here were reviewed by curriculum and prevention specialists to ensure conformance with the following criteria.  The curricula materials must: <UL>
<LI> Contain a strong no-use message;
<LI> Consist of at least 25 percent or more alcohol and other drug use prevention material. (The formula for deriving the amount of alcohol and other drug use prevention lessons within a curriculum is the number of alcohol and other drug use prevention lessons divided by the total number of lessons in that curriculum.  Alcohol and other drug use lessons are defined by lessons that teach refusal skills or teach alcohol and other drug information.  Lessons teaching self-esteem, communication, goal setting, and coping/stress reduction skills are not counted as alcohol and other drug use prevention lessons.)
<LI> Make clear that the use of illicit drugs is wrong and harmful;
<LI> Make clear that young people are responsible for their own decisions and not provide them with excuses for their behavior;
<LI> Use no illustrations or dramatizations that could teach people how to obtain, prepare, or ingest illegal drugs;
<LI> Be scientifically accurate and up-to-date;
<LI> Be appropriate for the developmental age, interests, and needs of the students;
<LI> Reflect an understanding of the target group's cultural systems and assumptions;
<LI> Not use recovering addicts or alcoholics as role models;
<LI> Be school-based;
<LI> Be available to the general public.</UL>

In addition to formal instruction, the DARE officer interacts with the students outside the classroom, during lunch and recreational activities.

<B>Prevention of Drug Abuse:  Examination of the Effectiveness of a Program with Elementary School Children<BR>
<I>Church, P.; Forehand, R.; Brown, C.; and Holmed, T.</I></B><BR>
<I>Behavior Therapy </I>21(3):339-347, 1990.
<BLOCKQUOTE>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a program with elementary school fourth graders.  One hundred children were assigned to an experimental group or a no-treatment control group and were assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and a 2 month follow-up.  Subjects in both groups were seen for three 1-hour sessions in groups of approximately 20 children.  The children receiving the drug use prevention program were taught information about drugs and drug abuse, the difference between good and bad drugs, information about addiction and being &quotconned&quot into drug use, and safety rules for preventing drug use.  Children in the control group were seen for an equal time by an experimenter but were taught their regular class lessons.  Relative to the control group, children in the experimental group acquired more information at the post-assessment.  While the differences between the two groups in this area diminished somewhat at follow-up, difference between the two groups' application of skills emerged at follow-up.  The results indicate that children in elementary school can be taught basic information concerning drug use prevention. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Substance Abuse Curricula vs. School Drug Policies<BR>
<I>Goodstadt, M.S.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of School Health </I>59 (6):246:250, 1989
<BLOCKQUOTE>Schools are attempting to reduce alcohol and other drug use by implementing policies related to their use in school settings.  A review of current trends in adolescent substance use, together with research concerning effectiveness of alcohol and other drug education and the impact of legal deterrence, indicate that:  (1) neither educational nor school policy strategies by themselves are likely to effectively prevent use; (2) to be effective, education and policies must acknowledge and incorporate clear statements of community norms about alcohol and other drug use; (3) to be effective, educational and policy strategies must complement and reinforce each other; and (4) education and policies must acknowledge and reinforce the positive behavior of the large number of students who do not use alcohol and other drugs.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

Washington, DC:  U.S. Department of Education, 1989, pp. 243-262  In:  R. Pedone and M.K. Gwaltney, Eds., <I>Perspectives on Preventing Student Drug Abuse.</I>  <BR>
(Available from the U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW, Washington, DC  20202.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>This volume presents 10 papers that examine the drug use problem and presents different views on issues about drug use, students, and schools.  The Department of Education commissioned these papers as part of a project on new research perspectives on preventing student drug use.  The goals of this project were to generate and acquire some creative, new ideas on preventing drug use.  The authors of these papers are not drug researchers, and their charge was deliberately broad to encourage them to explore areas that might be overlooked by the drug use research community.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Effects on Students of Teacher Training in Use of a Drug Education Curriculum<BR>
<I>Allison, K.R.; Silverman, G.; and Dignam, C.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Drug Education </I>20(1):31-46, 1990.
<BLOCKQUOTE>The study examines the effects of differential teacher training in use of a drug education curriculum on students' knowledge levels, problem-solving and coping skills, attitudes towards planned decision making, behavioral intentions, and  the use of tobacco and alcohol.  An experimental design was used to compare the effects of exposure to teachers who had either intensive staff development, in-service training, or no training.  The findings indicate a statistically significant difference between groups of students as to their intention to drink alcohol.  Students whose teachers had intensive staff development were less likely to intend to take a drink if offered one, than students whose teachers had in-service or no training.  Possible reasons for a lack of significant results on other variables are the confounding influences of school, classroom and teacher effects.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>HIPP:  Comprehensive School-Based Substance Abuse Program with Cooperative Community Involvement<BR>
<I>Carlson, C.E.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Primary Prevention </I> 10(4):289-303, 1990.
<BLOCKQUOTE>A school division of 20,000 students has implemented a kindergarten through grade 12 prevention and intervention program to address the use of alcohol and other drugs among youth in the Hampton Community.  Hampton Intervention and Prevention Program (HIPP) uses a 30-member steering committee, representative of the schools, parents, and community agencies, to monitor the comprehensive program and provide linkages among cooperating groups.  Specific components include elementary, middle, and high school prevention programs, a student assistance program, and a program for students suspended for use of alcohol and other drugs at school.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Teacher Characteristics and Competencies Related to Substance Abuse Prevention<BR>
<I>Jones, R.; Kline, K.; Habkirk, S.; and Sales, A.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Drug Education</I> 27(3):179-189, 1990.
<BLOCKQUOTE>Teacher characteristics and competencies perceived beneficial for preventing alcohol and other drug use among students are identified.  Characteristics and competencies were integrated into four distinct categories including those specific to alcohol and other drug use, specific to prevention, specific to intervention, and specific to teacher-student relations.  A questionnaire was developed to quantify expert perceptions of importance.  The questionnaire was given to 86 teachers, national university researchers, and drug program specialists that were actively engaged in the AOD prevention arena.  A total of 65 questionnaires were returned, with teacher-student relations emerging as the most important aspect of teacher comportment, followed by knowledge associated with human behavior, substances, user recognition and referral, prevention curricula, and legal issues.  These findings are encouraging in that the characteristics and skills perceived as important to prevention can be developed in both pre- and inservice teacher training.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The Drug-Free School Recognition Program is a competitive evaluation and award program that acknowledges those public and private elementary and secondary schools with successful alcohol and other drug use prevention or reduction programs.  Strategies and activities used by the 47 winning schools, which underwent an extensive nomination and review process, are highlighted in this report.  Effective prevention strategies, or &quotindicators of success,&quot are as follows:  recognition and assessment of drug problems; clearly defined, enforced, and publicized policies; comprehensive alcohol and other drug use education curricula; staff development; and student, parent, and community involvement.  A table depicting the outstanding components of each program is included, and individual programs are described in separate entries.  The entry for each program provides:  the &quotindicators of success&quot found to be especially outstanding in this program (e.g., teaching drug prevention); demographic profile¾grades, enrollment, percentage of Whites; brief narrative description of the program; and information concerning the contact person.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Journal of Drug Education </I>21(3):203-210, 1991.
<BLOCKQUOTE>This article surveys recent research findings on drug education programs in America.  Findings have been somewhat contradictory but a pattern of encouraging results seem to favor prevention programs that focus on resistance training.  Research results were complimentary of curricula and S.A.P. (Student Assistance Program) which emphasize intervention strategies.  Information about what parents, schools, students, and communities can do concerning drug prevention efforts is included.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Fact Sheet, National Head Start Association, 1989.<BR>
(Reprints available from National Head Start Association, 1309 King Street, Suite 200, Alexandria, VA  22314.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>This fact sheet describes an early childhood Head Start curriculum on AOD prevention.  The curriculum, designed for both parents and children, includes information on drug use, risk factors, drugs in the community, health issues, peer pressure, family management skills, and development of support networks.  The target populations are African American and Hispanic children who are enrolled in the Head Start program, and their parents.  The parent curriculum employs a skills development approach.  The 10 sessions include lectures, discussions, role playing, self-assessment, and puppet construction.  The children's curriculum is integrated into the regular Head Start classroom curriculum, and includes playing games, coloring, and singing.  The curriculum was evaluated by assessing the knowledge, values, attitudes, self-esteem, stress, and other factors of experimental and control groups.  These results are not yet available, but the developers have found teachers, parents, and children to be responsive to the need for drug prevention at the early childhood level. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>The Weekly Reader National Survey on Drugs and Alcohol<BR>
<I>Borton, T. (Editor)</I></B><BR>
The Weekly Reader National Survey, Field Publications, Middletown, CT, Fall 1990.<BR>
(Reprints available from Field Publications, 245 Long Hill Road, Middletown, CT  06457.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>This report presents the results of a 1990 survey of children and youth on their attitudes about drugs and drinking.  The readership survey, conducted by Weekly Reader Corporation periodicals, was conducted during the week of October 30 to November 3, 1990.  More than 14,000 teachers, representing more than 350,000 students, responded to the survey.  A sample of 4,800 teacher summary forms was randomly selected for processing.  Each teacher form represents roughly 25 students, for a total sample of 120,000 students.  For students in grades four to six, school, in 1990, was the primary source of information about the dangers of drugs and drinking ¾ a response that rose significantly from that given in 1987, and that more than doubled since 1983.  Due to the greater information role played by schools, television and movies dropped by 50 percent as a primary source of information about dangers, while the family as a source was the same as in 1987.  An increased percentage (46 percent in 1990 compared to 37 percent in 1987) believed cigarettes are drugs.  The percentage who believed that wine coolers are drugs increased from 21 percent in 1987 to 27 percent in 1990.  Since 1985, there has been a significant increase in the numbers of students who think drug and alcohol education should be taught in their grades.  An increased percentage (86 percent in 1990 compared to 70 percent in 1985) responded that alcohol and drug education should be taught in the 4th through 6th grades.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Preventing Alcohol and Other Drug Use through Curricula:  Where We've Been and Where We're Headed<BR>
<I>English, J., and Austin, G.</I></B><BR>
Paper, American Educational Research Association, San Francisco, CA, March 27-30, 1989<BR>
(Available from the Southwest Regional Laboratory for Educational Research and Development, 4665 Lampson Avenue, Los Alamitos, CA  90720.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>The field of drug and alcohol abuse prevention is still in its infancy, but has come a long way since the first prevention approach was adopted in the late 1960s.  Despite the weaknesses of past curricula and the problems still to be addressed, prevention curricula are becoming more effective as time goes on.  Much has been learned from prevention failures, as well as from a few successful prevention programs.  Programs that increase drug knowledge are quite easy to develop; programs changing attitudes toward drug use are more difficult; and programs changing drug- and alcohol-related behaviors are quite rare.  Yet many of the ineffective approaches are still being used in today's school-based curricula.  If further advancements toward reducing alcohol and other drug use problems are to be made, focus needs to be on approaches that lead to positive behavior change.  The Nation must continue to place the problems of alcohol and other drug use by our youth in the forefront providing the support needed to continue making progress in the area of educational research and curriculum development.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Many older adults today live by the motto &quot;a pill for every ill.&quot; They consume 30 percent of all prescription drugs, 70 percent of nonprescription drugs, and use alcohol for social or medicinal purposes. As a result, older adults are at high risk for drug misuse or abuse. They need quality prevention and education services.  The curriculum is designed to help health professionals set up and conduct an empowerment and awareness program on medications and alcohol for older adults. It has two components: (1) An easy-to-use manual that includes backgrounds, step-by-step plans for three group sessions, and a set of resources that includes participant handouts, transparencies, evaluation, and needs assessment questions; and (2) Wise Use of Drugs, an informative video aimed at the older adult audience.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from Roland M. Atkinson, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Portland, OR 97201.) <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Discusses alcohol problems of the elderly.  Suggests that alcohol problems in the elderly constitute a moderate public health concern. Special risk factors and clinical features of alcoholism in elders deserve further study, particularly in prospective, life-course, clinically oriented research. Such information, together with systematic study of optimal interventions, may promote improved prevention, recognition, and abatement of alcohol problems in the elderly.  15 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The social and clinical features of alcohol use and abuse among the elderly are reviewed through an examination of drinking patterns, polydrug use, and treatment. The most common precipitating events for late-onset alcoholism include bereavement, retirement, social isolation, and infirmity. The elderly often suffer from late-onset alcoholism. They may also abuse other drugs, including legally prescribed analgesics, tranquilizers, antidepressants, and over-the-counter medications. Besides extensive treatment programs, including social therapy, psychotherapy, and behavioral techniques, primary prevention must be emphasized.  39 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>People ages 65 and older represent about 12 percent of the population and the fastest growing segment of society. As the quality of life for older people is strongly tied to the maintenance of health, it is appropriate to consider the relationship of age and alcohol from a health perspective. Cross sectional studies of the use of alcohol have shown that, when compared to younger age groups, the rates of abstainers increase and the percentage of drinkers decreases. The impact of alcohol and alcohol use on the health and well being of any one older person has many dimensions. But there are effects related to the general process of aging: higher concentration of alcohol within organs; higher blood alcohol levels compared to younger people of equal weight who have consumed the same amount; and slower metabolism and elimination rates. Two excellent possibilities for pre-vention programs for older people are self-help groups and preretirement and retirement planning groups. Additional studies focusing on alcohol and aging would provide a firmer foundation than currently exists for the development of policy and programs.  52 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Drugs, Gender and Ethnicity:  Is the Older Minority Woman at Risk? <BR>

(Reprints available from Barbara Lynn Kail, Graduate School of Social Work, University of Texas at Arlington, Box 19129, Arlington, TX  76019-0129.) <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Our knowledge of drug misuse by older women of color is very limited.  This introductory article attempts to provide some background for the following chapters and an integrated overview of the issue as a whole.  The reader is provided with a discussion of ethnicity and some data describing the experiences of ethnic women of color.  The scope of problem of drug misuse is also considered. Finally, the role of professionals and non-professionals in prevention and treatment is explored, followed by policy considerations.  39 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

(Reprints available from Dr. Paul S. German, Department of Health Policy and Management, School of Hygiene and Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD  21218.) <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The increased elderly population makes for increased chronic disease and, hence, greater use of sophisticated medications.  This paper reviews current knowledge of the pharmaco-dynamics and pharmacokinetics among elderly users of drugs and estimates the prevalence of use of prescribed drugs.  Less is known of specifics of prescribing patterns, but evidence clearly suggests the strong influence of patient/doctor communication in compliance and control of side effects.  There is little hard evidence on the populations considered at high risk for inappropriate prescribing, use, and side effects.  The influence of race, socioeconomic class and age are all studied. Since drugs and their uses increase daily, it is important to investigate the area of high-risk populations in order to accumulate evidence which can lead to appropriate interventions.  103 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Interdisciplinary Treatment of Drug Misuse among Older People of Color:  Ethnic Considerations for Social Work Practice <BR>
<I>Raffoul, P.R., and Haney, C.A.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Drug Issues </I>19(2):297-313, 1989.<BR>
(Reprints available from Paul R. Raffoul, Ph.D., School of Social Work, University of Houston, Houston, TX  77004.) <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Drug misuse involves the interaction of users, physicians, pharmacists and the drugs themselves.  When ethnicity is included in this definition, information about the cultural heritage of the individual and what health and illness mean within that culture for that particular individual must be included to fully understand their drug-taking behavior.  A model of interdisciplinary treatment of drug misuse for practitioners, who work primarily with noninstitutionalized older persons of color, is presented.  Being ethnically sensitive to individual differences is a first step in treating the older minority person's drug misuse; with this sensitivity comes the knowledge of what objective differences are most important to consider in preventing drug misuse among all people, particularly older people of color.  28 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Alcohol-Related Morbidity in the Aging Population<BR>
<I>Stinson, F. S.; Dufour, M. C.; and Bertolucci, D. </I></B><BR>
<I>Alcohol Health and Research World </I>13(1):80-87, 1989.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Alcohol-related morbidity affects many older persons, especially those who are hospitalized for conditions not directly attributed to alcohol abuse. Current methods of assessing alcohol consumption and diagnosis of alcoholism and alcohol abuse among older persons are inadequate and lead to underestimates of prevalence for this group. Reasons for underestimation include: (1) inaccurate self-reports due to faulty memory and high levels of denial; (2) measurement scales that rely on problems with society, the legal system, and employers that may not be applicable to older people; and (3) problems that result from alcohol abuse often mimic those that are the result of aging.  26 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Patient-Physician Communication as a Determinant of Medication Misuse in Older, Minority Women <BR>
<I>Garrity, T.F., and Lawson, E.J. </I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Drug Issues </I>19(2):245-259, 1989.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This paper focuses on factors in the doctor-patient relationship that affect misuse of prescription drugs and other medically recommended regimens. The review first examines the patient compliance literature about the general population and then narrows the focus to the situations of older, minority females. In both sections, the reviews are organized around four aspects of the clinician-patient encounter: teaching efforts, sharing of expectations, activity versus passivity of the two participants, and emotional tone. In general, there is limited research available on either the general or the older, minority, female patient populations in this area. To the extent that there are data available, both patient groups appear similarly affected by the factors identified. In the latter population (older, minority, female patients) there appear to be several ways in which risk of misuse is heightened.  39 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Family, Friends and Neighbors:  Role of Primary Groups in Preventing the Misuse of Drugs <BR>
<I>Kail, B.L., and Litwak, E.</I></B> <BR>
<I>Journal of Drug Issues </I>19(2):261-281, 1989.<BR>
(Reprints available from Barbara Lynn Kail, D.S.W., Graduate School of Social Work, University of Texas at Arlington, Box 19129, Arlington, TX  76019-0129.) <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Primary groups, such as relatives, neighbors and friends, are a source of support that health care providers overlook. The authors present a theoretical framework which suggests primary groups can help prevent the misuse of prescription medicine. Kin are especially helpful in assisting elderly to take medications on a long-term basis where the regimens are fairly simple. It may also be especially important to engage kin in helping the older minority woman to understand the doctor. Even at a distance, kin may be able to provide such assistance and should not be discounted as a resource. Neighbors can be helpful in getting a medicine needed unexpectedly and might assist with relatively complex routines that last for only a brief period. Friends who have had similar experiences are especially helpful when the medicine is prescribed on an as-needed basis by teaching the client how to judge when a dose is needed.  34 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Characterization of the Use and Misuse of Medications by an Elderly, Ambulatory Population <BR>
<I>Bernstein, L.R.; Folkman, S.; and Lazarus, R.S.</I></B><BR>
<I>Medical Care </I>27(6):654-663, 1989.<BR>
(Reprints available from Linda R. Bernstein, University of California - San Francisco, Division of Clinical Pharmacy, San Francisco, CA  94143-0622.) <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This study attempts to learn about the scope and extent of drug misuse by the elderly. The study has several distinctive features. Misuse is defined in terms of (1) drug use, (2) drug interactions, and (3) redundant use of drugs in the same pharmacological class. This study gives a more detailed inspection of medications being used than does a similar study by Raffouletal. Misuse encompasses all over-the-counter and prescribed drugs and alcohol and psychoactive drugs. Also, the evaluation of use is based on many assessments over a substantial period. The study had a final random sample of 141. Subjects were interviewed in their homes once a month for 6 months, and they received a Daily Health Record on which they could read symptoms of discomforts and the drugs they had taken that day. The findings show that even in a well-educated population, many people still lack important information about their medication.  25 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Alcohol and other dependencies among the elderly are discussed. The addictive process is the same whether one is 20 or 70 years old, but there are substantial differences between the elderly chemically dependent and their younger counterparts. The percentages of elderly will increase as the overall age of the population increases. The amount consumed should be considered along with other signs of sensitivity in the elderly. The prevalence remains unclear since they often live with their families and do not become criminally involved when they abuse drugs. The article defines terms such as dependency, psychoactive substance abuse and substance dependency. Addict and addictionology are terms also defined. Historical considerations are discussed followed by some general clinical considerations. Guidelines for common clinical presentations are noted, such as ineffective healthy treatment outcomes, malnutrition, mental changes, self-neglect, and seizures.  Methods of detoxification are described. Concerns include drugs used for pain, anxiety, and the fact that elderly patients may be dependent on drugs that do not cure. Treatments for detoxification are described in detail.  88 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Drug misuse and chemical dependency in the elderly is often unrecognized until an acute reaction occurs. The financial and psychological costs to individuals and society for drug-related problems will likely increase as unprecedented numbers of people are surviving into their later years. Presently, the elderly consume 25 percent to 30 percent of all prescription drugs. This consumption rate becomes even more problematic when prescription drugs are combined with alcohol or other drugs, including over-the-counter medications. In examining the dimensions of this covert problem, the biological changes accompanying age, as well as the often overlooked sociological and psychological variables, need to be explored. Intervention and prevention, to be effective, must take cognizance of a wide range of socially relevant issues implicated as causally important.  47 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Age onset problem drinking was studied in 132 older men (age 60 years and older) admitted to a VA geriatric alcoholism outpatient treatment program. Demographics, alcohol history, self-reported psychological status, special treatment, and treatment compliance variables were tested for association with onset age. Late onset (defined as onset of the first alcohol problem at or age 60) was not uncommon, occurring in 15 percent of the sample (29 percent of patients age 65 or older). Compared to earlier onset cases, late onset alcohol problems were milder and more associated with less family alcoholism and greater psychological stability. Late onset patients were compliant with outpatient treatment requirements; however, treatment program variables were better predictors of compliance than onset age.  39 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The needs of the elderly chemically dependent are the focus of this article. The aging of the population is noted. Statistics show that about 20 percent of those over 65 are chemically dependent and 3.7 percent are alcoholic. These can be divided into two groups: the survivors and the reactors. Survivors have always been chemically dependent and survived their lifetime of use, and the reactors began taking drugs as a response to growing old. Recovery is more difficult for the elderly, with decreased metabolism, body mass, and tolerance to most drugs along with losses of friends, jobs, health and wealth. The loss of hope that comes with addiction may be the worst loss they suffer. Recommendations include taking time with older patients, caring, and avoiding adversarial positions. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research </I>15(2):383, 1991.<BR>
(Reprints available from E.S.L. Gomberg, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48104.) <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Our study of alcohol abuse among elderly persons addresses several questions, among them: What are the variables that distinguish elderly alcoholics in treatment from an age-matched group of recovered alcoholics? Mean age of the alcoholics-in-treatment is 61.2 years and they were interviewed in several treatment facilities. Mean age of the recovered group is 63.6 years, and interviews were conducted in senior centers, hospitals and senior housing. The in-treatment group averaged 11.7 grades achieved, the recovered group 14.5. A larger proportion of the in-treatment group is currently living alone (divorced, widowed, single). The structured interviews reveal that recovered alcoholics report more family/sibling alcoholism than the in-treatment group. Respondents' drinking histories also differed: those in treatment were more likely to drink at work and on the street and to become more depressed when drinking. Alcoholics currently in treatment have more limited social networks; they see their children less frequently, have fewer close friends and report less social support from others. Response to life stress shows the recovered group to be more likely to seek out someone to talk to. Elderly persons who are already recovered appear to manifest a degree of social integration and affect that distinguishes them from alcoholics currently in treatment.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Substance Abuse Problems of the Elderly:  Considerations for Treatment and Prevention <BR>

In:  <I> Alcoholism and Substance Abuse in Special Populations, </I>G.W. Lawson and A.W. Lawson, Eds., pp. 95-113.  Rockville, MD: Aspen Publishers, Inc., 1989.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Treatment and prevention of substance abuse problems of  the elderly are discussed.  The elderly are at risk for  misuse and abuse of legal drugs, including alcohol,  prescription drugs, and over-the-counter drugs.  Frequently these problems are complicated by mental  disorders and the symptoms of aging. However, this  population is under-represented in treatment populations  because they do not seek traditional assistance.  In addition,  therapists are often reluctant to treat elderly clients.  In preventing substance abuse in the elderly, these  prevention strategies should be applied:  keep  people without problems from getting them (primary); keep high risk people from developing problems (secondary); and keep problems from becoming worse  (tertiary).  Early onset alcoholics could benefit from all  of the prevention activities.  Late onset patients benefit  from prevention activities that reduce stress and assist  with coping skills.  While physical stresses occur as the  body wears down with age, medical responses can be changed  to reduce the risk of overmedication, drug interaction, or  drug misuse.  It is concluded that the elderly will  respond to most of the treatment approaches that work with  younger people when they are given a few special  considerations.  40 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse </I>15(1):101-113, 1989.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The use of psychoactive drugs by older adults is assessed.  The study sample included 141 retired persons, 65 to 74  years of age, 47 percent of whom were male and 58 percent  of whom were married.  The following specific issues were  examined:  (1) the relationship between psychoactive  substance use and personal characteristics; (2) the  relationship between psychoactive substance use and  coping; and (3) the use of psychoactive substances to cope  with stress among older people.  When compared to national  statistics, the sample included heavy users of alcohol and  average users of psychoactive drugs, with use of alcohol  increasing with income and drug use being associated with  psychosocial characteristics and physical and mental  health.  Only a small number used drugs or alcohol  specifically as a coping mechanism.  The risks associated  with psychoactive drugs are discussed.  29 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Two recent studies from the Mayo Clinic on problems of  alcoholism in the elderly are reviewed.  The two studies give a complete review of the problem, which is apparently more common than previously thought.  Forty-one percent of the overall group of patients admitted to the Mayo Clinic inpatient program developed alcoholism after 60.  Many had medical complications, including alcoholic liver disease, hypertension,  psoriasis, peptic ulcers disease, and diabetes.  The studies conclude that the elderly alcoholic can be  successfully treated in a medically-oriented inpatient  program.  2 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Alcohol abuse in the elderly is discussed.

Older persons with alcohol-related problems  are not a uniform group, but have diverse and individual  needs and concerns, which may be reflected in denial of  the need for and resistance to treatment.  It is stressed  that this population must adjust to changes that occur in  their lifestyles rather than to old age itself.  26 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

In:  <I> Diagnosis of Alcohol Abuse,</I> R.R. Watson (Ed.), pp 217-230.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Alcohol consumption and alcohol abuse among women and the  elderly are discussed.  Headings within this article are:   (1) alcohol consumption of United States adults,  quantities and patterns; (2) alcohol intake among the  elderly; (3) alcohol intake among women; (4) sequelae of alcohol abuse in the elderly and women; and (5) laboratory  markers of excessive drinking and alcohol abuse.  Alcohol  abuse is thought to be more common in these two groups  than is generally expected, and the abuse itself and the  effects of this abuse may often go undetected.  Current  research is directed at markers that can detect early  changes associated with alcohol abuse, before extensive  organ damage has developed.  If effective measures of  alcohol abuse become available, high risk individuals  might be identified early in the development of  alcohol-related problems and the personal and social  deterioration that goes with chronic alcohol abuse might  be prevented.  82 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The relationship between three questionnaire measures of alcohol consumption and self-monitoring reports of  drinking in the natural environment was investigated in 83  normal drinkers over 60 years of age.  Following  questionnaire administration, subjects recorded their  alcohol consumption each day for up to 3 months.  Collaterals verified subjects' self-monitoring reports.  Questionnaire scores and self-monitoring reports of  frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption were  generally well correlated.  Regression analyses showed the  Questionnaire Measure of Habitual Alcohol Use to be the  best predictor of both drinking frequency and quantity.  Measurement issues related to the use of verbal reports of  alcohol consumption with elderly drinkers are discussed.  8 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Although researchers have provided valuable descriptions  of samples of older problem drinkers and have discussed  possible causes of and treatments for alcohol abuse among  the aged, important questions remain.  Risk factors  associated with the onset of alcohol abuse in later life  have not yet been clearly identified.  Practitioners and  researchers serving this population in the future will  require a comprehensive understanding of the  characteristics and needs of older clients experiencing  alcohol-related problems.  This paper reviews the existing  literature with regard to elderly alcohol abuse and  outlines future directions for research activity.  40 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Alcohol consumption by the elderly is discussed, with a focus on the problems of alcohol consumption and the  implications for social work practice. Headings within  this article include:  (1) alcoholism or problem drinking;  (2) is there a problem among the elderly?; (3) extent of  the problem; (4) age of onset; (5) consequences of elder  alcohol use/abuse; (6) why do some older people drink? (7)  treatment; and (8) outreach needs.  It is noted that  social workers have several tasks to perform for this  group of alcohol consumers: (1) identification of the  population at risk; (2) education; (3) prevention and  early detection; (4) coordination of services; and (5)  revision of attitudes and myths.  31 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Social and clinical features of alcohol use and abuse  among the elderly are discussed in this review of the  literature.  Headings within this paper include:  (1)  drinking patterns; (2) polydrug abuse; (3) treatment; and  (4) prevention.  While it had been repeatedly reported  that older persons generally drink less than younger  persons, late onset alcoholism does occur, precipitated by  such events as bereavement, retirement, social isolation,  and infirmity.  In fact, many older persons are polydrug  abusers, with the most commonly abused drugs being legally  prescribed medications.  Treatment for this special  population should combine physical and medical regiments  with social therapy.  39 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>A cross-sectional study among older persons (N = 1034)  used multivariate stepwise discriminate analysis to  determine the predictive value of variables affecting  alcohol intake. Fifteen percent of the study sample was  classified as severe drinkers.  Alcohol consumption before age 40, smoking, male gender and marital status were  predictors of severe drinking.  In addition, the  unimpaired Older Americans Resource and Services (OARS)  objective summary ratings for physical status and  activities of daily living (ADL) were associated with  severe drinking.  Assessing the factors that predict  alcohol consumption may help to identify initially those  persons at possible risk, lending to heuristic and  theoretical alcohol prevention policies among the aged.  21 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The agreement among self-monitoring, recall, and  collateral observation measures of alcohol consumption by  older adults was assessed.  The study group included 22  subjects who were recruited from a larger sample of 33  nonabstinent normal drinkers over age 60, who were  participating in a study of daily time allocation.  The  study subjects were divided into two groups:  (1) 14  normal drinkers  who self-monitored daily frequency,  quantity, duration and drinking pattern of alcohol  consumption for 3 weeks; and (2) 8 subjects who used an  ABAB reversal design to evaluate the effects of engagement  in self-monitoring and experience with recall procedures  on recall of drinking.  The study results revealed that  daily self-monitoring reports and weekly recall of daily  consumption were in good agreement.  Neither engagement in  self- monitoring or experience with recall procedures  affected recall.  It is concluded that self-monitoring and  short-term recall provide comparable results, although  self-monitoring appears to be more useful for measuring  duration and the temporal patterning of consumption.  27  Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Alcoholism in the elderly is discussed.  Headings within  this article include:  (1) acute effects of alcohol; (2)  vascular problems; (3) gastrointestinal problems; (4)  ketoacidosis; (5) hypoglycemia; (6) gout; (7) metabolic  bone disease; (8) renal problems; (9) neurologic  impairment; (10) chronic alcohol use; (11) hepatic and  hormonal dysfunctions; (12) lipid abnormalities; (13)  cardiovascular effects; (14) gastrointestinal effects;  (15) hematologic consequences; and (16) drug  interferences.  It is concluded that alcoholism is present  in the elderly population, that it is associated with  increased mortality in this group as well as in younger  people, and that, as a result of underreporting by many  elderly persons, chronic problems may be attributed to  normal aging or age-prevalent illness.  15 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Coping was studied in  a group of older problem and  non-problem drinkers, with a focus on the Coping Responses  Inventory, which organizes coping efforts in terms of  focus and method.  The study sample included 5,125 men and  women, ranging in age from 55 to 65, of whom 84.1 percent  completed a demographic survey and a set of questions  about past and present alcohol consumption and alcohol-<R>related problems.  The study results revealed that  problem drinkers in this age group were more likely to use  cognitive and behavioral avoidance responses to cope with  stress, with those experiencing more negative life events  and more severe stress using both more approach and more  avoidance coping. However, those with more financial and  social resources relied more on approach and less on  avoidance coping.  Those older problem drinkers who relied  on avoidance coping more than approach coping were more  apt to report drinking problems, more depression, more  physical symptoms, and less self-confidence.  55 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Alcohol problems do not necessarily decrease with age.  Differences in drinking patterns among different age groups may have to do with historical and cultural differences between the individuals.  Some people may drink more as they age in response to age-related stresses such as loss of employment and widowhood or other bereavement. Because most elderly people come to medical attention for treatment of problems apparently unrelated to alcohol use, they are more difficult to identify.  When treating the older alcoholic, the physician should remember that self-reports of consumption may not be accurate because of faulty memory; many scales used to diagnose alcoholism may be inappropriate since they were validated with younger audience and older people may be isolated and not subject to the same social, legal, and job-related consequences of drinking; they have a high incidence of problems not related to alcohol use; and there is an increased risk of drug interactions, especially adverse drug reactions.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>From the Director of CSAP...</H3>

<P>As with many other communities, Asian American and Pacific Islander (A&PI) populations are seriously impacted by substance abuse related problems.  Culturally appropriate prevention resources for A&PI audiences on alcohol, tobacco, and other drug issues remain a critical need.</P>
<BR>
<P>CSAP/SAMHSA is strongly committed to the integration of A&PI issues throughout all of our programs.  And, information is a primary tool in prevention.  This Resource Guide provides information and referrals to help prevention specialists, educators, and community leaders locate resources appropriate for use with diverse Asian American and Pacific Islander communities.</P>

<B>New Land, New Choices:  A Culturally Specific Curriculum on Alcohol, Tobacco, and Other Drugs for Southeast Asian Students</B><BR>
Year:  1995<BR>
Format:  Classroom Material <BR>
Length:  220 Pages<BR>
Topic:  ATOD Prevention, Intervention, and Treatment <BR>
Target Audience:  Educators of Students Grades 6-12, Asian/Pacific Islander Americans<BR>
Language:  English, Some Vietnamese and Khmer<BR>
Availability:  Metropolitan Indochinese Children and Adolescent Services, Southeast Asian Family Empowerment Project, 254 Adams Street, Dorchester, MA 02212; 617-825-1861.
<BLOCKQUOTE>This curriculum was designed to address primary prevention of ATOD problems among Vietnamese and Cambodian youth enrolled in bilingual programs.  A culturally specific approach was used because it takes into account particular learning needs of Southeast Asian youth, some of whom have experiences as refugees and immigrants.  These experiences contribute to the development of ATOD problems.  This approach is also necessary because of the difference in ATOD use patterns between American society and Southeast Asians. Southeast Asian youth in America are at high risk for ATOD problems because of factors such as family fragmentation and limited English proficiency.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Ethnic Differences in Family Factors Related to Early Drug Initiation</B><BR>
<I><B>Catalano, R.F.; Morrison, D.M.; Wells, E.A.; Gillmore, M.R.; Iritani, B.; Hawkins, J.D.</B></I><BR>
<I>Journal of Studies on Alcohol</I> 53(3)208-217, 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>The literature on family predictors of substance use for the general population is reviewed and compared to findings for three specific ethnic groups: black, white and Asian Americans.  Rates of substance use initiation are examined in a sample of 919 urban 5th grade students.  Ethnic differences on measures of family predictors are examined and significant ethnic differences are found on several of these factors. Finally, separate regressions for black, white and Asian American youths of family factors on the variety of substances initiated examine ethnic similarities and differences in predictors. The results demonstrate significant differences by ethnicity in family management practices, involvement in family activity, sibling deviance, parental disapproval of children's drinking, and family structure. The regression equations identified unique as well as common predictors of the variety of substances initiated by the end of 5th grade. Implications of the results are discussed. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Behavioral Risk Factor Survey of Vietnamese - California, 1991</B><BR>
<I>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report </I> (MMWR) 41(5)69-72, 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>To characterize risk factors for selected non-infectious diseases and injuries among the estimated 280,200 Vietnamese who have relocated to California, a Vietnamese-language version of the Centers for Disease Control's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System was developed for use in a computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) system. Findings are summarized from the 1991 survey and compared with data for the general California or U.S. population. The questionnaire included 96 questions covering 10 target areas: sociodemographics, acculturation, nutrition, exercise, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, hypertension, cholesterol, safety belt use, and cancer screening. Of 1,705 eligible persons who were contacted, 1,011 agreed to participate. When compared with the total population of California or the United States, prevalence rates for several behavioral risk factors were higher for Vietnamese who had resettled in the United States, including rates of smoking (men), no exercise (both sexes), never having had cholesterol checked (both sexes), not knowing cholesterol level (women), never having had recommended breast and cervical cancer screening tests (women), and never having had rectal exams (both sexes). However, rates of alcohol consumption and hypertension (both sexes) and safety belt non-use (men) were lower than for the total population of California.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The Healthy People 2000 objectives for Asians and Pacific Islanders include the development and implementation of a national process to identify the significant gaps in disease prevention and health promotion data for racial and ethnic minorities. There is no process at present for drug abuse research among Asians and Pacific Islanders. Although there are about 10 million Asians and Pacific Islanders on the U.S. mainland and in Hawaii, Alaska, and the Pacific Islands there is a need for National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)-supported research regarding these populations. The lack of knowledge regarding substance abuse among Asians and Pacific Islander populations can be addressed through research applications to NIDA and other Public Health Service agencies.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I><B>Zane, N.; Sasao, T.</B></I><BR>
<I>Drugs & Society</I> 6(3/4)181-209, 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>This chapter provides a critical review of the selected literature on substance abuse among Asian Pacific Americans with focus on (1) patterns of substance and abuse, (2) the conceptual models that may be applicable in explaining the substance abuse patterns for this ethnic minority population, and (3) the effectiveness of prevention and treatment programs in serving these communities. Each section is concluded by discussing some research issues and strategies that may prove helpful for advancing research on substance abuse within the larger context of Asian Pacific American health and mental health.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Substance Abuse Treatment: Cultural Barriers in the Asian-American Community</B><BR>
<B><I>Ja, D.Y.; Aoki, B.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Psychoactive Drugs </I>25(1)61-71, 1993
<BLOCKQUOTE>Asians constitute the largest growing minority in the United States. However, inaccurate perceptions and stereotypes continue to mask a full understanding of the state of knowledge regarding their alcohol and other drug abuse. Much of the existing research has continued this trend by categorizing Asians as &quotothers&quot or persisting in its attempts to explain low incidence rates by investigating metabolic phenomena. More recent community-based studies have shown alarming incidence rates of specific substance abuse among different Asian ethnic groups. Asian heterogeneity and cultural barriers have also contributed to the lack of knowledge regarding substance abuse prevalence rates. Issues related to taboo, denial, and loss of face further mask understanding of the extent of the problem. Institutional barriers and the lack of community infrastructure make treatment efforts difficult in serving a myriad of Asian groups. For most Asians undergoing treatment, cultural factors need to be considered, including the involvement of the family as well as the risk related to its transition under immigration and the following acculturation patterns. An example of a specific treatment program and activity is discussed in relationship to the cultural factors indicated above. Finally, recommendations are specified for future treatment policy, research, and services.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Conceptions of Alcoholism among Koreans and Americans</B><BR>
<B><I>Cho Y.I.; Faulkner, W.R. </I></B><BR>
<I>International Journal of Addiction </I>28(8)681-94, June 1993
<BLOCKQUOTE>Ethnographic research has occasionally reported the presence (or absence) of the disease concept of alcoholism in non-Western cultures. However, the problem of differences in the nature of the concept of alcoholism between cultures in which it exists has not been seriously investigated. This study contrasts beliefs about alcoholism among samples of Koreans and Americans at a university in the United States. The findings suggest that the concept of alcoholism is present in both cultures, but Koreans tend to restrict their disease to the physiological consequences of long-term alcohol use, while Americans accept a definition couched largely in social and behavioral terms. It thus appears that, in contrast to America, alcohol consumption in Korea is relatively high, but alcoholism is rare. The implications of these findings for drinking behaviors and the diagnosis and treatment of alcoholism are discussed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Smoking and the Health Gap in Minorities</B><BR>
<B><I>Chen, V.W. </I></B><BR>
<I>Annals of Epidemiology </I>3(2)159-64, March 1993
<BLOCKQUOTE>Over the past decade, tobacco companies have targeted minority populations when advertising and promoting their products, which contain the most widely available, legal addictive drug in the United States. This has contributed to a greater prevalence of cigarette smoking among some minorities and lower-income groups. Black males are more likely to smoke than white males and more often they smoke high-tar cigarettes. They are also less likely to quit smoking. Compared to the national average, a greater proportion of Hispanic males smoke, but not Hispanic females. Smoking prevalence rates among Asians and Native Americans are available from local surveys but there are no reliable national estimates. Blacks experience substantially higher rates of mortality and morbidity from all causes, heart disease, stroke, and smoking-related cancers as well as adverse pregnancy outcomes. Substantially lower rates of death from heart disease, stroke, and cancers are observed among Asians and Native Americans than among whites. Disparities in cigarette smoking among racial and ethnic groups do not mirror the observed racial and ethnic disparities in mortality. Other health risk factors, access to medical care and premature death from other causes, may partially explain the morbidity/mortality gap between minorities and nonminorities. Reliable national estimates on smoking prevalence and morbidity and mortality among minorities are needed. The role of tobacco use in the etiology of diseases that are disproportionately prevalent among minorities should be studied. Culturally sensitive and acceptable smoking interventions should be developed with the involvement of minorities. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Public Outpatient Mental Health Services: Use and Outcome among Asian Americans</B><BR>
<B><I>Ying, Y.W.; Hu, L.T.</I></B><BR>
<I>American Journal of Orthopsychiatry </I>64(3)448-55, July 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>Use of public outpatient mental health services and treatment outcomes were studied among Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Korean, and Southeast-Asian Americans in Los Angeles County. Filipinos were underrepresented in the system, whereas Southeast Asians were over-represented and had higher use rates, but showed less improvement, than did the other groups. The influence of therapist-client ethnic match and of clinicians' professional status were assessed and recommendations made for further research based on findings. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Effects of Combining Disparate Groups in the Analysis of Ethnic Differences: Variations among Asian American Mental Health Service Consumers in Level of Community Functioning </B> <BR>
<B><I>Uehara, E.S.; Takeuchi, D.T.; Smukler, M. </I></B><BR>
<I>American Journal of Community Psychology </I>22(1)83-99, February 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Asian American population comprises historically, socially, and culturally diverse ethnic groups. Given this diversity, investigators caution that combining disparate ethnic groups may lead to erroneous conclusions. Whether by choice or necessity, however, mental health studies still typically consider Asian Americans as a single ethnic category rather than as separate ethnic groups. Few investigations have addressed the consequences of this practice. This paper examines the implications of conceptualizing Asian Americans as an ethnic category versus ethnic groups, in an investigation of the community functioning status of clients in publicly funded mental health programs in King County, WA. When treated as a single ethnic category in a multivariate linear regression model, Asian Americans are found to have a lower level of functioning difficulty than their white counterparts. However, when treated as separate ethnic groups (e.g., Vietnamese, Japanese), only one of five Asian ethnic groups has a significantly lower level of difficulty. In a separate analysis of the Asian American subsample, groups are found to differ significantly from one another with respect to functional status. Several factors, including refugee status, account for this difference. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The authors conducted a comparative analysis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) knowledge, communication, and risk behaviors among 1,272 white, Chinese-, and Filipino-American 10th and 11th graders in San Francisco, CA, a high-prevalence AIDS epicenter. They performed principal components analysis on an epidemiologic survey instrument, and identified five factors: HIV prevention knowledge, sexual behavior risk index, drug use risk index, HIV misconceptions, and communication about HIV. White students had higher HIV prevention scores than did Chinese and Filipino students, and whites had significantly greater ability to communicate with others about HIV disease and prevention. Chinese- and Filipino-American students had fewer misconceptions about HIV than did white students. Ethnicity did not have a significant influence on sexual behavior or drug use risk indices. Findings are discussed with reference to culturally sensitive HIV education.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Development and Health in the Pacific: Which Way to Die? </B><BR>
<B><I>Finau, S.A. </I></B><BR>
<I>Papua New Guinea Medical Journal </I>36(4)324-36, December 1993
<BLOCKQUOTE>Development in the Pacific has largely ignored the importance of health as a pathway and an outcome. This paper reviews the effects of development on health and health services in the region. It aims to highlight the plight of development that happens without considering the sociocultural and physical environments of the small island countries. The review shows that health and social conditions in the Pacific are deteriorating. The process of development has been externally controlled without community participation. Pacific leaders have been preoccupied with economic development and have not been cognizant of health and social consequences. During progress an enjoyable life can be achieved through sustainable development with community participation. However, indicators of economic growth in the Pacific do not correlate with those of health. The increase of rape, suicide, drug abuse, sexual promiscuity, and crime suggests that Pacific islanders are increasingly disillusioned by the present developmental approach: they have ceased to enjoy life before death. It is suggested that decentralized development planning with community involvement, integrating health and social considerations, would be the way out of this dilemma.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This publication addresses the range of health issues confronting Asian and Pacific Islanders in the United States. It critically examines and reviews the distribution of and factors associated with health problems in specific Asian and Pacific Islander populations. Expert contributions address the top priority health problems and issues facing these groups including infectious diseases, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, and mental health. Current trends in health care policy are also discussed, as well as methodological problems that have hampered health research in Asian and Pacific Islander American communities.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Asians comprise many diverse groups: Chinese, Koreans, Japanese, Filipinos, Pacific Islanders, Vietnamese, Thai, Cambodians, Laotians, and Indonesians, and others. There are language, historical, social, and economic differences between these groups. The author begins by reviewing current demographics and ecosystems of Asian Americans. Most Asian American children are bilingual; most of their parents speak only their native language. This language differential may widen the generation and cultural rift within Asian American families. The author reviews the history of Asian American immigration and the impact of cultural adjustments on family relationships. There are three types of Asian American families in the U.S.: recently arrived immigrants, immigrant-American families, and immigrant-descendant families. The help-seeking patterns and behaviors of each group are discussed. Seven salient cultural values social workers should understand are: (1) filial piety; (2) shame as a behavioral influence; (3) self-control; (4) middle-position virtue, which fosters the individual's sense of belonging and togetherness; (5) awareness of social milieu; (6) fatalism; and (7) inconspicuousness. Four skills and techniques are essential in working with Asian Americans in the beginning intervention phase: (1) engaging the client/family; (2) cultural transitional mapping and data collection; (3) mutual goal setting; and (4) selecting a focus/system for intervention. Community prevention programs for Asian Americans should provide education and lessen the stigma attached to seeking counseling.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Cambodian Oral History Research: Preliminary Findings on Alcohol and Other Drugs in Cambodia and in the United States</B><BR>
<B><I>Berry, L.; Nil, S.; Locke, N.; McCracken, S.; Seth, K.; Koch, V. </I></B><BR>
Report, Travelers & Immigrants Aid, 1992. 19 p.
<BLOCKQUOTE>This project was designed to assess alcohol and other drug use in the Chicago Cambodian community. During the interviews, the indigenous leaders of the Cambodian community were asked to identify patterns of traditional, ceremonial, and ritual alcohol use in Cambodia, the sorts of treatment available in Cambodia for persons with alcohol problems, and the social sanctions and patterns of alcohol use prevalent in the Cambodian community in Chicago. The project was intended not only to gather information, but to serve as a catalyst for community leaders to begin discussion of alcohol and other drug use among Chicago's Cambodians. This report summarizes nearly 100 interviews with 59 Cambodians in individual and group settings. A summary of the key themes from the interviews and quotes from the participants is provided in the second section of the report. The project found that none of the assumed stereotypes about Cambodian substance abuse accurately reflected addiction problems in the Cambodian community of Chicago. What did emerge from the study is that alcohol consumption among adults has increased since Cambodians began resettling in Chicago. Both male and female participants reported that they consumed more alcohol in the United States than they did in Cambodia and that there is more social drinking in the U.S. The incidence and prevalence among men and women in Cambodia and the U.S. is compared. Also included is information about the association between alcohol and work in Cambodia; social issues influencing Cambodian life, including religion, traditions, and family; alcohol as a medicine; recovery in the U.S. and Cambodia; issues of older adults; and recommendations from the project.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Middle-Aging Asians: Demographic Forecasts</B><BR>
<B><I>Exter, T.G. </I></B><BR>
<I>American Demographics </I>14(11)67, 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>Asians are America's fastest growing minority group. From 1980 to 1990, this population grew from 3.5 to 7.3 million. According to the Urban Institute this population will grow to 17.1 million by 2010 and 34.5 million by 2040. At these rates, Asians will comprise 5.7 percent of the population in 2010 and 9.7 percent by 2040. This rapid growth is due to above-average fertility and a high rate of immigration.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Substance Abuse Among Asian/Pacific Islander Americans</B><BR>

In: R.C. Cervantes, Ed., <I>Substance Abuse and Gang Violence. </I> Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1992. 178 p. (pp. 3-23)<BR>
Available from Sage Publications, 2455 Teller Road, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320.
<BLOCKQUOTE>The empirical literature and research on the epidemiology of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use and abuse among the Asian and Pacific Islander Americans are reviewed. Despite the increasing diversity and numbers of Asian and Pacific Islanders in the United States, there is a paucity of studies that investigated culturally specific issues related to AOD use. Some of the methodological and conceptual issues are highlighted. Findings of the 1990 California Statewide Asian Drug Needs Assessment are described briefly, noting methodological and conceptual difficulties in accurately estimating AOD prevalence among Asian and Pacific Islander communities. Because of increasing costs for providing needed prevention and treatment services, a greater understanding and accurate portrayal of AOD use and abuse in the Asian and Pacific Islander populations are important to guide the practical decisions for resource allocation, program planning, and other purposes. Creativity in designing and implementing culturally appropriate AOD research should facilitate accountability for prevention and treatment services.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Alcohol-Related Problems Encountered by Japanese, Caucasians, and Japanese-Americans</B><BR>

<I>The International Journal of the Addictions </I>27(12):1389-1400, 1992.
<BLOCKQUOTE>Using population-based survey data, personal-problematic and socioproblematic factors were examined among Japanese in Japan, Japanese-Americans in Hawaii, and Japanese Americans; Caucasians in California were analyzed as a control group.  Caucasian males were more likely to exhibit  drinking-related social problems, whereas Japanese males showed more personal-problematic symptoms.  Japanese-American men, both in Hawaii and California, were least likely among the three ethnic groups to have personal-problematic symptoms  and were more likely to have socioproblematic symptoms than Japanese men.  These differences might be explained by differences in the perception of social problems.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>Memories of Your University Years  Will Always Be Special</H2>
<P>Long after you have graduated from UT, memories of your time on campus and
the friendships you made during college will continue to be a part of your life.
At Contessa Dorms Ltd., we take pride in being part of your university
experience.</P>
<P>We offer more than a place to live--we offer a place to belong.</P>
<P>Nestled in the trees west of the UT campus are our three friendly
dorms--Contessa, Contessa West, and Barrone. Each dorm has different floorplans
and amenities--you choose the one that fits you best. Whichever dorm you select,
you'll appreciate the freedom of an apartment lifestyle combined with the
conveniences of a dorm.</P>
<P></P>
<H2>We Take Your Academic Success Seriously</H2>
<P>At Contessa Dorms, we never lose sight of the goal: We take your academic
success seriously. An on-site computer room provides the tools you need to work
efficiently and to stay competitive. Without leaving the buildings, you can
connect to the University library system or send your assignment directly to
your professor by modem. Comfortable study rooms provide a quiet place for you
to prepare for exams. And with 340 students in the Contessa community, chances
are you'll find a friendly study group to help solve those academic quandaries.</P>
<P></P>
<H2>We Help You Make Friends For Life</H2>
<P>Friends you make in college will be with you for years to come. At Contessa
Dorms we recognize the part a strong social network plays in supporting your
academic success. We make a real effort to help foster these lifelong
friendships by bringing students together in a supportive, comfortable, and
caring atmosphere.</P>
<P></P>
<H2>We Make You Feel Right At Home</H2>
<P>A comfortable retreat from the hustle-bustle of college life can make a big
contribution to your success at the University. At Contessa, you can choose from
among three buildings to find the floorplan that best meets your needs.</P>
<P>The Contessa building offers two-bedroom suites that accommodate from two to
four students (private or double bedrooms). Contessa West offers three-bedroom,
two-bath suites joined by a kitchenette and dining area. Three or four students
share these spacious suites (two double bedrooms plus living room--or three
private bedrooms). And, at the Barrone, all residents live in private rooms with
connecting baths--ideal for graduate or very serious students.</P>
<P>All rooms are fully furnished and carpeted; each building has central air
conditioning and heat. Our housekeeping staff visits twice weekly.</P>
<P></P>
<H2>We Serve Food To Write Home About</H2>
<P>When it comes to the dining room, you'll especially appreciate Contessa's
local management. Because all food is prepared on-site by our own professional
chef and his staff, you can count on fresh, nutritious, and well-balanced meals.
Contessa's flexible dining service saves you valuable time and gives you access
to the quality food you need to support an active lifestyle. We pride ourselves
on flexibility and innovation in meal planning and preparation: Where else will
you find daily vegetarian menus, &quot;invent your own omelette&quot; brunches,
special Sunday dinners and dorm food to write home about!</P>
<P></P>
<H2>We Give You A Chance To Unwind</H2>
<P>Contessa residents appreciate the chance to unwind at the end of a long day.
Not only do the buildings themselves contribute to relaxation, but an energetic
team of Resident Advisors is busy making plans to help you recuperate from a
hectic class schedule. Parties, picnics and other fun events are part of what
makes Contessa &quot;home.&quot; Combined with Austin's year-round outdoor
lifestyle, Contessa's amenities offer students a well-rounded choice of
activities and entertainment.</P>
<P></P>
<H2>We Give You A Great Location</H2>
<P>Just three short blocks from the University of Texas campus, Contessa,
Contessa West and Barrone offer an ideal Austin location.</P>
<P>The UT shuttle bus stops right out front, and provides quick transportation
to the far reaches of campus. Austin's excellent city bus system also stops out
front and makes quick trips to the malls and other student spots. For students
who bring a car to UT, limited covered parking is available underneath Contessa
and Contessa West.</P>

<H2>Contessa Top Ten Questions</H2>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>How far is Contessa from the University of Texas campus?</STRONG>
</DT>
<DD>The University of Texas campus is huge, stretching for blocks in every
direction. But from the center of campus, Contessa is just five short blocks to
the northwest. We are located in the pleasant West Campus neighborhood, a
tree-shaded mix of shops, historic homes and student residences. 
<A HREF="map/index.html">(Click here for map.)</A>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>How do I get to campus?</STRONG>
</DT>
<DD>From Contessa, it's easy. Many parts of campus are in easy walking
distance. However, to get to the far reaches, you can catch the West Campus
shuttle bus right outside the front door. Shuttles run every few minutes, making
it easy to arrive in time for class. Also, Austin's mild climate makes walking
to class possible year round. Bike racks are available for those who prefer to
pedal to class, another very popular option.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>What about security?</STRONG>
</DT>
<DD>Contessa and Contessa West have 24-hour desk attendants, and Barrone has a
resident manager. Parking areas are fenced, and this summer card access will be
installed. Suites and rooms have solid doors with secure locks. Locks are
re-keyed yearly.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Does Contessa have on-site parking?</STRONG>
</DT>
<DD>Yes, at no additional charge. Parking is located beneath both the Contessa
and Contessa West buildings on a first-come first served basis. However, many
residents find that the location of Contessa Dorms and Austin's compact size
make a car all but unnecessary.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>How many meals are served?</STRONG>
</DT>
<DD>Three meals a day are served Monday through Friday. On the weekends, brunch
and dinner are served. Menus are posted weekly.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Is the food good?</STRONG>
</DT>
<DD>Yes! We pride ourselves on a flexible, student-oriented approach to meal
planning. Vegetarian and low fat entrees are always available, as are unlimited
seconds. All meals are planned and prepared on-site, by our own foodservice
staff. Because this is not a contract foodservice, you are able to interact
directly with the dining room staff.  
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Are all three dorms co-ed?</STRONG>
</DT>
<DD>Yes. In the past one of our dorms was all women and one was all men, but
now all three dorms are co-ed.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>What mix of majors live at Contessa?</STRONG>
</DT>
<DD>Contessa residents are a lively mix of majors from throughout the United
States and many foreign countries. They range in age from incoming freshmen to
graduate students, and represent nearly every school and college at the
University. Barrone, our smallest dorm, caters to graduate students.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Is smoking allowed in the dorms?</STRONG>
</DT>
<DD>Smoking is allowed in suites where all residents have requested it so. All
public areas in the buildings are non-smoking. Note: Austin has a stringent
no-smoking ordinance which prohibits smoking in public places, including
restaurants!
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>What if I don't have a roommate in mind?</STRONG>
</DT>
<DD>Most incoming residents don't. Part of your application process is a
personality profile, which we will use to help match you to a compatible
roommate. This profile evaluates such habits a music listening, study habits and
neatness. Our managers have a good track record of matching &quot;friends for
life!&quot;

<H4>CIGAR AIRLIFT RESULTS FROM INTERNET REQUEST BY U.S. CAPTAIN<BR>
DEPLOYED FOR OPERATION JOINT ENDEAVOR</H4><BR>

April 10, 1996, <I>HOUSTON, TX</I> - Making good use of his resources, a U.S.<BR>
Captain stationed in Hungary as part of the 'Operation Joint Endeavor'<BR>
peace-keeping mission in Bosnia had a special supply need (cigars) which<BR>
he posted on the Internet. The message was received by a Texas-based web<BR>
site, Cigar.com, and the result is that an airlift is in progress.<BR>
Captain Paul Rupp, a U.S. Army physician, stationed with <BR>
the 67th Combat Surgical Hospital in Taszar, Hungary,<BR>
has started a small cigar club. The camaraderie is there but the<BR>
supplies are not. &quot;We have been locked down on a small NATO air base<BR>
for four months&quot;, Captain Rupp reported in his email message intercepted<BR>
by Cigar.com webmaster Jim Denton. &quot;We are down to our last four<BR>
cigars. Any catalogs you could send us would be greatly<BR>
appreciated.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Denton immediately put the wheels in motion, collecting boxes of cigars<BR>
and assorted accessories from retailers and manufacturers featured at<BR>
Cigar.com on the World Wide Web. [http://www.cigar.com] The result is<BR>
that the first airlift will be on its way by the end of the week.<BR>
&quot;There is nothing worse than for a cigar aficionado to be out of cigars.<BR>
I wouldn't wish that dilemma on any one, so I considered it my duty to<BR>
help out the Captain and his cigar club&quot;, comments Denton. &quot;Besides,<BR>
it's a great way for the internet cigar community to show its support<BR>
for our troops.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Cigar.com is a web site designed and administered by Planet Texas, an<BR>
Internet design and technology company based in Austin, Texas.<BR>
Maintained by Denton out of Houston, Texas, Cigar.com is one of the<BR>
largest cigar communities available on the World Wide Web, with a<BR>
variety of retailers, manufacturers and cigar-friendly restaurants<BR>
represented in its collection of home pages.<BR>
<BR>
An emergency shipment will be sent this week to Hungary, with a larger<BR>
one to follow once Denton receives the complimentary supplies from his<BR>
home page customers. In return for the supplies, Denton has requested<BR>
that the Captain send a picture of his cigar club so that it can be<BR>
featured on its own home page at Cigar.com. &quot;This is a perfect scenario<BR>
illustrating how the Internet facilitates communication and commerce in<BR>
ways previously unthinkable&quot;, comments John Christensen, president
of<BR>
Summary Corporation, the parent company of Planet Texas. &quot;We are<BR>
delighted to be able to help out, responding to this special need of the<BR>
troops stationed in Hungary.&quot;<BR>

<center><h1>Stories From Bosnia</h1></center>

<font size=+1>
<p>
Major Daniel Mansfield, MD is a surgeon deployed to the 67th Forward Surgical Team in Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina.  As an Operation Cigar lift recipient, he has graciously provided Cigar.com with these stories.  In his own words:
<dl>
<dt>
<dd>
"I have written a short series of articles as an observer in Bosnia, kind of experiential in nature, that my home town paper had published.  I hope you enjoy the pieces.  I think they give a little more personal and humanistic viewpoint than most people are getting back in the States."
</dl>
We are indeed priveleged to be able to offer this unique look into the making of a mission.  Thank you Dan!

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Cigar.com is divided into 8 major sections.</B></FONT> At the top of every page within the Cigar.com Virtual Community, you will find a menu bar that will aid in navigating the site; however, it will not appear on sites to which we link but do not serve.
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><A HREF="/cigar/manufacturers/index.html"><B>Cigar Manufacturers</B></A></FONT> contains links to the sites of many cigar companies whose products are available through retail tobacco dealers.  Some of these sites, such as the <A HREF="http:butera.cigar.com">Butera Pipe Company</A> and the <A HREF="http://splendid.cigar.com">Splendid Seed Tobacco Company</A>, include a retailer search engine which will help you locate a cigar store near you (or on the web) which carries that product.  Others, like the <A HREF="http://consolidated.cigar.com">Consolidated Cigar Corporation</A>, contain extensive information on <A HREF="http://consolidated.cigar.com/judge/index.html">How to Judge a Good Cigar</A>, as well as product education on the numerous lines produced by this company.
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><A HREF="/cigar/accessories/index.html"><B>Cigar Accessories</B></A></FONT> is a listing of the sites of humidor makers, cigar ashtrays, lighters, air cleaners, cd-roms and anything else designed to enhance your enjoyment of fine cigars.
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><A HREF="cigar/faq/index.html"><B>Cigar Articles</B></A></FONT> provides you with reading material that is cigar related. Some of the articles are reprints originally appearing in other magazines and some are original articles solicited by Cigar.com specifically for this site.
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><A HREF="/cigar/airlift/index.html"><B>Cigar Airlift</B></A></FONT> - <b>Operation Cigar Lift</b> sends thousands of free cigars to U.S. troops serving overseas.  These grateful servicemen and women have sent us many photos and letters, which are featured here.  Take some time to read these - they will really give <b>you</b> a lift!  Also, you will find a listing of everyone, from billion dollar corporations to concerned individuals, who have contributed cigars to this cause.  Please patronize their web sites.
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><A HREF="/cigar/search/index.cgi"><B>Cigar Search</B></A></FONT> is the only thing of its kind on the web.  It allows you to <b>simultaneously</b> search the catalogs of 13 cigar retailers for a cigar by any combination of Brand, <A HREF="/cigar/faq/size/index.html">Shape</A>, Wrapper, and Country of manufacture.  From the "results" page of a performed search, you can then click through to the web page of the store from which you would like to purchase your cigar.
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><A HREF="/cigar/stores/index.html"><B>Cigar Stores</B></A></FONT> is a listing to the web sites of all the cigar retailers who have had the presence of mind and good judgment to advertise here!
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><A HREF="/cigar/clubs/index.html"><B>Cigar Clubs</B></A></FONT> includes both cigar-of-the-month type clubs as well as cigar-friendly clubs and restaurants.
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><A HREF="cigar/news/index.html"><B>Cigar News</B></A></FONT> is our newest section at Cigar.com.   Here you will find a compilation of all stories related to publicly held cigar and cigar-related companies.  Plans for this site include a stock ticker specific to these companies.  For those of you who currently hold (or plan to hold) cigar company stocks in your investment portfolios, this section should be a welcome addition!

<b>To:</b> jdenton@cigar.com

<p>Dear Mr. Denton,

<p>Thank your for the Cigars!  As soon as I can clear my office from today's
meetings - I will sit down and smoke one.  I do indeed appreciate a good
Cigar.

<p>The soldiers of Task Force Eagle and I appreciate the support we are
receiving from around the world for this Peace Enforcement Mission in
Bosnia-Herzegovina.  We have accomplished much during our five months here,
but have much work to do.  The soldiers are proud, disciplined and well
trained.  They are executing the mission to standard and are making a
difference in a country long at war.

<p>Thanks again for your thoughtful gesture and God bless.


<p>Bill NASH

<p>Comments,</p>

<p>Gentlemen,  I am the Chief of medical operations for the 30th Medical Bde deployed in Bosnia.  SFC Fiers of the 212th MASH/Task Force Med Eagle told me about the great thing you are doing for the troops.  Particularly for one of my troops.  Most of us have been here in the Tuzla Valley since just after the New Year.  I'm sure you have heard all the stories of how few of the pleasures of home get to us.  To the credit of many agencies and the Army itself we are finally seeing things that make the stress of peacekeeping more tolerable.  Unfortunately, a truly fine cigar is not one of them.  Because our PX facilities are forced to keep a reduced number of stocked items only the most common of cigars can be stocked.  Those of us, myself included, who love a good cigar have had to rely on the good graces and fortune of a fellow soldier who happened to receive a special care package from home.  We have spent a number of nights in the in the guard towers overlooking the countryside and enjoying a rare moment of comraderie.  Thanks again for supporting the troops.  Tonight SFC Fiers and I are going to share one of those quiet moments with a fine cigar that he has given me.</p>

<p>Thank you again and God Bless. </p> 

<p>Maj Art Gonzales</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
     
<p>We just heard about the cigar lift.  We are stationed here in Bosnia with
the 84th Medical Detachment.  We have several soldiers in our unit that
would like to participate in the cigar lift.  It would be greatly
appreciated if you would send a box of cigars in care of MAJ Pincus to be
distributed to members of the unit.</p> 

<p>Thanking you in advance,</p>

<p>MAJ Pincus</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>Hate to bother you -- but was inquiring about some information how how   
to order some cigars.  I'm one of the lucky ones to be deployed here in   
Bosnia.  Have looked at your web site -- but do to my connection to it --   
it moves extremely slow.  I pulled up some of the short cuts to some of   
the cigar companies that you had on your main menu and requested catologs   
in which I could order some cigars from them.</p>

<p>As I'm sure others from here can tell you that the only good cigar that   
you can get in Bosnia has to come through the mail.</p>

<p>Online ordering is very slow at my PC and telephone ordering is   
expensive.  Would appreciate any  help that you can give.</p>

<p>If you can help get some catologs that will deliver to Bosnia (APO) I   
would be in your debt.</p>

<p>Keep up the good work !!</p>

<p>Thanks for your time and help !!</p>

VR,</p>

<p>Mike</p>

<p>Mr Denton,</p>

<p>Your awesome !!  Thank you for the quick response.  I didn't expect free   
cigars but will gladly share with soldiers here. Please let me thank you in advance !!

<p>When cigars arrive -- will get a picture of them with the soldiers who   
will be enjoying them.</p>

<p> It's nice to know that others have not forgotten us little people over   
here in Bosnia.</p>

<p>Very Respectfully,</p>

<p>Michael Mills</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>


<p>I'm writing in response to your advertisement on the Internet. For 
background information, I am an Army physician deployed with Operation Joint 
Endeavor in support of the Bosnia peace mission. I am presently starting a 
small cigar club here in Taszar, Hungary. It now consists of mainly novice to 
early intermediate smokers.</p> 

<p>Currently, we are unable to acquire cigars, lighters, cutters, boxes and 
other essential equipment. For the past 4 months we have been locked down on 
a small NATO air base. Our supplies that we brought with us (including the 
last 4 Montecristo Cubans) are quickly diminishing. Any samples, and 
catalogs that your company offers would greatly be appreciated. </p>
        
<p>Thank you for your time and effort supporting those who support America's 
freedoms!</P>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>
CPT Paul Rupp M.D.<br>
67th CSH</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Denton,</p>

<p>It is Sunday evening, 23 June, and I was thinking how much I would enjoy a good cigar.  Since there are none to be found at my base camp here in Bosnia, I thought that a little "cigar surfing" was in order.  That is how I happened upon your web site.  I am thoroughly impressed.  I am the commander of a personnel services support detachment.  Several of the soldiers in my unit are also cigar smokers.  We have the same problem as the rest of my fellow soldiers who have written to you.  There is a great demand for a good cigar here in Bosnia, but the supply is unfortunately non-existent.  I would appreciate if my unit could be added to your mailing list.  I would like to order some good cigars for us to enjoy after a long day at the "office".  It is great corresponding with a fine American such as yourself.</p>  

<p>Sincerely,  CPT Dan Kelly<br>

<p>Jim,</p>

<p>I cannot thank you enough for the cigars.  The news of their arrival spread quickly.  I have been passing them out like crazy.  All of the recipients are most appreciative.  The cigars have provided us with a way of relaxing after a long day, a way to make new friends, time for some good conversation and a way of bringing us all closer together in friendship while we are away from our loved ones.  A picture of my unit is on the way.  I wish you and all of the contributors a safe and joyous Independence Day.</p>

<p>Gentlemen,</p>

<p>One of our fine NCOs (SFC Rodriguez) ran into 
<A HREF="/cigar/airlift/letters/kelly/index.html">
<b>CPT Kelly</b></a> today.   He 
showed up here in our little home away from home in Lukavac, Bosnia  bearing 
a sample of some wonderful cigars.  He spead the wealth around and we now 
have at least a dozen soldiers all waiting anxiously for this evening to 
come,  when we will all meet on the "patio" for an after dinner smoke.  What 
a great surprise and relief.  When he told me about how he got his hands on 
such great cigars, I had my doubts ( a good source would, of course, be 
guarded jealously) .  Those of us who brought cigars with us are now out and 
are at the mercy of our wives to make critical decisions on, what to send 
us, how often, and what kind.</p>
<p>Also,  I have a few friends who are devoted pipe smokers.  While our 
PX  has an ample supply of Borkum Rif,  they were hoping to find a source 
for a quality tobacco that were once accostomed to.   Is there any way that 
we could get a quality suplier of pipe  products to send a catalouge of 
suitable items in order to help stop the whining?  They will be waiting and 
choking in anticipation of your reply.   I have included my address, you 
have my assurance that any required charges for catalogs will be sent 
immediately.</p>
<p>Again thanks for the cigars.  We will all lift them in a toast to your 
generosity and support.</p>

<p>Craig,

<p>Sorry for the delay in getting back to you!  I can't do anything right now
with pipe tobacco - I'm absolutely swamped with the cigars. If you need more
cigars though, I can send some - just let me know!  How about a picture for the web site?  It helps to me to get more donations.</p>

<p>My best to all my comrades in smoke!  I _will_ try on the tobacco but it may take some time.</p>

<p>Jim</p>

<p>Jim,</p>

<p>Absolutley, send the cigars. The ones you sent CPT Kelly are going 
fast.  He has been more than generous.  I think the pipe tobacco can wait as 
these guys will smoke a cigar.  They do tend to say from time to time how 
much they prefer a good pipe.  Sort of ruins the mood for the rest of us. 
CPT Kelly will be sending a photo soon.  We can do likewise here.  Look 
forward to sampling what's been donated.  Thanks again for the support.  We 
are hoping to get some great photos as we cross over the Sava River going 
north.</p>

<p>We can't tell you how much the support from people like you and your

a relaxing moment with a nice cigar.</p>

<p>If it is at all possible I would love to receive a shipment of cigars from

<p>Again it warms the heart to know people like you.  Thanks for going above 
the standard of supporting us soldiers.  I have seen the news not too long 
ago where Bosnia and its troubles and the soldiers serving here were no 
longer mentioned.  You honor us, and are honored for your efforts.  Thank 
you!!!</p>

<p>May I ask again something of you?</p>

<p>Maybe in your endeavors, could you find me some pipe tobacco.  For it is 
pipe tobacco which I thirst.  The cigars are most welcome, but for some 
pleasant smoke in my pipe is what I truly need!</p>

<p>Again Jim, many warm thanks from me and my friends.</p>

Jim, it is great to hear from you.  I hope all is well with you.  I would 
like to thank you not only for the cigars but for the great T-Shirt of Op. 
Cigar.Com.  That is a keeper for sure.  Is there anyway to get more of those 
T-Shirts,  do you have them in a catalog?  My friends and I are eyeing the 
perfect spot for our photo, we have something in mind that has meaning to us 
who have been stationed in the European based U.S. Army and I'm confident 
you'll get a kick out of it also.  To be sure the days are long but when I 
get the chance I take a long walk around the place here and enjoy a cigar 
and for a few moments out of the day I can honestly say a smile comes over 
my face.  Sounds silly, but the cigar helps and we owe it to you.  Thank you 
Jim, our friend!</p>

<p>Your friend, Scott</p>

<b>Date:</b> Sun, 7 Jul 96 21:13:46 WETDST (2013Z)<br>
<b>From:</b> Cpt. Maureen Ryan<br>
<b>To:</b> jdenton@cigar.com (cigar)</p>


<p>My name is CPT Maureen Ryan.  I'm currently deployed in support of Operation 
Joint Endeavor.  I deployed to Lukavac Bosnia in early January.  While ther I 
picked up the habit of smoking cigars and telling numerous lies with my 
firiends after the evening meal.  There we would be, standing around ouside in 
the Balkan winter smoking cigars and telling each other our life stories.  It 
became a very important part of our lives.  Its hard to explain but when you 
deploy with a group of people you become incredibly close.  People that you 
might have only been casual friends with become lifelong friends after getting 
to know them on a deployment.  Anyway, our cigar smoke was a important time for
us to bond as peers and friends.</p>

<p>I think half the pleasure my male friends got from it was the fact that here 
was a female captain (me) smoking this huge cigar.  It tends to shock people.</p>

<p>In June, I took company command in the 127th Aviation Support Battalion.  This 
is the battalion which provides all logistical support to the 4th Brigade (the 
aviation brigade) and in fact all logistics to the aviation assets in theater.
Half of my company is located at Comanche Base (Tuzla West in Bosnia)( and half
in here in Kaposujlak in Hungary.  Needless to say, I spend a lot of time 
flying back and forth between the two sites.</p>

<p>As much fun as command is, I still miss my cigar smokes with my friends back in
Lukavac.  Some of them (<A HREF="/cigar/airlift/letters/kelly/index.html">
Dan Kelly</a> and <A HREF="/cigar/airlift/letters/thompson/index.html">
Craig Thompson</a>) told me about Operation 
Cigar Lift.  I would like very much to be able to order cigars while here in 
Bosnia.  I'm still ignorant as to what to order but I'm sure we'll figure 
swomething out.  Besides, I need to figure out some way to fend off all these 
aviators.  They're worse than advertised.</p>

<p>Any help you can provide me would be deeply appreciated.</p>

<p>Thank You,

<p>Maureen E. Ryan<br>
CPT, QM<br>
Commanding</p>

<p>I would be thrilled to share your cigars -- I've got a number of friends here

<p>I promise to send you numerous amusing pictures featuring groups of us smoking 
your cigars.</p>

<p>Jim,</p>

<p>We eagerly await any cigars you send our way.  Don't worry, we're in no hurry.
I think we'll be here a while.</p>

<p>Again, thanks so much for implementing Operation Cigar Lift.</p>

<p>Mr. Denton,</p>

<p>I wanted to take time out to thank you for the work you've done in 
supporting the troops here in Bosnia-Herzegovina with your cigar lift.  I 
was in the Division Headquarters the other day and everyone is talking about 
it.  Even when I returned to my place of duty, in the Division Rear Command 
Post, our little cigar "club" was all excited with the news that there were 
folks in the states supporting the only relaxation that is legal under the 
rules of our Task Force .... which is a good cigar !!!   Even the foreign 
soldiers that we work with including the British, Norwegian, Sweedish, and 
Germans were amazed with the wonderful support that we receive on missions 
such as this one from folks such as yourself.  At this moment  the supply 
that was shared with us is being consumed with smiles on our faces and pride 
in our hearts from the feeling that we are not forgotten.  If there is 
anything that we can do for you on this end, please let me know !!   If you 
should find yourself with excess stockage again, please send some our way 
and I will share them with the cigar enthusiasts that exist among the more 
than 2,000 soldiers here at our Base Camp.  In any case please except my 
sincere gratitude for the gracious support that you have provided.  You have 
truly affected the morale of this Task Force in a positive way !!!!</p>

<p>Take Care and God Bless !!!!!!!</p>

<p>Mr. Denton,</p>

<p>I would again like to send my appreciation for your efforts with 
"Operation Cigar Lift" to our troops involved in Operation Joint Endeavor. 
 I have seen the results and you would be proud of morale booster that you 
have created.  I would however like to ask for a favor. I have just 
repositioned from Bosnia to Croatia with my shop, the Division Medical 
Operations Center,  and there seems to be a lack of cigars here.  I would 
like to request one of your shipments if you have any left.  I understand 
the rules and will share them with the soldiers here. I further promise some 
great pictures for your web sight !!  If you do not have any cigars left, I 
would still like to thank you for everything you have done for us !!</p>

<p>Thank you so much, and may the Lord watch over you in your 
"Endeavors",</p>

<p>Dear Gentlemen,</p>

<p>I recently was informed that you are providing relief to the
afficianados of fine cigars in Bosnia.  Since my deployment ,
Operation Joint Endeavor, I have not enjoyed a quality cigar.  While
the PX does sell White Owls and Tampas they do not appeal to my
palate.  I will gladly distribute your products to other cigar
smokers in this theater and send you photos
of our happy faces.  All I ask is that you send a relief package as
soon as you can.  Thank you for
your time.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Denton:</p>

<p>I have just received your shipment of cigars.  Thank you for the
effort and thought.  When my wife told me she had made contact with a cigar
distributor who was sending some samples, I had expected a three pack of
Swisher Sweets Tiparillos.  I am really pleased with what you and your
associates have sent, and I am hard at work distributing them to the
soldiers here in LA Lisa.</p>

<p>Regarding your request for photos, I will take some pictures of the
soldiers here, but there is a large event coming up that will provide an
excellent photo opportunity.  I am in a Cavalry Squadron, where we maintain
the traditions of the Cavalry by holding a Spur Ride for officers and
warrent officers as a rite of induction into the Squadron.  Our next Spur
Ride is set for 7 July.  Every one of the 80 officers and warrents of the
Squadron should be present.  What I'm going to do is hold enough cigars for
that, and then take a group photo of the officers and warrents smoking
cigars and send that photo to you also.  This should be a really good shot.</p>

<p>I will also be passing out the addresses you included in your letter
so that the companies will receive the appreciation they deserve.  If any of
them have email addresses, if you could send those, we could also send
thanks in that manner.  For now, let me pass along the appreciation I feel
towards you and the companies supporting your effort.  It does raise spirits
here knowing that people in the States are thinking of us as we stand here
in rain, and snow.  Your support means more to us than the thanks of the
government.</p>

<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Denton,</p>
     

<p>I would like to say thank you for your efforts in Operation Joint
Endeavor Cigar Lift. It is great to know that other Americans care about
the troops here. That means a lot.</p>
 
<p>Currently I am deprived the pleasure of a magnificant cigar. The
author, Robert Fulghum, described a cigar in one of his stories as a
"please god, don't smoke THAT near me" cigar. That's my kind of cigar.
Something that looks more like a stick of dynamite than a tobacco
product. The PX system doesn't stock fine cigars so could you please
send me any cigar catalogs you might have. I would very much like to be
able order "please god, don't smoke THAT near me" cigars from the
states. I also know that my fellow cigar connoisseurs in my battalion
would be interested in ordering from those catalogs too.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>2LT Mike Baker<br>

<p>Mr. Denton,</p>

<p>Your generosity is spreading fast over here in Bosnia.  Ran into <A HREF="/cigar/airlift/letters/thompson/index.html">
CPT   
Thompson</a> as he crossed over the Sava River -- and he was gracious enough   
to share one of his cigars that he got from you.</p>

<p>It was like mana from heaven.  It is so hard to believe that such simple   
pleasures in life are so hard to come by over here.  As an a man who   
enjoys relaxing to a great cigar -- I am impelled to write you a note.   
 Any help that you can provide to ease my withdrawls from good cigars   
would be greatly appreciated.</P>

<p>My family and friends do the best that they can -- by mailing cigars to   
me -- but the shipments tend to be far and between.  If you can send me a   
catolog or two of a company that would deliver cigars to Bosnia, I will   
be in your debt.</p>

<p>CPT Thompson says that you would like to get some pictures of soldiers   
enjoying your cigar.  That seems to be an easy task -- will get on it   
right away.</p>

<p>Your simply getures to date have put many happy smiles on the faces of   
soldiers that I work with.  Thanks for not forgetting us little people in   
Bosnia.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</P>

<p>SGM Luis Santos<br>

<p>Comments,</p>

<p>Well their I was surfing the net when I saw it for the very first time. A web site for cigar lovers, at first I could belive it.  As I search though the pages I thought I was in heaven. But alas I am not, I am here in Tuzla, Bosnia stuck on a hilltop unable to go anywhere. Their are no cigar stores here, and the PX carry only the basic brands in a box. So I order my cigars from stores in the states. It takes a couple of weeks to get here, so I have to ration myself carefully. Its times like these that you really enjoy the simple pleasures in life. Nothing like getting off duty, standing outside with your flak vest and kevlar on with your M16, and enjoy your favorite cigar and watching the sun set in this war torn country.  If you could I would appreciate any cigar catalogs, and reading material, so I may expand my knowledge of cigars.

<p>Thank You,

<p>Jim,

<p>I want to thank you for all of your assistance in sending the cigars to the 212th MASH in care of myself.  It means a lot to the military when we know the American people are behind us. So often we in the military have very little, if any say in what we do or where we will go.  Out here in Bosnia we have very few pleasures, what we
do have most of us brought with us.  Having our Mon, Wed, Fri cigar smoking bull sessions helps all of us cope with the mission. Well, once again I want to thank you for all of your help.

<p>Your Fellow American

<p>Dear Mr. Denton,</p>
     
<p>In a very short time your name has become a household word on at
least two base camps in Bosnia.  I also work for the 30th Medical Brigade
(of which the 67th Combat Support Hospital in Hungary is a subordinate
unit) in the G2 section.  <A HREF="/cigar/airlift/letters/gonzales/index.html">
MAJ Art Gonzales</a>, the Chief of Medical
Operations obtained your name from another one of our subordinate units,
the 212th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH).</p>

<p>MAJ "G" and I arrived at the future Base Camp Rumbaugh in January;
when the mud was half-way up our legs, there was no hot food, no heat,
no latrines, no mail, and there were no cigars to be found anywhere.
We have finally reached that point in the operation where we are only
working 15-16 hours a day, six and one-half days a week.  Even though
the conditions have been tough, and there is still a long-way to go, the
knowledge that our countrymen are supporting us, in any way they can
think of, helps us to "Charlie-Mike." Thanks for the support.  My boss,
MAJ Armstrong, is on his way home for the night (he left at 1145 p.m.)
smoking a cigar that MAJ "G" gave him.  Not only will we send you a group
photo (MAJ "G," MAJ "A," CPT "L," SFC "F," and myself) I will try and
coordinate some photos of our fathers, smoking a cigar while on the
phone with us here in Bosnia.</p>
     
<p>Thanks again for your support and may God Bless you and yours.</p>
     
<p>SSG(P) Mark Epstein, Task Force Med Eagle, Operation Joint Endeavor<br>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I am currently stationed on Tulza West, Bosnia.  I have heard
about Operation Cigar Lift happening at your location. My unit is an
aviation unit that supports two attach helicopter battalions of
Apache helicopters and a lift battalion with Blackhawk helicopters.
We spend most of the day working on these helicopters.  At night we
kick back on our home made front porch and tell lies.  This nightly
routine would be a hundred times better if we could smoke some good
cigars.  Unforunately for us there is no supply of good cigars at
this location.  If you could assist us we would greatly appreciate
it.</p>


<p>Thank You 

<p>Rip</p>

<p>I am a Cigar smoking Infantryman from Houston deployed to Bosnia as a part
of the NATO  force here.  There are very few thing that were able to do here
that does not conflict with out mission.  Drinking is out as is any social
interaction with the locals.  The one thing that I enjoy that is not
prohibited is a good cigar.  But Stogies are difficult to find here and
almost impossible to order.  So I have tried to find other things to keep me
happy but nothing can replace a good cigar.  And now I see this becon of
light at the end of this dark tunnel.  A Cigar Lift?  If such a good thing
could be true then sign me up!</p>

<p>Jim,</p>

<p>Thanks for what you are doing.  It's realy good to know that the people in
the states care for what we are doing here and support the Soldiers.  I'll
be sending you some pictures of myself and a few of the other cigar smokers
here as soon as I can get them developed.  I hope to have them back from the
developer in a few weeks.  Once again Thanks;</P>

<h1 align=center>A Christmas Eve in Bosnia</h1>
<center><i><b>by</b></i></center>
<h5 align=center>
Major Daniel Mansfield<br>
MD 67th Forward Surgical Team<br>
Operation Joint Endeavor</h5>
<br clear=all>

<font size=+1>
<p><dd><font size=+2>A</font>fter arriving at Ramstein Airbase in Germany, carefully packed into six Humvees each towing its own trailer, we were told to return to our home base in Wuerzburg, Germany. Our priority level wouldn't get us on the planes to Tuzla. We were the 67th Forward Surgical Team, and we were given the mission of providing the Forward Surgical Support for 20,000 troops to be deployed. And we couldn't even get into the Bosnia. The anticipation, the butterflies in our midsections, and the sad, pre-Christmas good-byes were left to repeat themselves on another, undetermined date. It was the 19th of December.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>F</font>our days earlier we had been scrambled with two-hour notice to deploy. Unopened Christmas packages were shoved in front of us as we finalized the packing of our rucksacks and duffel bags. Enough gear for a year. Amid the tears and questions and quickly opened packages, the contents of which were jammed into any remaining space in the duffel bag, quick 'good-byes' were said, and hugs that needed to last potentially twelve months were given. No one wanted to let go.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>D</font>uring the next several days, we were eating the 'last supper' every evening, never knowing when the call would come to immediately load up and move out. Opened packages and wrapping paper were shoved under the makeshift Christmas tree. There really had been no reason to get a big tree. We had been told from before Thanksgiving that we would be leaving any time. Weekend trips had been canceled, as we had to be on a two-hour leash, ready to deploy at any time. Families were pulled in every direction, trying to make the most of what could always be the last evening.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>O</font>ur team is made up of twenty people. This includes four surgeons, two anesthesia personnel, a couple of Operating Room Technicians, and an assortment of nurses and medics. We are an Airborne, Rapidly Deployable unit, and can be air-dropped into otherwise inaccessible locations by parachute. We were hoping not to be dropped into Bosnia, because we had all heard of the number of land mines, and none of us wanted to be part of an airborne mine clearing project. We have essentially been preparing for this mission for a year. Setting up in blackout conditions, using just night vision goggles, tearing down, moving, and setting up again. This set-up includes two operating rooms, a small emergency room, and a recovery room and ward area. We are designed to provide the far forward surgical support until larger units such as a MASH (Mobile Army Surgical Hospital) could get set up.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>W</font>e got the call on December 22. Hugging our families and saying another in a seemingly endless series of good-byes, we trekked back to our vehicles to prepare for the journey to Ramstein. We had been moved up on the priority list. The forward units in Bosnia realized that their surgical support was still in Germany. They wanted us in Bosnia, now. People were starting to question whether or not we would actually go. In fact, we became known as the Eveready Team, we keep going and going, but had yet to leave.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>T</font>he next day we convoyed back to Ramstein. Our equipment needed to be weighed and marked. Then we waited. A tent the size of a hangar was now our home, as it was to several hundred other soldiers waiting to deploy to Bosnia. Cots were set-up for sleeping, but no one really slept. The anticipation, the excitement, and the fear of the unknown all returned with their usual vigor.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>W</font>e finally heard that we were on the priority list to get to Tuzla. We were moved to an even earlier flight. Starting Christmas Eve, we loaded our equipment and personnel onto six C130 Hercules transport planes, separating the personnel so that only three or four people were on any one flight. I was scheduled on the last flight. Each flight was separated by between twenty and 120 minutes.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>I</font>t was pitch black out when I heaved my ruck sack and duffel bags onto the plane. I strapped my body armor into place, and tried to settle down for the flight. The Crew Chief threw us a box lunch, gave us a new set of earplugs, a few instructions, then said, 'good luck,' and went back to his pre-flight check list. There were a total of five passengers on the flight. Only three of us were on the surgical team. We were all packed around a Humvee and a large canister filled with our surgical equipment.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>I</font> heard the engines fire up one by one, the four turbo-props screaming as they strained, pulling the aircraft down the flight line. I could feel the plane slow for its turn onto the airstrip. There was a short pause as the engines revved, then we started rolling, speeding down the runway. As the plane pitched upwards and the tires left the ground, I knew that we were finally on our way.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>W</font>e didn't know what to expect. We didn't know where we would be. We didn't know where we were to sleep, or to set up. This was finally the unknown. What we had trained for, and secretly feared, yet secretly desired. We looked at each other silently, knowing what anxieties everyone was feeling, but because of the noise, no words were said or heard.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>T</font>he flight lasted about one hour and 45 minutes. As Bosnia approached, the aircraft went to blackout conditions. All of the lights were turned off. There was nothing to see. I could feet the pitch of the plane change as the pilot pointed its nose down. The tactical approach. To limit our visibility to whatever potential adversaries or unfriendly people might be watching. I again felt the nose of the plane pull up, just as we touched down. We were in Bosnia. The Crew Chief had the rear cargo door open as we slowed at the end of the runway. The aircraft pulled up to the download area, and as we stopped the Humvee drove off, and the lift that was to receive the large, 15 ton container, moved into place. Within a minute or two, the aircraft was empty, and started rolling down the runway to return to Germany.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>N</font>o one was there. No reporters, and no one from our team. I grabbed my radio, and called for them. "Welcome to Bosnia," the radio crackled at me. "We'll be right there." Several minutes later, one of our Hummers showed up. We threw our gear into the back and headed away from the runway.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>O</font>nly about 400 meters from the flight line, we stopped. It was 11:00 PM, Christmas Eve. I tossed my sleeping bag next to everyone else on the dirty floor of a small building, and tried to rest. We had been up for about two days, and we were tired. But we had all made it to Bosnia. I looked around at the people spread out over the floor. There was no room even to walk. Obviously absent were stockings on the wall. Santa Claus would not be coming this year.</p>

<H1 align=center>The Cottage on the Hill</h1>
<center><i>by Daniel Mansfield</i></center>

<font size=+1>
<p><dd><font size=+2>T</font>he small cottage overlooked the valley to the east, at a high enough elevation to raise it just above the level of the lignite haze which had settled over the once industrial surroundings. No one lived in the small house, constructed probably scores of years ago out of mud and straw, branches used as crossbeams, and covered with clay shingles, until about eight years ago. The old woman who moved into the cottage was 'removed' from her native village, some fifty miles to the southeast. The land was still Yugoslavia at the time, but the power belonged to the army. Moslems were being killed and run out of their homes as if their homes were nothing but temporary dwellings. She had packed what she could carry, and walked with the remnants of her family, out of the horrors of her home, and into the unknown. Trying to survive, and trying to find a better life, they ended up just outside of the town of Gradacac. There they found the cottage on the hill. It was empty, no running water, only a small outhouse for a toilet. But she set up her home there. Her daughter and her husband found a place just down the hill from the cottage. They moved in with the two grandchildren.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>T</font>hen the war broke out, and her son in law was killed. The valley was virtually destroyed, burned, mined, and mortared. More homeless people, and more dead people. This was an area that was far from peace. But in December, half of a world away, a piece of paper was signed, and the building of peace was underway.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>T</font>he tenuous peace has held, so far, and many of the people who had been previously displaced, are trying to rebuild shattered lives. The US troops, as part of the NATO Implementation Force, have moved into the area. The old tobacco factory that had been bombed out and burned, has become home to a force of almost 500 soldiers, including a medical holding company, and a forward surgical team. There is also a helicopter landing pad, created not far from the little cottage on the hill.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>D</font>uring a med-evac mission, one of the Apache guard helicopters hovered over the little house of mud and straw, and like the Wolf who terrorized the little pigs, huffed and puffed and blew off the shingled roof. The old lady, the queen of her cottage which had been built with sticks and mud and straw, was terrified. Her tenuous world had come crashing down in a cloud of dust and dirt and broken clay shingles. The army, of course, apologized gently through the words of interpreters, but that didn't repair the roof or keep the rain and snow out. She knew it wasn't on purpose that the helicopters had created the tornadic winds that had brought down her small home. She wasn't there to blame. She just wanted to have a roof over her head. Just like she wanted to be able to live in peace. She was, after all, old and tired, and had seen enough of war.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>T</font>he members of the 67th Forward Surgical Team, normally stoppers of bleeding, and repairers of broken bodies, gathered together. Today the doctors, nurses, and medics were to become carpenters, engineers, and roofers. A roof needed to be built, and we figured that if we could fix people, we ought to be able to fix a roof. We were obviously just a little bit delusional. Wood was located, and with the local command group nodding, sort of smiling, and gently averting their eyes from our activities, was hidden away for special use for repairing a roof that had blown off by a new kind of big, bad wolf.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>T</font>he newly appointed carpenters wandered just outside of the north gate of the compound and turned west to walk up the hill. A dirt trail led from the muddy road, through a field of cut corn, and ascended jaggedly up the slope to the cottage on the hill. The Moslem lady appeared to be well into her elder years, though the age on her face and lines on her skin could easily have been caused by the hardness of her existence. She greeted them without a smile or a frown, but with the expectation that soon she would have a roof. She stood in the doorway, looking out on the varied military entourage, like the broken queen of her shattered castle. Quietly, and without ceremony, she pulled from a hidden front pocket in her torn and dirty skirt a small silver tobacco holder, and deftly rolled herself a cigarette. A thick, heavily gnawed cigarette holder was gently placed on the end of her creation, and fire applied ceremoniously onto the other end. She relished the gentle draws, and let the heavy smoke meander its way out from between her thick, cracked lips.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>T</font>he team divided up functionally. I went back down the hill to a borrowed table saw, and began the process of taking rough boards, and cutting them into roofing slats. Several others started gathering the broken roof tiles that were scattered around her house, salvaging what could be salvaged, and then placing them in piles. Our carpenter, a surgeon under normal circumstances, climbed the roof with the anesthetist, and started taking inventory on what needed to be done, and how long to cut the boards. The measurements were radioed down to me, waiting patiently at the saw. As the lengths, widths, and breadths were given, the boards were cut and then carried on our backs up the dirt trail to the house.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>T</font>he fresh wood brought the semblance of a smile to her face. After all, the house was constructed of mud and straw, with slats had been made up of largish sticks, none of them straight. These new boards were truly going modernize her home.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>S</font>he, the queen, observed the production with heavy interest. Her cheeks, pouching out with overly generous jowls, were lined with worry, and tan with exposure. Most of her teeth were gone, with the exception of one or two seemingly awkwardly placed yellowish tusks, lined with brown, and rarely ever shown. Her upper and lower lips caved in around them, giving her face a sort of squashed, or sunken in appearance. Yet her eyes were bright, and anxious to take in all the new activity around her. She was going to watch the building process. She placed herself in charge, gesturing, and pointing, and discussing the procedures and progress with our translator.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>T</font>he building improved as she watched. New slats were laid, and the form of a new roof emerged from the rubble. The poles, or branches that had made up the majority of the structure were blackened by the long action of wood fires built in the small stove which heated the diminutive cottage. There were only two rooms, and the stove was in the first. As some of the branches were replaced, the walls of the house itself shuddered, and threatened themselves to give way. But they fortunately held. Should one of those walls have fallen, we would have been better off building an entirely new house, and none of us even wanted to think about that possibility.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>T</font>here was a brief moment that nearly stopped our hearts. I was crouched outside of the house measuring plastic to replace a broken window, when I heard the telltale signs of an impending avalanche. There was a brief clattering of small stones, followed by a roar of noise. I dared not look up, as I was directly beneath the eves. I was afraid that the tiles that were being placed were cascading downwards, towards my very location. The cacophony lasted only fractions of a second, but it seemed like minutes. I hunched my back, and gripped my Kevlar helmet tight to my head, bracing for the shock. Visions of the headlines passed in front of my eyes. Surgeon Killed While Repairing Roof or the more macabre Surgeon Tiled to Death. I waited for the impact, trying to be ready for the pain, but it never came. One of my friends had fallen through the ceiling into the front room of the cottage. He had caught himself halfway down, and retrospectively, appeared comical, with his legs dangling in mid-air in the house, and his arms grasping for a firm hold on the roof. He finally was able to pull himself up, nothing but his pride injured. Now we had another project to add to the list. Now we had to fix a man sized hole in the ceiling.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>F</font>rom below, her daughter and grandchildren watched the progress, and seemed pleased that there were people to help. The little boy, who was four years old, held on to a tattered copy of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. His sister, who was twelve, cautiously guided him around the yard, shepherding him away from any potential danger. He calmly accepted her guidance. I knelt down by them. 1, in my battle dress uniform, helmet, and pistol, was trying to build a friendship. I offered Juicy Fruit gum, and they cautiously came forward to accept their treat. The friendship was on the way. Surprisingly, the girl thanked me in English, although she would not converse further despite my efforts. My meager attempts at speaking in Serbian were to no avail. They pocketed the gum, and backed off a couple of feet to a safe distance.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>S</font>hingles began to be handed up to the two men on the roof and were carefully laid into place. The chimney had to be rebuilt, and parts from an old army pot-bellied stove were used to fill in the empty spaces. It started to look like a house again. We were able to cut a piece of plywood to the appropriate size and patch the ceiling. It wasn't mud and straw, but it would suffice.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>T</font>he lady, the queen of the cottage, continued to watch, and rolled another cigarette. Had she known that we were doctors and nurses and medics, I'm not sure that she would have wanted our help. But there we were, trying to build a roof for an old lady we didn't even know, carefully piecing together the broken remnants of what was once a home, unfortunately located in a fractured country, reluctantly and uneasily at peace.</p></font>

<h1 align=center>Planting the Seeds</h1>
<center><i>by Daniel Mansfield</i></center>
<font size=+1>

<p><dd><font size=+2>T</font>hey needed another surgeon at the 212th MASH, and my number came up. I was to fly down to Camp Bedrock, so named for its location atop an old strip mine, where the MASH set up amidst discarded tires, mud and rock. It is not far from Tuzla, and lies within the Tuzla valley. It would be kind of like going home, to where Christmas was almost remembered this last year by those of us on the ground, surrounded by the smells of diesel fumes, dust, and fear. I wasn't anxious to get back, but I could feel the distant connection to the place where I had started out in Bosnia in what seemed like a lifetime ago.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>T</font>he bird was a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter rigged for medical evacuation with a central carousel for patient transport, the right rear door covering the boom of the jungle penetrator, orange, like an upside down traffic pylon, suspended by its mount and winch assembly. This same jungle penetrator was to rescue three injured soldiers, and deliver three other soldiers from a mine field several days after my arrival at the MASH.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>I</font> had befriended the fly guys, the pilots and crew chiefs of the MedEvac unit, and was hoping to get a good seat on the chopper. I wanted to see the country. Because of a series of rules called Force Protection, we are not able to get out and about without a great deal of effort. The Americans are pretty much locked down into their respective camps, whereas the other forces are given much more freedom. I lucked out, and got a seat on the outside, aft position. I would have a good view, if there was anything to see.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>T</font>he day we left was slightly overcast, with the ever present sulfuric haze of the burning lignite settling into the low areas. I strapped myself in, and waited for the flight checks to be completed. I could hear the auxiliary power unit running as each system was carefully examined by computer, and then checked again by pilot. When the thumbs up signal was given, the main turbine was engaged, and the jet engine started its wailing as it began to turn the four main rotor blades. The whine of the engine increased as the blades spun faster and faster. The aircraft shook with its effort, trying to lurch into the sky, beating the surrounding air into submission, the pilots calmly taming its fury. As he pulled on the collective, we heaved into the sky, and danced laterally, into our air corridor, like an obscenely obese dragonfly, picking its way through the weeds and stems of the swamp, the antennae and smokestacks of the factories trying to impede our progress.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>A</font>s we passed over the old tobacco factory that I called home, I could finally appreciate the amount of damage to the facility in which I lived. The roof had been blown out in many areas, and the strafing tracks of automatic weapons scarred the buildings like mouse tracks across the snow. As we rose over the man made obstructions and approached the fields, I could see the effect of the rotor wash, gently licking the underlying grass in circular motions, caressing the ground roughly enough to kick up the ever present dust.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>H</font>alted in mid track, a supply train had been paralyzed by the war probably a couple of years ago. One could see the many wounds on its iron skin. Which was the fatal blow was difficult to discern. It laid there quietly in the middle of the fields, still, appearing crispy as an earthworm that had attempted to enjoy the rain, but that had gotten trapped by the sun. We circled it twice to fully examine the wreckage, and then turned away towards the hills.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>T</font>here were several small outlying towns to the west and south of Gradacac. As we approached from the air, one could readily see the stillness of the area. The buildings had been razed. Roofs were absent from most of the buildings. Haphazardly placed piles of bricks and cement blocks were all that represented any clean-up effort, or rebuilding effort for that matter. I had been told by our translators that the area was primarily Muslim, and that the Serbs had destroyed whatever they could of the Muslim people, or their meager possessions. In several places, homes were untouched, but surrounded by others that had been destroyed. The houses that remained standing whole had been owned by the Serbs. So the apparently random violence that had brought so many of the buildings and houses to ruin, was really not so random after all, but carefully planned and executed egocentric cultural destruction. In fact, some of the destruction didn't even take place during the war, so to speak, but afterwards, when the Zone of Separation was identified in the Dayton Peace Accord, and the repatriation of the political, cultural, and religious refugees was imminent. Their return, although a relatively small and insignificant victory, was to be an empty victory. Their homes were gone. Their possessions stolen. And their security raped.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>W</font>e flew on.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>A</font>s I looked down over the Zone of Separation, that area separating the Serbs from the Muslims, separating the orthodox Christians from the non-Christians, it became more and more obvious that this was one land. There were no lines separating factions of people who feel that they are different from others living just down the road. All of that was just a man-made artifice decided by people with ulterior motives. But from the air, seeing the view that the falcon sees, this was all one land, budding trees, green grass, and flowing rivers, without borders.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>T</font>he soft rolling, gentle hills of northern Bosnia were blanketed by some sort of small purple flower, perhaps a phlox, draped appropriately over the hills like a regal funeral shroud. Interruptions in the violet mist were haphazardly placed fields of a brownish, reddish loam; small, perhaps only an acre or two, but busy with families working the soil. Single -bladed plows were pulled by draft horses and steered by the women, or the sons who still remained after the war. The families in the fields lent an unusual speckling of color to the almost colorless dirt and surrounding brown grass. Rocks overturned were removed by others, children dressed in bright yellow and red. There was a noticeable absence of young men, the slack being taken up by grandfathers and preteen boys, daughters and mothers. The fathers had secretly and mysteriously disappeared over the last several years. Most of them have never returned.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>T</font>he horses, or sometimes, cows were harnessed to the plow or makeshift cultivator by a single long leafless branch, probably taken from the adjacent woods. This was then attached to the implement, and then harnessed to the animal in such a way that it necessitated an asymmetric pull, forcing the horse or cow to walk at an angle in order to pull the blade through the earth. Luckily for the beast of burden, the fields were small.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>T</font>he people would hear us coming, the forced beating of the hazy air signaling our passing, and halt their work. As they gazed up and recognized our markings, they would wave. Knowing that they couldn't see me, I would wave back, my friendly gesture lost to the sky, but nevertheless warming my heart. Through the binoculars that I carry with me. I could appreciate their faces. The tanned skin of long exposure to the elements was cracked by the lines of worry, and fear; and sometimes cracked with smiles. They seemed glad to see us; happy we were there, relieved by a pause in the hundreds of years of hostility. Their eyes seemed tired, perhaps vacant. Similar to what we refer to as the thousand yard stare. Probably tired of the war, and tired of the fear, and tired of the loss and uncertainty, and tired of the pain. As we passed, they would turn back to the horse, or the cow, and start the next row with the single -bladed plow. Preparing to plant the seeds of a new crop, and of a new life.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>T</font>uzla approached. One could see through the greenish, yellowish haze being vomited forth by the burning lignite, that sulfurous soft coal so commonly found in the prior eastern block countries, one of the largest coal-fired power plants in Bosnia. The adjacent hills of unburned lignite, the mounds of waste, marked by cicatricial railroad tracks and the several towering smokestacks belching forth their venomous fumes, marked the land like a huge, hairy mole on the face of a beauty. I knew that we were close to Camp Bedrock, the home of the 212th MASH.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>A</font>nd then I saw it. A completely deforested, defoliated mound of slag. This must be Bedrock. We started to circle, and I could see rows of tents on top of the mound. An engineer battalion and the MASH were located on top of this barren bunch of rocks. To the north, the quarry continued. An opalescent, jewel of a lake had filled into one of the deep pits, and was the only source of color other than brown. We banked, and continued around the slag heap. I could see the landing pad, built on a small outcropping of the rock, and lined with sandbags. As the bird slowed down and the nose pitched upwards, we prepared to land. The landing gear softly touched the sandbags, and the Blackhawk settled down. The doors opened to the side, and I grabbed my gear, and slid out into the noisy rotor wash, squinting to keep the dust out of my eyes. I circled around to the front, eyed the pilots, mouthed my thank-yous and returned their salute. Then I backed off, and watched as they pulled on the collective. Kicking up a dust storm, the UH-60 Blackhawk lifted into the air, backed up slightly, then turned and sped away. They had delivered their package.</p>

<p><dd><font size=+2>A</font>s I gathered my gear and looked around that desolate hill of stone trying to get my bearings, I thought about the flight. There were no borders from the air. The leaves on the trees, the budding blossoms of the orchards, and the people working the land were symbols of spring, planting the seeds of their future.</p>

<h2 align=center>Certificate of Authenticity</h2>

<p>
This is to certify that the Pinocchio cel pictured above, smoking the infamous cigar, is an original hand-inked and hand-painted cel from the Walt Disney Co.  It is a cel made during the production of the 1940 Disney masterpiece Pinocchio and is one of the following:
<ul>
<li>a production cel cut from the final film;
<li>a publicity cel used for same at time of the film's original release;
<li>a color model cel used by animators, inkers and painters as an example of the way he should look.
</ul>

We have reached this conclusion based on the celluloid, the ink, the paint, and his size ( as he is <i>very</i> close to the Pinocchio in the film).
</p>
<p>
The <i>almost identical</i> image can be seen in the film in <i>the first few seconds</i> of the scene in the pool hall on Pleasure Island.  The camera pans in through the pool hall door to view Lampwick and Pinocchio as they are seen smoking cigars.  Pinocchio settles into an easy chair to puff away on his new object of pleasure.
</p>
<p>
He is in fairly good condition for someone of his age. We have rehydrated some of the original paint on the cel thus leaving any other restoration an option for the new owner. We feel restoration is not necessary but we will absorb any costs and handle any additional restoration oif so desired.  He has been in a private collection since his original purchase many years ago and is still on it's typical Courvoisier background with the shadowing and cigar smoke actually appearing on the cel!
</p>
<p>
The cel is trimmed and measures 7 1/4" x 9 1/4" with three partial peg holes still visible at the very bottom of the celluloid.

cigars either fall in the cracks or overlap size designations and may be labelled differently from what you're accustomed in the interest of simplifying the "Search" program.

<h1 align=center>The Cigar-Label Art<br> 
Visual Encyclopedia, Volume 1</h1>
<hr>


<font size=+1>
<ul>
<li>Tired of not knowing the correct name of a label? What does a label look like before you buy it? What labels are available? This first encyclopedia and following volumes will allow you to focus on labels and subjects you really like.<p>

<li>Volume 1 is the first volume in a continuing series to visually show Cigar-Label Art in glorious color.<p>
<IMG ALIGN="right" HSPACE="10" SRC="/cigar/accessories/gazette/encycvr.jpg">

<li>Volume 1 illustrates commercially available inner, outer, stock, and untitled labels.  Labels that new collectors can purchase. Publication allows identification and correctly names many "No Name" and Untitled labels. Untitled labels have the most variations in their descriptions, and cause confusion to the collectors.<p>

<li>The next most confusing are the European or foreign labels. Volume I illustrates hundreds of European and foreign labels. Inner labels are shown where the name is unknown unless you have the matching outer label. European lithographer's numbers are listed where available and referenced to price guide.<p>

<li>All labels use the new (DB) Dunn & Barnes numbering system for easy reference and positive identification. All labels are alphabetically organized and indexed to the price guide.<p>

<li>Additionally, labels are indexed numerically and by genre.<p>

<li>Over 954 color illustrations showing Inner, Outer, Untitled, Stock, and European Cigar-Label Art. For variety and interest many rare labels are illustrated.<p>

<li>Volumes I & II (Volume II available in near future) are designed to eliminate collector confusion. Many labels featured are available from dealers.
Volumes I & II will illustrate about 95% of all labels commonly stocked by major dealers.<p>

<H1>"Our Kitties" Topwraps Are Really Inners</H1>

<IMG ALIGN="right" HSPACE="10" SRC="/cigar/accessories/gazette/ourkit1.jpg">
<font size=+2>S</font>teven Gilbert sent the above photos to clarify the Our Kitties
issue. I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw the photos. I have always assumed if a label showed wood grain then it is a wood or top . Just as the English language is riddled with exceptions, so are placement rules on cigar boxes. As you see in the photos above, the inner label is a wood grain label. Also, with this box there is no top wrap. The top is branded with the cigar name and some decoration. In this case, however, there is a common wood theme on the front, ends, and the inner. So, the only logical conclusion is the box was designed to look like wood from the start.

<IMG ALIGN="left" HSPACE="10" SRC="/cigar/accessories/gazette/ourkit2.jpg">

<font size=+2>I</font> have also seen cigar boxes where the inner label doesn't match the outer. In this case the manufacture probably ran out of the correct outer and made "do" with whatever was available. If you discover exceptions or interesting properties about cigar labels please write the Gazette.

<H1>The Treasure Hunt</H1>

<i>by Kay Chambers</i>
</center>
<hr size=3 width="80%" >
<FONT SIZE=+1>
<p>

<font size=+2>C</font>igar label collecting recently took us on a treasure hunt throughout Tennessee and Kentucky.  Having fruitlessly searched through literally hundreds of shops for labels, I again considered the paradox of this collection.  The availability of labels from sources other than the major wholesalers is slim and shopping with the big dealers where one can quickly and easily build a collection reduces the thrill of the search.  However, we were fortunate to experience some enriching encounters.
</p>
<p>
<IMG VSPACE="10" ALIGN="right" HSPACE="10" SRC="/cigar/accessories/gazette/treasur1sm.jpg">
</IMG><font size=+2>W</font>e accidentally ran into the Museum of Tobacco Art and History in downtown Nashville, Tennessee and were welcomed by the Curator, David Wright.  David is extremely hospitable and helpful.  He personally escorted us on a tour of the museum and extended an invitation to the cigar label collectors to visit.  The museum was founded to reflect the role of tobacco in the economic and social development of the United States and other  countries around the world.  It is a public service of the United States Tobacco Manufacturing Company Inc.
</p>

<p>
<IMG VSPACE="10" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="10" SRC="/cigar/accessories/gazette/treasur2sm.jpg">
</IMG>
<font size=+2>T</font>he museum's collection traces the history of tobacco through art and antiques.  Cigar labels are not forgotten, however very few were on display.  Madame Butterfly was the most impressive.  The gift shop features several framed reproduced labels including Round Up priced at $12.95 each.  Tony Hyman's book is available at $15.00 and there are a few remaining copies of Joe Davidson's book priced at $69.95.
</p>


<p>
<IMG VSPACE="10" ALIGN="right" HSPACE="10" SRC="/cigar/accessories/gazette/treasur3sm.jpg">
</IMG>
<font size=+2>V</font>isiting this museum certainly encourages crossover collecting.  The exhibit of pipe tampers is worth the trip alone.  I am certain many of us have passed by figural tampers thinking they were mini statues that would not stand straight.  The most intriguing item on display was the smoking chair, circa 1890.  And again, I suspect some of us have passed by these delightful little Victorian chairs not realizing the back houses a secret compartment to hold cigars and other smoking paraphernalia.  The smoker would don his elaborately embroidered smoking jacket and hat (usually a handworked gift of love from wife, mother or sweetheart) and then straddle the chair, extract the cigar or pipe from the compartment and finally relax with his arms on the back while enjoying his smoke! 
</p>
 <p>
<font size=+2>F</font>or those of you who would like more information about the museum or gift shop, I encourage you to contact David Wright, Curator, at the Museum of Tobacco Art and History, 800 Harrison Street, Nashville, TN 37203

<H1>Auction Tips</H1>

<i>by Ed Barnes</i>
</center>

<hr size=3 width="80%" >
<FONT SIZE=+1>
<p>
<font size=+2>F</font>irst, there are no set rules for auctions. You must be able to think on your feet and adapt to change. Auctions are fun, frustrating, confusing, and they may make you mad. However, some of the best labels in my collection came from auctions. I have "lost" out on some fine labels too. My only satisfaction is the other guy didn't "steal" it at a low price. The nice thing about mail and phone auctions is you don't know who are the other bidders. Otherwise, many of us would have no friends.
</p>
<ol>
<p>
<li><b>Research The Auction</b> - if you are serious then buy and study the auction materials. How are you going to know what to bid on? Also, I find the printed catalog a valuable reference. I keep all of the auction materials together for easy access.
</p>
<p>
<li><b>Ask Questions</b> - The only bad question is the un-asked question. Please ask questions early. Don't wait until the last day and expect an answer. The auctioneer will be too busy on the last day for questions.
</p>
<p>
<li><b>Prepare Early</b> - Don't wait until the last minute to get a bidder number. Many auctions require you to establish yourself as a bidder several days or weeks in advance.
</p>
<p>
<li><b>Think About Your Bids</b> - It may pay not to get yourself into a bidding war too early.
</p>
<p>
<li><b>Set Priorities</b> - Make a list of what labels you want to bid on. Rank the lots in the order of importance. As the prices go up, you will be better prepared for the difficult decisions. This priority list will help you think on your feet when the bidding intensifies on the last day.
</p>
<p>
<li><b>Up To's</b> - Time is an advantage in phone auctions. Unless you have lots of money or cannot call back you should avoid upto's. Upto's allow for quick increases in the lot price.
</p>
<p>
<li><b>Know The Auction Rules</b> - Auctions are different and have different rules for various reasons. Read the rules several times and have them available for reference.
</p>
<p>
<li><b>Accounting</b> - Keep a list of what you bid on and the prices. This saves time when you are on the phone.
</p>
<p>
<LI><B>The Plague</B> - Don't get auction fever. Your emotions will cost you money.
</p>
<p>
<LI><B>Problems</B> - Notify the auction promptly if you have a problem with a lot. You should study the video or catalog carefully. Many times the condition of a label is described or observable from the auction materials.
</p>
<p>
<LI><B>Digging Your Grave</B> - Many times the "value" of a label is established at auction. Therefore, if you bid up a label and loose, you may have to pay a higher price later.
</p>
<p>
<LI><B>Don't be Afraid</B> - If you have the money and you want the label then by all means bid on it. You may never see the label again.
</p>
<p>
<LI><B>Set A Budget</B> - If you set a budget then there will be no suprises when the bill comes.
</p>
<p>
<LI><B>Factor All of the Costs</B> - Some auctions add commisions, insurance, and shipping charges. Don't let this scare you away. Many auctions add fees.
</p>
<p>
<LI><B>Have Fun!</B> - Auction are fun and exciting.
</p>
</ol>
<p>
<font size=+1>I</font>n conclusion, the above tips are to get you thinking. Think of an auction as a battle. You are fighting with money and the winner gets the prize!

<H1>Blowing Smoke</H1>
<i>By Chris Garcia</i>
</CENTER>
<hr size=3 width="80%">
<font size =+1>
<p><font size=+2>I</font> am intrigued with the recent popularity of cigar smoking. Just what in the name of Swisher Sweet is going on here? Not long ago, <i>Robb Report</i><img width=4 src="http://www.planet-texas.com/lib/spacers/clear.gif"> addressed the matter and ranked its top cigar in a "best of" edition. Pappas Bros. Steakhouse, Morton's Steakhouse and other fine culinary establishments in Houston not only provide smoking areas, they encourage it. And most perplexing to me is that it's no longer gender biased; it is perfectly acceptable for ladies to light up. Cool, in fact.</p>

<p><font size=+2>T</font>his trend is especially interesting to me because I've been fascinated with cigars since the age of 10, when I liberated one from my Dad's desk drawer and smoked it behind the bushes in the backyard with my older brother Dave. All I can remember about that cigar was that it was dry, green and becoming increasingly unraveled. And, by the time we ditched it, so were we.</p>

<p><font size=+2>W</font>ell, cigar smoking has come a long way; it's no longer relegated to behind the bushes. Men from every demographic profile are smoking them faster than they can be rolled. And that's only half the story.</p>

<p><font size=+2>W</font>hen I asked Patricia Mailler Smith, of Alfred Dunhill, to describe her customers, she said, "That's easy. It's everybody; it's men and women. It's guys coming in with their friends, their fathers and even their grandfathers. And one in every ten customers is female."</p>

<img src="poolchickie1.jpg" hspace=10 align=right><p><font size=+2>T</font>he female demographic profile is a bit more specific than its male counterpart, "It's mostly professional women in their 30s and 40s," according to Candy Coley, founder of Society Demimonde, an exclusively female cigar club. She also offers her insight into why women are smoking them. "Women are being introduced to something they've never tried. It gives them something in common with men. And, more importantly, it forces them to slow down, relax and enjoy the moment."</p>

<p><font size=+2>A</font> more candid assessment of this phenomenon came from a college English professor who requested that I withhold her name. "Oh, sure, the glass ceiling still exists, and we have to put up with a lot of sophomoric nonsense, mostly from men past 50, but, over the last millennium or so, we have made some small social progress. Let's see - we can vote, become doctors, lawyers or Indian chiefs, wear pants, we can drive sports cars, we can even participate in sports and, when the men won't let us join their teams, we just form our own. The sexual revolution is old news, and we have our own bank accounts and all the necessary plastic.</p>

<p><font size=+2>"Y</font>et, there remains that last vestige of male-dominated rituals: cigar smoking. Granted, it's been awhile since the men left the dinner table and retired to the library to enjoy their brandy and cigars and discuss important matters, leaving us womenfolk to gossip and quilt. But, customs haven't changed all that much and, damn it, we want to go to the library, too!"</p>

<p><font size=+2>T</font>his brought it all into perspective for me. While both men and women will protest that they simply enjoy the rich, full flavor of a fine cigar, I see deeper implications. Cigars are the bathtub gin of the '90s. They represent the antithesis of everything we have come to regard as healthy and socially acceptable.</p>

<p><font size=+2>M</font>en want to be like their fathers, to feel masculine and powerful; they want to go back to the library. Women just want to blow smoke at us literally and figuratively. They want to be rebellious; they want to be the flappers of the '90s. It's no fun to smoke cigars at home (and ruin the upholstery and draperies); they want to be seen in all the fashionable speakeasies, daring and cutting edge.</p>

<p><font size=+2>W</font>ell, that's just my take on the situation; your motives may be totally different. And, for those of you who want to join the ranks of cigar smokers, I have compiled the following information on the best places to buy cigars, how to select the perfect cigar for you, cost, cool accessories and the "in" places to go and enjoy your newly acquired passion.</p>

<img src="humidor1.jpg" hspace=10 align=left><p><font size=+2>N</font>ow, there are all kinds of rules of etiquette and subtle nuances involved in smoking a cigar properly. There's the selection, the grip, the clip, the light, the draw, etc., that if performed improperly will leave you looking like Barney Fife. And, the idea here is to look like Bond. James Bond. So I embarked on a journey to introduce myself to the finer points of cigars from the selection to the final puff.</p>

<p><font size=+2>F</font>irst, some tips on where to shop for your cigar and how to select one you will enjoy. Moving across town from west to east, I found that Cigars, Pipes & More on Memorial Drive, Jeffrey Stone, Ltd. on Westheimer (with location #2 under construction), Alfred Dunhill's in The Galleria, <a href="http://briar-shoppe.cigar.com">The Briar Shoppe</a> in The Village and <a href="http://mccoys.cigar.com">McCoy's Fine Cigars</a> downtown to be the most impressive of the shops I visited.</p>

<p><font size=+2>A</font>lthough they all have large inventories of cigars, pipes and accessories, each has something unique to offer. At Cigars, Pipes & More, you'll find a nice smoking lounge upstairs where you can sit and relax while smoking your cigar and reading a magazine.</p>

<p><font size=+2>J</font>effrey Stone has been in the cigar business in Houston since 1978, and has a truly elegant store featuring exclusive Davidoff Cigars. The Briar Shoppe is the largest of the four stores and carries a wide assortment of accessories, including a wine boutique and a selection of cigar-friendly liquors. McCoy's offers a homey, country store atmosphere that attracts all walks of life.</p>

<p><font size=+2>W</font>hat is most impressive about each of these shops, and what they all have in common, are employees with a passion for their work and an eagerness to educate their customers. An unexpected and refreshing shopping experience.</p>

<p><font size=+2>A</font>s you shop these stores, ask as many questions as you want, or let them know it's your first time out - they'll probably suspect that anyway. Most of the people who walk through their doors are in the early stages of the learning curve and will be asking questions also.</p>

<p><font size=+2>U</font>pon entering the humidor, a climate-controlled room behind a glass door, you may be instantly overwhelmed by the selection. After all, fine handmade cigars are available in over 60 
<a href="http://www.cigar.com/faq/size">sizes</a>. Don't let that daunt you; just remember that the only dimensions to keep in mind are length (usually in inches) and ring gauge, the circumference measured in 64ths of an inch. For example, a cigar with a ring gauge of 50 will measure 50/64ths of an inch in diameter. Typical cigars range between 4 1/2 to 7 inches in length, with a ring gauge between 34 and 50. The longer, larger ring gauge cigars offer a cooler, longer smoke.</p>

<p><font size=+2>B</font>ut, don't worry about remembering all this; for the details on sizes, blends, construction and the different regions where the tobaccos are grown, just pick up a copy of <i>Cigar Aficionado's Pocket Guide</i><img width=4 src="http://www.planet-texas.com/lib/spacers/clear.gif"> and read it as you browse through the humidor. While you're at it, pick up a copy of <i>Nat Sherman's Guide to Complete Cigar Enjoyment</i><img width=4 src="http://www.planet-texas.com/lib/spacers/clear.gif"> and 
<a href="http://consolidated.cigar.com/judge">How To Judge A Good Cigar</a>, by 
<a href="http://consolidated.cigar.com/judge/#Schielein_bio">Henry Shielein</a> and 
<a href="http://consolidated.cigar.com/judge/#Dimeola_bio">Richard DiMeola</a>. 
All three are pamphlet sized, a quick read and contain excellent information for those who want a brief lesson in cigars.</p>

<p><font size=+2>B</font>efore you make your purchase, keep in mind that selecting a cigar is an individual choice. Although certain types of cigars are considered best when smoked with certain drinks or followed by certain foods, you really can't make a fundamental error. You will, however, have four criteria to help you decide: draw, length of time, flavor and price.</p>

<p><font size=+2>O</font>ne of your first inclinations, after walking around the humidor and being enveloped in the aroma, will be to pick up a cigar and smell it. It's practically an irresistible urge, and a quick sniff is probably okay. Just don't touch it to your nose; it's not good cigar etiquette.</p>

<p><font size=+2>H</font>old the cigar between your thumb and index finger and gently roll the cigar to compare different rolls (rent the movie Gigi for a graphic demo). A looser roll means an easier draw and a quicker burn. If you don't know whether you prefer a looser draw to a stiffer draw, try one of each. Remember, this is a completely individual choice.</p>

<p><font size=+2>N</font>ext, how much time do you have to savor your cigar? Depending upon length and ring gauge, a cigar will give you anywhere from thirty minutes to an hour and a half smoking pleasure.</p>

<p><font size=+2>A</font>s far as selecting by taste, you'll find that choosing a fine cigar is much like selecting a fine wine. The two share many similarities in their preparation and, for your first cigar, you may want to try one that matches your wine preference. For example, if you prefer full-bodied cabernets, request a full-bodied cigar. Conversely, if you prefer a lighter wine, request a lighter smoke. If you don't drink wine, your coffee preference may be a good indicator for your first time out. Some people prefer a dark, full-bodied Columbian roast and others may prefer a lighter blend. If you prefer your coffee three hours old and your wine from a box or a screw top bottle, you're in the wrong classroom. You should be next door in Cave Dwellers: A Requiem. Now, grab a wood-tipped El Producto and hit the bricks.</p>

<p><font size=+2>A</font>s far as price ranges, it's probably best to stick to the $3-10 range until you figure out what you like. Most of the ones I tried hovered around $6. Some people think that spending that kind of money for a single smoke is reason for having your head examined. I'm telling you that this is therapy.</p>

<p><font size=+2>A</font>fter you have an idea what you want, ask the knowledgeable proprietor for some suggestions. Again, these folks truly enjoy this process. Ask them to show you how to clip the cigar and the proper way to light it. Also, ask them to show you the difference between the V cut and the guillotine cut. Different cuts make the draw and overall smoke different. A decent cutter will cost around $25. It's permissible to light up in the store so, if you have time, go ahead.</p>

<p><font size=+2>W</font>hen you do light up, make sure you use the proper apparatus. Lighters are like expensive jewelry and look so appealing they almost make you want to smoke. There is a wide assortment of clips and lighters available and, as you might suspect, they are always eager to introduce them to you. Although Zippo makes a great lighter with a good sized flame, avoid using a fluid lighter for cigars. Unlike cigarettes, which may contain over 130 chemical preservatives, cigars are pure tobacco. Apparently the odor from the fluid can change the taste of the cigar as it passes through the tobacco when you light it. Wooden matches or butane lighters are best. Wooden matches are actually best, but make sure you allow the sulfur to burn off before putting the flame to your cigar. As for butane lighters, might I suggest the Dunhill double flame. This lighter employs two flames side by side that create one wide flame, and is designed specifically to light cigars. It retails for $450. When the cigar is lit, might I also suggest that you ask the nice salesperson to put the lighter back in its display case.</p>

<p><font size=+2>O</font>kay, you have cigars and you're ready to smoke. Where to go? The first rule of thumb is to go where you are in a relaxed environment. To truly enjoy your cigar, you need elbow room and a place where the music doesn't rattle your fillings. 
The second rule is to be in a place where cigar smoking is acceptable. Restaurants are increasingly cigar-friendly, and more and more bars are advertising cigar nights. You might want to call in advance if you're not sure. Pappas Bros. Steakhouse on Westheimer features a cigar-friendly piano bar and a very respectable humidor. Behind the bar is a lounge where you can relax on a leather sofa with a magazine and a cocktail, or you can enjoy your cigar with a meal. The dark woods, red leather and low lighting offer a perfect atmosphere for the true cigar experience.</p>

<p><font size=+2>L</font>ocal watering holes also recognize the popularity of cigars; I had a big time at a cigar party at Strict-9. Owner and cigar lover Greg Walker featured a nice mix of male and female cigar enthusiasts, great music and bourbon tasting as part of the evening's entertainment. I took my younger brother and his wife and they both loved it, too. Check out Muldoon's, <a href="http://www.cigar.com/~elvis">The Velvet Elvis</a>, The Gingerman and Mathias' while you're at it.</p>

<img src="3men1.jpg" hspace=10 align=left><p><font size=+2>T</font>here are also wine tasting and cigar smoking events going on around town all the time. Call one of the above mentioned cigar shops for a schedule or call Anthony Lefferts at Cigar Connoisseurs of Texas (529-3892) or Candy Coley at Society Demimonde (789-0214). Lefferts has a cigar club for men and women, and is hosting a golf tournament at Southwick in May. Also look in the "Events" section of this magazine.</p>

<p><font size=+2>I</font>ncidentally, if you want to know how popular cigars are, where the craze started and where it's going, here's the scoop from Mike McCoy of McCoy's Fine Cigars, "From seed to smoke is roughly a 2-3 year process and production is 3-7 years behind. Prices are up, supply is low and demand is soaring."</p>

<p><font size=+2>D</font>allas Snyder, of The Briar Shoppe, summed up what seems to be the consensus concerning its origin, "In September 1992, <b><i>Cigar Aficionado</i></b><img width=4 src="http://www.planet-texas.com/lib/spacers/clear.gif"> magazine published its first issue. It was the first publication of its kind and, suddenly, veteran and rookie cigar enthusiasts had a reference to educate them on finer hand-rolled cigars. The combination of the magazine, improving economic conditions and celebrities such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, David Letterman and Alec Baldwin stepping out publicly with cigars in hand all contributed to the renewed interest."</p>

<p><font size=+2>M</font>cCoy offers an additional spin, "Smoking cigars is rebellious. Think about it. What were the three big taboos of the eighties? Beef, caffeine and tobacco. What's popular now? Steakhouses, coffee and cigars. People decided they wanted a better quality of life, but in moderation."</p>

<p><font size=+2>I</font>t doesn't look like the trend is going away any time soon, either. All of the proprietors I spoke with felt confident that cigar smoking was going to gain momentum well into the turn of the century. Walker, of Strict-9, is preparing right now by opening a cigar lounge in early summer called Sikar.</p>

<p><font size=+2>Y</font>es, cigars are back and I'm glad. For some, they never left. How about Clint Eastwood and his panatella, Jiminy Cricket decked out in tux and spats, or the late George Burns who smoked cigars since velociraptors were a menace?</p>
 
<p><font size=+2>E</font>ven if you've just figured out that a humidor isn't a bull fighter, I hope you learned something. And, even if you don't smoke, maybe you will have a better understanding of and tolerance for those who do.</p>

<p><font size=+2>R</font>udyard Kipling was quoted as saying, "A woman is just a woman, but a good cigar is a smoke." He obviously spent too much time in the jungle and not enough time in Texas, but I think I understand his passion for cigars.</p>

<p><font size=+2>Y</font>es, there's something rebellious about smoking a cigar, but there's also an element of nostalgia for me. It's like bringing something good back from the past. Sometimes, when I smoke, I feel like rounding up my brother and just hangin' out.</p>

<H2>Welcome!</H2>

<P>

Whether you are a veteran or a rookie of our graceful yet gaudy

establishment, we hope you continue to enjoy our friendly staff,

eclectic decor, top notch entertainment and fine selection

of food and beverages. We proudly present Happy Hour from 4pm

until 7:30pm daily, and our Grill is open from 11am until 10pm

daily. Both foods and beverages may be enjoyed on our cool

courtyard -- the best inside the loop!

<P>

The <B>Velvet Elvis</B> offers 25 single malt scotches and nine small batch

bourbons. It is also well know as the home of Houston's original

Cigar Bar. If you haven't yet had the opportunity, try one of our

Tuesday evening Smokers. And if you are a true cigar connoisseur,

inquire about joining our 

<A HREF="/~fez"><B>Velvet Fez Cigar and Pleasure Club</B></A> (meets the last

Tuesday of every month).

<P>

At the <B>V.E.</B>, we'll use any excuse for a party. Watch the event listing

for the next big bash. As the next best thing to the Summit (and also

the thing best next to the Summit), there's also no better place to

catch sporting events than on one of our nine T.V.s (...yes, we

have Satellite!). In addition to these many attractions, we also have

the world's best patrons. So, enjoy our crib, and return often to our

cozy social retreat...our temple...our King of Dives!

<P>The cigars are all tobacco -- natural leaf wrapper. They have absolutely

<B><I>no paper</I> products or homogenized binders of any kind. </B>They

consist of the finest combination of Honduran, Nicaraguan, and domestic

tobaccos. They are wrapped in Connecticut Shade and Broadleaf wrappers,

the finest in the world. After you light one of these up, you would swear

you were smoking a hand rolled imported cigar. That's the point; our cigars

have all the flavor, aroma and quality tobacco of a premium handmade cigar

without the high price. So, go ahead, enjoy one of these fine cigars today!<B>

<P>The Cigar Baron also offers an excellent selection of hand made imported
cigars. All are long filler and are made of the finest tobaccos. Please
take the time to browse through our fine cigars. We will ship you individual
cigars or by the box. <B><FONT COLOR="#800040">We are happy to offer you
the ability to order individual cigars</FONT></B>. Sometimes you just don't
want to order an entire box of cigars, but rather you would like to sample
one or two cigars from different companies. Go ahead, order some cigars
today, individually or by the box. Our current inventory can be found by
clicking on the links below. We will be delighted to ship them to you.

<h2 align=center>HISTORY</h2>
<p align=center><img alt="---------------------------------" src="rainban.gif"></p>

In 1992, the EPA Air and Energy Engineering Lab (AEERL) initiated a program to assist in the selection of nonpolluting industrial surface cleaning alternatives.  The objective of the program was to make the identification of cleaning options simple yet based on the latest technical and economic feasibility information available.  This objective could be most easily accomplished through the use of electronic equipment and a logic tree format.  The resulting system, called SAGE for Solvent Alternatives Guide, incorporates the speed and ability of the computer to evaluate a large number of operating parameters and conditions to identify the most viable surface cleaning option.  The first BETA test version 1.0, of SAGE was released in May of 1993 and placed on the EPA Control Technology
Center Bulletin Board for down loading and review.  Version 1.0 included only metal parts cleaning and was designed to test the SAGE concept for selecting surface cleaning alternatives.  Since its release there have been over 1000 downloads of SAGE from the CTC bulletin board and another 500
copies of the system disk has been mailed to requestors.  Many of the responses from users of the BETA test version indicate that the system in a few minutes confirmed their prior conclusions derived from many hours of study and analysis.  The report also gave many users greater insight into the technical considerations and requirements for use of the various options which were previously unknown.  The results of the responses have validated the concept used in the SAGE system.  The system has been featured in a number of trade magazines including "Product Finishing," and "The Journal of the American Electroplaters and Surface Finishers
Society."<p>

SAGE is not a database, rather a PC based logic tree system that evaluates the user's present operating scenario and then identifies possible surface cleaning alternative solvent chemistries and processes that best suits the defined operating and material requirements.  The system asks a series of questions concerning the user's existing operation such as: part size,
present processing chemistry, part cost, production rate, and contaminants.  Based on the answers provided, a number of recommended options are provided which represent the alternate cleaning chemistry and/or process most likely to succeed.  The report generated by SAGE presents the recommended options and important technical parameters.  It also provides information on environmental considerations that must be taken into account, regulations that must be addressed when using the alternative, safety requirements, economic considerations, and equipment
requirements, and other information that must be considered when implementing the recommended alternative.  Finally, the report will include examples of case studies with a similar operating scenario and requirements.<p>

SAGE is designed for use by individuals ranging from shop foremen to regulatory agency personnel, both technical and nontechnical personnel.  It requires only a 286 level machine (a 386 is recommended), DOS 3.3 (minimum), and a printer if a complete report is required.  The SAGE system is scheduled for continued upgrade through FY 95 with frequent releases of new versions during this period.  Subsequent versions will
incorporate into the system additional surface cleaning requirements such as paint stripping, electronic manufacturing, machinery, and printing equipment cleaning.  In addition a process and facility design capability, economic and cost projection capability, and a regulation summation by state may be incorporated into the system.<p>

While the final selection of a process alternative must ultimately be made by the user, SAGE will provide the user with the information needed to make that choice.  For more information on SAGE call the CTC Hotline at (919) 541-0800.<p>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> It is possible to re-use food waste by diverting it to a hog or livestock farmer.  An estimated 75% of food waste is also usable for composting operations.  A significant reduction in landfilled waste could be achieved by initiating or expanding programs to re-use or compost food waste.  Food waste consists of vegetable trimmings, raw and cooked food, meat and dairy products,  spoiled food, leftovers, plate scrapings, and some animal feeds.  It is a major contributor to the weight  of disposed waste due to its high water content.  Military food services produce large quantities of food waste which makes the waste easy to capture and divert.  </P>

<P> Food waste and paper waste from food service operations can be processed through waste pulpers.  The waste pulpers grind up organic matter with water (the process is similar to a household garbage disposal) and then extract most of the moisture to produce a dry, organic pulp.  This material is less expensive to transport than raw food waste and is often in a more usable form for animal food or composting.  The dry pulp is easily mixed with traditional feedstuffs such as urea and corn. </P>

<P> Diverting food waste to a hog or livestock farmer is a source reduction strategy.  Although animal food processors can take meats and oils, they may not accept material containing paper.  Specific requirements of animal food processors should be consulted before initiating a program.  Licensed animal food processors will contract to pick up food waste.  They charge a fee to the generator that is approximately half the cost of landfilling the waste.  If unlicensed farmers accept the food waste, the military installation may be liable for potential damages.  The state&#146;s Department of Agriculture should be consulted about legal requirements, permitting, or the location of animal farmers who can accept food waste prior to implementing a program.</P>

<P> Food waste that is diverted to a composting operation can contain significant amounts of wastepaper.  This makes it easier to separate from regular trash and results in higher diversion.  Food containing meat and dairy products is not suitable for composting because it attracts scavengers and creates odor problems.  Most yard waste composting operations can be designed or adapted to incorporate food waste.  The addition of food waste often helps yard waste decay faster.  Housing residents can practice backyard composting and large scale composting systems can be set up for food service wastes.  Although any composting method can be used for food waste, in-vessel composting is particularly appropriate since it eliminates problems with odor and scavengers. </P>

<h3>Material Compatibility:</h3>

<p>N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Food waste collection facilities have the potential for rodent/pest infestation, foul odor, and unsightly conditions.  The addition of food to composting operations increases the potential for rodent/pest and odor problems.  Consult your local industrial health specialist and your local health and safety personnel prior to implementation.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Reusing or composting food waste can result in a potential 6.7% reduction by weight of disposed waste (EPA, 1994)</P>

<P><li> Composted food waste can be used as a soil amendment on base, possibly reducing the need for purchased supplies</P>

<P><li> Cost savings are achieved from reduced landfill disposal fees</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Food waste introduces problems of odor and scavengers in outdoor composting operations</P>

<P><li> Source separation of food requires extra work and special containers in the kitchen</P>

<P><li> Food waste contaminated with trash is not suitable for use as an animal food</P>

<P><li> Storing food waste between pickups can be messy, odorous, and requires frequent cleaning of containers</P>

<P><li> Food waste composting may require permits</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> Capital costs for incorporating food waste into an existing composting operation would include the purchase of separate collection containers for the compostable material.  The economic analysis is limited to this option since it has a lower capital cost than diversion as livestock feed.</P>


<P> Capital costs for using food waste to produce animal feed may include the cost of one or more waste pulpers as well as bulk collection containers for the processed material.  Capital costs for a waste pulper range from $27,000 to $34,000.  Operating costs would include transporting the material to the livestock farmer.</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Purchase of 200 60-gallon bins at $50 each</P>

<P><li> Labor approximately 1 day per week at $30/hr</P>

<P><li> Use existing garbage trucks for food waste collection</P>

<P><li> 20 tons per month diverted</P>

<P><li> Produces 15 tons per month finished compost</P>

<P><li> Landfill fees: $30/ton</P>

<P><li> Hauling to landfill costs: $5/ton</P>

<P><li> Hauling costs to on-base compost facility: $2/ton</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Empty drums in good condition can be re-used as collection containers for hazardous wastes, usually for the same type of product they originally contained.  Damaged or excess metal drums can be washed and recycled as ferrous scrap metal.  In general, drum washers/recyclers wash contaminated drums inside an enclosed chamber.  Drums can range in size from 5 gallon pails to 55 or 90-gallon drums.  There are numerous suppliers of this type of equipment and multiple options which can be specified for unique site needs.  Units have both interior and exterior washing capability.  Some units use heated water and detergent dispensing systems and a rinse cycle.  Other units offer an option for solvent washing.  Some options include stainless steel construction, recirculating rinse tanks, live steam capability, explosion proofing, automatic cycle timers, and remotely located controls which can be operated from non-hazardous areas.  </P>

<P> Legally empty drums are exempt from hazardous waste regulation in 40 CFR Section 261.7 and can be recycled.  For hazardous wastes that are not &#147;acute&#148; as listed in 40 CFR 261.31, 261.32, or 261.33, empty is defined as containing less than three percent of the original contents (by weight) or less than a one inch residue on the bottom.  Drums can be made empty by pumping out the residue or washing the drum.  Drums that contained acute hazardous waste are empty after they have been triple rinsed with a solvent (which may be water) capable of removing the product.  </P>

<P> Drums which contain a residue such that the drum does not meet the legal definition of empty can still be re-used as collection and storage drums for hazardous wastes <!--(49 CFR 173.28(b)(6)) -->which are compatible with the residue in the drum.  If the drum is used for any material different from the residue in the drum then a chemical safety reference needs to be checked to insure that the residue and the new material will not react in any way.  Incompatible materials may react to form heat, toxic gases, violent reactions, explosives, etc..  The list of incompatible material combinations is too long to include in this data sheet.  Incompatible combinations include combinations such as acids and bases, oxidizing agents and reducing agents, inorganic sulfides and acids, etc..</P>

<P> Drum reconditioning, regulated by 49 CFR 173.28(c), is the process of stripping a metal drum down to the bare metal, removing all contents, paint, corrosion, and labels.  The drum is then restored to its original shape and inspected for pitting, reduction in material thickness, metal fatigue, damaged threads or closures, or other significant defects.  Drums that pass inspection can be painted and marked according to 49 CFR 178.  Plastic drums are reconditioned by repair or replacement of non-integral packaging components to a condition such that it conforms in all respects with the prescribed requirements of 49 CFR 178.  Companies are available to recondition drums.</P>

<P> Re-use and recycling of drums has the potential of removing 100% of drums from landfilling.  Some drums have liners of LDPE #4 plastic which can be removed and recycled.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Empty drums should be stored and handled as if the drums were still full (i.e., store incompatibles separately), until properly washed.  Rinse waters will contain the residues from the drums; therefore, segregation of incompatibles and proper treatment of rinse water is essential.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, the base safety office, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementation.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Re-using drums saves the cost of purchasing new drums</P>

<P><li> Recycling of drums prevents drums from becoming hazardous waste</P>

<P><li> Avoids hazardous waste transportation and disposal costs</P>

<P><li> Recycling drums generates income</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Wastewater from drum rinsing may require special treatment depending on test results of the rinse water</P>
</ul>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Although recycling aluminum cans will not significantly reduce the volume of solid wastes being disposed at landfills, the high value and ease of collection can generate revenue that will sustain a recycling program that also collects lower value items.</P>

<P> Recycled aluminum beverage cans are generally marketed to aluminum can manufacturers.  The manufacturers process the material into sheet metal for the production of new beverage containers.  Aluminum mills are another market where recycled aluminum cans are used in the manufacture of other products made from aluminum.  Scrap metal dealers and traders can also be very competitive for aluminum cans, offering higher than market prices on occasion.  Steel mills or foundries use aluminum cans to help remove chemical contaminants from steel, and secondary smelters consume a small percentage of the aluminum beverage can market.</P>

<P> Mechanical extraction of aluminum from commingled recyclables or mixed solid waste is being developed but is not yet feasible on a commercial scale.  Source-separated aluminum cans are preferred by recycling centers.  Aluminum cans can be source separated by base residents and personnel participating in curbside or voluntary drop-off collection programs or manually separated at a materials recovery facility.  In addition, outdoor aluminum can recycling machines (e.g., Golden Goat) can be purchased or leased to encourage recycling among base residents and personnel by paying the consumer for the cans.</P>

<P> Aluminum cans can be crushed or baled to reduce storage and transport space requirements.  The amount of processing required depends on the needs of the buyer.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Proper personal protective equipment, such as long sleeves and gloves, should be worn when handling scrap metal.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist and your local health and safety personnel prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Reduces the volume of waste disposed in landfills by approximately 1% (EPA 1994)</P>

<P><li> Conserves energy and natural resources used to produce new aluminum</P>

<P><li> Reduces landfill disposal fees</P>

<P><li> Generates revenue</P>

<P><li> Requires little, if any, simple off-the-shelf processing equipment</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Training of waste generators will be required, to ensure that aluminum waste streams can be properly separated</P>

<P><li> Aluminum must be segregated from steel</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> Aluminum recycling can be incorporated into residential and commercial/industrial recycling programs with minimal capital costs.  The same collection containers used for curbside collection of residential recyclables can be used for aluminum collection.  Dedicated collection containers could be purchased for offices or other commercial/industrial areas to increase aluminum recovery from the commercial/industrial waste stream.  Operating costs for recycling aluminum include labor costs for a coordinator/monitor, collection costs (if applicable), materials handling costs (e.g., separation of metal by type), and transportation costs to deliver the material if pick up service is not arranged with the contractor.  These operating costs can be offset with reduced landfill disposal fees and revenue from the sale of the aluminum.</P>

<P> Capital costs for the purchase of a Golden Goat would be approximately $20,000 per unit. Operating costs would include maintenance activities (e.g. cleaning of the unit, trash removal, coin loading), consumer revenue, and transportation costs to deliver the cans to market.</P>

<P> Market prices for aluminum range from $350 to $800/ton from local recycling centers, with prices on the West Coast considerably higher (greater than $1,000/ton). Higher market prices are generally obtained for good quality (uncontaminated) metal cans.</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Medium scale aluminum collection program: 1 ton/month</P>

<P><li> Purchase of 40 curbside recycling containers: $15/container</P>

<P><li> Purchase of one large collection bin: $500</P>

<P><li> Labor for collection/separation of aluminum containers: 2 hrs/week</P>

<P><li> Landfill fee: $25/ton</P>

<P><li> Labor rate: $30/hr</P>

<P><li> Transportation cost to on-base recycle center: $50/month</P>

<P><li> Transportation cost to landfill: $150/month</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Cardboard is reportedly the largest single source of waste paper for recycling, comprising 46% of all waste paper recycled in the U.S.  (American Forest and Paper Association, 1994).  If reducing the amount of cardboard used for packaging is not feasible (source reduction), then it should be recycled or composted.  Corrugated cardboard is made from strong, good quality wood fiber and includes un-waxed cardboard boxes and brown paper bags.  Paperboard cartons such as cereal boxes and other non-corrugated boxes cannot be recycled as cardboard.  The waxed cardboard used for packaging fresh vegetables is contaminated and cannot be recycled.  However, paperboard cartons and waxed cardboard can be composted.   Cardboard usage on base is widespread and contributes significantly to the waste stream disposed in landfills.  Cardboard is universally marketable, profitable, and easily recycled.</P>

<P> The simplest and most cost-effective method for reducing the amount of cardboard solid waste is through source reduction.  Many suppliers over-package goods because they believe that it is preferred by the customer.  If an item can be delivered with less cardboard or other packaging, it is recommended that the end user negotiate with the supplier to redesign it.  </P>

<P> If source reduction is not an option, then the cardboard should be recycled.  The first step in setting up a recycling program is to identify local markets and contact paper dealers to determine dealer and end-user requirements.  Some dealers require that it be baled; others will take it loose.  The regular waste hauler may also be willing to collect the corrugated cardboard separately, depending on the volume generated and the availability of local markets.</P>

<P> There are four methods of bundling corrugated cardboard for storage and marketing:  loosely bundling, flat packing, baling, and piling in roll-off containers.  Small quantity generators generally flatten boxes and tie them (loosely bundled).  Flat packing is similar except that flattened boxes are stacked on a pallet about shoulder high and then banded.  Balers are commonly used by small, medium, and high generators of cardboard for compacting into stackable rectangles.  The bales are much easier to handle and move than bundled cardboard and can be picked up with a forklift.  Baling sometimes increases the market value of the cardboard.  For larger generators, a roll-off compactor or stationary dumpster may be used for collecting loose, flattened cardboard.  These containers will typically hold 30 cubic yards.  A dealer may provide a roll-off container if it can be filled quickly; (about once per week) on a consistent basis.</P>

<P> If cardboard recycling is not possible, it can be composted.  The cardboard should be shredded so that it will mix with other materials and decompose quickly.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Paperboard cartons such as cereal boxes, other non-corrugated boxes and waxed cardboard cannot be recycled as cardboard. </P>

<P> N/A</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Reduces the volume of waste disposed in landfills by an average of 12.7% (EPA, 1994)</P>

<P><li> Reduces landfill disposal fees</P>

<P><li> Generates revenue from the sale of the cardboard</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Training of waste generators will be required, so they can separate cardboard waste properly.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> Capital costs for a cardboard recycling system will depend on the selected handling systems:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Recycling trailers (16 x 7 x 8 ft) for collecting loose, flat corrugated cardboard will cost approximately $1,500 each. </P>

<P><li> Capital costs for balers range from $8,000 to $150,000, depending on the model type and capacity required.</P>
</ul>

<P> The operating costs for a cardboard recycling program include labor costs for a coordinator/monitor, collection costs (if applicable), materials handling costs (if applicable), and transportation costs to deliver the material if pick-up service is not arranged with the recycler.  These operating costs are usually offset by savings incurred from reduced landfill disposal fees and revenue from the sale of the cardboard. </P>

<P> Market prices for cardboard is $15 to $30/ton (1996), based on recent surveys in selected regions, with prices on the West Coast generally higher ($80 to $110/ton).  The costs presented below are incremental costs for a cardboard recycling program that is incorporated into a large scale recycling program which includes other recyclables (e.g. aluminum cans, plastic bottles, etc.)  In many cases where cardboard recycling is incorporated into an existing recycling program, the purchase of additional recycling equipment (e.g. baler) may not be necessary.  Hence, this is a conservative analysis.</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Two tons of cardboard recycled per week</P>

<P><li> Cost of recycling trailer: $1,500</P>

<P><li> Cost of baler: $10,000</P>

<P><li> Labor for cardboard collection/separation: 4 hrs/week</P>

<P><li> Labor for transportation to landfill: 1 hr/week</P>

<P><li> Labor rate: $30/hr</P>

<P><li> Transportation cost to on-base recycle center: $50/month</P>

<P><li> Transportation cost to landfill: $150/month</P>

<P><li> Landfill cost: $25/ton (California)</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Although steel cans contribute only a small portion to the municipal wastestreams disposed in landfills, they have a market value and recycling steel cans will save energy and resources.  The steel category includes bi-metal cans (steel cans with an aluminum top), and tin cans (steel cans coated with tin).</P>

<P> Magnetic separation makes steel cans easy to reclaim from commingled recyclable material.  Alternatively, steel cans can be source separated by base residents and personnel participating in curbside or voluntary drop-off collection programs.  Processing requirements for steel cans vary, but generally cans should be rinsed, the labels do not need to be removed, and the lids can also be recycled (including steel lids from glass and plastic bottles).  In addition to steel food and beverage containers, empty steel paint and aerosol cans are also accepted by the steel industry for recycling.  Paint cans do not need to be rinsed, but the thin layer of skin paint remaining in the empty can must be dry.  Aerosol cans must be completely empty, with the plastic lid removed (spray nozzles do not need to be removed for recycling).  The can scrap may be baled, bundled, or shipped loose to the recycling facility.  There may be specific requirements set by the recycler on bale size and density or bundle weight and density.</P>

<P> The three major potential markets (steel industry, foundries, and de-tinning companies) have specific requirements for purchasing post-consumer steel cans.  It is essential to finalize market arrangements prior to processing the cans to ensure that the preparation process will be acceptable.</P>

<P> The marketability of steel cans depends on the form and purity of the recovered scrap.  Clean compressed steel is more marketable and has a higher value.  Equipment is available to compress the cans, while removing the contents and contaminants. </P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Consult the base safety office and your local industrial health specialist to determine the proper personal protection equipment (PPE) and the necessary training prior to using this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Reduces the volume of waste disposed in landfills by up to 1.3 % (EPA 1994)</P>

<P><li> Conserves energy and natural resources needed to produce new steel</P>

<P><li> Reduces landfill disposal fees</P>

<P><li> Minimal processing equipment requirements</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> May not be marketable in some regions</P>

<P><li> May not be economical to recycle small quantities</P>

<P><li> Training of waste generators will be required, to ensure that steel waste streams can be properly separated.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> Steel recycling can easily be incorporated into residential and commercial/industrial recycling programs with minimal additional capital costs.  The same collection containers used for curbside collection of residential recyclables can be used for steel collection.  Dedicated collection containers could be purchased for offices or other commercial/industrial areas to increase steel recovery from the commercial/industrial waste stream.  Operating costs for recycling steel would include labor costs for a coordinator/monitor, collection costs (if applicable), materials handling costs (e.g. separation of metal by type), and transportation costs to deliver the material, if pick up service is not arranged with the contractor.  These operating costs can be offset with reduced landfill disposal fees and revenue from the sale of the aluminum and steel.</P>

<P> Market prices for steel are currently $0 to $50/ton from local recycling centers based on recent surveys in selected regions.  Higher market prices are generally obtained for good quality (uncontaminated) metal cans.  The recycling  program presented below is dedicated only to steel can recycling.    The payout period for this example is primarily a function of the market price for steel.  Steel can recycling will be more cost effective if incorporated into an existing program that also includes glass and aluminum recycling.  </P>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Medium scale steel can collection program: 1 ton/month</P>

<P><li> Purchase of 40 curbside recycling containers: $15/container</P>

<P><li> Purchase of one large collection bin: $500</P>

<P><li> Labor for collection/separation of steel can containers: 1 hr/week</P>

<P><li> Landfill fee:  $25/ton </P>

<P><li> Labor rate: $30/hr</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> The Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center has developed a shore-side system for treating bilge and other oily waste waters. The Bilge and Oily Wastewater Treatment System (BOWTS) removes all major contaminants found in bilge waters.</P>

<P> BOWTS has been successfully operating 150 gpm units at Naval Shipyard Long Beach and Naval Air Station Alameda. It is scheduled to be installed in the near future at Subase San Diego, Fleet Industrial Support Center Oakland, Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Naval Station San Diego, Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, and Naval Station Guam.</P>

<P> The BOWTS hardware is a stationary system with secondary containment equipped with redundant (duty/standby) intake pumps, each fitted with upstream strainers. After the ship&#146;s bilge water is transferred to a large holding tank, the feed is then passed through a first stage oil/water separator, and is then introduced into a series of three chambers for performing chemical treatment. Two chemical metering pumps feed a reverse emulsion breaker and sodium hydroxide, respectively, into this subsystem, resulting in the removal of the emulsified oil and precipitation of the heavy metals. The effluent is then pumped into an induced-air flotation unit, where the generated residues are removed. Two slop oil tanks are provided for collecting the free oil separated in the oil/water separator, and a sludge tank is provided for holding the sludges collected in the oil/water separator and the induced-air flotation device. The water fraction leaving the system will be of a quality that can be discharged directly into the sanitary sewer.</P>

<P> Although the pollutants found in ship bilge and other oily wastewater vary from ship to ship, the approach followed was to categorize and quantify the principal pollutants. The data collected was used in designing the basic BOWTS. Additional process units could be added where local discharge requirements indicate the need for more rigorous treatment than is available from the basic system design. BOWTS lowered the contaminant levels to less than the permissible limits for discharge into navigable waters.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> BOWTS chemicals are irritants to skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Inhalation of these fumes can be dangerous. Pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls are suspected carcinogens. Proper personal protection equipment is, therefore, recommended.</P>

<P> Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> BOWTS can potentially reduce the amount of bilge water disposed at a site by as much as 95 percent.</P>

<P> <li> BOWTS is a proven off-the-shelf technology. </P>

<P> <li> The system is flexible to accommodate a wide range of concentrations and flow ranges and each system is designed to site specific requirements (e.g., configuration, modifications, etc.). </P>

<P> <li> The BOWTS operation is completely automated but requires one person to monitor the process.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>

<P>N/A</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> Based on 1995 dollar values and for a 150 gpm flow, the cost for BOWTS is broken down as follows:</P>
<ul>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> The precipitation and microfiltration process uses a combination of treatments on a variety of wastes. Chemical precipitation of heavy metals is the first treatment in this process. Precipitates and all particles larger than 0.1 to 0.2 micron size are filtered through a unique tubular fabric crossflow microfilter. Concentrate is dewatered using conventional processes, such as filter press or centrifuge.</P>

<P> Microfiltration modules are fabricated from a tubular woven polyester material. Wastes pumped into these polyester tubes form a dynamic membrane that produces a high quality filtrate and removes all particles larger than 0.1 to 0.2 micron. Turbulence continually maintains the membrane and maximizes treatment efficiency.</P>

<P> Metals are removed via precipitation by adjusting the pH in a reaction tank. Metal hydroxides or oxides form a dynamic membrane with other suspended solids. The concentrate, which contains up to 50 percent solids by volume, is periodically discharged to solids concentration and drying systems (filter press, centrifuge, or sludge thickener). Water from solids concentration is recycled to the feed tank.</P>

<P> Constituents are removed using seeded slurry methods in the microfilter. Hardness can be removed through traditional precipitation reactions. Oil and grease can be removed by adding adsorbents. Organics and solvents can be removed using activated carbon, bone char, or powdered ion exchange resins as adsorbents.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> The polyester membrane support cloth is suitable for use in all conditions except high concentrations of caustic at elevated temperatures. All other system components are either plastics (PVC, polyethylene, fiberglass) or type 316 stainless steel.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> Care should be taken when handling wastewater contaminated with heavy metals. They can be poisonous, and skin absorption is the major route. Proper personal protection equipment is, therefore, highly recommended.</P>

<P> Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<p>Advantages of this system are:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Modular construction allows flow rates from a few gallons per minute to virtually any capacity required </P>

<P><li> Can treat any contaminant which can be converted to solid form either through precipitation or through adsorption on any of a variety of adsorbents</P>
</ul>

<P>Commercial applications include removal of heavy metals from semiconductor and components manufacturing, oil and grease removal from industrial laundry effluent, and silica removal through water softening reactions from reverse osmosis concentrate.</P>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> High capital cost</P>

<P><li> High operating cost</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> The capital cost of the precipitation, microfiltration, and sludge dewatering treatment process will vary, depending on the particular removal challenge presented. A typical capital cost is approximately $1.00 to $2.00 per gallon per day of capacity. For example, the capital cost of a system to treat a wastewater flow of 100,000 gallons per day would be between $100,000 and $200,000. Operating costs consist of normal mechanical maintenance, neutralization chemicals, and adsorbents. Typical operating costs are in the range of $1.00 to $2.50 per 1,000 gallons.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> The closed loop wash rack allows complete recycling of wash water used for vehicle cleaning. Facilities installing closed loop wash racks will attain zero discharge, and therefore eliminate any possibility for NPDES violations.</P>

<P> A typical process flow consists of the mechanical equipment (trucks, cars, etc.) stopping over a wash pad collection pit. The wash water will go through three treatment units (alpha, beta, and omega) before being recycled for reuse.</P>

<P> The purpose of the alpha unit is to separate free oil and dirt from the waste water. Water in the alpha unit goes through a vertical zigzag solids-liquid separator unit with 150 sq. ft. solids separator area, a polypropylene oil coalescent pack with 850 sq. ft. of oil coalescing area, a high density adsorption filter for removal of very small droplets, an engineered flow baffling, and an oil/skimmer for removal of floating oil and dirt. From the alpha unit, water will be pumped to the beta unit. </P>

<P>The beta unit removes fine dirt particles and remaining hydrocarbons in the effluent alpha. Water in the beta unit goes through a 400 sq. ft., 20 micron quad cartridge filter, an adsorbent media filter for filtration down to 5 to 20 microns, a 30 lb. carbon filter for removal of trace contaminants, and an enclosed cabinet with thermostatically controlled heater for freeze protection. Finally, the effluent from the beta unit flows to the omega unit. </P>

<P>The omega unit stores the water in a holding tank and then transfers it for reuse. The omega unit consists of a corrosion-proof polyethylene tank 1/4 inch thick, a centrifugal pump with surge tank and switch to draw reclaimed water from the holding tank for reuse by the pressure cleaner, a level control valve for maintaining proper recycled water level, an overload drain system and an ozone generator.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health: </H3>

<p> Care should be taken when handling these chemicals. They are irritants to the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Inhalation of the fumes can be dangerous. Proper personal protection equipment is, therefore, recommended.</P>

<P> Consult your local Industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
 
<p>The closed loop wash rack can handle a flow range of 1 to 50 gpm. It requires minimal maintenance. All the units are available as fully assembled modular units that are simple to install. The closed loop wash rack removes trace amounts of solvents, hydrocarbons, and dirt.</P>

<P> The closed loop wash rack has been operating successfully at various locations in the USA. The following table shows the Closed Loop Wash Rack treatment efficiency:</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> The closed loop wash rack comes in four different units. The alpha unit costs $5,000, the beta unit costs $7,000, the Omega unit costs $3,500, and the ozone generator costs $1,500. These cost estimates are based on 20 gpm flow rate.  In addition to the four units, there are some consumable items that have to be replaced. These items are: 1) D.E.C. Media 30# (5 to 6 lb. charges), $60; 2) Cartridge Element, $43 (2) 50 sq. ft.; and 3) Carbasorb filter media, 30 lbs., $75. It will cost an additional $10,000 for piping, electrical wiring, and installation. Based on 10% discount factor, the expected payback period is 4 years.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> An alternative to using disposable diapers is to launder them at home or contract with a diaper service to take away the soiled diapers and deliver clean diapers.  Cloth diapers can be as convenient as disposable diapers when a diaper service is employed. </P>

<P> The most cost effective way to reduce the quantity of disposable diapers in the waste stream is to educate base residents on the benefits of using cloth diapers.  Diaper services usually deliver and pick up diapers twice a week.  The diaper does not need to be pre-soaked or treated in any way.  The soiled diaper is taken off the baby, put into the hamper, and picked up by the service. </P>

<P> The use of cloth diapers is easily implemented and offers a unique pollution prevention strategy.  Disposable diapers can be a significant source of waste in residential trash.  They contribute untreated human waste to the landfill or waste disposal system, increasing the potential for groundwater contamination and the spread of disease-carrying organisms.  It is estimated that disposable diapers contribute 1.3%, of the total volume of municipal waste disposed in U.S.  landfills (EPA, 1994).  Using cloth diapers removes the disposable diaper waste stream from landfills and transfers the human waste to the sanitary sewer system where it is properly treated.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Good hygiene practices such as frequent hand washing and careful handling should be practiced when removing soiled diapers. to be further investigated to determine the actual health risks of this process and applicable safety procedures needed.</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Study for occupational infection risk to employees and source of risk</P>

<P><li> Evaluation of captured aerosols found in closed receptacles where soiled diapers are contained and potentially present a risk to humans</P>

<P><li> Examine the survivability of pathogens in the reusable diaper wash process</P>

<P><li> Evaluate different biocides for the sanitation of reusable diapers</P>
</ul>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Source reduction potential of 1.3 % of disposed waste (EPA, 1994)</P>

<P><li> Reduction of untreated human waste in landfills </P>

<P><li> Reduction of resource consumption from disposable diapers</P>

<P><li> Cost savings due to reduced landfill disposal fees</P>

<P><li> Cost savings from reusable diapers</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Less convenient</P>

<P><li> Handling, storing, and laundering diapers is a disagreeable task</P>

<P><li> May be difficult to implement due to the ease and accessibility of disposable diapers</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> The cost elements of using cloth diapers are compared to disposable diapers.</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Each use of a cloth diaper is equivalent to one disposable diaper</P>

<P><li> A baby uses 60 diapers per week, which is 3,120 diapers per year</P>

<P><li> The weight of a single soiled disposable diaper is 0.5 lb; the weight of soiled disposable diapers produced per baby (60 diapers per week) is 1,560 lb/yr</P>

<P><li> </P>

<P><li> A package of 12 cloth diapers costs $15.29,  they are used 78 times, so that 3.33 packages are required per year, and they are recycled as rags when no longer usable</P>

<P><li> A package of 32 disposable diapers costs $7.39, and 97.5 packs are used per year</P>

<P><li> The cost of using a diaper service is $ 13.70  per week</P>

<P><li> Waste disposal costs are $40 per ton therefore $31.14 per baby, per year</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> The hydrogen peroxide oxidation process is designed to destroy dissolved organic contaminants through an advanced chemical oxidation process using ultraviolet (UV) radiation and hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide is added to the contaminated water, and the mixture is fed into the treatment system. The treatment system contains one or more oxidation chambers. Each chamber contains one high-intensity UV lamp mounted in a quartz tube. The contaminated water flows in the space between the chamber wall and the quartz tube in which each UV lamp is mounted.</P>

<P> This technology has been successfully applied at over 100 sites throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe. The units at these sites have treated groundwater, industrial wastewater, landfill leachates, potable water, and industrial reuse streams.</P>

<P> The hydrogen peroxide oxidation technology was demonstrated at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory site 300 Superfund site. The results of the demonstration successfully reduced trichloroethene and tetrachloroethene to below analytical detection limits.</P>

<P> UV light catalyzes chemical oxidation of organic contaminants in water by its combined effect upon the organic substances and reaction with hydrogen peroxide. First, many organic contaminants that absorb UV light may undergo a change in their chemical structure or may become more reactive with chemical oxidants. Second, and more importantly, UV light catalyzes the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide to produce hydroxyl radicals, which are powerful chemical oxidants. Hydroxyl radicals react with organic contaminants destroying them and producing the harmless carbon dioxide, halides, and water  byproducts. The process produces no hazardous by-products or air emissions.</P>

<P> The hydrogen peroxide oxidation equipment includes circular wipers attached to the quartz tubes. These wipers periodically remove solids that may accumulate on the tubes, a feature designed to maintain treatment efficiency.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> Proper operation, design, and maintenance of the system will ensure its safe use. Hydrogen peroxide can be poisonous to the skin, eyes, and mucuous membranes. Polychlorinated biphenyls are experimental carcinogens and teratogens; therefore, proper personal protective equipment is highly recommended.</P>

<P> Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
 
<p>The hydrogen peroxide oxidation technology treats wastewater contaminated with a variety of pollutants.  These include: chlorinated solvents, pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, phenolics, fuel hydrocarbons, cyanides, and other organic compounds ranging from a few thousand milligrams per liter to less than 1 microgram per liter. In some cases, the process can be combined with air stripping or biological treatment for optimal treatment results.</P>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li>   High capital cost</P>

<P><li> High operational cost</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> The capital cost for the hydrogen peroxide oxidation system is between $100,000 and $200,000 for a 200,000 gallons per day treatment facility. Equipment capacities can range up to several thousand gallons per minute. The operational cost for the 100,000 gallons per day treatment facility varies between $3,000 and $10,000 per day.</P>

<P> The chemical oxidation process in the hydrogen peroxide oxidation process is dependent upon a number of reaction conditions which can affect both performance and cost. The process variables that are related to the contaminated water condition are the type and concentration of organic contaminant, total organic substances present, light transmittance of the water (turbidity or color), type and concentration of dissolved inorganic substances (e.g., carbonates and iron), and pH. The process variables that are related to the treatment process design and operation are UV and hydrogen peroxide dosage, pH and temperature conditions, use of supplementary catalysts, and treatment mode (batch, recycle, or continuous).</P>

<P><B>Applicable EPCRA Targeted Constituents:</B> Heavy Metals, Sodium Nitrite (CAS: 7632-00-0)</P>
<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> This technology has been used to successfully recycle wastewater generated during the hydroblasting of ship&#146;s boilers. Hydroblasting is a time consuming process that generates 12,000 to 20,000 gallons of wastewater containing heavy metals and sodium nitrate.  Sodium nitrate is added to the water used in the hydroblasting process and acts as a surface conditioner that prevents flash rusting of boiler tube surfaces during hydroblasting operations. It has been found that this water/sodium nitrate mixture can be reused in the hydroblasting process without adversely effecting finished product only if the solids have been removed.</P>

<P> The recycling system consists of collection, settling, filtration, reconditioning, and reuse of the hydroblasting water. The water is continuously recycled during the hydroblasting operations until the operation has been completed. Initially, potable water is mixed with sodium nitrate before being pumped under pressure to spray wands. The water is pressurized and sprayed on to the steam side surfaces of the boiler tubes to remove scale build-up. The wastewater from the blasting operation is collected and pumped out of the boiler.</P>

<P> Utilizing the recycling unit, wastewater is sent to two 650-gallon settling tanks. Once enough water has been collected, the fresh water is shut off and the wastewater is recycled through the unit. The wastewater is pumped to the first collection tank, where it is gravity fed to the second tank, allowing larger, suspended particles to settle out. It is then pumped from the second settling tank through two filter trains, three fabric filters (50, 25, and 5 microns), and a cartridge filter. The recycled water passes through a heat exchanger before being returned to the hydroblasting operation for reuse. The filters remove small suspended material that can&#146;t be removed through gravity settling. The filters do not remove sodium nitrate, which remains above 1,200 ppm, the level needed prevent flash rusting. This means that no additional sodium nitrate needs to be added to recycled water.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> Heavy metals and sodium nitrate are irritants to skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Inhalation of these fumes can be toxic. Proper personal protection equipment is, therefore, recommend.</P>

<P> Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<p>The recycling unit has resulted in no known mechanical failures during the hydroblasting operations, nor does it cause a decrease in the quality of the cleaning operation. The sodium nitrate stays above the 1,200 ppm threshold, preventing rusting and surface damage. After inspection, no residuals were observed on the tube surfaces of boilers cleaned with the hydroblasting recycling unit and the cleaning operation was completed satisfactorily.</P>
<ul>
<P><li>  System reduces the amount of wastewater generated by hydroblasting operations by more then 90%. </P>

<P><li> With the use of the recycling unit, the amount of wastewater generated can be reduced by 90%</P>

<P><li> Since less potable water was used in the operation, the amount of sodium nitrate used can be dramatically reduced</P>

<P><li> No additional personnel are needed to operate the recycling unit.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>

<p>This process does generate spent filters that must be disposed as hazardous waste.</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> The process has been used successfully throughout the Navy for the hydroblasting of ship&#146;s boiler and may have application to other hydroblasting operations. It has been implemented at several shipyards and Shore Intermediate Maintenance Activities (SIMA) by the former Naval Energy and Environmental Support Activity (NEESA) and Naval Ship System Engineering Station (NAVSSES).</P>

<P> The cost of the recycling unit is around $25,000. This payback is achieved from two boiler cleaning operations. The cost savings come from the reduction of water usage, the reduction in the amount of sodium nitrate used, and the reduction of wastewater needing disposal.</P>

<H3>Approval Authority:</H3>

<p> Navy:  Approval is controlled locally and should be implemented only after engineering approval has been granted.  Major claimant approval is not required.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> The powder activated carbon wastewater treatment system combines biological treatment (such as the activated sludge process) with adsorption on powdered activated carbon (PAC). The technology removes organic contaminants from wastewater and minimizes the inhibitory effects of process wastewater containing toxic organic compounds. Mobile powder activated carbon wastewater treatment systems can be furnished as continuous flow or batch treatment systems. Continuous flow systems come mounted on a mobile trailer, with treatment capacities from 2,500 to 10,000 gallons per day. Batch operated or continuous flow package plants can be provided for flows to 100,000 gal/d. In-ground systems of up to 53,000,000 gal/day are currently in operation.</P>

<P> Typically, living micro-organisms (biomass) and PAC contact wastewaters in an aeration basin (anaerobic systems are also available). Biomass removes biodegradable organic contaminants through biological assimilation, while the carbon physically adsorbs conventional and toxic organics.</P>

<P> The degree of removal achieved by the system depends on the influent waste characteristics and the system&#146;s operating parameters. Important considerations are biodegradability, absorbability, and concentrations of toxic inorganic compounds, such as heavy metals.</P>

<P> Powder activated carbon wastewater treatment systems can be adjusted to specific waste stream feeds by varying the concentration of the PAC in the system, adjusting the retention time of the mixed liquor, and adjusting the waste to biomass ratio. If necessary, the temperature and the pH of the incoming waste can be adjusted, and nutrients can be added.</P>

<P> After the aeration cycle, solids (PAC, with adsorbed organics, biomass, and inert solids) are removed through settling. The removed solids are mostly returned to the aeration tank, with only excess solids being removed. Solids may be regenerated to recover PAC, or may be dewatered and disposed.</P>

<P> A two-stage powder activated carbon wastewater treatment system may be applied where environmental standards require an even higher degree of treatment. In the first stage aeration basin, a high level of biomass and PAC removes most contaminants. The second stage aeration basin polishes the first stage effluent. The virgin PAC, added just ahead of the second stage, and the counter flow of solids to the first stage increases process efficiency. Excess solids are removed from the first stage and treated as described above.</P>

<h3>Material Compatibility:</h3>

<p>N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> Care should be taken when handling wastewater polluted with organic substances. They have a high order of dermal toxicity. Proper personal protection equipment is, therefore, highly recommended.</P>

<P> Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
 
<p>A powder activated carbon wastewater treatment system has been applied for:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Pretreatment and end-of-pipe treatment of industrial process wastewaters</P>

<P><li> Combined industrial/municipal wastewaters</P>

<P><li> Contaminated surface runoff and groundwater</P>

<P><li> Landfill leachates</P>
</ul>

<P>The technology can be very useful at naval installations that have a combined industrial and municipal collection system.</P>

<P> Powder activated carbon wastewater treatment systems can treat liquid wastes with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) in excess of 60,000 parts per million (ppm), including toxic volatile organic compounds in excess of 1,000 ppm. Treatability studies have shown that the system can reduce the concentration of specific toxic organic chemicals to below the detection limit.</P>

<P> Other benefits of the system include: </P>
<ul>
<P><li> Stability in the face of shock loadings</P>

<P><li> Color and ammonia removal</P>

<P><li> Improved sludge settleability </P>

<P><li> The process can be retrofitted into an existing activated sludge system at minimal cost.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li>   High capital cost</P>

<P><li> High operating cost</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> The capital and operating costs of a powder activated carbon wastewater treatment system depends on the influent quality and the effluent standards. The budget level capital cost estimate for a mobile powder activated carbon wastewater treatment system ranges from $100,000 to $300,000. The operational costs range from less than $0.50 to greater than $1.00 per 1,000 gallons, depending upon a number of variables. Costs of wastewater treatment vary from one location to another. Factors determining the wastewater treatment costs are: the treatment technology used, the flow rate, and the level and type of contamination. Each naval activity will have to examine the cost effectiveness of the treatment technology needed before selecting the appropriate treatment system.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> The Laser-Induced Photochemical Oxidative Destruction (LIPOD) is a method to photochemically oxidize organic compounds in wastewater. Using a laser, ultraviolet radiation can be applied to organic compounds to achieve complete oxidation of a variety of organic compounds.</P>

<P> The LIPOD process oxidizes low levels of toxic organic chemicals in aqueous solutions. The toxic organic compounds include unsaturated and chlorinated organic compounds. These compounds rank high on the EPA&#146;s list of priority pollutants. Because of low concentrations (parts per billion) removal of these compounds from wastewater can be difficult.</P>

<P> The oxidation process uses a UV laser to excite organic compounds in the presence of an oxidant to initiate a chain oxidation reaction. The UV source is an excimer laser, which excites gas to produce a high-intensity coherent energy source. The oxidant is hydrogen peroxide, which mixes with water. The laser&#146;s energy initiates hydrogen peroxide oxidation of the organic compounds. Hydroxyl radicals, which are powerful oxidants, are produced when the laser impacts the hydrogen peroxide. </P>

<P> Sufficient oxygen or hydroxyl radicals are formed to completely oxidize the organic compounds to carbon dioxide, water, and inorganic ions. The narrow band UV radiation is preferentially absorbed by the organic molecules and hydrogen peroxide. Little radiation is absorbed by the surrounding water molecules. The process requires no ozone use. The wastewater needs to be exposed to the UV light for a short time (less than 50 seconds) to initiate the oxidative chain reaction. Only a portion of the contaminated water is exposed to the UV radiation source in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. The exposed water can be mixed with unexposed water to cause a chain oxidation reaction. These chain reactions can last 40 to 62 hours. In the LIPOD process, the feed stream containing the toxic organic compounds and hydrogen peroxide flows countercurrent to the laser beam in a photochemical reactor where the compounds are irradiated. When oxidizing halogenated solutions, the reaction byproducts are carbon dioxide, water, and the halide ion.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> There are safety and health concerns when dealing with compounds like carbon tetrachloride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, etc. Carbon tetrachloride is a suspected carcinogen; therefore, caution should be taken when handling wastewater contaminated with it. In addition to that, carbon tetrachloride is also a skin and eye irritant, along with trichloroethane. They are toxic by inhalation. Proper personal protection equipment is therefore recommended.</P>

<P> Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<p>The LIPOD is effective in destroying benzene, chlorobenzene, chlorophenol, dichloroethene, benzidine, and phenol. Destruction percentages of the test compounds measure using LIPOD ranged from 89% to greater than 99%.  Destruction of other contaminants can be achieved by varying the electromatic. </P>

<P>The destruction of the chemicals occur during the initiation phase of the reaction when reactants are exposed to the light source and continues as the reaction proceeds in the absence of light. Limited destruction is also achieved during the photochemical initiation phase for all compounds irradiated. Increased destruction can occur during this phase only when a greater irradiation dose is applied. After several days changes in the percent destruction is dependent on the concentrations of toxic organic compounds and hydrogen peroxide, and the irradiation dose applied during the initiation phase.</P>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>

<P>N/A</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> Capital cost ranges from $25,000 to $60,000, depending on the size of the reactor.</P>

<P>Based on a 50 mg/L initial toxic concentration, the cost to operate the LIPOD range from $0.01/L to $0.02/L ($0.03/gal. to $0.07/gal.). The cost reflects the complete conversion of toxic organic compounds to carbon dioxide and water.</P>

<H3>Approval Authority:</H3>

<p> Navy:  Approval is controlled locally and should be implemented only after engineering approval has been granted.  Major claimant approval is not required.</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Clothing and household items in fair to good condition can be reused if they are donated to thrift shops, churches, or shelters.  Damaged clothing can be used as rags by individual households or processed by a textile recycler.  Larger thrift shops often sell clothing that is in poor condition to a recycler that shreds them and produces carpet padding, furniture stuffing, and other products.  Household items can easily be diverted from the waste stream if housing residents are aware of the location and donation policies of local or base second-hand stores. </P>

<P> Some military installations have thrift shops on base where residents can donate durable goods or leave them on consignment for a period of time.  If the base does not have a second-hand store, larger thrift stores may be willing to bring a truck to a convenient location on base for specified time periods.  Base residents or personnel would be able to bring clean textiles and other durable goods to be received by the thrift store attendant.  The base recycling coordinator should be responsible for monitoring the effect of the program and distributing information on what types of household goods can be donated, and in what condition they must be received.</P>

<P> Since textile recyclers do not commonly accept material from the public, the simplest solution is to donate the clothing or fabric to a charitable organization and let them divert it to the recycler.  Current estimates indicate that 1.25 million tons of post-consumer textile waste are recycled annually.  Post-consumer textile waste consists of any type of garment or household article made of some manufactured textile.  Approximately half of this material is recycled as second-hand clothing, which is typically given or sold to third-world nations.  The remaining textile waste is either used as wiping and polishing cloths, or converted into fiber and reused.</P>

<P> Re-using and recycling clothing and household items are simple and effective pollution prevention opportunities.  They effectively remove these items from solid waste landfills without generating any additional waste streams.</P>

<P><li> Cost savings are achieved from reduced disposal fees</P>

<P><li> Donations to charitable organizations provide affordable household products and clothing for low income people, and generate revenue for charity</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>

<P>N/A</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> There are no capital investments for establishing a durable goods collection program on base, if done in conjunction with a charitable organization that will provide a truck and attendant free of charge.  Alternatively, a recycling container could be purchased by the base and centrally located for voluntary collection of textiles and leather.  The donated goods could be periodically transported to a thrift store.  Costs for this option include the capital cost for the purchase of a recycling container and transportation and labor costs for trips to the thrift shop.</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Food and beverage glass containers can be reused or recycled.  Windows, mirrors, and other non-recyclable glass can be crushed for use as aggregate in construction projects.  Glass comprises a significant portion of municipal waste streams, has a reasonable market value (with an added redemption value in some states), and the public is generally aware that it is recyclable.  A simple glass recycling program requires no processing equipment.</P>

<P> Glass should be reused if possible to reduce losses associated with recycling.  Reusable bottles are found only in the wine and beer industry.  Some beer companies bottle their product in reusable, heavier bottles, and sell them to bars and drinking establishments.  Since the bottles never leave the site, they are easily picked up by the manufacturer when the next delivery is made.  Wine bottles are also made from a thicker glass and some wineries will accept them for refilling.  On-base drinking establishments can contract with suppliers to deliver beer and wine in returnable bottles.</P>

<P> All food and beverage containers made from glass are recyclable, even if  they have no deposit value.  In many states, beverage containers have a deposit value and are often worth more whole than crushed, since it is possible to verify the states deposit value.</P>

<P> Recyclable glass is clear, brown, or green.  The highest demand is for clear glass, followed by brown or amber glass.  Green glass is generally undesirable, as there is typically an overabundant supply on the market.  Broken, mixed-color glass has a low value, and may not be marketable.  Long distances to markets may necessitate crushing the glass to lower transport costs.  It can be broken into pieces, called &#147;cullet,&#148; with a glass crusher.  </P>

<P> The primary market for recycled glass is in the manufacture of container glass.  Competition for good-quality recycled glass bottles and jars (i.e., free of contaminants) that are separated by color is particularly acute.  Recycled glass is sold to end users as cullet.  The cullet is generally sold to glass benefaction facilities where it is cleaned and processed to meet the quality standards of glass container manufacturers.  </P>

<P> Contamination of recyclable glass is a serious impediment to glass container recycling.  Contaminants that are present in the glass stream include non-recyclable glass, ceramics, metal caps, lids, bottle neck rings, stones, and dirt.  Standard separation equipment is available at beneficiary facilities to remove contaminants; however, there is no established technology for removing ceramics, and the current technology for removing non-ferrous metal (eddy current detectors) result in about 5% to 8% glass loss.</P>

<P> The glass container industry maintains a high demand for reasonably priced cullet of good quality.  Some states require minimum percentages of cullet in new glass containers and the glass manufacturing industry has announced an overall goal of 50% cullet use.  Other uses for cullet include the manufacture of building materials such as glass tile and composite wall panels, concrete applications, construction aggregate, industrial mineral uses, insulation applications, paving applications in road construction, and re-melt applications to make colored windows and stained glass.</P>

<P> Window glass, Pyrex, and drinking glasses are of a different composition than bottle glass and are considered contaminants to the container glass industry.  These non-recyclable glasses along with non-marketable mixed color glass and green glass can be pulverized and turned into a fine sand that can be used in construction and other applications.  Crushed green glass has also been successfully used at NAS Whidbey Island in place of pea gravel to provide a bed for new culverts.  </P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Recycled glass must not contain contaminates, such as non-recyclable glass (window glass, Pyrex, and drinking glasses), ceramics, plastic and metal bottle caps, lids, bottle neck rings, stones, and dirt.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Precautions must be taken when handling glass.  Safety gear such as heavy gloves, long sleeves, boots, and eye protection should be worn to protect handlers from broken and flying glass shards.</P>

<P> Consult the base safety office on procedures for handling glass.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Reduces the volume of waste disposed in landfills [national average volume reduction = 5.7% (EPA, 1994)]</P>

<P><li> Achieves cost savings from reduced landfill disposal fees</P>

<P><li> Generates revenue from sale of recyclable glass</P>

<P><li> Reduces the purchase of aggregate for construction</P>

<P><li> Returnable bar bottles can be less expensive than disposables</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Extreme care must be taken to avoid glass contamination</P>

<P><li> Glass commodities market fluctuates frequently</P>

<P><li> Training of waste generators will be required, to ensure glass waste is properly separated.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> Glass recycling can be incorporated into residential and commercial/industrial recycling programs with minimal additional capital costs.  The same collection containers used for curbside collection of residential recyclables can be used for glass collection.  Dedicated collection containers could be purchased for offices or other commercial/industrial areas to increase glass recovery from the commercial/industrial waste stream (see &#147;Equipment--Recycling Containers&#148;).  Operating costs for recycling glass would include labor costs for a coordinator/monitor, collection costs (if applicable), materials handling costs (e.g. separation of glass by color), and transportation costs to deliver the material if pick up service is not arranged with the contractor.  These operating costs are usually offset by savings incurred from reduced landfill disposal fees and revenue from the sale of the glass.</P>

<P> Market prices for glass are currently $0 to $15/ton from local recycling centers, based on recent surveys in selected regions, with prices on the West Coast considerably higher ($10 to $50/ton).  A higher market price could be obtained if good quality glass is consistently delivered or the glass is delivered directly to a glass processing facility. The recycling  program presented below is dedicated only to glass recycling.  The long payout period for this example is primarily a function of the market price for glass.  Glass recycling will be more cost effective if incorporated into an existing program that also includes steel and aluminum recycling.  </P>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Medium scale glass collection program: 1 ton/month</P>

<P><li> Purchase of 40 curbside recycling containers: $15/container</P>

<P><li> Purchase of one large collection bin: $500</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Wastewater generated from the rinsing of silver cyanide plated parts contains silver metal and cyanide containing compounds (cyanides). Silver metal and cyanides are toxic hazardous materials. The waste stream requires pretreatment to reduce these toxic materials prior to discharge. This treatment requires the use of hazardous chemicals including acids, alkalis, and chlorine-containing chemicals.</P>

<P> Electrolytic recovery technology uses an electrical current to plate out the silver metal and oxidize the cyanides in the rinse waters. The silver metal is recovered from the electrolytic recovery unit (ERU) as a metal foil that can be returned to the silver cyanide plating bath as an anode source. The purity of the recovered silver should meet the specifications for anode purity as long as the water from the rinse tank is used to rinse parts that are only plated in the silver cyanide tank. The ERU is plumbed to a stagnant rinse tank (the first rinse tank that the plated parts would see) in a closed loop fashion. The cyanides are partially oxidized to cyanates in the ERU. Electrolytic recovery technology can remove more than 90 percent of the silver metal in the rinse stream and oxidize up to 50 percent of the cyanides.</P>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> Silver is known to be a mild skin irritant. It is also an equivocal tumorgenic agent. Cyanide compounds are very poisonous in nature, and prolonged exposure to high concentrations can be detrimental to human beings. It can be absorbed through skin and through inhalation. Proper personal protective equipment should be used.</P>

<P> Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
 
<p>The benefits of electrolytic recovery for silver cyanide recycling include cost savings and reduction of hazardous waste. The cost savings will vary for each installation. The cost savings result from the following: </P>
<ul>
<P><li> Reduction in the use of treatment chemicals for cyanides and heavy metals in the wastewater treatment plant; </P>

<P><li> The recovery and reuse of silver metal, which reduces the costs for silver anodes or chemicals</P>

<P><li> Reduction in the volume of silver-containing hazardous sludge at the wastewater treatment plant</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>

<P>N/A</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> The cost to implement an ERU assumes that the rinse system for the silver cyanide plating line is a dedicated rinse (only used to rinse silver cyanide plated parts) and that the rinse system consists of a two-tank rinse system (a stagnant rinse followed by a final rinse connected to a wastewater treatment plant).</P>

<P> Capital costs are based on a 800 gallon cadmium cyanide plating bath:</P>
<ul>
<P><li>  Electrolytic Recovery Unit - $15,000</P>

<P><li>  Labor and Installation Costs - $3,000</P>
</ul>

<P> Operational costs: The ERU will only be operated when the concentrations of the silver and cyanides reach predetermined concentrations in the stagnant rinse tank. Once turned on, the ERU will run continually until these concentrations are reduced to acceptable levels. By using the ERU in a batch mode, existing personnel should be able to operate the unit. Therefore, no additional operational costs are associated with the implementation of the ERU.</P>

<P>Assuming that a given naval facility generates 300,000 gallons of silver cyanide rinse waters a year, the following savings are estimated: </P>
<ul>
<P><li> Waste treatment costs (300,000 gals. x $0.50 per gallon) = $15,000 </P>

<P><li> Savings for purchasing fewer silver anodes = $500</P>

<P><li> Total savings = $15,500</P>

<P><li> Total costs = $18,000</P>

<P><li> Payback period = approximately 15 months</P>
</ul>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> The BioTrol Aqueous Treatment System (BATS) is a biological treatment system for contaminated wastewater. This system uses naturally occurring microbes; however, where highly toxic or recalcitrant target compounds are present microbial amendments are introduced.</P>

<P> The process flow consists of contaminated water flowing to a mix tank, where its pH is adjusted and inorganic nutrients are added. If necessary, the water is heated to an optimum temperature, using both a heater and a heat exchanger to minimize energy costs. The heated water then flows to a bioreactor where the contaminants are biodegraded. The degrading microorganisms are then immobilized in a multiple-cell, submerged, fixed-film bioreactor. Each cell is filled with a highly porous packing material, to which the microbes adhere. For aerobic conditions, air is supplied by fine bubble membrane diffusers mounted at the bottom of each cell. This system can also operate under anaerobic conditions.</P>

<P> As water flows through the bioreactor, contaminants are degraded to biological end products, predominantly carbon dioxide and water. The resulting effluent may be discharged to a publicly-owned treatment works (POTW) or may be reused on site.</P>

<P> This technology can be applied to a wide variety of wastewaters. Contaminants amenable to treatment include pentachlorophenol, creosote components, gasoline and fuel oil components, chlorinated hydrocarbons, phenolics, and solvents. Other potential target waste streams include coal tar residues and organic pesticides. BATS has performed successfully at forty different locations..</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> Pesticides and herbicides must be handled with care. Skin adsorption can be a concern when handling wastewater contaminated with these chemicals. Pentachlorophenol is an experimental teragen and carcinogen. It is also poisonous when inhaled and causes dermatitis. Proper personal protective equipment is, therefore, recommended.</P>

<P> Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<p>The Biological Aqueous Treatment System was tested at the MacGillis and Gibbs Superfund Site in New Brighton, Minnesota. The system was operated continuously for 6 weeks at three different flow rates. The demonstration showed the following: </P>
<ul>
<P> <li> reduced pentachlorophenol concentrations from 45 to 1 ppm in a single pass </P>

<P> <li> achieved 96 to 99 percent removal of pentachlorophenol </P>

<P> <li> minimal sludge production and no air emissions of pentachlorophenol, <li> mineralized chlorinated phenolics </P>

<P> <li> eliminated biotoxicity in the wastestream</P>

<P> <li> BATS requires minimal operator attention</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>

<P>N/A</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> The capital cost for this technology depends on the flow rate.  </P>
<ul>
<P> <li> capital cost for 1 to 2 gallons per minute is $15,000 </P>

<P> <li> capital cost for 100 gallons per minute is $150,000</P>

<P> <li> operating costs were $0.75 per 1,000 gallons for a 5 gallon per minute unit and $0.40 per 1,000 gallons for a 30 gallons per minute unit</P>
</ul>

<P> Factors determining costs of treatment are the technology used, the flow rate, and the level and type of contamination. Each naval must examine the cost effectiveness of the technology needed before selecting the system.</P>

<P><B>Usage List:</B> Navy: Medium; Army: Medium; Air Force: Low</P>

<P><B>Substitute for:</B> Disposal of used fluorescent light tubes and HID lamps</P>

<P><B>Applicable EPCRA Targeted Constituent:</B>  Mercury (CAS: 7439-97-6), Lead (CAS: 7439-92-1), Cadmium (CAS: 7440-43-9)</P>
<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> The recycling of fluorescent lights and high intensity discharge (HID) lamps is a proven technology capable of reliably recovering greater than 99% of the mercury in the spent lights.  This is done by using a crush-and-sieve method.  In this process, the spent tubes are first crushed and then sieved to separate the large particles from the mercury-containing phosphor powder.  The phosphor powder is collected and processed under intense heat and pressure.  The mercury is volatilized and then distilled to the required purity.  The glass particles are segregated and recycled into fiberglass.  Aluminum components are also segregated and recycled separately. </P>

<P> All of the components of the used lights are recycled into reusable/saleable raw materials [except for any polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-containing ballasts, which are incinerated].</P>

<P> Fluorescent lights and HID lamps have one important drawback: relatively high environmental costs associated with their use, specifically, the disposal costs.  Fluorescent light tubes and HID lamps may be considered hazardous waste.  This is due to mercury and trace amounts of lead and other metals contained in the tubes, regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).  Even small quantities of these metals may be potentially harmful to human health and the environment, especially when mass quantities of used tubes are landfilled.  Used fluorescent light tube disposal in municipal landfills is, in fact, considered the second largest source of mercury pollution entering the environment.  These pollutants can often migrate into groundwater supplies or even become airborne (due to mercury&#146;s relatively high volatility), at which time they pose an even greater environmental threat.  Thus, proper disposal and, preferably, recycling of these tubes would help reduce and prevent heavy metal pollution.</P>

<P> Proper handling and disposal of used fluorescent light tubes and HID lamps is becoming an increasingly expensive and problematic chore for big users of these lights.  The metal content of used lights usually exceeds the threshold levels qualifying them as a hazardous waste.  Unfortunately, manufacturers&#146; information on the heavy metal content of their fluorescent light products has too great an uncertainty to rely upon its accuracy for determination, so RCRA requires testing of representative samples.  Testing of some representative samples can be done, but it is usually prohibitively expensive.  It is almost always cheaper to consider all used fluorescent lights as hazardous waste than to test even representative samples.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Storage and handling of used lights pose no compatibility problems; nevertheless, storage and shipment of the glass tubes is best done keeping the glass tubes intact.  This prevents any mercury or mercury-containing materials from leaking and entering the environment, which could result in contamination of storage areas, packaging, soil, etc.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Fluorescent light tubes must be handled with care because of the mercury, lead, and cadmium.  Mercury and lead are cumulative poisons, are experimental teratogens, and carcinogens. Cadmium dust can be poisonous if inhaled.  Proper personal protective equipment is highly recommended.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Saves landfill space</P>

<P><li> Reduces raw materials production needs</P>

<P><li> Keeps the potentially toxic materials out of landfills</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> May require hazardous waste storage or treatment permits</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> Actual disposal costs of used lights vary greatly, depending on the quantity, proximity, and disposal facility, and also on any state and local fees.  The cost to recycle a used fluorescent light is usually calculated per linear foot, or per bulb for HID lamps.  Shipping of the used lights may or may not be provided, depending on the company.  Nonetheless, overall costs to recycle are usually comparable to direct disposal costs. </P>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> $0.08 to $0.10/ft to recycle fluorescent light tubes (average cost: $0.09/ft)</P>

<P><li> $0.25 to $0.50 per four-foot fluorescent tube for disposal in a hazardous waste landfill (average cost: $0.38)</P>

<P><li> Costs based on 10,000 four-foot long fluorescent light tubes</P>

<P><li> Collection and storage costs equivalent for both options</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Proper segregation and storage of used POLs is necessary to ensure that recycling is promoted. Required segregation is normally dictated by the waste oil transporter so that waste oils are consistent with the intended use. Proper storage is the same, regardless of the degree of segregation. Generally, the goal of proper storage is to eliminate water and dirt contamination of the waste POL prior to off-site shipment.</P>

<P> Based upon a review of Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 279, &quot;Used Oil Management Standards,&quot; Subpart A, &quot;Definitions,&quot; used oil is defined as any oil refined from crude oil or any synthetic oil that has been used and, as a result of its use, is contaminated by physical or chemical impurities. Subpart B, &quot;Applicability,&quot; states mixtures of used oil and any hazardous waste requires regulation as a hazardous waste under 40 CFR, Parts 260 through 266, 268, 270, and 124, rather than as used oil under 40 CFR 279.</P>

<P> All used oil should be tested using the following methods to determine if it is hazardous waste in accordance with 40 CFR, Parts 261 and 279. Measured values should be compared to those presented in 40 CFR 261.</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Method 1311, &quot;Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP)&quot; (40 CFR 261.24);</P>

<P><li> EPA Method 1010 Pensky Martens Closed Cup (PMCC) Method, or EPA Method 1020;</P>

<P><li> Setaflash Closed Cup (SCC) Method - &quot;Flash Point&quot; (40 CFR 261.21);</P>

<P><li> EPA Method 1110, &quot;Corrosivity (pH)&quot; (40 CFR 261.22);</P>

<P><li> EPA Method 9040 or 9041, &quot;Reactivity&quot; (40 CFR 261.23); and</P>

<P><li> EPA Method 8010, &quot;Halogenated Volatile Organics.&quot;</P>
</ul>

<P> Process knowledge can also be applied to any used oil to eliminate any or all of the above tests. For example, if it is known that no acids or bases were added, or may have been accidentally deposited into the used oil, the corrosivity test may be eliminated. Also, the reactivity test is usually not performed on most used oils.</P>

<P> Used oil becomes hazardous when any one of the four characteristics are met, or when the used oil contains 1,000 ppm or greater total halogens, subject to rebuttal (40 CFR 279).</P>

<P> Assuming the oil meets the criteria of used oil rather than a hazardous waste, it is regulated under 40 CFR 279. Forty CFR 279.1, &quot;Definitions,&quot; defines the following terms:</P>

<P> Used Oil Collection Center: &quot;...means any site or facility that is registered/licensed/permitted/recognized by a state/county/municipal government to manage used oil and accepts/aggregates and stores used oil collected from used oil generators regulated under subpart C of this part who bring used oil to the collection center in shipments of no more than 55 gallons under the provisions of subpart 279.24. Used oil collection centers may also accept used oil from household do-it-yourselfers.&quot;</P>

<P> Used Oil Aggregation Point: &quot;...means any site or facility that accepts, aggregates, and/or stores used oil collected only from other used oil generation sites owned or operated by the owner or operator of the aggregation point, from which used oil is transported to the aggregation point in shipments of no more than 55 gallons. Used oil aggregation points may also accept used oil from household do-it-yourselfers.&quot;</P>

<P> Forty CFR 279, Subpart D - &quot;Standards for Used Oil Collection Centers and Aggregation Points&quot; requires both the used oil collection center and the aggregation point to comply with the requirements of 40 CFR 279, Subpart C, &quot;Standards for Used Oil Generators.&quot; The essential difference between a used oil aggregation point and a collection center is the aggregation point can accept oil only from used oil generation sites owned or operated by the owner or operator of the aggregation point and there is no requirement for state, county, or municipal registry, licensing, permitting, or recognition. In both cases, shipment, acceptance, and transport of used oil is limited to 55 gallons or less. There is no limitation on the amount of used oil that may be accumulated at the collection center or the aggregation point.</P>

<P> Forty CFR 279, Subpart C, &quot;Standards for Used Oil Generators,&quot; requires used oil to be stored in tanks, containers, or units subject to regulation under 40 CFR 264, &quot;Standards for Owners and Operators of Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, and Disposal (TSD) Facilities,&quot; and 40 CFR 265, &quot;Interim Status Standards for Owners and Operators of Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities.&quot; Subpart C, &quot;Standards for Used Oil Generators,&quot; states containers and above ground tanks used to store used oil at generator facilities must be labeled or marked clearly with the words &quot;Used Oil.&quot;</P>

<P> In addition to federal requirements, state regulations should be carefully reviewed to ensure all applicable requirements are met.</P>

<P> The most effective method of minimizing contamination is to segregate the used oil from possible contaminants such as non-petroleum oils, solvents, and antifreeze. This can be done by providing separate, labeled containers for the collection of waste solvents, synthetic oils, glycol, and other materials. Physical separation of the processes using materials which contaminate oil can be helpful in solving the problem.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Material compatibility concerns exist with non-petroleum-based POLs, solvents, fuels (some), and non-POLs such as antifreeze. For example the following materials are not normally mixed with used oils:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Non-petroleum based hydraulic fluids</P>

<P><li> Solvents</P>

<P><li> Parts cleaners</P>

<P><li> Gasoline (MO gas)</P>

<P><li> Antifreeze</P>

<P><li> Methanol</P>

<P><li> Water</P>
</ul>

<P> Waste diesel fuel and jet fuels JP-4 and JP-8 may be acceptable for mixing depending upon the ultimate use of the used oil. For example, if used oil is destined for energy recovery, waste diesel fuel and jet fuels JP-4 and JP-8 may be acceptable for mixing.</P>

<P> With regard to used refrigerant oil, according to 40 CFR Part 266, Subpart E, &quot;Used Oil Burned for Energy Recovery&quot; (enclosed), used oil containing greater than 1,000 ppm total halogens is considered a RCRA hazardous waste under the assumption the oil was mixed with chlorinated hazardous waste. However, if a person can document the used oil was not mixed with chlorinated hazardous wastes (e.g., document the oil is, in fact, used refrigerant oil), the oil does not need to be managed as a hazardous waste, as long as the total halogens do not exceed 4,000 ppm and the used oil is recycled. In order to keep accurate records of the source of the oil, the used refrigerant oil should be kept separate from other types of used oils. Most used refrigerant oils do exhibit greater than 1,000 ppm chlorides. However, if the analytical results of the used refrigerant oil indicate it contains less than 1,000 ppm chlorides, the used refrigerant oil can be mixed with other types of used oils destined for energy recovery. If the amount of chlorides in the oil is variable, the oil must be analyzed each time it is removed from a refrigeration unit before mixing it with other types of oil. Keeping the used refrigerant oil separate from other types of used oil will ensure compliance with the regulations.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> There are minimal safety and health concerns regarding waste oils. Care should be taken when hot oils.  Consult your local health and safety personnel for  specific precautions.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<p>Proper used oil segregation and storage helps:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Ensure the marketability of used oil</P>

<P><li> Generators avoid the high cost of disposing of oil as hazardous waste  </P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Bypass filters are designed to remove smaller particulate than would be removed by the engine's normal filter, so that oil changes are not necessary. Oil added during filter changing, and to replace burned oil, is normally sufficient to replenish the oil's additive package (the component of the oil that is responsible for maintainig pH and preventing deterioration of the oil).</P>

<P> Bypass filters are installed in the engine compartment of a vehicle or, nearby a stationary engine. The bypass filter is fed a slip stream of oil that is bypassed around the engine. There are several different types of bypass filters. Those manufactured by Gulf Coast and Enviro Filtration rely upon filter elements that remove particles down to the 1 to 10 micron range. The Gulf Coast unit is distinctive in that it uses a commonly available roll of toilet paper (or paper towels for larger units) as the filter element. The TF Purifiner unit filters down to 0.5 to 1 micron, and then refines the oil by passing it through a heated element refiner that is vented back into the engine air intake. The heated element volatilizes any unburned fuel, water, or glycols that contaminate the oil and cause the oil's additive package to breakdown. With these systems, the engine's canister filter is changed regularly, and the micron filter is changed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Oil that is used to replenish the oil removed from the system during the filter change, and oil that is added to replace burned oil, is sufficient to keep the additives package intact without ever having to change the vehicle's oil.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> There are minimal safety and health concerns regarding vehicle motor oil. Care must be taken when handling oils that are high in temperature. Proper personal protective equipment is recommended.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Reduce operating expenses by:</P>

<P> - Eliminating oil changes</P>

<P>  - Reducing new oil purchases</P>

<P> - Reducing waste oil handling and disposal</P>

<P><li>Provide environmental benefits by:</P>

<P> - Reducing the use of oil</P>

<P> - Reducing the generation of waste oil</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> <B>TF Purifiner</B></P>

<P> An up to 12 quart capacity bypass filter has a payback period of approximately 14 years for systems operated with conventional oil. If synthetic oil is being processed, the payback period is reduced to approximately 3 years. For an up to 24 quart bypass filter, the payback periods are 5 years and 1.5 years for conventional and synthetic oils, respectively.</P>

<P> <B>Enviro Filtration</B></P>

<P> An up to 12 quart capacity bypass filter has a payback period of approximately 2.2 years for systems operated with conventional oil. If synthetic oil is being processed, the payback period is reduced to approximately 0.8 years. For an up to 24 quart bypass filter, the payback periods are 1.3 years and 0.4 years for conventional and synthetic oils, respectively.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Lead-acid battery recyclers purchase the batteries from the generator for a nominal price.  In this way, some money is recouped from recycling.  When lead-acid batteries are sent to a hazardous waste disposal company, the batteries are still recycled, but the batteries are not purchased from the generator.</P>


<P> The various parts of the lead-acid batteries are recycled.  The sulfuric acid is purified and recycled.  The lead plates are melted, refined, and recycled.  The plastic case is shredded and recycled.</P>

<P> Wet cell lead-acid batteries are routinely collected for recycling at military installations, since most states currently ban the disposal of wet cell lead-acid batteries in landfills.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that approximately 80 percent of all lead-acid car batteries are currently recycled.  Most battery recycling facilities will accept lead-acid batteries.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Handling lead-acid batteries can be dangerous in terms of possible explosions and exposure to sulfuric acid.  In addition, the batteries themselves can be fairly heavy and hard to lift, such as out of the engine bay.  Therefore, safe work practices and proper personal protective equipment is recommended.</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Offsite recycling of hydraulic fluid is performed by numerous companies using a variety of technologies. Although a technically viable option for pollution prevention, offsite recycling tends to be significantly more expensive than disposal.  To secure a successful off-site recycling program, off-site recycling costs must be less than the sum of disposal costs plus the cost of new hydraulic fluid, as illustrated in the economic analysis in this datasheet.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Mixtures of certain hydraulic fluids may not be acceptable for recycling.  Consult the recycler for specific requirements.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> Personnel handling hot hydraulic fluid should take necessary precautions. Use of the proper personal protective equipment is recommended. Consult your local health and safety personnel for specific precautions.</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P><B>Substitute for:</B> Disposal of Drums as Hazardous Waste</P>

<P><B>Applicable EPCRA Targeted Constituent:</B> Lead (CAS: 7439-92-1), Chromium (CAS: 7440-47-3)</P>
<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> In general, drum washers/recyclers wash contaminated drums inside an enclosed chamber.  Drums can range in size from 5 gallon pails to 55-90-gallon drums.  There are numerous suppliers of this type of equipment and multiple options which can be specified for unique site needs.  Units have both interior and exterior washing capability.  Some units use heated water and detergent dispensing systems and a rinse cycle.  The wastewater should be tested for hazardous contaminants.  Other units offer an option for solvent washing.  Some options include stainless steel construction, recirculating rinse tanks, live steam capability, explosion proofing, automatic cycle timers, and remotely located controls which can be operated from non-hazardous areas.  </P>

<P> Navy personnel collect hazardous waste from on-base generators using 55-gallon drums.  After pumping out the waste, the drums are disposed of as hazardous waste.  Empty drums which formerly contained hazardous materials or wastes and which are in good condition can be re-used as collection containers for hazardous wastes, in lieu of purchasing new drums.  Various hazardous materials and other chemicals used by the Navy are delivered in large metal drums.</P>

<P> According to the U.S. EPA, empty drums which contained hazardous materials are exempt from hazardous waste regulation in 40 CFR Section 261.7.  For hazardous wastes that are not &#147;acute&#148; as listed in 40 CFR 261.31, 261.32, or 261.33, empty is defined as containing less than three percent of the original contents (by weight) or less than one inch of residue on the bottom.  Drums that contained acute hazardous waste are empty after they have been triple rinsed with a solvent (which may be water) capable of removing the product.  Rinse water is the only waste stream from this process and it should be tested for hazardous substances to determine the method of treatment required. Damaged or excess metal drums can be conditioned or washed and recycled as ferrous scrap metal.  A drum washing system manufactured by Enviro-Techniques Products, Inc. has been installed at North Island Naval Air Station, San Diego, CA.  The facility is currently defining an operating procedure.</P>

<P> For additional information, see the Re-use and Recycling of Metal and Plastic Drums Datasheet.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Empty drums should be stored and handled as if the drums were still full (i.e. store incompatibles separately), until properly washed.  Rinse waters will contain the residues from the drums; therefore, segregation of incompatibles and proper treatment of rinse water is essential.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Because the systems are enclosed, exposure to chemicals being removed from the drums is minimized.  Automatic shut-down when unsafe conditions (overheating and electrical shorting) are detected by the electronic controller.  Consult your local industrial health specialist, the base safety office, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementation.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Eliminates disposal of drums as hazardous waste, thereby reducing hazardous waste quantities</P>

<P><li> Avoids hazardous waste transportation and disposal costs</P>

<P><li> Washing and re-using drums saves the cost of purchasing new drums</P>

<P><li> Recycling damaged drums generates income</P>

<P><li> More effective than triple rinsing and less labor intensive</P>

<P><li> Less exposure of workers to chemicals being removed as compared to manual triple-rinsing</P>

<P><li> Some drum washers are compatible with solvent solutions</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Wastewater from drum washing may require special treatment depending on the test results of the rinse water</P>

<P><li> Drum washing using this type of self-contained equipment <B>DOES NOT</B> qualify a drum as a DOT reconditioned metal drum as defined in 49 CFA 173.28(C)</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> The cost elements of washing drums are compared to the disposal of drums as a hazardous waste and the purchase of new drums.</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> 500 metal drums per year</P>

<P><li> Weight per empty drum:  10 lbs</P>

<P><li> Same amount of labor expended to collect drums for washing or disposing</P>

<P><li> Drums washed at 5 drums per hour</P>

<P><li> Labor rate: $30/hr</P>

<P><li> Waste water treatment per drum: 5 gallons</P>

<P><li> Waste water treatment cost: $0.25/drum</P>

<P><li> Wash solution requirements: 55 gallons to wash approximately 200 drums</P>

<P><li> Cost of wash solution: $800/55 gallon drum</P>

<P><li> Disposal cost for hazardous waste: $0.60/lb</P>

<P><li> Utilities to operate: $125/yr to heat water and $75/yr to operate washer</P>

<P><li> Recycling profit: $20/ton</P>

<P><li> Unit cost: $23,000</P>

<P><li> Installation cost: $7,000</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Off-site heat recovery is the most common ultimate disposal method of used oil in the United States. Processors of used oil typically collect automotive and industrial oil, perform limited processing on it to remove water and sediment, and offer the used oil for sale, primarily to fuel blenders and industrial fuel burners. Some fuel processors may use the blended fuel on site in their own boilers and industrial furnaces.</P>

<P> Off-site heat recovery is facilitated by waste oil processors who collect, process, and burn or offer for sale the processed product as specification fuel. Processing is a physical/chemical process that may include: 1) blending with virgin petroleum, 2) blending to meet fuel specification, 3) filtration to remove sediment and/or water, 4) simple distillation to remove water, and 5) physical/chemical separation. The specification fuel is then burned or sold to industrial facilities to be burned for energy recovery.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Materials that are not suited for this type of disposal should not be mixed with the waste oil.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> Care must be taken when handling the waste oils due to high temperatures. Proper personal protective equipment is recommended.  Consult your local health and safety personnel prior to implementing this pollution prevention opportunity.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Hazardous waste disposal is avoided</P>

<P><li> An abundance of used oil transporters and processors exist</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>

<P>N/A</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> Economics are usually favorable for off-site heat recovery of waste oil.  Specific economics should be performed on a case-by-case basis, since handling charges differ from one oil transporter/processor to another.</P>

<h3>Approval Authority:</h3>

<p> Navy:  Approval is controlled locally and should be implemented only after engineering approval has been granted.  Major claimant approval is not required.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Using individual, dedicated (compartmentalized) recycling containers to separate common recyclables such as plastics, glass, paper, cans, and compostables from both residential and commercial waste streams eliminates or reduces the need to sort the materials at the recycling center and results in lower processing costs.  The containers may be placed at exterior or interior locations around the residential or work areas, allowing the residents or personnel to place each type of material in its own bin.</P>

<P> Containers are made in a wide range of sizes and types, suitable for a large variety of applications.  Examples of these containers are listed below:
<BR></P>
<ul>
<P><li> Personal desk-top office paper recycling containers</P>

<P><li> Centralized recycling containers</P>

<P><li> Containers for residential recyclables</P>

<P><li> Modified trash cans, compartmentalized to permit the separation of household kitchen wastes (e.g. cans, plastic, and compostables)</P>
</ul>

<P> Source separation of recyclables by the waste generators requires consistent education and program support to prevent them from becoming contaminated with other materials.  All recycling containers should be clearly labeled with the types of material that are acceptable posted on the container, as well as who to call (name and phone number) for further information.  Color coded containers for each material type will help users quickly identify the proper container.  A trash can should be placed next to all recycling stations to reduce contamination.  Regularly publicizing the location and availability of the containers will bring in new users and keep the old ones current.  </P>

<P> In an office, recycling containers should be placed so that using them is as convenient as putting the material in the trash.  For material such as office paper that is generated sheet by sheet, desktop or individual containers are recommended.  For less commonly generated items, such as aluminum cans, a centralized set of containers should suffice.  A single bin that is compartmentalized for different materials may be difficult to empty unless special handling equipment is purchased.  Containers that contain single material types are more suitable for collection.</P>

<P> The use of collection containers for recycling is a simple and effective pollution prevention opportunity.  Normal office and household wastes are recycled without producing any new waste streams.  It also helps to foster pollution prevention awareness among the office and residential areas where they are used. </P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> The establishment of a good housekeeping program to prevent odors, visual nuisance and pest (i.e. rodents and insects) propagation is required when implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Reduction of landfilled waste through recycling and composting</P>

<P><li> Lower processing costs for recyclables </P>

<P><li> Separating recyclables and/or compostables at the source of generation eliminates the need for a  materials recovery facility</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Mixing of material types often occurs and the material may require further sorting</P>

<P><li> Some participants who do not understand which materials belong in a category, or find it too difficult to separate the materials may stop recycling</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> Recycling programs usually depend upon some type of collection container.  Containers range in size and functionality from small household or office bins, to wheeled carts, to single or multiple material drop-off containers  The approximate costs of some types of containers are listed below.  The exact cost will depend upon quantity ordered and shipping distance.</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Permanent filters are full-flow filtration units that contain a reusable, stainless steel wire cloth filter installed inside a serviceable housing. The filter removes solids just as a normal canister filter would. The advantage to using a permanent filter is that the permanent filter can be cleaned and reused many times, eliminating the need for disposal of canister filters.</P>

<P> With a permanent filter, the standard canister filter is replaced with an adapter which spins onto the filter header. The adapter directs oil into hoses, which take the oil to the permanent filter housing, where the oil is passed through a stainless steel screen-type filter element. Filter elements can remove particles down to various sizes with 5 to 10, 15, 28, 40, and 60 microns being typical. The 28 or 40 micron filter element is the typical size used for vehicle engines and is comparable to a conventional canister filter. After filtration, the oil is returned to the adapter and recirculated through the engine.</P>

<P> The RACOR Tattletale Filter is equipped with a by-pass when the wire cloth filter element restricts flow due to clogging. At this point, a signal light tells the operator that there is a need for service. To service the filter, the filter housing is disassembled, and the wire cloth screen is soft brushed in solvent or cleaned in a parts washer. The clean filter is then put back into service. A visual evaluation of dirt accumulated on the filter may be helpful in diagnosing engine wear problems.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> There are minimal safety and health concerns regarding vehicle motor oil. Care must be taken while handling oils when high in temperature. Proper personal protective equipment is recommended.  Consult your local health and safety personnel before implementing this pollution prevention opportunity.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> There are no canister filters to be removed, drained, crushed, or disposed</P>

<P>   <li> An indicator light reveals when filter is ready for servicing</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> A wood tub grinder is used to reduce wood or other organic matter into small particles.  The larger-sized output material from the tub grinder can be used as a biomass fuel or as a bulking agent to balance high nitrogen loads in composting operations.  The smaller-sized material is composted.  The upper section of a tub grinder is a large, revolving tub and the stationary, lower section contains a hammer mill.  Typically, the tub grinder is fed by a front-end loader or stationary grapple, while a conveyor carries away the continuous stream of shredded material.  Tub grinders are not limited in opening size like smaller chippers and shredders, and can process large and odd shaped wood including stumps, pallets, and waste lumber.  </P>

<P> Normal tub widths range from 6 to 14 feet in diameter.  Most Navy buyers prefer an 8 foot tub width.  Engine horsepower can range from 100 hp to 800 hp.  A 575 hp tub grinder is capable of providing a throughput of up to 120 tons per hour.  Grinder weight varies from 5,000 pounds to 60,000 pounds.  The entire tub grinder assembly is usually moveable from one site to another.</P>

<P> Complete recovery of yard waste will reduce the amount of waste disposed by an average of 15.9% while the addition of wood waste will divert another 6.6% (EPA, 1994).</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Safety issues for using tub grinders concerns the operation of power equipment.  Operators should be specifically trained to use the grinder.  Machinery should not be used if workers are on medication.  Proper personal protectivon equipment (PPE) including gloves, eye protection, and hearing protection should be used if needed.</P>

<P> Consult the base safety office on proper protective gear and training prior to using mechanized equipment.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Produces usable products such as landscape mulch, fuel, and compost agents</P>

<P><li> Grinds material to a fine, even texture that will compost quickly</P>

<P><li> Can process large trees and finished lumber</P>

<P><li> If all yard waste is ground and diverted, there is a possible average 15.9% reduction in waste (EPA 1994) disposed in landfills</P>

<P><li> If all wood is ground and diverted, there is an additional 6.6% possible reduction in waste (EPA, 1994) disposed in landfills</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>

<P>N/A</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> Typical application: 8 foot tub grinder, 110 hp diesel; capital cost - $40,000; operating cost - $70/hour (includes labor, fuel, and maintenance).</P>

<P> Chipper applications: at 25 to 50 cubic yards per hour; capital cost: $10,000 to $40,000 (with replacement blades at approximately $70 to $200).</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Process 1,000 tons/yr of wood waste</P>

<P><li> Produce 1,000 tons/yr of mulch</P>

<P><li> Capital costs: $40,000</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Classification of used oil filters as non-hazardous solid waste for disposal purposes or for metal recycling can often be accomplished by crushing or otherwise voiding the filters of oil.  Crushing and draining used oil filters to manage as non-hazardous solid waste reduces hazardous waste disposal costs.  Waste managers must contact recycling facilities to ensure drainage techniques and handling methods are compatible with the recycling facility's requirements.  Waste managers must also contact their state to verify what requirements may apply beyond the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements.  Several states have more stringent requirements and do not allow the disposal of oil filters in landfills.</P>

<P> The EPA used oil filter regulation, published in the Code of Federal Regulations, 40 CFR 261.4(b)(13), excludes oil filters from hazardous waste regulations provided that three criteria are met: 1) the filters must not be terne plated; 2) must not be mixed with other hazardous waste; and 3) must be gravity hot-drained.  These criteria are further explained as follows.</P>

<P> <B>Non-Terne Plated</B></P>

<P> Terne is an alloy of tin and lead formerly used to cover the interior of oil filters.  The lead content may cause terne-plated filters to exhibit the hazardous waste characteristic of toxicity.</P>

<P> <B>Mixture Rule</B></P>

<P> According to 40 CFR 261.3(a)(2)(iii-iv), mixtures of solid wastes and hazardous wastes are regulated as hazardous wastes.  Used oil filters mixed with hazardous waste are classified as hazardous waste.</P>

<P> <B>Gravity Hot-Draining</B></P>

<P> 40 CFR 261.4(b)(13) specifies used oil filters must be gravity hot-drained using one of the following methods:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Puncturing the anti-drain back valve or dome end</P>

<P><li> Crushing</P>

<P><li> Dismantling</P>

<P><li> Using any other method which will remove oil</P>
</ul>

<P> The EPA defines hot-draining in 57 Federal Register 21523 as draining the oil filter near engine operating temperature and above room temperature (i.e. 60 degrees F).  The EPA also recommends a minimum hot-drain time of 12 hours.  The preamble also states, &quot;if an oil filter is picked up by hand or lifted by machinery and used oil immediately drips or runs from the filter, the filter should not be considered to be drained.&quot;  Some states require a greater amount of oil to be removed from the filters before recycling.</P>

<P> Oil filters are currently collected for recycling at Naval Station San Diego.  The filters are crushed using a commercial filter crusher.  All free-flowing oil is removed and collected during the crushing process.  The used filters are gathered until a minimum of 5,000 pounds are accumulated.  The collected filters are shipped to a local steel mill, where they are used as feed stock in the company's steel mill operations.  </P>

<P> An oil filter crushing operation has also been established at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.  This operation has been very successful in minimizing the hazardous waste disposal costs associated with oil filters.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Oil filters should be segregated from hazardous wastes so that they will not be considered hazardous waste under the &#147;Mixture Rule&#148;. </P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Care must be taken when handling oil filters.  Skin absorption is a concern when handling oil containing metals.  Proper personal protection equipment (PPE) is recommended.  Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Eliminates the cost and liability associated with hazardous waste disposal</P>

<P><li> Minimizes the volume of waste disposed</P>

<P><li> Produces steel products through recycling of the filters</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Specific criteria must be met before oil filters can be classified as non-hazardous</P>

<P><li> Some states may not allow disposal of oil filters</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> The cost for oil filter crushers range from $1,500 to $5,000, depending on the crusher size needed and particular specifications.  Depending on the endpoint of the crushed filters (recycled or disposed as solid waste) the economics also vary.  However, in either situation, a cost savings should be realized due to the reduction of hazardous waste disposal fees and future liability.</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> 2,000 oil filters recycled per year</P>

<P><li> Approximately one ounce of oil generated per crushed filter</P>

<P><li> 100 hours annual labor for operating system, storage, paperwork, and arranging delivery</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> A recycling sorting line (RSL), also known as a clean material recovery facility (clean MRF) processes commingled recyclables from curbside collection programs, drop-off sites or satellite recycling centers.  A properly designed RSL will process and recover up to 90 percent of the collected material.  Recovered material is ultimately re-sold to specialty recyclers.  Materials processed include newspaper; steel and aluminum cans; brown, green, and clear glass; polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastics.  A RSL serving a small community is typically designed to process less than 50 tons per day of recyclables.  A RSL serving a municipality can process 200 to 300 tons per day of recyclables.</P>

<P> RSL designs can vary significantly.  RSL sorting systems can be fully automated, partially automated, or consist solely of manual sorting systems.    A combined system of automated and manual sorting usually begins with automated sizing and sorting, and ends with manual sorting.  The type of recyclables processed, and anticipated current and future processing rates need to be considered when designing a RSL.  However, the basic features of the RSL site are similar for all types of RSLs.  Each RSL includes a customer vehicle weigh scales; areas for queuing and maneuvering; recyclable shipping; vehicle parking; and outdoor storage of recyclables.  The main building housing the RSL will typically include a tipping floor for dumping recyclables, areas for sorting materials and processing recyclables, interim storage of recyclable materials, and warehouse storage for processed recyclables awaiting shipment.  </P>

<P> The RSL tipping floor is divided into separate areas for source-separated recyclables and commingled paper and recyclables.  At the tipping floor, a rubber-tired loader transports the recyclables onto incline conveyors.  These conveyors transport the recyclables to a sorting area, usually located 10 to 20 feet above the ground level.  Sorting is conducting at the sorting area, and recovered recyclables are dropped into appropriate segregated collection bins.</P>

<P> Automated sorting systems sort containers by size, density, and/or material chemical composition.   These automated sorting systems may consist of trommels, disk and vibrating screens, density sorters, and magnetic separators.  A trommel, or rotating drum screen, sorts material by size.  The outside of the trommel consists of a screen with small holes that grow larger along the length of the screen.  Small containers, like aluminum and tin cans fall through the smaller screen holes.  Plastic soda bottles and milk jugs pass through the larger holes.  </P>

<P> Disk and vibrating screens also sort by size.  The disk screen employs a series of parallel rotating shafts affixed with discs that are staggered from one shaft to the next.  Between the shafts and the discs are openings where small materials fall as they pass over the surface of the rotating discs.  Larger materials ride along the discs onto a conveyor.  </P>

<P> Density sorting subjects the materials to an air stream, also known as an air knife or air classifier.  The air stream velocity is pre-set so that lighter materials such as plastic or aluminum cans are blown away from heavier materials such as glass containers.  </P>

<P> Magnetic equipment sorts materials by chemical composition through removing ferrous metals or using eddy current separators to create an electric current in aluminum materials that propels the aluminum away from other materials.  </P>

<P> Manual sorting systems generally consist of flat conveyor belts where workers remove recyclables by hand from the belt as they pass by.  The conveyor belt for sorting may be 50 to 100 feet long to accommodate between five and 20 sorters.  The length of the belt depends on the number of types of recyclables and the total amount of each type of recyclable being sorted.  Glass is usually separated by hand, in order to ensure the separation of clear, brown, and green glass.  </P>

<P> Once the recyclables are separated, they must be processed into materials for sale.  Processing typically includes baling for paper, tin cans, and plastic bottles; flattening or densifying for aluminum cans; granulating or perforating for plastic bottles; and crushing for glass bottles.  Once processed, the materials are sold directly to specialty recyclers for re-use.</P>

<P> RSLs operated by municipalities have had a dramatic effect on reducing the reliance on landfills.  The use of RSLs have, in many states, been mandated by legislation requiring a significant reduction in landfill disposal.  California Assembly Bill 939 requires every city and county in California to reduce its landfill waste stream 25% by 1995 and 50% by the year 2000.  Similar mandates are now law in many other states.  The employment of RSLs in conjunction with commingled recycling programs have greatly assisted municipalities in achieving these goals.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Material Compatibility issues are specific to the design of the RSL.  Most notably, materials that are not processed by the RSL should not be commingled with other recyclables.  Education is a key element to ensure that users of a curbside collection program are well informed as to the types of recyclables processed by the RSL.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Safety issues for operators working at an RSL include the operation of power equipment, respiration, eye, ear, and dermal protection.  Proper personal protective equipment including gloves, eye protection, respiratory protection, and hearing protection should be used.  Operators should be specifically trained in the use of all machinery.  Machinery should not be used if workers are intoxicated or on medication.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Saves landfill space</P>

<P><li> Allows municipalities to meet mandated landfill reduction goals</P>

<P><li> Income is generated from the sale of recyclables</P>

<P><li> Cost savings in landfill tipping fees</P>

<P><li> Conserves resources</P>

<P><li> Generates community interest in recycling</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> High capital cost</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> The cost of the equipment and installation of a RSL varies depending upon the size.   A small RSL non-automated system which includes balers, will cost on average from $500,000 to $700,000.  A large system can cost $1,500,000 or more depending upon the equipment and degree of automation.  When conducting an economic analysis for a new RSL, it is critical that the amounts and types of materials processed be well defined, as well as the markets and finished specifications for these materials.  The market price for recyclables is volatile and as a consequence, predicting the long term revenue obtained from a RSL is difficult.  Since there are no long-term markets in recyclables, operators of successful RSLs must research markets on a frequent basis.  The volatility of the marketplace makes it necessary for RSL operators to avoid long-term contracts in order to stay on top of changing commodity prices and to not get locked into a price that has the potential of increasing.  The recent high cost of landfill disposal has enhanced the economics of RSLs.</P>

<P> The economic analysis presented below is for a successful RSL located in the midwestern United States.  This RSL serves a community of approximately 50,000 people.  The facility is processing approximately 500 tons per month of recyclables, with well over 70% of all households in the area participating in the commingled recycling program.  </P>

<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Monthly processing rate: 500 tons/month of recyclable</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> A solid waste sorting line (SWSL), also known as a dirty material recovery facility (dirty MRF) processes recyclables from a stream of raw solid waste and is typically used in rural areas with no curbside programs or in communities that are not actively promoting recycling.  A properly designed SWSL will process and recover between five and 45 percent of the incoming material as recyclables, then the remainder is used in a waste-to-energy facility, landfilled or otherwise disposed.  Materials processed as recyclables include newspaper; steel and aluminum cans; brown, green and clear glass; polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastics.  A SWSL serving a small community is typically designed to process less than 200 tons per day of solid waste.  A SWSL serving a municipality can process 700 tons per day of solid waste.  In many cases SWSLs are operated by independent private contractors that haul commercial waste.  Rather than hauling the waste directly to the landfill, the trucks stop at a SWSL and recyclable material is extracted.  Only the material for which there is no market goes to the landfill.</P>

<P> SWSL designs can vary significantly.  SWSL sorting systems can be fully automated, partially automated or consist solely of manual sorting systems.    A combined system of automated and manual sorting usually begins with automated sizing and sorting and ends with manual sorting.  The type of recyclables processed, and anticipated current and future processing rates need to be considered when designing a SWSL.  SWSLs typically include a customer vehicle weigh scale and areas for queuing and maneuvering; recyclable shipping; vehicle parking; and outdoor storage of recyclables.  The main building housing the SWSL will typically include a tipping floor for dumping mixed solid waste and areas for sorting materials and processing recyclables, interim storage of recyclable materials and warehouse storage for processed recyclables awaiting shipment.  </P>

<P> At the tipping floor, a rubber-tired loader spreads the waste out for inspection.  At this stage, hazardous items and appliances are recovered.  The loader then transports the solid waste onto incline conveyors.  These conveyors transport the solid waste to a sorting area, usually located 10 to 20 feet above the ground level.  Sorting is conducting at the sorting area, and recovered recyclables are dropped into appropriate segregated collection bins.</P>

<P> In an automated system, the initial sorting operation usually removes bulky or dangerous items, followed by waste screening to remove small grit.  This screening operation can also  remove aluminum and tin cans.  An air classifier, the most common density sorting system used at a SWSL, is used to split the solid waste stream into heavy and light fractions, which allows the other sorting operations to specialize in the most common materials found in the respective fraction.  The light fraction includes paper, aluminum cans and plastic, while the heavy fraction includes glass and ferrous materials.  Equipment that sorts by chemical composition such as magnets and eddy current separators are commonly used in automated SWSLs.  </P>

<P> Manual sorting follows automated sorting.  The waste travels down a flat conveyor belt and workers remove the recyclables as they pass by.  The conveyor belt for sorting may be as long as 50 to 100 feet to accommodate between five and 20 sorters.  The length of the belt depends on the number of types of recyclables and the total amount of each type of recyclable being sorted.  </P>

<P> Once the recyclables are separated, they must be processed into materials for sale.  Processing typically includes baling for paper, tin cans, and plastic bottles, flattening or densifying for aluminum cans; granulating or perforating for plastic bottles; and crushing for glass bottles.  Once processed, the materials are sold directly to specialty recyclers for re-use.</P>

<P> If the residual solid waste can be used in a waste-to-energy facility, additional processing is required.  In addition to balers, SWSLs employ other processing equipment including shredders, pelletizers and compactors.  A shredder reduces the volume and increases the uniformity of the residual solid waste for use at a waste-to-energy facility.  Pelletizers receive shredded waste and extrude it under high pressure to form small pellets.  The pellets may then be used as fuel for a furnace or power plant.  </P>

<P> Compactors are typically used to process residual solid waste bound for landfills.  Compactors are large balers that compress either shredded or un-shredded waste into large bales weighing up to 29 tons.  The compactor loads the bales into trailers for transport to a disposal site, which ensures the maximum legal load in the to reduce hauling costs.  </P>

<P> SWSLs operated by municipalities have had a dramatic effect on reducing the reliance on landfills.  The use of SWSLs have, in many states, been mandated by legislation requiring a significant reduction in landfill disposal.  California Assembly Bill 939 requires every city and county in California to reduce its landfill waste stream 25% by 1995 and 50% by the year 2000.  Similar mandates are now law in many other states.  The employment of SWSLs have greatly assisted municipalities in achieving these goals.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Material Compatibility issues are specific to the design of the SWSL.  Most notably, materials must be inspected when received at the tipping floor to ensure that materials not compatible to the operation of the SWSL are not processed.  The proper removal and treatment of hazardous materials or wastes is a necessity.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Safety issues for operators working at an SWSL include the operation of power equipment, respiration, eye, ear, and dermal protection.  Proper personal protective equipment including gloves, eye protection, respiratory protection, and hearing protection should be used.  Operators should be specifically trained in the use of all machinery.  Machinery should not be used if workers are intoxicated or on medication.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing thisany of these technologyies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Saves landfill space</P>

<P><li> Allows municipalities to meet mandated landfill reduction goals</P>

<P><li> Income is generated from the sale of recyclables</P>

<P><li> Cost savings in landfill tipping fees</P>

<P><li> Conserves resources, including energy</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> High capital cost</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> The cost of the equipment and installation of a SWSL varies depending upon the size.   A small SWSL non-automated system, including balers will cost on average from $500,000 to $700,000.  A large system can cost $1,500,000 or more depending upon the equipment and degree of automation.  When conducting an economic analysis for a new SWSL, it is critical that the amounts and types of materials processed be well defined, as well as the markets and finished specifications for these materials.  The market price for recyclables is volatile and as a consequence, predicting the long term revenue obtained from a SWSL is difficult.  Since there are no long-term markets in recyclables, operators of successful SWSLs must research markets on a frequent basis.  The volatility of the marketplace makes it necessary for SWSL operators to avoid long-term contracts in order to stay on top of changing commodity prices and to not get locked into a price that has the potential of increasing.  The recent high cost of landfill disposal has enhanced the economics of SWSLs.</P>

<P> The economic analysis presented below is for a successful SWSL located in the eastern United States.  The facility is processing approximately 1000 tons per month of solid waste</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Aerated static pile composting is a process that biodegrades organic material and destroys pathogens, producing a stabilized compost product that can be used as mulch, soil conditioner, or a soil amendment.  Aerated static pile composting can be used to compost yard waste, food, paper, municipal solid waste, and sewage sludge.  </P>

<P> The process for composting begins with collecting, processing, and storing feedstock materials, followed by mixing and pile construction.  The compostable materials must be screened for non-biodegradable contaminants and then chipped or shredded into uniform particles that will decompose quickly.  The high-carbon (dry wood and paper) waste should be mixed in equal proportion with high-nitrogen, high moisture (grass clippings and food) waste to provide balanced nutrition for the organisms of decomposition.  The mixed feedstock materials are then formed into piles to decompose.  </P>

<P> Pile sizes are typically three to four meters high, six to eight meters wide, and 30 to 40 meters in length.  Perforated pipes are laid under each compost pile.  Each pipe in the aeration system is connected to blowers that blow air through the pipes.  The pipes are typically covered with a layer of wood chips that facilitates the distribution of air, providing uniform aeration.  The compost mix is placed on top of the wood chip layer forming the piles.  The piles are then covered with a layer of material, usually recycled cured compost, for insulation.  Pile temperature is controlled by increasing aeration to vent the excess heat.</P>

<P> Oxygen and temperature are key environmental parameters that must be maintained within a specific range to provide optimum conditions for the microorganisms.  The temperature generated from decomposition must be high enough to kill pathogens and weed seeds but not the microorganisms.  </P>

<P> Following the composting period (typically 30 days for biosolids), the piles are broken down and reconstructed into curing piles for additional aging and drying of the material.  Curing compost stabilizes it to prevent odors or other nuisances from developing while the material is stored.  After curing, the compost can be screened to improve the quality of the final compost product.</P>

<H3>Material Compatibility:</H3>

<p>N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> As long as no meat or animal products are included, compost does not pose health risks and can be touched with bare hands.  Some people may wish to use a mask when turning compost to prevent inhaling bacteria or particles.</P>

<P> Consult the base safety office and your local industrial health specialist to determine the proper personal protection equipment (PPE) and the necessary training prior to using this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Complete composting of yard waste will reduce the amount of waste disposed by an average of 15.9% while the addition of food waste will divert another 6.7% (EPA, 1994)</P>

<P><li> The aerated static pile method requires less land than other methods</P>

<P><li> It produces compost quickly</P>

<P><li> It is possible to contain odors</P>

<P><li> Indoor operation reduces access to scavengers</P>

<P><li> Controlled conditions can produce a high quality, marketable compost</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:  </H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Higher capital cost, and requires more resources to operate than outdoor methods</P>

<P><li> Requires maintenance to keep perforated pipes from clogging.  Clogged pipes will reduce the efficiently of the systems</P>

<P> Capital costs for an enclosed facility processing approximately 5,000 tons/yr of wood and yard waste is approximately $2,000,000 to $5,000,000.  The capital cost, not including land, for an open facility will be decreased by building costs (approximately $75/sq. ft.).  Estimated annual operating costs may run $10 to $70/ton (including labor, benefits, amendment grinding, maintenance, etc.).  This economic analysis is based on an industry survey of yard waste composting facilities using the median values from the survey.</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Although appliances comprise only a small portion of the municipal waste disposed in landfills, they do have a market value and it&#146;s important to remember that recycling saves resources, energy, and reduces pollution.  All appliances are recyclable, including refrigerators, washers, dryers, air conditioners, water heaters, and de-humidifiers.</P>

<P> Appliance recyclers specialize in recovering all hazardous materials and wastes from an appliance prior to recycling the appliance as scrap metal.  For a small fee, appliance recyclers will pick up the appliance, transport it to their recycling facility and conduct a multi-stage recycling program to recover all hazardous materials and wastes.  The following table presents the typical hazardous materials and wastes recovered from appliances and their ultimate destination.</P>

<P> Appliance recycling should only be conducted by fully licensed recyclers.</P>

<P> Approximately 20 states have regulations restricting the disposal of appliances in municipal landfills.  California, New Jersey, and New York have strict regulations regarding appliance disposal.  Check with your state representative to determine the regulations in your area.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Appliance recycling should only be conducted by trained professionals in a licensed recycling facility.  CFC recovery must be conducted in facilities equipped for proper CFC recovery and in accordance with Clean Air Act requirements.  Gas operated appliances should not be recycled due to potential explosion hazards.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Reduces the volume of waste disposed in landfills</P>

<P><li> Conserves natural resources needed to produce CFCs, mercury, oil, and steel</P>

<P><li> Reduces landfill disposal fees</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Currently not marketable in some regions</P>

<P><li> Scrape metal recyclers may refuse to accept metal from appliances due to potential exposure to PCB and mercury components.  Recycling conducted by trained licensed recycling contractors mitigates this concern.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> Appliance recycling should only be conducted by trained licensed recycling contractors.  Recycling costs vary and are dependent upon the quantity of appliances recycled and the region.  Utility supported recycling programs are currently conducted in California and New York.  These programs are free and in some cases include cash incentives.  These programs typically require that the recycled appliance is in good working order and is currently serving as a second (spare) appliance in the household.  </P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview: </H3>

<p>Disposal of spent photographic and X-ray processing and printing solutions is expensive and difficult. The wastes generated by these processes typically contain elevated concentrations of heavy metals, organic compounds, and other toxic constituents unacceptable for direct discharge to a sewer system. In addition, as a result of the specialized characteristics of these solutions, they generally have very little, if any, value other than for their intended application. There are, however, various technologies that can be applied to treat certain solutions prior to disposal and/or to recover constituents of the waste streams which have value (e.g. silver recovery from specific photographic process wastes).</P>

<P> Silver may cause a material to be classified as a RCRA-hazardous waste by the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) (40 CFR 261.24). However, for a material to be a RCRA-hazardous waste, it must first fit the definition of a solid waste under RCRA (40 CFR 261).</P>

<P> Per a July 16, 1990, letter from Sylvia Lowrance (EPA) to Ralph Eschborn, the EPA considers spent photographic solutions as &quot;spent materials,&quot; which is a subcategory of solid wastes (40 CFR 261.2 [c], Table 1). Further interpretation is provided by a February 28, 1994, letter from Michael Shapiro (EPA) to Scott Donovan:</P>

<P>&quot;Provided that economically significant quantities of silver are reclaimed from the [spent] solution, [then] the generation, transport, and storage prior to reclamation of the solutions is not subject to the general RCRA Subtitle C requirements for recyclable materials... but rather a different set of regulatory requirements specified at 40 CFR Part 266 Subpart F [40 CFR 266.70].&quot; In addition, &quot;Under RCRA Subtitle C regulation [and 40 CFR 261.2 (c), Table 1.], characteristic sludges being reclaimed are not within the definition of solid waste.&quot;</P>

<P> In summary, 40 CFR 266.70 states that persons who generate, transport, or store recyclable materials that are reclaimed to recover economically significant amounts of gold, silver, platinum, or any combination of these must apply for an EPA or EPA-approved state generator identification number, and must also use the EPA or EPA-approved state manifest system to document all off-site transportation of solutions destined for reclamation of precious metals. However, once reclaimed, the silver is exempt from all hazardous waste regulations. Also, if the resulting treated liquid does not exceed the RCRA toxicity characteristic limits for silver (5 mg/L) or any other TCLP compound, than it is considered to be a non-hazardous material.</P>

<P> There are various technologies for recovering/recycling materials from spent photographic and X-ray processing and printing waste solutions. The most concentrated silver-containing waste in film and image processing is spent or excess fixer bath solution. In a typical film developing operation, fixer solution is continuously added to maintain solution strength. As a result, there is generally an overflow of fixer from the bath. The concentration of silver in the overflow may vary greatly depending on the type and amount of film processed, frequently exceeding 5 grams per liter. Because of this high silver concentration, silver recovery from the fixer solution is cost effective.</P>

<P> When the film is moved from the fixer to the rinse, it carries a small amount of silver which is removed by the rinse water. Rinse waters contain low concentrations of silver, ranging from less than 1 milligram per liter (mg/L) to greater than 5 mg/L. Although there is little economic benefit to recovering silver from rinse water, environmental regulations prohibit discharge of untreated rinse water if the silver concentration exceeds regulatory limits. Nearly all the silver in photographic wastes is bound up in silver thiosulfate complexes, which are highly stable. However, federal, state, and local regulations governing silver-containing wastes do not distinguish between different forms of silver.</P>

<P> There are several technology categories that are used for silver recovery, including precipitation, ion exchange, reductive exchange, electrolytic recovery, reverse osmosis, and electrodialysis. The specific technology to be applied for a particular waste stream will be based on the waste characteristics, volume, and treatment objectives. For example, if reduction of silver concentrations to meet wastewater effluent limitations is the primary treatment objective, then a technology which achieves extremely high silver recovery from the waste stream is probably not a cost-effective application. On the other hand, in cases where silver recovery is of primary importance, then application of a highly efficient system, such as reverse osmosis or ion exchange, makes sense. The following paragraphs provide brief descriptions of various technologies used for treating silver-laden waste streams. Although this discussion centers on the application of these technologies for silver treatment and/or recovery, these technologies are also effective in addressing additional waste constituents, as described herein.</P>
<ol>
<P><li> Waste Stream Heavy Metal Precipitation: Hydroxide precipitation of metal-laden wastewater is a common technology that has been proven effective for several decades. The concept of this technology includes adjustment of the waste stream pH to a level at which the targeted metal is least soluble and will readily precipitate from solution. Precipitated solids are agglomerated, allowed to settle out, and then withdrawn from the treatment unit as a metal hydroxide sludge. Since the optimal treatment pH for various targeted metal species ranges from about pH 7 to over pH 12, most hydroxide precipitation systems are only effective in co-precipitating two, or perhaps three, different metals. As a result, most metal wastewater treatment systems which deal with multiple metal species include some means to segregate the waste stream flow trains, to more effectively address specific metals. Hydroxide precipitation of silver is effective, although it is not widely utilized, due to unfavorable economics and lower recovery efficiencies than competitive technologies.</P>

<P> Silver is frequently precipitated from metal wastewater as silver chloride, which is extremely insoluble. Thus, silver can be selectively removed from a mixed metal wastestream without prior segregation or co-precipitation interference. Should alkaline conditions exist in the silver treatment wastestream, resulting in co-precipitation of additional metal species, the precipitated metal sludges can be acid washed to leave the insoluble silver chloride compound. Alternative silver precipitation processes, such as the patented process developed by Eastman Kodak, are available. These processes rely on the use of magnesium sulfate and lime. The silver then precipitates as a mixed sulfate-oxide and is recovered from the settled sludge.</P>

<P> Sulfide is also widely used and is one of the oldest technologies for silver recovery in the photographic film processing industry. Hydrosulfite precipitation results in formation of both free silver and sulfide, with a more compact precipitate with favorable settling qualities. Disadvantages of this method include relatively high chemical costs and the need for supplemental heat input.</P>

<P> Precipitation is not commonly used to recover silver from film processing operations, nor is it commonly used to process liquid wastes to meet discharge limits.</P>

<P><li> Ion Exchange: Ion exchange is commonly used for silver recovery from liquid wastestreams. One patented process exists which involves silver recovery from dilute photographic processing wash water by passage through a mixture of basic ion exchange resins. Silver retained on the resin is recovered through either elution of silver salts from the resin bed or by direct resin incineration and pure silver recovery.  An ion exchange system for silver cyanide rinsewaters has also been developed, which consists of a five-column unit. In the first column, a cation exchange resin converts the silver cyanide to a silver hydrogen cyanide complex. The second column contains an anion exchange resin, which removes the silver cyanide. The elutant from the second column is then treated with sodium or potassium cyanide to recover the silver as either sodium or potassium silver cyanide. The additional three columns are used to achieve additional cyanide removal.</P>

<P> Another application of ion exchange technology for silver recovery utilizes a Type I, strong base gel anion resin to selectively remove silver from waste rinses. The dissolved silver is present as a negatively charged thiosulfate anionic complex which exchanges with sulfate ions on the anion resin. The resin bed is then rinsed with 2 percent sulfuric acid to precipitate the silver collected on the resin. The effluent from this rinse is then collected, neutralized, and discharged. This system is capable of reducing silver concentrations in the treated effluent to between 0.1 and 2.0 mg/L. After a sufficient number of cycles through the resin bed, the ion exchange capacity of the resin bed to remove silver will be exhausted. At this time, the resin is sent to a silver refiner for incineration and silver recovery.</P>

<P> Automated ion exchange columns units generally cost several thousand dollars and are practical only for large processing facilities. An ion exchange column is not suitable for high concentrations of silver, but may work well for recovering silver from fixer bath overflows that are diluted with rinse waters.</P>

<P><li> Metallic Replacement: This method utilizes iron metal (typically steel wool) to react with silver thiosulfate solution in photo processing fixer solutions and rinse waters. The iron replaces the silver in solution, while the silver settles out as a solid, for subsequent removal. The silver-laden waste solution is passed through a container filled with steel wool as a means of contacting the silver with the iron. The typical system consists of two chemical cartridges installed in series. The silver concentration in the treated effluent is generally below 5 mg/L. There are three disadvantages of this system: silver is recovered as a sludge, which is more difficult and expensive to process than alternative technologies; chemical recovery cartridges can not be reused and, thus, must be replaced when exhausted; and the cartridge effluent wastestream contains high iron concentrations. The advantage to this technology is that it is low cost, readily available, and requires no energy or special plumbing connections.</P>

<P><li> Electrolytic Silver Recovery: In this method, silver-laden solutions are passed through a system containing an anode-cathode array, which applies a controlled current. As the solution flows through the system, silver in virtually pure form is plated on the cathode. Once a sufficient quantity of silver has been accumulated on the cathode, the silver is recovered. Two disadvantages of the electrolytic recovery method are the relatively high capital costs and the lower treatment efficiency (typical silver effluent concentrations are in the range of 100 to 200 ppm). In common practice, electrolytic and metallic replacement systems are used in series, whereby the electrolytic unit will remove up to 90 percent of the silver in the influent, with the metallic replacement system removing most of the remaining silver in solution. However, even when these two technologies are used in combination, they still are not capable of achieving silver effluent concentrations to well below 5 ppm. Ion exchange or other alternative technologies must be implemented if extremely low effluent silver concentrations are consistently required.</P>

<P> Electrolytic recovery systems can also be used &quot;in-line&quot; for silver recovery in fixer solutions. Since much of the silver is recovered during the in-line process, often the only final treatment required is a metallic replacement cartridge system. Another benefit of in-line silver recovery is that less silver is carried into the wash water, since the concentration in the fixer bath is maintained at a lower concentration.</P>

<P><li> Reverse Osmosis: This method uses high pressure to force a liquid solution through a semipermeable membrane, which will separate larger molecule substances, such as salts and organic compounds, from smaller molecular substances, such as water. Reverse osmosis (RO) is capable of removing up to 90 percent of silver thiosulfate complexes (the most common silver compound present in most photo processing solutions) from wash water. Along with silver, RO is effective in removing almost all other chemicals in solution. On this basis, RO is used to recover such photo processing chemicals as color couplers and ferrocyanide. An additional benefit of RO treatment is that, due to its high removal efficiencies, treated wash water may be suitable for reuse in final rinses. Once silver has been removed from the wash water, it can be recovered using such means as chemical precipitation, metallic replacement, or electrolytic recovery. The primary disadvantage of RO compared to alternative silver recovery technologies is the high capital investment required. As a result, its principal application is for treating wash water solutions to reduce silver concentrations to acceptable levels for discharge.</P>

<p>N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p>These materials must be handled with caution. Skin absorption is the main health concern. Chemicals like lead are experimental tetatogens and carcinogens. Proper personal protective equipment is highly recommended.</P>

<P>Consult your local health and safety personnel prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<P>Recycling and/or recovery of photographic and X-ray processing and printing solutions can:</P>
<ul>
<P><li>  Reduce the volume of hazardous waste generated from these processes</P>

<P><li>  Reduce the cost of chemical usage </P>

<P><li>  Reduce or eliminate hazardous waste handling/treatment/disposal costs</P>
</ul>
<P>Result in a net positive economic return (especially for silver recovery)</P>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> These processes can be costly if not selected in conjunction with a specific treatment plan or goal</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis: </H3>

<p>Economics depends on site-specific information including system characteristics, waste volumes, and treatment objectives. In general, the higher volume and the higher concentration of the process solution being handled, the more cost effective implementation of a reuse/recovery system becomes. For low volume operations, installation of a metallic replacement system is typically a cost effective alternative. Installation of an electrolytic recovery unit becomes economical for higher processing volumes, since the capital installation cost will be more than offset by the savings incurred from fewer changeouts of metallic replacement cartridges.  In-line electrolytic recovery units will reduce silver refining costs since the collected silver is in a form that is more readily recoverable. In cases where low effluent silver concentrations are required, installation of an ion exchange system may be necessary. However, the capital investment and chemical handling costs associated with this method are higher than for alternative technologies.</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Many building materials and the majority of asphalt and concrete in construction and demolition (C&amp;D) waste streams can be recycled.  Recycling building materials from demolition and renovation projects, such as rebar, asphalt, and concrete, and selling salvaged lumber, building materials, and fixtures is more economical than disposal and can result in a lower bid price for the project. </P>

<P> Construction and demolition (C&amp;D) waste consists of concrete, asphalt, wood, fixtures, rebar, metals, drywall, roofing, and other materials.  C&amp;D waste generation and disposal is usually handled by contractors at many military installations, but alternate diversion methods can be specified in the contract.  </P>

<P> Local recyclers of asphalt and concrete may include construction material companies, sand and gravel producers, and asphalt plants.  Alternatively, the material can be recycled on base.  Asphalt and concrete rubble can be recycled on base without further processing for use as general rubble fill in low lying areas or quarries.  However, a more beneficial use of the material is to crush the asphalt and concrete using a portable crusher.  The crushed product can be used as a substitute for crushed stone products in road construction (pavement and road base) and as a fill material (footing and foundation backfill and general fill).  The use of crushed concrete for landfill roadways or landfill covers should also be investigated as a potential market.  Large slabs of concrete can be used as rip rap to prevent shoreline and stream erosion, or used in various projects such as artificial reef development.</P>

<P> The two types of on-site recycling of asphalt pavement include surface recycling and road base recycling.  Surface recycling involves breaking up the top layer of a pavement structure to a depth of about one inch by milling or crushing the material, and then re-compacting the loose material.  A new surface is placed on top of the recycled asphalt, and the pavement is compacted again.  Road base recycling involves recycling both the asphalt surface and base material to produce a new road base.  There is a machine on the market that uses a cutter drum to raise asphalt and base material.  The base aggregate and asphalt top coat are blended and crushed by the machine to produce a well-graded base course, and then deposited back on the roadway.  A new surface is then placed on top of the recycled road base.  Alternatively, recycled asphalt can be transported to an asphalt batch plant and processed. </P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Care should be taken when handling asphalt, as it may contain carcinogenic components.  Proper personal protection equipment is recommended.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Recycling asphalt and concrete on base provides a source of crushed stone product for base applications and reduces the cost of new material</P>

<P><li> Saves landfill space</P>

<P><li> Conserves resources</P>

<P><li> Plumbing and lighting fixtures can be sold to fixture reclamation vendors  </P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Machinery may require air permits or permits-to-operate, depending on local and state regulations where this technology is to be implemented.  Permits-to-operate establish compliance requirements, administrative and procedural standards to operate maintain, renew and or revise permits</P>

<P><li> Regulatory compliance may be required with regard to source emission standards and fugitive emissions, etc., generated by the process</P>

<P><li> Certain regulatory requirements and restrictions may apply if the materials are found to contain hazardous materials</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Waste pulpers are used to process a variety of solid wastes, primarily food service wastes.  Food service wastes typically include food scraps, cardboard, paper, styrofoam, aluminum foil, plastic utensils, and juice and milk cartons.  Waste pulpers grind up organic matter with water and then extract most of the moisture to produce a dry, organic pulp.  Waste pulpers can reduce the volume of wastes by up to 70 to 85% (depending upon the type of pulper used) and provide for reduced transportation and disposal costs.  The dry pulp that is produced is often in a form that can be used for animal feed or composting.  Dry pulp can be easily mixed with traditional feed materials such as urea and corn.  Reuse of the pulp product will result in an added reduction of disposal costs.  Note: the use of dry pulp requires that the food wastes be segregated from packaging materials and utensils prior to processing.</P>

<P> Waste pulpers are currently employed at numerous facilities across the nation, including educational facilities, restaurants, hotels, health care facilities, corporate dining operations, casinos, cruise ship lines, correctional facilities, manufacturing plants, in-flight kitchens, and municipal/industrial wastewater treatment plants.  Although waste pulpers have primarily been used for food service wastes, they are also adaptable to other types of solid wastes such as biological sludges, pulp and paper mill sludges, textile mill sludges, and cattle and dairy waste solids.</P>

<P> Waste pulpers are often used on ships to process food, paper and cardboard wastes prior to disposal.  Shipboard waste pulpers are typically designed to process large quantities of food and paper wastes.  Shipboard waste pulpers use seawater to produce the slurry mixture.  Shipboard waste pulpers are effective at reducing the volume of wastes and can improve on-board health, safety, and sanitation.  </P>

<P> Military bases produce large quantities of food waste at eating facilities.  Such food wastes can be significantly reduced using waste pulping systems.  Waste pulpers are available in capacities ranging from 250 lb/hr to 4,000 lb/hr.  Waste pulpers reduce the volume of wastes that would otherwise be incinerated or landfilled and, thus, reduce costs associated with disposal.  Waste pulpers can also be used to recycle organic wastes into composting material.  This provides for reduced transportation costs and composting time.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Food waste collection facilities have the potential for rodent/pest infestation, foul odor, and unsightly conditions.   Although waste pulping systems reduce the potential for rodent and insect problems (since the wastes are washed with water and then compacted), the owner or operator should properly maintain the equipment and perform all work in a sanitary environment.  Consult your local industrial health specialist and your local health and safety personnel prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Up to 85% reduction of waste volume</P>

<P><li> Fewer trash pickups</P>

<P><li> Reduced man hours needed to haul wastes to pick-up area</P>

<P><li> Eliminates the need to sort paper from food waste</P>

<P><li> Reduction of rodent and insect problems</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Initial capital cost for waste pulper equipment</P>

<P><li> Increased energy costs</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> The following cost analysis is based on Hobart&#146;s WS-800 pulping unit.  This system consists of a pulper, water extractor, valves and an electrical control panel.  The capacity of this system is 700 lbs/hr.  The pulping system is compared to a 4 hp food waste disposer.  The food waste disposer requires the manual separation of approximately 15% of solid waste from the food waste.  For the economic analysis presented below, the manual separation required by the disposer system requires an additional 2 hours of labor per day.  The pulping system is capable of processing that portion of solid waste without the need for additional labor.</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Waste pulper operates 8 hrs/day, 5 days/wk, 52 wks/yr</P>

<P><li> Waste material processed:  700 lb/hr or 1,456,000 lb/yr</P>

<P><li> Pulper water usage:  2 gpm</P>

<P><li> Disposer water usage:  8 gpm</P>

<P><li> Waste disposal costs (sewer): $8.24/1,000 gal</P>

<P><li> Water usage costs:  $1.94/1000 gal</P>

<P><li> Pulper electricity costs:  $120/mo</P>

<P><li> Disposer electricity costs:  $80/mo</P>

<P><li> Pulper reduces waste volume 80%, therefore, 291,200 lbs/yr solid waste produced</P>

<P><li> Disposer requires 15% of waste to be disposed as solid waste, or 218,400 lbs/yr  </P>

<P><li> Solid waste disposal cost:  $0.015/lb</P>

<P><li> Disposer labor:  8 hrs/day</P>

<P><li> Pulper labor:  6 hrs/day</P>

<P><li> Labor rate:  $30/hr </P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Compartmentalized trailers are used to separate plastics, glass, paper, cans, and compostables at the source, from residential and commercial trash.  This eliminates or reduces the need to sort the materials at the recycling center and results in lower processing costs.  The trailers may be placed at exterior locations around the residential areas or office buildings, allowing the residents or personnel to place each type of material in its own bin.  The trailers are usually located in centralized, easily accessible locations.</P>

<P> Trailers are made in a wide range of sizes and types, suitable for a large variety of applications.  Trailers may be up to 20 yards long, with between two and ten compartments for segregated wastes disposal.  Some may be stationary, however they are intended to be mobile with the use of a truck.  The recyclables can be emptied from the compartments, or the whole trailer when full and then can be towed to the recycling center.  The compartments should be locked to prevent scavenging.</P>

<P> Source separation of recyclables by the waste generators requires consistent education and program support to prevent them from becoming contaminated with other materials.  All recycling compartments should be clearly labeled with the types of material that are acceptable, as well as who to call (name and phone number) for additional information.  A trash container should be placed next to all recycling stations to reduce contamination.  Regular publicizing of the availability and location of the containers will bring in new users and keep the existing users current.  </P>

<P> The use of recycling trailers is a simple and effective pollution prevention opportunity.  Normal office and household wastes are recycled without producing any new waste streams.  It also helps to foster pollution prevention awareness among the office or residential areas where they are used. </P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> The establishment of a good housekeeping program to prevent odors, visual nuisance, and pests (e.g. rodents, insects) propagation is required when implementing this technology.  </P>

<P> Consult the base safety office and your local industrial health specialist to determine the proper personal protection equipment (PPE) and the necessary training prior to using this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Reduction of landfilled waste through recycling and composting</P>

<P><li> Lower processing costs for materials</P>

<P><li> Separating recyclables and/or compostables at the generation source eliminates the need for a  materials recovery facility</P>

<P><li> Trailers are mobile and can be towed away when full or moved to another location</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Mixing of material types often occurs and the materials may require further sorting</P>

<P><li> Some participants who do not understand which materials belong in which category or find the materials too difficult to separate may not recycle</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> Recycling trailers come in a variety of styles and sizes from simple bin style, to removable multiple bins, to hydraulic compaction trailers.  The costs for trailers range from approximately $5,000 to $25,000.  The cost elements for the collection and storage of recyclables using trailers are compared to the collection and storage of recyclables without using trailers.  This results in an increase in labor efficiency over the manual handling of bags and bundles of recyclables.</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Adding recycling trailers to existing recycling operation</P>

<P><li> Purchasing 5 trailers at $10,000 each</P>

<P><li> Existing collection and storage requires 5 days of labor per week</P>

<P><li> Recycling trailers reduce the collection and storage labor requirements to 3 days per week</P>

<P><li> Labor rate: $30/hour</P>

<P><li> Minimal change in recycling quantities</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> When used in place of conventional motor oil, synthetic oil lasts longer, requiring fewer changeouts. As a result, waste oil generation and consumption of virgin oil is reduced.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> There are minimal safety and health concerns with synthetic oils. Care must be taken when handling hot oil. Proper personal protective equipment is recommended. Consult your local health and safety personnel for specific precautions.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li>  Synthetic oil lasts two to five times longer than conventional oil</P>

<P><li>  Waste oil generation can be reduced two to five times if synthetic oil is         used</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Aerosol can puncturing, crushing, and recycling is a way to eliminate disposing of aerosol cans as solid or hazardous waste.  Aerosol can puncture devices are available that breach and empty the cans to make them classifiable as &#147;empty,&#148; for EPA requirements.  The processed cans are then no longer considered to be a hazardous waste and can be sold as scrap metal.</P>

<P> Aerosol can puncturing devices safely puncture the cans, capturing their contents for easy recycling or disposal.  Spray nozzles are removed as well.  A simple, low-capacity can operator puncturing unit does not require power and is manually operated.  The operator presses on a handle which causes a puncture pin to pierce the aerosol can, which is secured inside a cylinder.  The can&#146;s contents are then collected in a drum.</P>

<P> More sophisticated units have a pre-loader that moves aerosol cans into a 12-inch sealed cylinder.  This cylinder is then ruptured and can be crushed into a 1/2 inch thick wafer by a piston.  The propellant and concentrate then pass through a check valve in the piston and are collected in a pressure tank.  A scavenger system accepts the small amount of propellant remaining to reduce pressure to atmospheric before the cylinder is opened.  The cans are then discharged onto a well ventilated, drying conveyor where they remain for 10 to 15 minutes, before being collected in a container.</P>

<P> Sophisticated aerosol can puncturing devices can process over 99% of the cans for either safe disposal or recycling.  Capacities range from 120 to 2,000 cans per hour.  Available features of the more sophisticated units include explosion-proofing, and electric, hot oil, and steam heaters to vaporize residual propellant.</P>

<P> Empty steel paint and aerosol cans are accepted by the steel industry for recycling.  Aerosol cans must be completely empty, with the plastic lid removed (spray nozzles do not need to be removed for recycling).  Residues remaining in aerosol cans are subject to federal regulations (40 CFR Sec. 261.7) and state regulations.  Can-puncturing processes may need to be licensed by state or federal EPA.  Because puncturing cans may involve local air quality regulations, consultation with city and county air quality agencies is advised.  In most states, volatile organic compound (VOC) venting is regulated.  Typically, the propellants used are VOCs, and hence the puncturing operation could result in release of these compounds to the environment.  One example of a frequently used propellant is butane.  To address this problem, some devices provide an activated carbon adsorption canister to capture any VOCs (not CFCs) released from the punctured can.  However, the carbon has to be replaced and disposed of periodically.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> The residual contents of all aerosol cans being crushed must be compatible.  Mixing aerosol can contents that are incompatible is not allowed.  It is important to check material compatibly when disposing of many cans at once, especially when disposing of a group of cans that contain different products.  The containers (55 gallon steel drum or other container) in which the residues are discharged should be designated and labeled for specific materials (e.g., paints, lubricants, etc.).  Check with product manufacturers for compatibility within the same class of material, e.g., are two different types of paints compatible with each other in a disposal drum?  The practice of designating drums for specific classes of materials also simplifies waste management and disposal.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Proper design, operation, and maintenance of the equipment is required for its safe use.  There are minimal health concerns regarding this process, but care must be taken when pre-loading these cans for manual processing.  Precautions must be taken and proper personal protective equipment is recommended.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, base safety office, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>

<H3>Overview: </H3>

<p>The Navy Hazardous Material Control &amp; Management (HMC&amp;M) Program was established in 1989 in response to the increased attention being focused on environmental issues, both in the United States and internationally. This program focuses on the reduction of hazardous material (HM) usage and the subsequent generation of hazardous waste (HW) associated with HM usage. As implementation of the HMC&amp;M program got underway, an early initiative was development of a strategy to achieve significant reductions in the use of HM and the generation of HW. Historically, the Navy managed HM in much the same manner as most non-hazardous consumable material. There was no centralized mechanism of procuring HM or maintaining HM inventory control and management. This lead to the proliferation of redundant capacities of HM, as well as unnecessary generation of HW resulting from excess quantities being handled.</P>

<P> As a means to eliminate many of the problems associated with traditional HM management practices, the Commanding Officer (CO) of Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS), Point Mugu, California, decided to implement a program to consolidate the inventory management of HM through a single organization known as the Hazardous Material Minimization Center (HAZMINCEN). This center served the entire base and was the central element in the development of the plan for life cycle micro-management of HM at the base, which was termed the Consolidated Hazardous Material Reutilization and Inventory Management Program (CHRIMP).</P>

<P> Major Features of CHRIMP (as executed at Point  Mugu):</P>
<ol>
<P><li> Establishment of a HAZMINCEN to consolidate the inventory management of hazardous material  into a single organization to serve the entire base.</P>

<P><li> Started by consolidating material from the Aircraft Maintenance Department (AMD). Set up system of credits and billings to control inventory and purchase of all HM by the department. Also established delivery system to respond to work order requests for material and to pick up any unused portions of HM.</P>

<P><li> Customer service was a key element of the HAZMINCEN. System was set up to eliminate as much paperwork as possible. Only a phone call was necessary to draw material. Efficient inventory management techniques were also essential to ensure material is on hand when needed, which was vital in the efforts to eliminate proliferation of locally purchased HM to meet an immediate requirement.</P>

<P><li> Established a recycling center on the base to collect all types of recyclable material including aluminum and tin cans, plastics, paper (many kinds), glass, cardboard, copper wire, and scrap metal (ferrous and non-ferrous).</P>

<P><li> Hazardous Inventory Control System (HICS) provided on-line visibility of inventory levels and provided the capability to process material requisitions, receipts, and issues. The system uses bar code technology to allow the user to create container bar-codes for each issue that uniquely identifies each container (see detailed description at end of section).</P>

<P><li> HAZMINCEN Startup Procedures:</P>

<P>a. All HM on site turned in to central storage area.</P>

<P>b. All material with shelf life greater than 6 months was bar-coded  and entered into inventory.</P>

<P>c.  All material with shelf life less than 6 months was donated to the  community.</P>

<P>d. Small percentage of material which couldn't be used was sent to an  approved waste transfer facility.</P>

<P>e. Reusable materials were consolidated and stored in approved  containers.</P>

<P>f. All stocked HM is regularly checked to verify that supplies are  sufficient.</P>

<P>g. Reorders are made regularly to replenish depleted supplies.</P>

<P><li> Typical HM processing steps:</P>

<P>a. Call for HM request is received at the Central Order Desk.</P>

<P>b. The HM order is immediately entered into the computer.</P>

<P>c. Order Clerk notifies stock manager of order.</P>

<P>d. Stock manager locates HM, retrieves amount for order, and       delivery.</P>

<P>e. Guaranteed delivery time is within 45 minutes of order. Average      delivery time is 30 minutes.</P>

<P>f. Performed daily roundup loop to pick up accumulated HM at      customer locations, thus relieving them of responsibility and costs      associated with tracking and storing HM.</P>
</ol>

<P> <B>Description of HICS Program</B></P>

<P> The Hazardous Inventory Control System (HICS) is a computer-based program which formed the key element of the hazardous material management program at Point Mugu NAWS. HICS was developed to replace the manual INDEX system formerly used to manage HM. It includes the capability to process material requisitions, receipts, and HM issues. The HICS program uses bar code technology to allow the user to create container bar-codes for each issue that uniquely identifies each container. This feature is significant in that it establishes accountability for the HM that is issued and prevents unauthorized disposal of empty or partially filled containers. Another important element of the HICS program is that HM data collection is automatically performed, which allows for informed management decisions regarding HM purchasing and stockpiling policies. This type of information, combined with the ease in which it can be processed, was not available with the former HM management programs.</P>

<P> The Navy issued a CHRIMP manual in 1994 that includes HICS software and User's Guide. This package outlines the methodology for implementing a HICS-based centralized inventory management program. The HICS program has also been recently enhanced to provide networking capability. This will enable the regional FISC to query other HICS inventories to determine availability of reuse material. In addition, each regional FISC will be able to access inventory data from each HAZMINCEN within their region, as well as all other HAZMINCENs throughout the Navy. This capability will be instrumental in optimizing the HM inventories and usage, and will allow the fullest utilization of all HM that is procured. Furthermore, the HICS program can be incorporated into a more complex HM data collection system undergoing prototyping throughout the Navy to enhance compliance with the Pollution Prevention Act (PPA) and the Emergency Preparedness and Community Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA) requirements.</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Reverse osmosis (RO) technology uses membrane separation systems to typically remove inorganic salts from wastewater. However, reverse osmosis can also be used to treat wastewater containing some organic solvents.  The RO system uses a semipermeable membrane to separate pure water from contaminated liquids. Osmotic theory implies that when a contaminated solution is separated from pure water by a semipermeable membrane, the higher osmotic pressure of the contaminated solution will cause the water to diffuse into the contaminated solution. Water will continue to permeate into the contaminated solution until the osmotic pressure of the contaminated solution equals that of the pure water. RO occurs when an external pressure is exerted on the contaminated solution, water will flow in the reverse direction from the contaminated solution into pure water.  RO systems can be used to separate pure water from contaminated matrices, such as the treatment of some hazardous wastes through concentration of hazardous chemical constituents, where pure water can be recovered on the other side of the membrane.</P>

<P> Ultrafiltration (UF) is a pressure-driven, membrane filtration process that is used to separate and concentrate macromolecules and colloids from wastewater.  A fluid is placed under pressure on one side of a perforated membrane having measured pore size.  All materials smaller than the pore pass through the membrane, leaving large contaminants concentrated on the feed side of the process.  UF is used as a pretreatment step to RO or as a stand-alone process. Control of pass-through constituents can be achieved using a membrane with a limiting pore size, or by installing a series of membranes with successively smaller pores.  The UF process cannot separate constituents from water to the same level of purity that RO can achieve. However, the two technologies can be used in tandem, with UF removing most of the relatively large constituents of a process stream before RO application selectively removes water from the remaining mixture.</P>

<P> Membrane technology can be used to treat a variety of wastes, including sanitary landfill leachate containing both organic and inorganic chemical species, water-soluble oil wastes used in metal fabricating and manufacturing industries, solvent-water mixtures, and oil-water mixtures generated during washing operations at metal fabricating facilities.</P>

<P> Waste feed, process permeate, and rinse water are potential feed materials to the skid-mounted RO-UF modules that consist of a tank and a high-pressure feed system that itself consists of a centrifugal feed pump, a prefilter cartridge housing, and a triplex plunger pump. The processing units themselves are self-contained and need only electrical and interconnection process piping to be installed prior to operation.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health: </H3>

<p> There are health concerns when dealing with hydrocarbons.  Inhalation of vapors can be toxic and dangerous to human health. There can be oral, dermal, and ocular effects. Personal protective equipment is recommended.</P>

<P> Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<p>This technology can be applied to a variety of wastewaters and the units are compact for use at sea.</P>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> High capital cost</P>

<P><li> The UF process cannot separate constituents from water to the same level of purity that RO can achieve</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> The costs of a 40,000 gallons per day (gpd) membrane treatment unit are as follows:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Capital cost is approximately $350,000</P>

<P><li> Electrical cost per 1 gallon of wastewater treated is $0.000024</P>

<P><li> Maintenance cost per 1 gallon of wastewater treated is $0.0003.</P>
</ul>

<P> Treatment of gray water:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> capital cost of 1,000 to 20,000 gpd RO-UF treatment unit for treating gray water is approximately $500,000</P>

<P><li> Electrical and maintenance costs would be similar to the single membrane treatment unit.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Approval Authority:</H3>

<p> Navy:  Approval is controlled locally and should be implemented only after engineering approval has been granted.  Major claimant approval is not required.</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Drum crushing machines can compact drums, pails, and paint cans into dense disks prior to recycling, reducing storage space and transportation requirements.  Volume reduction for the drum crushers ranges from 6:1 to 14:1.  A 14:1 volume reduction equates to crushing a standard 55-gallon drum to less than 2 1/2 inches thick.  The mid-size crusher will reduce most pails and paint cans by 90%.  The crushed containers can be recycled as scrap metal.  These machines are used at installations that generate significant quantities of metal drums.</P>

<P> Drum crushing machines typically include a three to ten horsepower motor, and one or two (30 to 40 inch) stroke cylinders.  The single drum crusher requires one stroke cylinder, while the double drum crusher requires two.  Drum crushers have a compacting force ranging from 35,000 lbs to 105,000 lbs, with a cycle time of 30 to 60 seconds.  Space requirements for drum crushers range from approximately ten square feet for the single crushers to 20 square feet for the double unit.</P>

<P> Mid-range crushers have also been developed to handle pails and paint cans.  These units are pneumatically operated; therefore, a source of clean, dry air must be provided.  An Occupational Safety and Health Administration lock-out-tag-out safety valve, and an air regulator with lubricator and filter are included as standard equipment.</P>

<P> This technology facilitates the recycling of metal containers while producing no new wastestreams.  It also reduces the liability of having drums found in landfills or hazardous waste sites.  A well-managed recycling program incorporating metal drum crushers will remove the majority of metal containers from the waste stream.</P>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Safety issues for using drum crushers concerns the operation of power equipment.  Operators should be specifically  trained to use the crusher and exercise caution to keep limbs, clothing and hair from being caught up in the equipment.  Machinery should not be used if workers are on medication.  Proper personal protectivon equipment (PPE) such as gloves, eye protection, and hearing protection should be used.</P>

<P> Consult the base safety office on proper protective gear and training prior to using mechanized equipment.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<P><li> Decreases storage and transport requirements</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3> 

<p>None</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> Capital costs for drum crushers range from approximately $7,000 to $43,000.  An average single drum crusher costs approximately $15,000, and an average double drum crusher costs approximately $35,000.  Operating costs would include labor, power to operate a three to ten HP motor, and maintenance (oil changes, repairs, etc.).</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Oil/water separators are self-contained, automatic treatment systems used for treatment of oily wastewaters.  The units can incorporate a coalescing pack to promote oil globule agglomeration to enhance the conventional gravity separation process.  The units are durable and simple to operate, requiring a minimum level of operator sophistication.  The unit requires no filter or filter media, eliminating the costs of purchasing filters and their operation.  Downtime is minimized by eliminating the need to clean or replace clogged filters.  These units are not designed to remove emulsified oils, dissolved inorganic chemicals such as heavy metals, or dissolved organic chemicals such as solvents and some fuels.</P>

<P> Oil/water mixtures are separated in the unit by conventional gravity separation and by enhanced coalescence in the coalescing pack.  These two steps may take place in separate compartments or in a single chamber and the selection of the appropriate type of system depends on the amount of wastewater to be treated, its physical and chemical characteristics, and the treatment objectives.  Some units incorporate a hopper-type bottom for accumulation and ultimate discharge of settled material.</P>

<P> Free oil is removed from the water by gravity separation; a process that takes advantage of the density difference between the oil and water.  In general, the greater the difference in densities, the more effective will be the oil removal.  The effectiveness of the process also depends on the rate that oil droplets rise through the water column and this rate is dependent on the size of the oil droplets.  Small oil droplets may not rise fast enough to be captured for removal unless the unit is very large (unsuitable for pierside operation) or a coalescing pack is used.</P>

<P> The coalescing pack may consist of a series of parallel plate or a volume of packing.  The purpose of this material is to provide surface area to contact and intercept small oil droplets.  Oil droplets become removed by adhering to the packing.  On the packing, the small oil droplets will agglomerate, forming larger oil droplets.  As these oil droplets grow in size, their buoyancy and rise rate increases and they will rise to the surface of the unit where they will be removed.</P>

<P> The treated effluent from these units should not contain free oil. Free oil is retained in the units by a baffle located upstream of a fixed level control device, usually a weir.  Free oil is removed from the unit by skimming the surface and a variety of mechanisms are available for this purpose.  Selection of a skimming device depends on the amount and necessary quality (e.g., for recycling) of the oil to be removed.  Manual and automatic skimming devices are available. Sludge blowdown from the bottom hoppers can also be automated.  Recovered oil and sludge is generally transferred to holding tanks for storage prior to disposal.  Additional processing of these waste materials prior to disposal may be warranted for larger systems.  </P>

<P> Oil/water separators can be located pierside to treat oily wastewater off-loaded from ships.  Depending on the type of wastewater treated in the unit and the local water quality standards, the unit may or may not provide sufficient treatment for discharge to a sanitary sewer without further pretreatment.  </P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Oil/water separators can be constructed from a variety of structural materials and can be protected with a wide variety of coating systems.  Wastewater characteristics and the operating environment must be considered when specifying equipment.  Some coalescing pack models may not be available in compatible materials but other models are available with a complete range of materials and protective systems.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> The principal safety concerns associated with the units are industrial accidents associated with operation and maintenance of mechanical (pumps) and electrical equipment.  Protection against slip accidents, that are associated with handling oily materials, should also be considered.  Some oily wastewaters may be considered hazardous by characteristic and this would require that the pierside oil/water separator include a system for spill containment. Personnel protection training and equipment must be consistent with the activities safety program and for hazardous waste treatment, should be consistent with 29CFR 1910.  Because of the potential for oily wastewater to be contaminated with fuels, tanks should be well ventilated to prevent buildup of vapors that could become explosive.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Minimizes the need for disposal of some oily wastewaters as hazardous wastes</P>

<P><li> May be discharged directly into industrial wastewater sewers or sanitary sewers in some cases</P>

<P><li> No filters or filter media to purchase, replace, or dispose</P>

<P><li> Can handle most mixtures of free oil and water in a continuous operation</P>

<P><li> Operation and maintenance is not complex; operations can be automated</P>

<P><li> Can be installed by in-house military personnel</P>

<P><li> May meet environmental regulations regarding discharge into sewers</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Cannot effectively treat emulsified oils</P>

<P><li> Can not remove dissolved materials such as fuels (gasoline), solvents, or heavy metals to most discharge limits</P>

<P><li> May require storage tanks for collected oils and sludges</P>

<P><li> Space requirements to place the separating unit on the pier</P>

<P><li> Requires electrical service and plumbing connections</P>

<P><li> Treatment effectiveness depends strongly on wastewater characteristics.  Performance may not be consistent</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> A comparison of the costs for disposal of oily wastewater by (1) offsite disposal as a hazardous waste or (2) treatment in a pierside oil/water separator followed by disposal in an industrial wastewater sewer was conducted.  Using the design and cost assumptions outlined below, the cost comparison was developed to determine the amount of oily wastewater that must be handled by an activity in one year to justify the implementation of this treatment equipment and allocation of manpower and resources to its proper operation and maintenance.</P>

<P> Form this analysis it was determined that an activity must handle at least 104,000 gallons per year of oily wastewater to justify installation of a pierside oil/water separator if a one year payback period is required.  This analysis assumed that the wastewater would receive additional treatment at the activity and if the wastewater characteristics were such that this was not necessary, the payback period would be shorter or a smaller volume could be treated economically.  However, this analysis is most sensitive to the assumptions pertaining the hazardous waste disposal costs, and care should be taken in applying these results to a specific activity that may have substantially different hazardous waste disposal costs.</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Oily wastewater will be unloaded pierside into a storage tank from which it can be fed into the oil/water separator.</P>

<P><li> Treated water from the oil/water separator will be discharged to the activity&#146;s industrial wastewater sewer and will be treated in the activity&#146;s industrial wastewater treatment plant.  The cost of this supplemental treatment will be $0.10/gallon.</P>

<P><li> Oily wastewater disposed offsite without treatment can be done for $0.75/gallon</P>

<P><li> Oil/water separator unit:  $30,000 for 10 gpm unit (includes installation and one time manufacturer training)</P>

<P><li> Electrical power required for operating the oil/water separator is 7.5 kW for operation of necessary pumps and controls</P>

<P><li> Electrical power required for transferring wastewater from ships to pier are equal for both alternatives and therefore not included</P>

<P><li> Electricity rate:  $0.08/kw&#183;hr</P>

<P><li> Labor associated with operating unit:  2 personnel while unit is in operation plus 20 percent for mobilization, demobilization, and hazardous waste handling</P>

<P><li> Sludge production in the oil/water separator is 5 percent of the process flow</P>

<P><li> Sludge will be disposed in drums at $200/55-gallon drum as hazardous waste</P>

<P><li> Oil production in the oil/water separator is 10 percent of the process flow</P>

<P><li> Oil will be recycled offsite at a cost of $0.75/gallon</P>

<P><li> Burdened Labor rate:  $60/hr</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Management of hazardous materials is dependent on several conditions, one of the most important being the material&#146;s expected usable lifetime, or &#147;shelf life.&#148; A material&#146;s shelf life is a function of a number of factors such as intrinsic degradation rate, storage conditions, packaging, exposure to air, etc. The effective management of hazardous materials has become an economic, as well as an environmental, necessity, because once a hazardous material&#146;s shelf life is exceeded, it is no longer usable for its intended purpose. At that point in time, the hazardous material becomes a hazardous waste. Proper disposal is not only difficult and expensive, but may cause some long-term environmental impact. Moreover, new material needs to be procured to replace that lost by expiration of the shelf life.</P>

<P>One of the goals of a hazardous materials management program should be to accurately determine a material&#146;s shelf life so that materials can be managed more effectively. This data sheet provides information on the basic aspects of a shelf life optimization program.</P>

<P> Hazardous materials include many widely-used chemical products, such as adhesives, lubricants, paints, oils, and sealants. Any such product remaining at the time of its shelf life code expiration has to be either tested for suitability for continued use or be disposed as hazardous waste and replaced with new material. In order to reduce hazardous waste generation and save money, the U.S. Navy is evaluating its hazardous materials management system and &#147;shelf life code&#148; assignments to determine which materials can have their shelf life codes lengthened without compromising safety, quality, or usability.</P>

<P>&#147;Shelf life&#148; is not synonymous with &#147;shelf life code.&#148; Shelf life is the actual useful life of a hazardous material, whereas shelf life code is the period assigned to that hazardous material by the procuring service that indicates the time period before quality testing is required to verify that the material has not degraded beyond its usefulness. This means that the period of a material&#146;s shelf life code should be less than or, at most, equal to its actual shelf life. There is also a distinction between &#147;lengthen&#148; and &#147;extend&#148; that is important in understanding the shelf life optimization concept in precise terms. A shelf life code can be &#147;lengthened&#148; after technical review of the material&#146;s specification, composition, storage condition, degradation rate, etc. In contrast, the shelf life code of a specific batch or lot of material can be &#147;extended&#148; only after quality testing has indicated that it has some more useful life left.</P>

<P>Most chemical products acquired by the Navy either have very conservative shelf life codes or were assigned a shelf life code without an adequate underlying technical basis. The goal of shelf life code optimization is to use a scientific basis to assign a shelf life code so that a product&#146;s useful life can be lengthened (shelf life code approaches the material&#146;s actual shelf life) and, thus, material usage can be optimized without compromising use or requiring excessive and costly quality testing.</P>

<P>A product&#146;s shelf life code can not simply be derived from any scientific formula; rather, it should be based on a technical evaluation of the degradation mode of each of the product&#146;s constituents, as well as its packaging and storage conditions. Furthermore, sound engineering judgment based on these data and other information, such as scientific literature, manufacturer&#146;s data, DOD material testing, and military specifications, along with product use and experience, should be combined to determine the product&#146;s optimum shelf life.</P>

<P>Not all products require prompt re-evaluation of their shelf life codes. Products should be prioritized for re-evaluation. The initial focus should be on products that contain hazardous materials, have short shelf lives, and have high disposal or replacement costs.</P>

<P>Individuals can be assigned to review specific products, but each individual&#146;s recommendations should undergo a peer review process in which a team scrutinizes the data and recommendations, and then has the final authority to determine a product&#146;s shelf life code.</P>

<P>Implementation of measures that will improve management of hazardous materials with respect to shelf life code lengthening are:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Procurement of chemicals in smaller lots so that all the material can be used by the shelf life code expiration</P>

<P><li> Reduce inventory of material</P>

<P><li> Just-in-time procurement of material</P>

<P><li> Improve storage conditions of chemicals</P>
</ul>

<H3>Materials Compatibility: </H3>

<p>Materials compatibility considerations are a key part of the analysis of each individual chemical product. This should include not only storage container compatibility, but also storage conditions such as temperature, humidity, atmosphere, light exposure, and mutual compatibility of chemical constituents of products.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health: </H3>

<p>Safety and health are important considerations when evaluating shelf life extension of a given material. While these considerations are primarily material specific, they should also be viewed in the broader areas of storage, distribution, and use of multiple products in a common area.</P>

<P>Materials that are used in critical applications within the DOD, especially those operations where use of aged material could jeopardize the safety or health of DOD personnel, are assigned more conservative shelf life codes.</P>

<P> Consult your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS for specific precautions..</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
 A shelf life code review and management program will :</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Reduce the total amount of chemicals purchased</P>

<P><li> Reduce generation of hazardous waste</P>

<P><li> Require less procuring, handling, shipping, and storage of chemicals and wastes because of decreased need for new materials and reduced generation of waste materials</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages: </H3>

<p>N/A</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> The savings incurred through shelf-life management of hazardous materials depend on how the program is organized at each activity. Reduced material purchases and waste disposed must be determined on an individual basis to assess the economic benefit of a shelf-life program.</P>

<H3>Approval Authority: </H3>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Backyard and small facility composting is a simple and inexpensive way to recycle yard and garden trimmings, some food waste, wood ash, manure, and paper waste on-site to eliminate the whole process of pickup and central processing.  This technology is appropriate for residences and facilities such as universities, hospitals, and military bases that want to compost their own waste on site and turn it into a soil amendment.  </P>

<P> The two primary methods of backyard composting are aerobic composting and anaerobic composting.  Aerobic composting requires once a week turning and watering, while anaerobic methods require only final aeration before being used for gardening.  Organic material is formed into open piles or contained in composting bins that can be built or purchased in a variety of design types and materials.  A more intensive system for institutions might include a paved area for heavy equipment maneuvering and multiple bins to allow for continuous composting.</P>

<P> A balanced compost mixture should contain approximately two parts carbon-rich materials such as leaves, wood waste, sawdust, and straw and three parts nitrogen-rich materials such as grass clippings and food waste.  Food waste will tend to attract scavengers, but burying it a foot below the surface of the pile will eliminate this problem.  Meat, oil, or animal products should not be added to backyard compost since they will produce an unpleasant odor and attract animals.  For quicker and more homogenous compost, materials should be shredded, chopped or chipped.  A home or landscaping quality chipper can be bought or rented for occasional use.  These machines will allow the inclusion of woody branches which are otherwise non-compostable and shred all material into a fine mulch that can be used directly in landscaping, or that will decompose in a few weeks or months into a fine soil amendment.</P>

<P> For backyard aerobic composting, a single pile should not exceed two cubic yards or it will be difficult to turn.  If a front end loader is available for institutional composting, the piles can be larger.  The piles should be watered and turned at least once a week for the first few weeks to produce compost in about one to two months.  A well-aerated and well-mixed compost pile will smell clean and woodsy.  Compost can be used when it is a rich dark brown color, individual particles are not distinguishable, and it is no longer producing heat.</P>

<p>N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> As long as no meat or animal products are included, compost does not pose health risks and can be touched with bare hands.  Sensitive people should consider using a mask when turning compost to prevent inhaling bacteria or particles.</P>

<P> Consult the base safety office on proper personal protection equipment (PPE) and training prior to using mechanized equipment.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Compost reduces the amount of waste to be disposed.  Complete recovery of yard waste will reduce the amount of waste generated by an average of 15.9% while the addition of food waste will divert another 6.7% (EPA, 1994)</P>

<P><li> Backyard or single facility composting incurs no costs for processing</P>

<P><li> No pickup mechanisms or transport required</P>

<P><li> It is easily implemented and requires low technology</P>

<P><li> It produces a nutrient-rich soil amendment for home gardening and landscaping</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Has potential to produce odors or attract pests</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> Capital costs for wholesale/retail or mail order purchase of backyard composting bins can vary from $30 to $300.  Homemade compost bins can be easily built from a variety of materials such as pallets, cinder blocks (for aerobic composting), and garbage cans with tight lids (anaerobic composting).  Building costs will vary.</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> A front-end loader is one of the most important components of a composting operation.  Typically, front-end loaders are used to move quantities of compostable materials.  It may be the only piece of equipment required for a small facility using a low-level technology approach.  Loaders can be used to fill a tub grinder, load material into a compost mixer, mix shredded or ground feedstock, turn and aerate compost, combine decomposing windrows, and move finished compost off site.  Unless the operation is a backyard composting project, a loader is a required piece of equipment for composting.</P>

<P> Front-end loaders may be fitted with attachments, such as claws for moving woody wastes, or simple compost turners for the mixing and aeration of windrows.  In compost operations, a large capacity bucket, usually larger than 4 cubic yards (cy) and possibly up to 10 cy, is required.</P>

<P> Compost reduces the amount of waste to be disposed.  Complete recovery of yard waste will reduce the amount of waste disposed in landfills by an average of 15.9% (EPA, 1994).</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Safety issues associated with using front end loaders concerns the operation of power equipment.  Operators should be specifically trained in the proper operation of the loader.  Machinery should not be used if workers are on medication.  Proper personal protection equipment (PP) including gloves, eye protection, and hearing protection should be used if needed.</P>

<P> Consult the base safety office on proper protective gear and training prior to using mechanized equipment.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Efficient material handling with oversized buckets</P>

<P><li> Functions as a compost turner with attachments</P>

<P><li> Versatility for other uses</P>

<P><li> Can handle all composting equipment needs for small to medium projects</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Slower for turning compost than a windrow turner</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> Front end loaders typically cost in the range from $80,000 to $160,000.  The ecomomic analysis is for an aerated static pile compost operation.  The capital costs include compost pads with air lines, blowers, a tub grinder, compost mixer, trommel screen, front end loaders, and offices.</P>
